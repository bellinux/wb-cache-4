40|$|In-situ neutron {{diffraction}} {{has been used}} to study the stress and strain development in a single crystal Ni-base superalloy (CMSX 4) during stress relaxation testing under displacement control mode. It was found that the macroscopic strain is dependent not only on stress and temperature but also on time, suggesting that the overall strain development during stress relaxation is a typical visco-plastic behaviour. The visco-plastic and lattice relaxation strain rates were obtained as best-fit equations from the experimentally measured data encompassing a range of stresses and temperatures. The relaxation lattice strain rate was found to be highly dependent on stress and temperature. It was an order of magnitude smaller than the visco-plastic strain in displacement control mode. An in-situ cooling experiment was also carried out but under strain control mode to simulate the casting condition where the metal solidifies and cools in a rigid ceramic mould. It was found that the stress relaxation was significant in this case and the lattice relaxation dominated visco-plasticity in the early stage of cooling. These results were compared with the calculations using the currently developed <b>visco-plastic</b> <b>law</b> and some key points are discussed...|$|E

The final publication is available at [URL] audienceThis paper mainly treats the thermal effects during the thermoforming process {{while most of the}} previous analyses consider an isothermal deformation. A non isothermal three dimensional finite element model of the thermoforming process is proposed. It couples the thermal equations in the thickness and mechanical equations on the mean surface of the sheet. The mechanical resolution is done by a finite element method using a membrane approximation. The deformation is driven by a pressure difference through the sheet. The thermal resolution uses a one dimension finite element method in the thickness with convection or conduction at the surface and dissipation of mechanical energy. The polymer cooling is very efficient during the contact with the tools. The coupling is done by the thermal dependent rheology. The respective contributions of friction and thermal effects in the thickness of the part during the process are discussed. The model also considers a possible multilayered material, with specific rheological parameters inside each layer. The rheology of a polystyrene was measured under elongation as a function of temperature, strain and strain-rate and described by a <b>visco-plastic</b> <b>law.</b> The predictions of the model were compared with measurements on an instrumented thermoforming machine and with the local thickness of axisymmetrical parts and with 3 -D parts thermoformed with the same polystyrene...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} {{to obtain}} <b>visco-plastic</b> <b>laws</b> in heterogeneous materials with digital image correlation (DIC) is proposed based on tensile and tensile-relaxation tests conducted {{at room temperature}} and at 625 °C. Tested samples are manufactured from a P 91 weld in which a microstructural heterogeneity translates into graded mechanical properties. To simplify the problem, a classical decomposition of the weld into five different domains is considered. Strain field in each domain is obtained by means of digital image correlation applied to high magnification pictures recorded with an optical long distance microscope. The conducted identifications exhibit key features in the behaviour of each domain in terms of yield stress, ultimate tensile stress and hardening at both room temperature and 625 °C. Experimental fields are compared to the fields provided by finite element simulations. Eventually, the benefit of accounting for transverse strains in the identification procedure is examined, and the robustness of the procedure with addition of noise (representative of experimental conditions) in the measurement is characterized...|$|R

In order to explore those results, a coupling model has been developed to provide a design tool in a mechatronic frame which consists of an analytical model of the forging process based on simplified <b>visco-plastic</b> <b>laws</b> and a state space model of the piezoelectric actuator based on a finite element approach [1]. The coupling model can be used to analyse the important parameters of the whole process in order to optimize the forging process design using mechanical vibrations or to control the process if necessary. A finite element simulation of forging process using mechanical vibration based on finite element software Forge 2008 ® is also presented in this study. The results obtained by experiment, finite element simulation and simulation using the model above are compared in the case of simple upsetting, with good agreement. Moreover, it can be concluded that high frequencies are not required to observe this phenomenon. Finally visco-plasticity phenomenon is not self-sufficient to explain completely the force reduction...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2014 Springer-VerlagCreep {{processes}} in halite (salt rock) include glide, cross-slip, diffusion and dynamic recrystallization. Diffusive Mass Transfer (DMT) {{can result in}} crack rebonding, and mechanical stiffness recovery. Crack rebonding driven by DMT occurs {{within a few days}} at room temperature and low pressure. DMT is enhanced at higher temperatures, which could be beneficial for the sustainabilty of geological storage facilities in salt mines. On the one hand, <b>visco-plastic</b> <b>laws</b> relating creep microscopic processes to microstructure changes are empirical. On the other hand, theoretical models of damage and healing disconnect thermodynamic variables from their physical meaning. The proposed model enriches the framework of Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) with fabric descriptors. In order to infer the form of fabric tensors from microstructure observation, creep tests were carried out on granular salt under constant stress and humidity conditions. The evolution of net damage is governed by a diffusion equation, in which the characteristic time scales with the typical size of halite crystals, and the diffusion coefficient is a function of temperature. A stress path comprising a tensile loading, a compressive unloading, a creep healing stage and a reloading was simulated. Macroscopic and microscopic model predictions highlight the increased efficiency of healing with time and temperature. The model presented in this paper is expected to improve the fundamental understanding of damage and healing in rocks at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, and the long-term assessment of geological storage facilities...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{numerical}} model is developed to investigate long-term soil-geosyn-thetic interaction in typical geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures. The {{numerical model}} employs the {{finite element method}} with a time marching scheme while incorpo-rating a generalized creep law for geosynthetics and a <b>visco-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law</b> for soil. To verify the numerical model, two well-controlled laboratory long-term soil-geo-synthetic performance tests were analyzed. One performance test used cohesive back-fill {{and the other a}} granular backfill. As a result of soil-geosynthetic interaction, the cohesive backfill test exhibited significant deformation with time, while the granular backfill test demonstrated little deformation with time. It is shown that the numerical model is capable of simulating the long-term soil-geosynthetic interactive behavior of both long-term performance tests. To illustrate the importance of the long-term soil-geosynthetic interaction, the numerical model was used to analyze the long-term per-formance of two 3 m high geosynthetic-reinforced soil retainingwalls, onewith a cohe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Coupled thermo-mechanical models {{based on}} highly {{nonlinear}} elastic <b>visco-plastic</b> constitutive <b>laws</b> {{are applied to}} simulate simultaneous development of temperature and stress that occurs during steel solidification in continuous casting processes. The efficient and robust local visco-plastic integration scheme [Koric 2006] is implemented into both implicit and explicit FE commercial software ABAQUS/Standard and ABAQUS/Explicit via user defined subroutines VUMAT and UMAT. The models are first verified with a semi-analytical solution [Weiner 1963], and later they are applied to simulate 2 D and 3 D transverse sections of a thin slab caster under realistic operating conditions as they move down the mold. The execution times of the implicit and explicit parallel solvers performing some of these highly computationally demanding analyses are benchmarked on the latest high performance computing platforms. INTRODUCTION: Continuous casting is {{the process by which}} over 90 % of steel is produced today.

40|$|AbstractIn mantle {{convection}} simulations, dynamically evolving plate boundaries have, for {{the most}} part, been represented using an <b>visco-plastic</b> flow <b>law.</b> These systems develop fine-scale, localized, weak shear band structures which are reminiscent of faults {{but it is a}} significant challenge to resolve the large- and the emergent, small-scale-behavior. We address this issue of resolution by taking into account the observation that a rock element with embedded, planar, failure surfaces responds as a non-linear, transversely isotropic material with a weak orientation defined by the plane of the failure surface. This approach partly accounts for the large-scale behavior of fine-scale systems of shear bands which we are {{not in a position to}} resolve explicitly. We evaluate the capacity of this continuum approach to model plate boundaries, specifically in the context of subduction models where the plate boundary interface has often been represented as a planar discontinuity. We show that the inclusion of the transversely isotropic plasticity model for the plate boundary promotes asymmetric subduction from initiation. A realistic evolution of the plate boundary interface and associated stresses is crucial to understanding inter-plate coupling, convergent margin driven topography, and earthquakes...|$|R

Copyright © 2013 by the American Rock Mechanics AssociationCrushing {{implies the}} {{division}} of particles into smaller parts, and may involve a change in shape. Continuum-Based models of crushing give an average representation of elastic weakening, often {{in the form of}} a <b>visco-plastic</b> deformation <b>law.</b> Particulate Mechanics and Discrete Element Methods (DEM) are better suited to capture the loss of compression and shear strength with particle crushing. In DEM, a Representative Elementary Volume typically contains several thousands of particles, which involves high computational costs. In all of these approaches, the assembly of grains is a closed thermodynamic system. Elementary simulations of sequences alternating crushing and sieving are presented in this paper showing that the GSD obtained after each sequence is the same. However, the key point in the energy balance is the loss of mass induced by sieving, which requires additional modeling. The bases of thermodynamics of open systems subject to crushing are presented, within the framework of breakage mechanics. The proposed approach is expected to bring new insights to the modeling of friction sliding during faulting, ballast particle crushing and optimization of processes used in powder engineering...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of the slow time dependent {{movement of the}} deep-seated deformation of Rosone. This rock slope, which mainly consists of gneiss, {{is located on the}} Italian side of Western Alps and has been a¨ected by recurrent instability phenomena. Due to these, and also to the presence of various villages and man-made structures (such as a hydroelectric power plant), a signi®cant amount of geological and geomechanical data has been collected in this area. They have led to the assumption that the slow movement develops along a deep-seated sliding surface, involving a volume of rock between 22 and 35 million cubic meters. To check these hypotheses, and to get some insight into the causes of the phenomenon, a series of non-linear, time-dependent analyses has been carried out through the ®nite element method. The slow movement of the rock mass, and the gradual loss of its mechanical properties with increasing deformation, has been accounted for in the calculations by means of a <b>visco-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law,</b> allowing for strain softening e¨ects. The results of analyses lead to some conclusions on the causes of the observed movements, among which the possible in¯uence of the groundwater pore pressure is likely to play an important role...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{perform an}} {{evaluation}} of the abilities of a bonded structure to endure repetitive loadings, characterizations of structural adhesive joints mechanical behavior are key objectives. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the phenomena occurring in the bonded joint until the appearance of a macroscopic crack. Using lap-shear type specimens, associated with stress concentrations, crack initiation generally appears early at the edge of the adhesive joint, which makes it difficult to identify the crack initiation phase. To characterize more properly the crack initiation phase, bonded joints designed to limit stress concentrations allowed the accurate characterization of the mechanical phenomena occurring in a polyurethane structural ductile adhesive. Then, based on the experimental response of the bonded assembly to creep recovery tests, a visco-elastic <b>visco-plastic</b> behavior <b>law</b> is defined for the adhesive joint mechanical behavior. In the following, details of such a model able to take into account the hydrostatic sensitivity with a non-associated formalism are given. The numerical work performed here relies on the identification of the material parameters of the behavior law using creep-recovery tests to model the cyclic behavior of bonded structures. Then, experimental results under fatigue loading are presented and compared to numerical simulations. Finally, using a strain-based criterion for the definition of crack initiations, predictions of fatigue lifetime are performed for specimens under shear loadings. The quality of the results obtained underlines that an accurate description of viscous mechanisms in the adhesive layer allows describing efficiently the mechanical behavior of bonded joints under cyclic loading...|$|R
40|$|Powder {{compaction}} is {{a production}} method {{commonly used in}} the manufacturing industry today. In order to minimize costly experiments and to optimize serial production of details several methods to analyze the powder compaction process are developed and used. One method is to use micromechanical analysis where the local description of contact between two individual particles is of great importance. In this dissertation a <b>visco-plastic</b> contact <b>law</b> has been used and further developed {{in order to understand}} the powder compaction process at packing, low relative density compaction up to high relative density compaction. In order to relax some assumptions from previous theoretical studies simulation with the discrete element method (DEM) was performed. Up to 10. 000 spherical particles were used in packing and early compaction simulation. It was found that rearrangement of particles is one of the major densification mechanisms in the early phases of compaction. At die compaction this effect of rearrangement was shown to be more pronounced than predicted from theoretical analyses. It was also found that the size ratio of particles is of importance when the number fraction of small particles in the compound is high. The finite element method has been used for numerical analyses to investigate the local contact problem between two particles when self-similarity no longer prevail. Based on the numerical results a suggestion for an approximate compliance relation was made. With this approximate formula the local compliance behaviour between two dissimilar particles was analysed. These findings are directly applicable to simulations with the discrete element method. Finally, an investigation using the finite element method to evaluate the range of the accuracy for theoretical and approximate compliance formula has been done with compounds of different regular lattices. It was found that the range of accuracy is much dependent on the number of contacts within the lattices, specially new forming contacts during the compaction. QC 20101007 </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{develops}} a new void growth model which {{is capable of}} describing the deformation and fracture of ductile materials under dynamic loading conditions. A representative volume element (RVE) which consists of a spheroidal void and a confocal spheroidal cell has been studied. A power <b>law</b> <b>visco-plastic</b> matrix material was assumed in the study in order to include the strain rate sensitivity effect. The formulations of Gåråjeu's model were used as basis for mathematical derivation. Particular {{attention is paid to}} inertia effect. In the new constitutive equations the inertia effect is represented by an individual term in the mesoscopic stress expression compared with the Gåråjeu's model. And this term {{is a function of the}} current void shape, void size, mesoscopic strain rate and matrix material density. A parametric study of the new model has been carried out by calculating the constitutive equations using FORTRAN code. Inertia effect and strain rate sensitivity have been evaluated numerically. The results of the new model have been shown to agree with the existing models very well. The relationships between inertia and parameters such as void shape, void size, strain rate, matrix material properties and void volume fraction were explained in details. It has been found that the strain rate effect dominates the void growth process at the early stage, and the effect decreases as the time elapses. FEM model analysis has been carried out to evaluate the new void growth model by ABAQUS. A special velocity boundary condition has been used in the FEM simulations to get the identical strain rate boundary condition as in the analytical calculations. It has been shown that the agreement of the present model with the FEM models is quite satisfactory on a wide range of strain rate, except the void shape which can not be predicted accurately. It has been found that the inertia effect is very small under the strain rate from quasi static up to several thousand 1 /s.

40|$|As {{the trends}} in green manufacturing, miniaturization, and {{enhanced}} functionality of electronics devices continue without {{any sign of}} slowing down, the reliability of lead free solder joints with diminishing size has {{become more and more}} a challenge to the design engineers and the electronics manufacturing industry. In order to predict the reliability of solder joints accurately, it is necessary to develop test techniques to test solder joints efficiently under conditions that are comparable to those in application environment. In this day and age when computer simulation has become an indispensable tool in many areas, it is also very important that suitable material models are available for solder materials so that virtual design tools can be used to predict device reliability performance accurately. In this work, the aim was to develop vibration and cyclic shear test methods and equipment, and to use computer modelling techniques in the analysis of lead free solder joints in microelectronics devices, and to develop an inverse Finite Element technique and experimental data to obtain constitutive laws for lead-free solder alloys. In the development of the vibration test machine, a prototype test machine that uses piezoelectric cell as actuators for the loading was modelled using the Finite Element Analysis method, and the behaviours of the test specimen which is similar to a BGA solder joint in dimensions was analysed. The static and dynamic response of the equipment was modelled and compared with experimental results. A novel multi-joint test specimen in which the solder deformation is similar to that in solder joints of BGAs that are under thermal loading was analysed so that test results can be interpreted and the specimens and loading conditions can be improved. The response of the joints reinforced the understanding that the interface of the solder and the copper or printed circuit board is the mostly likely region for crack growth and hence failure of the package. In the inverse Finite Element Analysis of solder joints, cyclic shear test data and Finite Element Analysis methods were used to improve the Anand's <b>visco-plastic</b> constitutive <b>law</b> for the SAC solder specimens under the test conditions. To reduce the possibility of spurious experimental data skewing the entire analysis, a technique was employed that uses limited experimental datasets in determining the material parameters. Simulation results using the new constitutive law showed significant improvement in accuracy. The main contribution of this research work to the manufacturing, testing and virtual design of solder joints can be summarised as follows: (1) A unique dedicated high cycle fatigue test equipment that is especially suited for testing very small solder joints and other surface mounted technologies under vibration conditions has been successfully designed, and manufactured. This is expected to enhance the capability of the industry in solder joint tests. (2) The behaviours of individual solder joints in a BGA-like multi-joint test specimen under isothermal cyclic loading condition have been characterised making the prediction of solder properties more accurate and efficient. (3) A novel procedure that is based on inverse Finite Element Analysis to obtain nonlinear creep parameters of, for example, Anand’s model, has been proposed and demonstrated. This method reduces the effect of spurious dataset, the high reliance of the skill of the individuals who perform the analysis and makes it possible for small institutions with limited resources to obtain the necessary model parameters for virtual product design and reliability analysis...|$|R
