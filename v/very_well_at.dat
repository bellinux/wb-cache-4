5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. Hamer expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Saw {{was first}} {{screened}} on January 19, 2004. Lionsgate {{picked up the}} rights and released the film in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2004. Critical responses were generally mixed and divided, but the film gained a cult following. Compared to its low budget, Saw performed <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, {{one of the most}} profitable horror films since 1996's Scream. The success of the film prompted a green-light of a sequel soon after Saw opening weekend, which was released the following October.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC was not doing <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of this}} episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E

5|$|After the encounter, Brooke {{returns home}} to comfort his mother at his father's death bed. After his father's death, though Brooke desires {{to return to}} the Orchard, Brooke is forced to stay at the school where his father worked as headmaster, {{retaining}} the post {{until the end of the}} school year. After a brief period, Brooke returns to The Orchard. Meanwhile, Nell's sister Betty becomes a maid at The Orchard and another of Nell's sisters has a still birth. Brooke continues to become closer to Nell, and they covertly go swimming together in Byron's pond, a local swimming hole named after the poet Lord Byron. Afterwards, Brooke departs on a tour advocating for workers' rights, which does not go <b>very</b> <b>well.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the tour, Brooke proposes to Noel Oliver, one of the wealthy girls whom Brooke had been courting during his stay at The Orchard. Upon his return to Grantchester, Brooke also finds himself expelled from The Orchard because of his wanton social life. Brooke then moves next door to another boarding house, the Old Vicarage.|$|E
5|$|Hockey is Canada's {{national}} winter sport, and Canadians {{are extremely}} {{passionate about the}} game. The nation has traditionally done <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union competed in its first World Championship in 1954, defeating Canada and winning the gold medal. At the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, the Soviet team went undefeated and won its first gold medal. Canada's team lost to the Soviets and the United States in the medal round, winning the bronze. The 1960 Winter Olympics, in Squaw Valley, United States, saw the first, and to date only, team from Australia compete in the tournament. Canada, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Sweden were the top four teams heading into the Games, but were all defeated by the American team, which won all seven games en route to its first Olympic gold medal. Canada won the silver medal and the Soviet Union won the bronze.|$|E
25|$|Akmal {{was dropped}} for the 2008 Asia Cup {{as a result}} of his poor wicket-keeping. He was {{replaced}} by Sarfraz Ahmed who performed <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the domestic level and also because of Sarfraz's strong showing in the U-19 World Cup. Akmal was named in the 30 man probable squad for the 2008 ICC Champions Trophy.|$|E

25|$|Johar then {{teamed up}} with Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap, and Dibakar Banerjee for Bombay Talkies (2013), an {{anthology}} film released to celebrate the centenary year of Hindi cinema. Each of the directors made one short film {{to contribute to the}} large anthology. The plot of Johar’s film followed a magazine editor (Rani Mukerji) who discovers that her husband (Randeep Hooda) is gay after an interaction with an intern at her office (Saqib Saleem). The film did not perform <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the box office but earned positive reviews from critics.|$|E
25|$|Linguists also {{administered}} several brain exams specifically geared towards measuring Genie's language comprehension. On {{one such}} test {{she had no}} difficulty giving the correct meaning of sentences containing familiar homophones, demonstrating that her receptive comprehension was significantly better than her expressive language. Genie also did <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> identifying rhymes, both tasks that adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients had previously been recorded performing well on. During these tests an EEG consistently picked up more activity from the two electrodes over the right hemisphere of her brain than from those over the normal locations of the Broca's area and Wernicke's area, and found especially high involvement from her right anterior cerebral cortex, lending further support to the researchers' conclusion that Genie was using her right hemisphere to acquire language.|$|E

25|$|Faraz Anwar {{started out}} as a session player working for many major artists around the country, which {{included}} the likes of Sajjad Ali, Vital Signs, Junoon, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Ali Haider and Nadeem Jafri. In 1996, Faraz, while studying at Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts, was awarded an educational scholarship and an outstanding musical achievement award but he was unable to proceed his education due to personal hurdles. Faraz then returned to Pakistan and took charge of the band Collage and went on releasing the band's debut album Gul Jana which was highly acclaimed and did <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the local music charts. However, after going on tour to England, Collage disbanded and Faraz went on forming his own band. First, he recruited Khalid Khan on bass guitar, also a band member of Collage and then Akhtar Qayyum on percussion.|$|E
25|$|Born on 18 September 1892, Newstead Colliery, Nottinghamshire, Staples first {{played for}} Nottinghamshire in 1920. Though he {{accomplished}} {{a few good}} performances such as 6 for 81 against the great Surrey batting side at The Oval, it was though he had little sting, and although he obtained a permanent place in 1921 and took 76 wickets, there was still little to suggest a significant career. Although in 1922, Staples bowled <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> times (notably four quick wickets to round off a brilliant win over Yorkshire) and made 85 not out in a last wicket stand of 140 with Richmond, he did not establish {{a reputation as a}} major force in the game until 1923, when his bowling gave Yorkshire its only defeat in the Championship and he took almost 100 wickets. In addition, he surprised everyone by making 110 against Surrey in the August Bank Holiday match.|$|E
500|$|Presley {{returned}} to the Sullivan show at its main studio in New York, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy. His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though he was not top billed, the film's original title—The Reno Brothers—was changed to capitalize on his latest number one record: [...] "Love Me Tender" [...] had hit {{the top of the}} charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by the critics but did <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the box office.|$|E
50|$|Critically, Nikki was not <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{received}} <b>at</b> first. Jeffrey Robinson, a reviewer for DVD Talk, was {{not impressed}} with her, stating {{that she was}} decent but did not really add to the series.|$|R

500|$|Development of the game's title {{screen was}} {{inspired}} by loading screens {{that were used in}} most computer games at the time; the objective was to create a nice-looking graphic while waiting for the game to load, even though the NES, more rooted in arcade traditions, did not require that. Pickford spent most of his character space on the title screen image; he was limited in the number of available colors due to the more limited graphic capabilities of the NES (as opposed to most home computers), as it was more designed for scrolling and animation and not for stationary graphics. The sword in the title screen used character sprites and used a different palette from the picture of Kuros himself; the sword had to be vertical as the NES hardware did not allow for too many sprites horizontally. Pickford planned to use, and completed, an Ironsword logo of his own when Acclaim made him use their planned logo, which he said [...] "was a bit more bland and blocky, with detail that didn't work <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> such a low pixel resolution".|$|E

Film critic Taran Adarsh wrote that he [...] "has {{all it takes to}} emerge a competent actor in years to come.

2500|$|Reeve {{was then}} offered {{the role of}} Basil Ransom in The Bostonians {{alongside}} Vanessa Redgrave. Though Reeve ordinarily commanded over one million dollars per film, the producers could only afford to pay him one-tenth of that. Reeve had no complaints, as {{he was happy to}} be doing a role that he could be proud of. The film exceeded expectations and did <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> the box office for what was considered to be an art house film. The New York Times called it [...] "the best adaptation of a literary work yet made for the screen." [...] Katharine Hepburn called Reeve to tell him that he was [...] "absolutely marvelous" [...] and [...] "captivating" [...] in the film. When told that he was currently shooting Anna Karenina, she said, [...] "Oh, that's a terrible mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beethoven was in Teplitz when {{he wrote}} this on Tuesday the 7th (no doubt about that), and Antonie Brentano was (as Beethoven knew <b>very</b> <b>well)</b> <b>at</b> the same time (for several weeks) in [...] "K" [...] (Karlsbad). From Teplitz to Karlsbad (ca. 100km), the post coach took just one day. Therefore, {{if it had been}} {{intended}} for Antonie, she would have received the Letter on Friday morning, the latest. If, however, Beethoven expected the addressee to receive the Letter not before Saturday (and [...] "probably") then she must have been two days away from Teplitz, or one more day from Karlsbad – in a westerly direction: the next bigger township is Eger , ca. 50km from Karlsbad (and Franzensbad another 10km away). Now it is established that Antonie is definitely ruled out, it helps to know that the Austrian Emperor was briefly in Franzensbad on 5 July 1812, and given the known fact that Josephine's first husband was a personal friend of the Emperor (to whom she went to ask for help, after becoming a widow), it makes sense to assume that she tried to meet him there (after her encounter with Beethoven on 3–4 July).|$|E

In the beginning, Bruce was just a guy’s guy. Let's just say he evolved. Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>at</b> times, other times I’d have to be the one who said you have to come out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E
