30|$|The crypt is {{considered}} as the <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> producer. In this respect, a deeper crypt shows rapid tissue turnover {{and a high}} demand for new tissue (Choct 2009). Interestingly, DLP 3 reduced crypt depth in this study; however, the larger crypt depth was expected. This might {{be attributed to the}} presence of active compounds such as tannins in the DLP. Feeding diets rich in soluble fiber usually lead to the presence of high viscosity digesta in the lumen, increase the rate of <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> losses, and elevate the cell proliferation, subsequently increasing the crypt depth (Montagne et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Golgi and cell surface membranes of intestinal cells was studied. These membranes were isolated from intestinal crypt cells and villus cells. The <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> membranes consisted of microvillus membrane, a Golgi-rich fraction, and two membrane fractions interpreted as representing lateral-basal membranes. The <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> microvillus membrane was purified by previously published techniques {{while the other}} membranes were obtained from isolated cells by differential centrifugation and density gradient velocity sedimentation. The two membrane fractions obtained from villus cells and considered to be lateral-basal membranes were enriched for Na+,K+- ATPase activity, but one also showed enrichment in glycosyltransferase activity. The Golgi membrane fraction was enriched for glycosyltransferase activity and had low to absent Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Adenylate cyclase activity was present in all membrane fractions except the microvillus membrane but co-purified with Golgi rather than lateral-basal membranes. Electron microscopy showed that the Golgi fraction consisted of variably sized vesicles and cisternalike structures. The two lateral-basal membrane fractions showed only vesicles of smaller, more uniform size. After 125 I labeling of isolated intact cells, radioactivity was found associated with the lateral-basal and microvillus membrane fractions and not with the Golgi fraction. Antibody prepared against lateral-basal membrane fractions reacted with the surface membrane of isolated villus cells. The membrane fractions from isolated crypt cells demonstrated that all had high glycosyltransferase activity. The data show that glycosyltransferase activity, {{in addition to its}} Golgi location, may be a significant property of the lateral-basal portion of the intestinal <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> plasma membrane. Data obtained with crypt cells support earlier data and show that the crypt cell surface membrane possesses glycosyltransferase activity...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the mechanism of}} action of an intestinal secretagogue, serotonin, we have isolated crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and demonstrated Na:H and Cl:HCO 3 exchange activity using the intracellular pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2, 7 -bis (carboxy-ethyl) - 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein. Serotonin alkalinized both crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> Alkalinization in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> was HCO 3 dependent and Na independent. In contrast, alkalinization in crypt cells was HCO 3 independent and Na dependent. In <b>villus</b> <b>cells,</b> recovery from an alkaline load induced by Cl removal, 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanatostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonic acid or propionate pulse, known to occur via the Cl:HCO 3 exchange, is inhibited by serotonin. In contrast, in crypt cells, recovery from an acid load induced by Na removal, amiloride and NH 4 Cl pulse, known to occur via Na:H exchange, is stimulated by serotonin. These data suggest that serotonin is inhibiting Cl:HCO 3 exchange in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and stimulating Na:H exchange in crypt cells. These effects of serotonin {{would be expected to}} inhibit coupled Na and Cl absorption by <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and stimulate HCO 3 secretion by crypt cells in the intact ileum...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNa-K-ATPase {{located on}} the basolateral {{membrane}} (BLM) of intestinal epithelial cells provides a favorable intracellular Na+ gradient to promote all Na dependent co-transport processes across the brush border membrane (BBM). Down-regulation of Na-K-ATPase activity has been postulated to alter the absorption via Na-solute co-transporters in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further, the altered activity {{of a variety of}} Na-solute co-transporters in intact <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> has been reported in animal models of chronic enteritis. But the molecular mechanism of down-regulation of Na-K-ATPase is not known. In the present study, using a rabbit model of chronic intestinal inflammation, which resembles human IBD, Na-K-ATPase in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> was shown to decrease. The relative mRNA abundance of α- 1 and β- 1 subunits was not altered in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> during chronic intestinal inflammation. Similarly, the protein levels of these subunits were also not altered in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> during chronic enteritis. However, the BLM concentration of α- 1 and β- 1 subunits was diminished in the chronically inflamed intestinal <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> An ankyrin–spectrin skeleton is necessary for the proper trafficking of Na-K-ATPase to the BLM of the cell. In the present study, ankyrin expression was markedly diminished in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> from the chronically inflamed intestine resulting in depolarization of ankyrin-G protein. The decrease of Na-K-ATPase activity was comparable to that seen in ankyrin knockdown IEC- 18 cells. Therefore, altered localization of Na-K-ATPase as a result of transcriptional down-regulation of ankyrin-G mediates the down-regulation of Na-K-ATPase activity during chronic intestinal inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic AMP-dependent secretagogues such as {{cholera toxin}} inhibit the coupled {{absorption}} of Na+ and Cl- and stimulate the secretion of HCO 3 - and Cl- in the ileum. Aside from Cl- secretion, {{little is known}} about the mechanism of these cyclic AMP-mediated effects. We therefore determined the effect of forskolin, an agent known to increase intracellular cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, on Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO 3 - exchange in isolated crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> from rabbit ileum. Forskolin increased cyclic AMP in the <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and decreased intracellular pH. The effect of forskolin on pH in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> was HCO 3 - independent, Na+ dependent, and amiloride sensitive. Further, the rate of recovery from an acid load was decreased by forskolin. These data suggest that increasing cyclic AMP inhibits Na+/H+ exchange in <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> In crypt cells also, forskolin increased cyclic AMP; however, forskolin increased intracellular pH in these cells. The effect of forskolin in crypt cells was also HCO 3 - independent, Na+ dependent, and amiloride sensitive. However, the rate of recovery from an acid load was increased by forskolin, the opposite effect of that seen in <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> These data suggest that increasing cyclic AMP in crypt cells stimulates Na+/H+ exchange. Inhibition of Na+/H+ exchange on the brush border membrane in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> would be expected to inhibit coupled NaCl absorption (which occurs by coupling of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO 3 - exchange). Stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange in crypt cells, present only on the basolateral membrane, alkalinizes the cell, which would be expected to stimulate HCO 3 - secretion by stimulating the Cl-/HCO 3 - exchanger on the brush border membrane. Thus, these results provide a mechanism for some of the previously unexplained in vivo and in vitro effects of cyclic AMP on ileal electrolyte transport...|$|R

40|$|Background: Small {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cells}} (IEC) show apoptosis in physiological turnover of cells and in certain inflammatory diseases. Aims: To investigate {{the role of}} caspases in the progression of IEC apoptosis in vivo. Methods: IEC were separated along the villus-crypt axis from the jejunum of normal and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infected rats at 4 °C. Caspases were examined by a fluorometric assay method, histochemistry, and immunoblotting. Results: <b>Villus</b> <b>cell</b> rich IEC from normal rats exhibited {{a high level of}} caspase- 3 -like activity whereas activities of caspase- 1,- 8, and- 9 were negligible. Immunoblotting analysis of <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> rich IEC revealed partial cleavage of procaspase- 3 into a 17 kDa molecule as well as cleavage of a caspase- 3 substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), whereas in crypt cell rich IEC, caspase- 3 cleavage was less significant. Caspase- 3 activity was also observed histochemically in villus epithelium on frozen sec-tions of the normal small intestine. IEC prepared at 4 °C did not reveal nuclear degradation whereas subsequent incubation in a suspension at 37 °C induced intense nuclear degradation within one hour in accordance with increases in active caspase- 3.

40|$|To {{define the}} role of cytoplasmic microtubules in the biogenesis of {{plasmalemma}} glycoproteins of rat small-intestinal villus cells, we studied the effect of colchicine on the incorporation of L-[1, 5, 6 - 3 H]fucose into Golgi, lateral basal and microvillus membranes. Colchicine was administered intraperitoneally before or after injection of radioactive fucose. The incorporation of radioactivity into Golgi membranes was little affected by colchicine, which did not prevent the redistribution {{of most of the}} labelled glycoproteins from the Golgi complex into other parts of the <b>villus</b> <b>cell.</b> The incorporation of labelled glycoproteins into the microvillus membrane was greatly inhibited by colchicine given 2 h or 10 min before the radioactive fucose: all labelled glycoproteins present in this membrane were equally affected. In contrast, the administration of colchicine considerably increased the incorporation of radioactivity into the lateral basal part of the plasmalemma, and prevented the disappearance of most of the labelled glycoproteins from this membrane at late times after fucose injection. These results suggest that cytoplasmic microtubular structures are important for the polarization of the intestinal <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> and the biogenesis of the microvillus membrane, although playing little or no role in the movement of membrane components from the Golgi complex to the lateral basal part of the plasmalemma...|$|E

However, clonidine stimulated recovery from an acid load induced by NH 4 Cl, Na removal, or amiloride.

40|$|Present {{evidence}} suggests that in the small intestine, <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> are primarily absorptive and crypt cells are primarily secretory. In order to further confirm that {{there are differences in}} transport properties between <b>villus</b> and crypt <b>cells,</b> we have separated <b>villus</b> from crypt <b>cells,</b> using calcium chelations techniques, and determined the distribution of Na:H and Cl:HCO 3 exchange activity on brush border membrane and basolateral membrane preparations from these two cell populations. Separation of cells was determined utilizing alkaline phosphatase and maltase activity as a marker of <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and thymidine kinase activity as a marker of crypt cells. Utilizing these techniques, we were able to sequentially collect cells along the villus-crypt axis. Na-stimulated glucose and alanine uptake in brush border membrane vesicles diminished from the villus to the crypt region in the sequentially collected cells fractions, further suggesting separation of these cells. Brush border and basolateral membranes were then prepared from <b>cells</b> from the <b>villus</b> and crypt areas, utilizing a continuous sucrose gradient.

40|$|Glutamine, {{the primary}} {{metabolic}} {{fuel for the}} mammalian small intestinal enterocytes, is primarily assimilated by Na-amino acid cotransporters. Although Na-solute cotransport {{has been shown to}} exist in the brush border membrane (BBM) of the absorptive villus cells, the identity of Na-glutamine cotransport in rabbit small intestinal villus cells was unknown. Na-dependent glutamine uptake is present in villus BBM vesicles. An intravesicular proton gradient did not stimulate this Na-dependent glutamine uptake, whereas Li+ did not significantly suppress this uptake. These observations in concert with amino acid substitution studies suggested that Na-glutamine cotransporter in the <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> BBM was the newly identified cotransporter B 0 AT 1 (SLC 6 A 19). Quantitative real-time PCR identified the message for this cotransporter in villus cells. Thus a full-length cDNA of B 0 AT 1 was cloned and expressed in MDA-MB- 231 cells. This expressed cotransporter exhibited characteristics similar to those observed in villus cells from the rabbit small intestine. Antibody was generated for B 0 AT 1 that demonstrated the presence of this cotransporter protein in the <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> BBM. Kinetic studies defined the kinetic parameters of this cotransporter.

Eighty five percent jejunoileal bypass caused a functional short gut; in intestine remaining in continuity there were significant increases in segmental weight, villus area and crypt depth, compared with sham operated controls and 25 % jejunoileal bypass rats. Despite <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia in 85 % bypass rats, mucosal sucrase and alkaline phosphatase fell in jejunum and remained low in ileum, while leucine amino peptidase rose in ileum. There was a significant fall in villus area (p less than 0. 01) and crypt cell production (p less than 0. 001) in self emptying loops of 25 % bypass rats not exposed to luminal contents compared with control segments of sham operated rats. In contrast, self emptying loops of 85 % bypass rats were not atrophied despite the much greater distance from luminal nutrients; the villus area (p less than 0. 01) and crypt cell production (p less than 0. 005) were higher than in 25 % bypass rats, and at least as great as in sham operated rats. These results indicate that adaptive hyperplasia has a variable effect on expression of brush border enzymes which might reflect <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> immaturity. The atrophic effect of diversion of luminal contents can be counteracted by systemic growth factors released as part of the adaptive response; thus systemic growth factors are not dependent on a permissive effect of luminal contents...|$|E
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of membrane {{proteins and}} glycoproteins {{has been studied}} in rat intestinal crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> by measuring the incorporation of L-[5, 6 - 3 H] fucose, D-[2 - 3 H] mannose and L-[3, 4, 5 - 3 H] leucine, given intraperitoneally, into Golgi, lateral-basal and luminal membranes. Incorporation of leucine and mannose was approximately equal in crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas fucose incorporation was markedly higher (3 - 4 times) in the differentiated <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> As previously reported [Quaroni, Kirsch & Weiser (1979) Biochem J. 182. 203 - 212] most of the fucosylated glyco-proteins synthesized in the <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and initially present in the Golgi and lateral-basal membranes were found re-distributed, within 3 - 4 h of label administration, in the luminal membrane. A similar process appeared {{to occur in the}} crypt cells, where, however, only few fucose-labelled glycoproteins were identified. In contrast, most of the leucine-labelled and many mannose-labelled membrane components found in the lateral-basal membrane of both crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> did not seen to undergo a similar re-distribution process. The fucosylated glycoproteins of the intestinal epithelial cells represent, therefore, a special class of membrane components, most of which appear with differentiation, that are selectively localized in the luminal portion of the plasmalemma. In contrast with the marked differences in protein and glycoprotein patterns between the luminal membrane of <b>villus</b> and crypt <b>cells,</b> only minor differences were found between their lateral-basal membrane components: their protein patterns on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide slab gels, and the patterns of fucose-, mannose- and leucine-labelled components (analysed 3 - 4 h after label administration) were very similar. Although the minor differences detected may be of importance, it appears that most of the surface-membrane changes accompanying cell differentiation in the intestinal epithelial cells are localized in the luminal portion of their surface membrane...|$|R

The YBB 1 / 27 antigen was first detected at the luminal membrane of the epithelial cells in fetal intestine at day 20 of gestation; it was confined to the crypt <b>cells</b> and lower <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> between 1 and 20 - 22 d after birth, {{and could not be}} detected in any region of the intestine in older animals. The YBB 3 / 10 antigen, identified as a set of high Mr proteins, was localized over the entire surface membrane of fetal intestinal cells and of crypt and <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> after birth; after weaning (20 - 22 d after birth) it gradually disappeared from the <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> and became confined to the region of the crypts. The CC 4 / 80 antigen, identified as a protein (or a set of related proteins) of molecular mass 28 - 34 kD, was shown to appear in the crypt cells 10 - 14 d after birth. Its distribution changed after weaning, when it disappeared from the crypts, and was localized in the absorptive lower <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> This change in pattern could, in part, be prematurely elicited by cortisone injection in younger animals.

Of the four NHE isoforms that have been cloned, only one, NHE- 3, appears to be epithelial specific. We have examined the regional and cellular expression of NHE- 3 in the rat intestine. NHE- 3 message in the small intestine was more abundant in the villus fractions of the small intestine than in the crypts. Analysis of NHE- 3 mRNA distribution in the gut by in situ hybridization demonstrated epithelial cell specificity, as well as expression preferential to <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> NHE- 1 message, in contrast, was ubiquitous, with slightly greater expression exhibited in the differentiating crypt and lower <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> of the small intestine.

To further characterize this kinase, synapsin I, a substrate for Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent protein kinases, was added to preparations of ileal brush border membranes. In the presence of Ca 2 +/CaM, synapsin I was phosphorylated. Phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that the addition of Ca 2 +/CaM to brush border membranes stimulated the phosphorylation of sites in synapsin I specific for Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent protein kinase II. Immunoblots containing brush border and microvillus membrane proteins were probed with an antibody that recognizes the 50 -kDa subunit of rat brain Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent protein kinase II. This antibody labeled major and minor species of 50 and 53 kDa, respectively, with more labeling of the brush border than the microvillus membranes. Right-side-out ileal <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> brush border vesicles were prepared containing CaM, ATP, and 350 nM free Ca 2 +. Na+/H+ exchange was inhibited by the presence of Ca 2 +/CaM/ATP within the vesicles. A 21 -amino acid peptide inhibitor of CaM kinase II was enclosed within some vesicle preparations by freeze-thaw. The effect on Na+/H+ exchange of Ca 2 +/CaM/ATP was partially reversed by the inhibitor peptide. These studies demonstrate the presence of Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in rabbit ileal <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> brush border membranes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether the rat small intestine exhibits quantitative changes in the synthesis of the secretory component (SC) during growth, epithelial villus and crypt cells were isolated from jejunal segments at intervals after birth up to adulthood. SC concentration was measured in each cell fraction by immunoradiometric assay and compared to sucrase activity, an enzyme marker of the differentiated villus enterocyte. The following results were observed. (i) Adult rats showed a characteristic decreasing concentration gradient of SC from the crypts (mean concentration in crypt cells: 636 +/- 173 ng/mg protein) to the villus tip (mean concentration in villus cells: 152 +/- 17 ng/mg protein). This gradient was the reverse of that found for sucrase activity. (ii) In young sucklings (10 days old), SC was virtually absent in both villus and crypt cells, but its concentration progressively increased in weanling rats and reached adult levels by day 40 postpartum. (iii) The crypt to <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> gradient of SC, absent in sucklings up to day 20, developed during the fourth postnatal week. (iv) Treatment of 10 -day-old suckling pups with pharmacological doses of either corticosterone or L-thyroxine for 3 consecutive days failed to induce the precocious synthesis of SC by jejunal enterocytes, but produced significant (P less than 0. 01) decreases in concentration. Under the same conditions, sucrase activity was markedly enhanced. In conclusion, major changes in the ability of the immature crypt cell to produce the specific receptor for transepithelial transport of polymeric immunoglobulins occur during the fourth week of rat life. The initiation of this ontogenic process is not triggered by the dietary and hormonal changes known to control the maturation of other functions linked to the differenciated <b>villus</b> <b>cell,</b> such as sucrase activity...|$|E

40|$|The {{direct effect}} of the {{rotavirus}} NSP 4 114 - 135 and Norovirus NV 464 - 483 peptides on 36 Cl uptake was studied by using <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> brush border membrane (BBM) isolated from young rabbits.

40|$|AbstractAmino acids, a {{critical}} energy {{source for the}} intestinal epithelial cells, are more efficiently assimilated in the normal intestine via peptide co-transporters such as proton:dipeptide co-transport (such as PepT 1). Active uptake of a non-hydrolyzable dipeptide (glycosarcosine) {{was used as a}} substrate and PepT 1 was found to be present in normal villus, but not crypt cells. The mRNA for this transporter was also found in villus, but not crypt cells from the normal rabbit intestine. PepT 1 was significantly reduced in villus cells also diminished in <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> brush border membrane vesicles both from the chronically inflamed intestine. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the mechanism of inhibition of PepT 1 during chronic enteritis was secondary to a decrease in the affinity of the co-transporter for the dipeptide without an alteration in the maximal rate of uptake (Vmax). Northern blot studies also demonstrated unaltered steady state mRNA levels of this transporter in the chronically inflamed intestine. Proton dipeptide transport is found in normal intestinal villus cells and is inhibited during chronic intestinal inflammation. The mechanism of inhibition is secondary to altered affinity of the co-transporter for the dipeptide...|$|E
40|$|We studied cell-volume changes {{caused by}} adding corticostatin (CS) or defensin-like {{peptides}} to villus enterocytes isolated in suspension from guinea pig jejunum. Guinea pig CS (10 (- 9) M) added to <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> in Na(+) -containing medium reduced volume, but immediate cell swelling {{was caused by}} 10 (- 6) M guinea pig CS. In Na(+) -free N-methyl-D-glucamine-containing medium 10 (- 9) M guinea pig CS accelerated the initial rate of shrinkage compared with cells in N-methyl-D-glucamine-containing medium alone as well as causing greater cell shrinkage. Guinea pig CS-stimulated cell shrinkage was prevented by a Ca 2 (+) -channel blocker [...] 5 microM nifedipine, by chelation of extracellular Ca 2 + with 100 microM EGTA, or by omega-conotoxin (10 (- 9) M). The Ca 2 + ionophore A 23187 (2. 5 microM) reduced volume when added to <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> in N-methyl-D-glucamine-containing medium; this action was prevented by EGTA, or quinine [...] an inhibitor of K+ conductance, or 9 -anthracenecarboxylic acid [...] a Cl- channel blocker, suggesting that the volume reduction occurred because K+ and Cl- conductances were activated. Guinea pig CS-stimulated volume reduction was also prevented by 100 microM quinine or 9 -anthracenecarboxylic acid. We conclude that jejunal villus enterocytes possess a Ca 2 (+) -activated Cl- conductance and a K+ conductance that need not be stretch-activated. Corticostatic peptides cause volume reduction in <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> by activating L-type Ca 2 + channels; other defensin-like peptides were without effect...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{mechanism}} by which Shiga toxin alters intes-tinal water and electrolyte transport, ligated loops of rabbit jejunum were incubated in vivo with purified toxin and then studied in vivo by single pass perfusion and in vitro by the Ussing chamber voltage-clamp technique. Toxin exposure led to accumulation {{of water in the}} jejunal lumen, associated with decreased active basal NaCi absorption. Glucose- and alanine-stimulated Na absorption were also reduced, while toxin had no effect on either basal short-circuit current or the secretory response to theophylline. These observations suggest that Shiga toxin selectively inhibits NaCl absorption without sig-nificantly altering active anion secretion. To localize the cellu-lar site of toxin action, populations of <b>villus</b> and crypt <b>cells</b> from rabbit jejunum were isolated and studied. <b>Villus</b> <b>cells</b> had a greater content of the glycolipid Shiga toxin receptor, Gb 3, had more toxin binding sites than did crypt cells, and were much more sensitive than crypt cells to toxin-induced inhibi-tion of protein synthesis. These experiments demonstrate that purified Shiga toxin inhibits jejunal fluid absorption. without affecting active fluid secretion by a preferential effect on <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> The results suggest that {{this is due to the}} differ-ential distribution of toxin receptors on villus compared to crypt cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{proximal}} {{small intestine}} responds to starvation by rapidly reducing crypt cell proliferation rate and villus cellularity and to resumption of food intake (refeeding) by abruptly increasing proliferation {{and the number of}} <b>villus</b> epithelial <b>cells.</b> We show that villus cellularity responds to starvation and refeeding similarly in young and aging animals. However, as compared to young animals, senescent rats showed increased basal DNA synthetic activity, starvation resulted in a smaller decrease in DNA labeling of crypt cells, and refeeding produced an abrupt broadening of the proliferative zone in older animals without concomitant increased numbers of <b>villus</b> <b>cells.</b> Such altered crypt proliferative responses resemble precancerous changes seen in the colon and the aberrant proliferation found in both small and large intestine after administration of the carcinogen dimethylhydrazine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGlutamine {{is a major}} {{nutrient}} utilized by the intestinal epithelium and is primarily assimilated via Na-glutamine co-transport (NGcT) on the brush border membrane (BBM) of enterocytes. Recently we reported that B 0 AT 1 (SLC 6 A 19) mediates glutamine absorption in villus while SN 2 (SLC 38 A 5) does the same in crypt cells. However, how B 0 AT 1 and SN 2 are affected during intestinal inflammation is unknown. In the present study it was shown that during chronic enteritis NGcT was inhibited in villus cells, however, it was stimulated in crypt cells. Our studies also demonstrated that the mechanism of inhibition of NGcT during chronic enteritis was secondary {{to a reduction in}} the number of B 0 AT 1 co-transporters in the <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> BBM without a change in the affinity of the co-transporter. In contrast, stimulation of NGcT in crypt cells was secondary to an increase in the affinity of SN 2 for glutamine without an alteration in the number of co-transporters. Thus, glutamine assimilation which occurs via distinct transporters in crypt and villus cells is altered in the chronically inflamed intestine...|$|E

To investigate if SLT- 1 receptors are maturationally regulated in human intestinal cells, we examined the effect of butyrate, a known transcriptional regulator of differentiation genes in many cell types, using cultured colonic cancer-derived epithelial cell lines. Exposure to butyrate increased <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> marker enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, sucrase, and lactase, expression of toxin receptors, and sensitivity to SLT- 1 in villus-like CaCo- 2 A and HT- 29 cells. These effects were reversibly inhibited by preincubation of CaCo- 2 A cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Butyrate-treated CaCo- 2 A cells unable to bind fluoresceinated SLT- 1 B subunit were undifferentiated as assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity. HT- 29 cells induced to differentiate by another signal, glucose deprivation, upregulated receptor content and response to toxin. Crypt-like T- 84 cells responded to butyrate with a modest increase in alkaline phosphatase and toxin binding, but no induction of sucrase or lactase, and no change in sensitivity to toxin. The results demonstrate that expression of SLT- 1 toxin receptors and toxin sensitivity are coregulated with cellular differentiation in cultured intestinal cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} {{integrity of}} the intestinal epithelial barrier relies on tight coordination of cell proliferation and migration, with failure to regulate these processes resulting in disease. It is not known whether cell proliferation is sufficient to drive epithelial cell migration during homoeostatic turnover of the epithelium. Nor is it known precisely how <b>villus</b> <b>cell</b> migration is affected when proliferation is perturbed. Some reports suggest that proliferation and migration may not be related while other studies support a direct relationship. We use established cell tracking methods based on thymine analogue cell labelling and develop tailored mathematical models to quantify cell proliferation and migration under normal conditions, when proliferation is reduced, {{and when it is}} temporarily halted. We find that epithelial cell migration velocities along the villi are coupled to cell proliferation rates within the crypts in all conditions. Furthermore, halting and resuming proliferation results in the synchronized response of cell migration on the villi. We conclude that cell proliferation within the crypt is the primary force that drives cell migration along the villus. This methodology can be applied to interrogate intestinal epithelial dynamics and characterise situations in which processes involved in cell turnover become uncoupled, including pharmacological treatments and disease models...|$|E

Weaning stress commonly results in a decrease in villus height and intestinal dysfunction in piglets. However, no study have been conducted to test the effects of weaning on the physiology and functions of upper <b>villus</b> epithelial <b>cells.</b> A total of 40 piglets from 8 litters were weaned at 14 days of age and one piglet from each litter was killed at 0 d (w 0 d), 1 d (w 1 d), 3 d (w 3 d), 5 d (w 5 d), and 7 d (w 7 d) after weaning, respectively. The upper <b>villus</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> in mid-jejunum were isolated using the distended intestinal sac method. The expression of proteins in upper <b>villus</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> was analyzed using the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification or Western blotting. The expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism, Golgi vesicle transport, protein amino acid glycosylation, secretion by cell, transmembrane transport, ion transport, nucleotide catabolic process, translational initiation, and epithelial cell differentiation and apoptosis, was mainly reduced during the post-weaning period, and these processes may be regulated by mTOR signaling pathway. These results indicated that weaning inhibited various cellular processes in jejunal upper <b>villus</b> epithelial <b>cells,</b> and provided potential new directions for exploring the effects of weaning on the functions of intestine and improving intestinal functions in weaning piglets...|$|R

Immunofluorescence microscopy on unfixed snap-frozen sections of ileum and jejunum from untreated rats or dogs showed HMG-CoA reductase in the absorptive <b>villus</b> epithelial <b>cells</b> and this appeared to be strikingly localized in their apical cyto-plasm. This pattern of HMG-CoA reductase staining approximated a gradient along the villus-crypt axis with the distal villi labeling most intensely. Treatment of rats with mevinolin and/or cholestyramine for 12 days induced a 5 - to 11 -fold increase in ileal HMG-CoA reductase activity, and yielded a higher intensity of immunostaining with-out altering the pattern of enzyme distribution observed in control intestines. Also, rats with maximal induction of ileal HMG-CoA reductase exhibited a twofold {{increase in the number}} of epithelial <b>villus</b> <b>cells</b> containing prominent stacks of smooth-sur-faced membranes in their apical cytoplasm as seen with electron microscopy.
