40|$|In view of {{the serious}} traffic {{congestion}} during peak hours in most metropolitan areas {{around the world and}} recent improvement of information technology, there is a growing aspiration to alleviate road congestion by applications of electronic information and communication technology. Providing drivers with dynamic travel time information such as estimated journey times on major routes should help drivers to select better routes and guide them to utilise existing expressway network. This can be regarded as one possible strategy for effective traffic management. This paper aims to investigate the effects and benefits of providing dynamic travel time information to drivers via <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>signs</b> at the expressway network. In order to assess the effects of the dynamic driver information system with making use of the <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>signs,</b> a time-dependent traffic assignment model is proposed.

50|$|Overhead {{variable}} message {{signs are}} today available in three form factors: front access, rear access, and walk-in. In a front access <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign,</b> maintenance is performed by lifting the sign open from the front. Most smaller VMS are of the front access form factor, and are typically installed today on major arterials. The rear access form factor {{is similar to the}} front access form factor, except that maintenance is performed {{from the rear of the}} sign, and are commonly used for medium-sized dynamic message signs installed along the roadside of freeways (instead of overhead). The walk-in form factor is a more recent introduction, where maintenance on the sign is performed from the inside of the sign. A key advantage of the walk-in form factor is that lane closures are generally not required to perform maintenance on the sign. Most of the largest VMS units installed today are walk-in units, and are typically installed overhead on freeways.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} both radio traffic {{information}} and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information on route choice behaviour. The empirical analysis {{is based on an}} extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information. The results confirm earlier findings that women {{are less likely to be}} influenced by traffic information. New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio traffic information are positively related to route choice adaptations based on <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic traffic information. As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips. Another important new finding is that the results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the use of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> information. ...|$|E

40|$|Researches {{indicate}} that foggy weather {{is one of}} the most critical factors that restrict human&# 39;s traffic activities and cause traffic accidents. It will reduce the visibility of traffic message board, which could cause the insecurity of transportation. Commonly, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used as light source for <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign,</b> which could not be seen clearly in the foggy low visibility condition. A high-brightness light source which could be used for variable information board was firstly put forward in this paper. And a new type of <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> used in low visibility condition was also introduced. Besides, the attenuation characteristics of laser diode (LD) and light-emitting diode (LED) were analyzed respectively. Calculation and simulation show that the attenuation of red light source is fastest, and the yellow LED light has the better transmittance property. In the experiment, LDs were used to make variable message board for verifying image definition. A 16 ∗ 16 array structure composed of LDs was designed and could display Chinese characters. By comparing the display effect of LDs and LEDs driven with same power, they were placed in fog chamber of the visibility less than 5 meters. And experiment results show that the penetrability of red LD light is better than that of red LED. So traffic <b>variable</b> <b>message</b> <b>sign</b> based on LDs could improve the image definition and the information could be seen more clearly in the foggy weather. In addition to the high-brightness, good coherence, good direction, experimental results show that traffic variable message board based on LD has better visual effect in low visibility condition. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.
