40|$|AbstractA fall cone test (FCT) {{was carried}} out to obtain the {{undrained}} shear strength (su), and to measure the sensitivity (St) of intact and remolded samples from several sites in Japan. The value of su from FCT was compared {{with half of the}} unconfined compression strength (qu/ 2), which is a standard way to evaluate su for practical design in Japan. It is found that su from FCT is neither related with qu/ 2 nor used directly as a design value. St was also obtained by field and laboratory vane tests. A comparison study revealed that St by FCT is as much as 10 times larger than that by the field vane. The large difference in St measured by different testing methods can be attributed to remolding methods. That is, the remold condition for FCT was created by kneading the sample in a plastic bag by hand, while in the field vane, the ground was remolded by 30 turns of the <b>vane</b> <b>blade.</b> This indicates that the degree of the reduction in strength caused {{by the turn of the}} <b>vane</b> <b>blade</b> is less significant than that caused by remolding by kneading...|$|E

Previous measurements taken in the MIT blowdown turbine facility have shown that nozzle guide vane cooling brings about {{an increase in the}} rotor pressure side heat transfer. A computational code (UNSFLO) was used to isolate the cause of the increased heat transfer on the rotor pressure surface. Two versions of UNSFLO were used so that the relative importance of nozzle guide vane wake temperature versus coolant mass addition on the heat transfer to the rotor could be investigated. The first version of the code did not include mass addition, with the decreased temperature of the wake being simulated by lowering the nozzle guide <b>vane</b> <b>blade</b> temperature. The second version of the code allowed coolant mass addition at the location of the coolant slots on the nozzle guide vane.

This configuration is analysed in a rotating configuration aiming increasing turbulence on the ribbed surface (i. e. destabilizing configuration).

Such configuration mimics the flow in internal cooling channels in the high pressure (HP) rotor and <b>vane</b> <b>blade.</b> The bottom walls are uniformly heated, except the rib walls. The turbulent flow field is modelled by the elliptic-relaxation-type k- ε-ζ-f model. This model was modified by the authors, to take in account the turbulence anisotropy derived by the Coriolis force through the sensitizing of turbulent viscosity to angular velocity vector. Results demonstrate heat transfer enhancement due to the rib induced secondary flows. The ribs cause an increase of turbulence, thus increasing heat transfer. In addition to it, rotation promotes turbulence close to the heated wall. Consequently, the heat transfer is found to be higher in the rotating case than in a non-rotating case.

With an increasing consciousness toward these factors during the design of combustors, research led development and improvement of every single aspect of the combustor design needs to be considered in this modern era of aerospace technology.

In the current study, the effect of modification to a swirler’s <b>vane</b> <b>blade</b> angle on mixing effectiveness and combustion stability is investigated, using flow properties such as turbulent kinetic energy, fuel dis- tribution and pressure losses as a measure of combustor performance. The study takes a sensitivity analysis approach and makes use of an existing combustor design that acts as a benchmark for verification of results. A cold flow computational fluid dynamics anal- ysis is used to test the effect of blade angle modifications based on a ‘cause and effect’ methodology. The computational fluid dynamics model is validated against experimental data from a similar combustor. It was found that optimal fuel/air mixing occured in a 70 ? blade angle swirler however large pressure losses and excessive vortex shedding directly behind the center body indicated a strong likelihood of combustion instability. Good fuel atomisation through strong shear layers and excellent pressure recovery seen in a 30 ? blade angle swirler was accompanied by poor fuel/air mixing.

40|$|This Masters Thesis {{describes}} {{the continuation of}} the Snow Probe development. The focus of this project was to establish the rotational shear vane as a useful tool in avalanche safety work as well as develop a robust method for measuring the applied torque. A new and novel way of measuring the torque on a rotational shear vane has been developed to illustrate its effectiveness. The new system measures the power supplied to a cordless drill to get an indication of the applied torque. This was done because {{it was found that the}} earlier method of using a strain gauge/cantilever system repeatedly failed to work, largely due to complexity. The snow probe in its present embodiment has been shown to provide a good clear indication of the snow profile under easily repeated circumstances. Shear strength results are at this stage not sufficiently for reliable quantitative results. However the probe in its present form is able to give pictorial impressions of the snow pack that compare well to current hand hardness profiles derived from snow pit methods. Even in its current form the snow probe is able to collect useful snow profile data in a matter of minutes, much quicker than conventional snow pit methods. A loose relationship was found to exist between the approach angle of a shear <b>vane</b> <b>blade</b> and the clarity of the snow profile. These relationships are relatively inaccurate at present due to lack of rotational velocity data and therefore pproach angle data. It is believed that the addition of a rotation counter would greatly increase the accuracy of the probe results and enable a shear strength profile to be quantified. Further developments and testing are underway with a view to forming a company around the snow probe...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collaboration}} between Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery(SIT) and Royal Institute of Technology(KTH). It is aimed to study and compare the outputs of two different computational approaches in axial gas turbine design procedure with the data obtained from experimental work on a test turbine. The main focus during this research is to extend the available test databank and to further understand and investigate the turbine stage efficiency, mass flow parameters and reaction degree under different working conditions. Meanwhile the concept and effect of different loss mechanisms and models will be briefly studied.  The experimental part was performed at Heat and Power  Technology department on a single stage test turbine in its full admission mode. Three different pressure ratios were tested. For the medium pressure ratio a constant temperature anemometry (CTA) method was deployed in two cases, with and without turbulence grid, {{to determine the effect}} of free-stream turbulence intensity on the investigated parameters. During the test campaign the raw gathered data was processed with online tools and also they served as boundary condition for the computational codes later.  The computational scope includes a one-dimensional design approach known as mean-line calculation and also a two-dimensional method known as throughflow calculation. An in-house SIT software, CATO, generated the stage geometry (<b>vane,</b> <b>blade</b> and the channel) and then two other internal computational codes, MAC 1 and BETA 2, were employed for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional computations respectively. It was observed that to obtain more accurate mass flow predictions a certain level of channel blockage should be implemented to represent the boundary layer development and secondary flow which is typically around 2 %. The codes are also equipped with two options to predict the friction loss: One is a more empirical correlation named as the Old approach in SIT manuals and the other works based on allocation of boundary layer transition point, named as BL in the present thesis. Simulations were done by use of both approaches {{and it turned out that}} the latter works more accurately if it is provided with appropriate transition point and blockage estimation.  The measured data also suggests the idea that the transition point of the vane and blade is not affected by a change in turbulence intensity at least up to 6 % in the tested Reynolds numbers,. Amongst different solutions the one which used BL approach and constant transition point (while the turbulence intensity changed) managed to predict this behavior.

40|$|A {{computer}} {{program has been}} developed for predicting design point specific speed-efficiency characteristics of centrifugal compressors. Compressor efficiency {{has been shown to}} be a function of specific speed. Specific speed is a characteristic that relates compressor inlet volume flow rate, rotation speed, and ideal enthalpy rise. Generally, high efficiencies are associated with high specific speeds, and low efficiencies are associated with low specific speeds. Compressor design point geometries that produce maximum attainable efficiency are also functions of specific speed. Knowing the variation in optimum design point geometric variables with specific speed permits rapid selection of high efficiency configurations. This {{computer program}} uses a one-dimensional mean streamline analysis conducted at fixed stagnation conditions. Seven specific losses are calculated for each set of compressor geometric variables and inlet velocity diagram characteristics studied. These are inlet guide <b>vane,</b> <b>blade</b> loading, skin friction, disk friction, recirculation, vaneless diffuser, and vaned diffuser losses. Each of these individual losses is expressed as a decrement in compressor total efficiency. The effect of these losses is then related to overall compressor performance and specific speed. By examining the program output, the user can select values of inducer hub-tip diameter ratio, inducer tip-exit diameter ratio, impeller blade exit backsweep, impeller exit blade height-diameter ratio, and impeller exit absolute flow angle that will result in maximum total efficiency for the chosen application. For given inlet stagnation conditions, the user can generate efficiency, pressure ratio, specific speed, and relative loss distribution data corresponding to various combinations of impeller inlet velocity diagram characteristics and impeller overall geometries. By examining the output data, a compressor geometry can be chosen which will yield maximum efficiency under the constraints imposed. The following categories are used as input information: (1) compressor geometry, (2) thermodynamic properties of the working fluid, (3) velocity diagram characteristics, and (4) iteration limits. The prewhirl used in this analysis is solid-body vortex. For iterations on inducer tip absolute critical velocity ratio, the inducer tip speed is adjusted to preserve inlet velocity triangle similarity with that determined by the first pair of input inducer tip speed and inducer tip absolute critical velocity ratio. That is, the absolute and relative flow angles are held constant for successive iterations. For each iteration, the following output information is tabulated: compressor geometry, velocity diagram characteristics, and compressor performance characteristics. The program can be used for working fluids other than air (which approximates ideal gas behavior) since the thermodynamic properties needed for the equations solved in the program are specified inputs. If a working fluid other than air is used in the analysis, an empirical equation expressing the dynamic viscosity as a function of temperature must be substituted.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to measure the aerodynamic performance of a film-cooled turbine stage and to quantify the loss caused by film-cooling. A secondary goal of the research is to provide a detailed breakdown of the losses associated with film-cooling for the turbine stage being tested. The experimental work was carried out at the MIT Blowdown Turbine Facility using a highly loaded turbine stage. The Blowdown Turbine Facility is a short duration test facility capable of testing turbine stages under fully scaled conditions for a test duration of 0. 5 seconds. The facility was modified to enable the measurement of the turbine mass flow and shaft torque. These newly developed measurement techniques, along with previously developed total pressure and temperature instruments, have enabled the measure- ment of the stage isentropic efficiency. A highly loaded turbine stage (without film-cooling) was designed, fabricated, and tested using the newly developed measurement techniques. The turbine stage was then modified to incorporate <b>vane,</b> <b>blade</b> and rotor casing coolant manifolds using precision electrical discharge machining. The film-cooling hole geometry was created using a laser drilling process to produce the required 43, 000 cooling holes. The film-cooled stage was then tested over a range of operating conditions (pressure ratios and corrected speeds) and over a range of coolant-to-mainstream mass flow and temperature ratios. (cont.) The loss due to film-cooling is defined as the difference in performance between the film-cooled turbine and an ideal turbine with the same velocity triangles and airfoil Mach number distributions. However, there is no uncooled turbine geometry that will produce the same flow conditions as the film-cooled turbine stage, and consequently, there is no experimental baseline that can be tested to determine the loss due to film- cooling. A meanline velocity triangle model of the turbine stage was developed using published correlations and loss models to estimate the performance of this ideal stage. The model was calibrated against the baseline test results without coolant and it was then used to estimate the loss due to film-cooling. The estimated loss due to film-cooling was 3. 0 % at the design point, which corresponds to 0. 3 % per percent of coolant. The estimated repeatability (U 95) for the efficiency measurement of the uncooled tur- bine geometry is ± 0. 14 %. Based on this measurement repeatability, the net effect of a design change can be determined with an uncertainty of just ± 0. 1 % if four measurements are repeated for each design configuration. The estimated measurement uncertainty for the film-cooled stage efficiency is 0. 55 % and for back-to-back measurements the uncertainty is 0. 45 %. by Rory Keogh. "February 2001.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} {{investigation of the}} shock-IGV (inlet guide vane) interaction in a transonic compressor is conducted at the Laboratoire de Thermique Appliquée et de Turbomachines (LTT) at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The objective of the presented research work {{is to determine the}} impact of the upstream propagating shock pattern of an axial transonic compressor rotor on an aerodynamically loaded IGV and the influence of this interacting process on the compressor flow field for different operating points and aerodynamic setups. For the approach to the subject, a literature review shed light on the different research efforts over the past years. A large numerical study is conducted including the work with two different flow solvers. A numerical 3 D transient analysis (commercial code) was conducted in order to provide information about the influence of the axial spacing on the overall mass flow through the stage. A numerical Q- 3 D transient analysis (industry owned code) on one streamline at a constant rotor inlet Mach number is performed in order to compare the shock-IGV interaction for different vane types similar to what is known in literature. A semi-analytical model was developed in order to evaluate in a fast approach the impact of a rotor bow shock on an upstream situated vane. The results of the numerical investigation can be summarized as following: The overall results of this investigation show that the upstream vane of a transonic compressor rotor transforms the rotor forcing function into an excitation with vane shape depending orientation and force. The time averaged flow field of the IGV does not show a measurable change of the exit flow angle due to the shock-IGV interaction for the studied operating points and axial distances. The 3 D transient calculations do not show any influence of the examined axial spacing between vane and blade on the mass flow rate through the stage. The results of the Q 3 D analysis are compared with the semi-analytic approach and the measurements, both showing with some restrictions good accordance to the model. The results of the numerical investigation give an accurate prediction of the transient aerodynamic load of the upstream vane. An analytic tool was developed which uses three input parameters, the rotor relative inlet Mach number, the stagger angle of the rotor and the axial spacing between vane and rotor in order to provide an estimation of the amplitude of the pressure variation on the upstream situated vane. An extensive modification of the existing test facility of the LTT precedes the experimental study. The main steps of the approach are: A subsonic axial compressor test facility was modified to allow test runs at transonic rotor inlet conditions. A perfect leak tightness of the closed circuit was accomplished to enable its operation in heavy gas. Heavy gases like refrigerants have been used in many studies for compressor testing. While respecting certain restrictions during the use of heavy gas, a reduction of operation and manufacturing costs of the facility is beneficial. A high molecular weight of the gas reduces the sonic speed to the half of that of air thus reducing the dimension and the rotational speed of the rotor significantly and consequently reduces the demand in the material quality of the blading. A 1. 5 stage transonic compressor had been designed and manufactured for the heavy gas (R 134 a) in a first step. Preliminary measurements showed that the influence of the downstream stator makes it difficult to separate the influence of shock-IGV interaction on the compressor flow field from loss generation mechanisms downstream of the rotor. Thus, the stator was removed and measurements were conducted in a one stage transonic compressor. Modifications on the construction of the testing setup are done {{in a way that the}} distance between IGV and rotor can be varied by means of spacers. Thus the flow can be determined for up to four different axial distances at varying rotational speed for different operating points. For transonic operation the time-dependent load of the IGV (inlet guide vane) due to the forcing function of the rotor bow shock was recorded with a high speed data acquisition system. The results of the experimental investigation can be summarized as following: No influence of the axial spacing on the efficiency and the mass flow was observed in the investigation. The operation characteristics remained equal between the minimum and the maximum vane-blade spacing. The measured global values of the stage are close to the values the design was made for, although the overall efficiency was generally lower than predicted. The experimental results of the pressure variation on the upstream vane agree well with the predicted values. The study in general showed a good matching between the numerical and the experimental investigation taking into account a rotor blade shape which is not optimized to the extend. The shock-vane interaction is responsible for an excitation of the entire <b>vane</b> <b>blade.</b> With decreasing distance between the rotor leading edge and vane trailing edge the excitation increases. The strength and orientation of the reflected shock/pressure wave part depends upon the vane shape. A more sophisticated design of the rotor blade shape should be in the focus of further investigations using this test facility at transonic rotor inlet conditions. Within this investigation a tool was developed in order to predict the load variation on the vane driven by the transient rotor forcing function. The tool maps the fact that the pressure on the vane surface oriented against rotational direction of the rotor exceeds the pressure of the passage shock due to the amplification effect of the reflection of the shock on a surface. Its possible application not only for compressors but also for turbine related topics should be an objective for similar investigations...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a combined experimental and computational research program to investigate turbine <b>vane</b> and <b>blade</b> material surface deterioration caused by solid particle impacts. Tests are conducted in the erosion wind tunnel for coated and uncoated blade materials at various impact conditions. Surface roughness measurements obtained prior and subsequent to the erosion tests are used to characterize the change in roughness caused by erosion. Numerical simulations for the three dimensional flow field and particle trajectories through a low pressure gas turbine are employed to determine the particle impact conditions with stator <b>vanes</b> and rotor <b>blades</b> using experimentally-based particle restitution models. Experimental results are presented for the measured blade material/coating erosion and surface roughness. The measurements indicate that both erosion and surface roughness increase with impact angle and particle size. Computational results are presented for the particle trajectories though the first stage of a low-pressure turbine of a high bypass turbofan engine. The trajectories indicate that the particles impact the vane pressure surface and the aft part of the suction surface. The impacts reduce the particle momentum through the stator but increase it through the rotor. <b>Vane</b> and <b>blade</b> surface erosion patterns are predicted based on the computed trajectories and the experimentally measured blade coating erosion characteristics...|$|R
