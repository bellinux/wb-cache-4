40|$|This book, {{the first}} study of <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax</b> to address the entire Greek Pentateuch, investigates {{the value of these}} {{translations}} as evidence for the history of the Greek language. The nature and degree of Hebrew interference are assessed, including analysis of Hebrew text components underlying all Greek verbal forms in the Pentateuch. This data allows new conclusions to be drawn on natural Greek usage of aspect, tense, and mood. Their implications extend well beyond the special issues of translation Greek, casting significant light {{on the development of the}} verbal system in the Koine period, the period in which a non-dialectic form of the Greek language was used, post-Alexander the Great...|$|E

The article explores parallel typological developments between West Semitic and early Indo-European as pertains {{to the creation of}} verbal forms by means of adding an “augment” or temporalizing particle to otherwise Aktionsart- or aspect-based morphological constructs. A typological comparison between the consecutive wāw and the Indo-European augment is used to highlight some of the factors which might {{have been involved in the}} genesis of the consecutive forms, as well as to illustrate some of the typological similarities in <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax</b> in the two phyla...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I propose an {{analysis}} of Persian complex predicates, based on the First Phase <b>Verbal</b> <b>syntax</b> developed by Ramchand (2008). I suggest that the light verbs lexicalize the subevent heads into which the verbal phrase is decomposed, while the preverbal element occupies the Rheme position and semantically unifies with the light verb to build one joint predication. Further, I propose a feature specification {{for some of the}} most productive light verbs. I argue that the light verb is responsible for the argument structure of the entire predicate (in line with Megerdoomian 2002 b, Folli et al. 2005), while the aspectual properties of the complex predicate depend on the interaction between the preverb and the light verb...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Progress in {{molecular}} biology has revealed profound relations between linguistic and genomic sciences, mainly through advances in bioinformatics. The structural symmetries between biochemical and <b>verbal</b> <b>syntaxes</b> {{raise the question}} of their origins: did they emerge independently, or did one arise from the other? Does the genetic code contain the traces of a protolanguage, a universal grammar whose gradual evolution and successive mutations progressively led to the polymorphism of natural languages? To explore this question, we review the isomorphism of the genetic code and verbal codes from lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic standpoints. We discuss the limits of these symmetries and their anthropomorphic connotations. We observe the gradual evolution of species and languages according to parallel mechanisms, and the genetic roots of the physiology of language. In conclusion, we hypothesize that human observers may not be projecting linguistic frameworks onto genomic structures. Rather, it could be their linguistic faculties that reflect the grammatical structure of genetic code...|$|R

40|$|This is a {{quantitative}} {{study of the}} effects of inter-generational contact between a majority language (Spanish) and a heritage language (Veneto). Specifically, we are studying the effects of the Spanish <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax,</b> referred to as a syntactic frame, on the syntactic frame of Veneto verbs. Data was gathered from a total of 69 participants, 35 older speakers and 34 younger speakers, through translation activities. The results were then codified and analyzed in two separate analyses studying variation across speakers and the degree of cross-linguistic influence (CLI) according to age groups. Variation among speakers is ubiquitous {{and at the same time}} demonstrates subtle patterns of language maintenance, shift, and loss at the lexical level. T-tests demonstrate that the differences in the degree of CLI of both groups is statistically different and that older speakers maintain a more classical version of Veneto lexicon whereas the younger speakers produce a variety of Veneto with higher rates of lexical and frame borrowing from Spanish. The implications of this study include providing evidence that the cognitive processes of progressive language attrition are parallel to cognitive processes present among second language learners (parasitism in L 2 learning), but in opposite directions...|$|E
40|$|Ancient Indo-European <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax,</b> as attested {{in early}} Vedic Sanskrit, {{exhibits}} numerous {{examples of the}} labile syntactic pattern: several verbal forms can show valence alternation with no formal change in the verb; cf. pres. svadate 'he makes sweet' / 'he is sweet'; perf. vavrdhuH ~ 'they have grown' (intr.) / 'they have increased' (tr.). It is argued that the labile patterning of the Vedic verb, however common it may appear, is mostly of a secondary character. There are {{a limited number of}} reasons which give rise to labile syntax: (i) the polyfunctionality of the middle inflection (which can be used to mark the anticausative, passive and reflexive functions, on the one hand, and the self-beneficent meaning of the transitive forms, on the other); (ii) the homonymy of some middle participles "shared" by passive (medio-passive aorist, stative) and nonpassive formations; (iii) the syntactic reanalysis of intransitive constructions with the accusative of parameter/scope (content accusative) as transitive-causative. As to the perfect, it could probably be employed both intransitively and transitively already in Proto-Indo-European, although the intransitive usages were prevalent. In the historical period the newly-built perfect middle forms have largely taken over the intransitive function, but active perfects are still quite common in the (more archaic) intransitive usages in early Vedic...|$|E

Here I assume a model like Chomsky (1986) in order to explain the interaction between the Complementizer Phrase (as a mood marker) and the Inflection Phrase (both a morphological device and the head of the sentence). The starting point is represented by the work of T. Stowell (1981). I include also, finally, some comments on the kind of regularities we can find in the Inflection Phrase of Romance languages. </span...|$|R
40|$|Speech is {{the vocal}} conduct of sense-making {{processes}} that involve both an external receiver (the hearer) {{and the speaker}} envisaged as an internal receiver: to speak is to cause one(self) to experience the emergence of organized thinking formatted by <b>verbal</b> patterns. <b>Syntax</b> {{is defined as a}} series of operational templates to be coupled with lexical selections to form phrases, following language-specific ritual syntactic agendas such as the subjet-predicate pair. However it is possible to decide at any moment of the execution of this process to go on following the structural beaten track or to open up new ones in the form of adverbials, subordinate clauses, insertions and so on. In this respect, prosody plays a metasyntactic role: prosodic events are the signature of metasyntactic decisions in real time and they "inform" both the interpreting hearer and the speaker himself, who realies on the symptoms of his own action {{to keep track of the}} ongoing developments. Prosody plays an ambiguous role that is both semiotic (forming a conventional sign system) and symptomatic (the corporal manifestation of psychological events of subjective, intersubjective and metasyntactic nature), which makes it possible to sketch an integrated model of the role and effects of prosody in spontaneous speech...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} transitivity {{plays a major}} role in the grammar of the indoeuropean languages. Its {{influence}} can be exerted beyond the <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax</b> and affect also the grammar of sentence. In the history of Spanish and other Romance languages, the transitive sentence, as a complex unit, was grammaticalized. As a result, it became a construction, in the sense that this term has in the work of Croft (2001) and Goldberg (2006). The main effect of this process is that the transitive construction was linked with a specific semantic prototype. On the other hand, the consolidation of the transitive construction was the cause that other sentence frames with opposite meaning ended up grammaticalized and gave rise to the birth of new constructions. This was just the case of the impersonal construction, which was integrated into a semantic associative network of constructions in the Romance languages. The purpose of this research is to address the history of these impersonal constructions that were possible in Old Spanish (and also in the early stages of some Indo-European languages) but tended to be replaced by new constructions with subject, that emerged under the growing influence of the grammaticalized transitive construction. These impersonal constructions, that were possible within a specific group of stative verbs, wer...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{constitutes}} {{a report of}} research in progress. Its results are tentative, in that I am still looking for confirmatory evidence, but {{the general direction of}} the research seems justified given the evidence presently available. For a number of years I have operated on the assumption that the Philippine languages (and possibly others, external to the Philippine archipelago) constitute a subfamily within the Malayo-Polynesian, or extra-Formosan languages. Certainly the languages are typologically similar, to the extent that the use of the term 'Philippine-type' is widely accepted as defining a certain kind of <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax.</b> It has been a useful assumption too, in that it has enabled us to reconstruct some features of an early proto-language, to which the label Proto-Philippines has been applied. Clinging to the concept of the Philippines as a subfamily, with each of its languages more closely related to one another than to any language outside the Philippines, has, for me anyway, been a reaction to the completely untenable theory that the different ethnic groups in the Philippines are the result of a series of migrations from the south and the west, a view that was popularised by the late H. Otley Beyer (1948) and which is still taught as fact in Philippine schools today. It is a theory, however, which has never been substantiated by any evidence, linguistic or archaeological...|$|E
40|$|The {{decision}} by American Presidents {{to use military}} force is a decision that is not taken lightly nor whimsically. This study attempted to determine whether any personal or psychological characteristics influence the President’s decision {{to use military force}} or to refrain from using military force. While other factors could influence the President’s decision, I believed that individual factors including personal and psychological characteristics would be able to most effectively explain the use of military force. Uses of military force were collected from a Congressional Research Service report listing all uses of military force from 1798 to 2015. The uses of force by each President were then cross-tabulated with the individual factors I was investigating. Based on the previous findings by Michael C. Horowitz, Allan C. Stam, and Cali M. Ellis that showed correlation between a leader’s personal experiences and the use of military force, I hypothesized that there would be similar findings among American Presidents. The results show that individual factors and personal characteristics may give little indication or its effects are overstated as to whether a President is more prone to use military force or less prone to use military force. Many of the results contradict existing literature, but due to the small sample size of American presidencies the results may not be truly representative. At best, it can be inferred that American Presidents aren’t as significantly affected by individual factors and personal characteristics compared to other world leaders and that other factors of explanation hold equal importance. Future research areas that may merit investigation include Presidential <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax</b> and operational coding...|$|E

Syntactical view - here the issue of choosing the auxiliary verb is observed in compound tenses, the issue of concord and verbal valency.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} acquisition of the passive. The apparent cross-linguistic delay of the verbal passive compared to other constructions suggests children 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge is somehow restricted, leading some to propose the difficulty arises because of syntactic maturation (Wexler 2004, Orfitelli 2012) or because of a heavy reliance on discourse features assigned to arguments (Snyder and Hyams 2008). These hypotheses predict that until relevant mechanisms mature, children will only produce and comprehend a subset of passives (i. e., adjectival), or will only show adult-like performance when felicity conditions are met. Others have suggested children have not overcome the poverty of the stimulus for passives, arguing that frequency of passive in the input determines the timing of acquisition (Kline and Demuth 2010). The prediction of this account is that passive production and comprehension will vary cross-linguistically {{as a function of}} the primary linguistic data. ^ I argue against both the maturation and frequency accounts with data from English and Sesotho. In the Sesotho study, I show that 4 - 6 year old Sesotho-speaking children perform adult-like on certain types of unambiguously verbal passives. Furthermore, I show that Sesotho-speaking children perform no better on any type of passive than their English-speaking counterparts, although the frequency of passives in Sesotho child directed speech is ten times greater than in English. ^ The English study, a targeted grammaticality judgment task where felicity conditions are met, shows that 4 - 6 year-old English-speaking children accept passives with purpose phrases as grammatical, indicating they have <b>verbal</b> passive <b>syntax.</b> This result further provides evidence against frequency as the main source of passive acquisition delay, since passives are less than 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{constitutes}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the verbal morphology and syntax of the Maskilic Hebrew prose fiction written in Eastern Europe between 1857 and 1881. It is based on an extensive corpus of short stories and novels by prominent authors such as Peretz Smolenskin, Yehudah Leib Gordon, Abraham Mapu, and Shalom Jacob Abramowitz. The chief findings are that, although the maskilic authors expressly attempted to utilise only Biblical Hebrew, their Writing exhibits considerable influence from Rabbinic Hebrew, traces of Medieval Hebrew, certain resemblances to their native Yiddish, and similarities with Israeli Hebrew, as well as numerous innovative features and unprecedented uses of biblical and rabbinic forms. The authors' deviation from biblical norms may occasionally serve conscious semantic purposes such as the representation of vernacular speech; however, it often appears to be unintentional. These characteristics appear regularly throughout the corpus, making the maskilic verbal system a reasonably homogeneous entity that can be considered independent from other forms of Hebrew. The first section of the thesis offers a selective examination of maskilic verbal morphology, which is composed of biblical features including the 2 fp and 3 fp yiqtol forms, rabbinic elements such as the nitpa'el and masculine plural qotel ending in nun, paytanic forms including the 3 ms object suffix ה -in conjunction with the infinitive construct, and biblical/rabbinic forms such as yiqtolu used in original contexts. The second section {{constitutes a}} thorough analysis of the functions of the maskilic qatal, yiqtol, qotel, periphrastic constructions, wayyiqtol, weqatal, cohortative, imperative, jussive, infinitive absolute, and infinitive construct.

In particular, this paper aims to ascertain the followings: (a) There is a hierarchy {{of the degree of}} JQ nominalization according to grammatical functions in sentences. That is, the degree of nominalization decreases in the following order: nominal argument > noun modifying phrase/clause > predicate of the main clause. (b) Even the nominal argument in the highest hierarchy exhibits limited case marking and thus does not obtain the same morphological and syntactic properties as a prototypical noun. (c) Predicative JQ in the lowest hierarchy of the degree of nominalization obtains certain <b>verbal</b> meaning and <b>syntax</b> in the following phenomena: i) Similar to a finite verb, it takes a nominal argument, that is, transitive subject, in the absolutive case. ii) Similar to a finite verb, it takes oblique cases and adverbs. iii) It obtains a modal meaning of obligation. Through the analysis of JQ, this paper also reveals that predicative JQ exhibits both syntactic and semantic similarity to the “noun-concluding sentence” found in a number of languages, including Japanese. This suggests that a cross-linguistic study of noun-concluding sentences is possible not only from those data of languages with syntactic noun-concluding sentences but also from that of some other languages with morphological noun-concluding sentences...|$|R
40|$|In {{less than}} three decades, the concept "cerebellar neurocognition" has evolved from a mere afterthought to an entirely new and {{multifaceted}} area of neuroscientific research. A close interplay between three main strands of contemporary neuroscience induced a substantial modification of the traditional view of the cerebellum as a mere coordinator of autonomic and somatic motor functions. Indeed, the wealth of current evidence derived from detailed neuroanatomical investigations, functional neuroimaging studies with healthy subjects and patients and in-depth neuropsychological assessment of patients with cerebellar disorders shows that the cerebellum has a cardinal {{role to play in}} affective regulation, cognitive processing, and linguistic function. Although considerable {{progress has been made in}} models of cerebellar function, controversy remains regarding the exact role of the "linguistic cerebellum" in a broad variety of nonmotor language processes. This consensus paper brings together a range of different viewpoints and opinions regarding the contribution of the cerebellum to language function. Recent developments and insights in the nonmotor modulatory role of the cerebellum in language and some related disorders will be discussed. The role of the cerebellum in speech and language perception, in motor speech planning including apraxia of speech, in verbal working memory, in phonological and semantic <b>verbal</b> fluency, in <b>syntax</b> processing, in the dynamics of language production, in reading and in writing will be addressed.

40|$|Network {{diagrams}} {{of ecological}} cycles, eg, carbon and nitrogen cycles, {{are a common}} feature in science textbooks for 14 - 18 years age groups. From an information design perspective these diagrams raise a particularly interesting challenge; that of categorising up to six types of biological information using two graphic syntactic roles – nodes and connecting arrows – whilst ensuring an efective and unambiguous message. This practice-led thesis reviews the precision of information categorisation in 209 network diagrams collected from UK and Danish science textbooks (1935 - 2009). Visual content analysis and graphic syntax theory (Engelhardt, 2002) is applied to review the existing information categorisation in relation to four types of graphic inefectiveness: 1) implicit nodes, 2) imprecise relative spatial positioning of graphic objects, 3) polysemy, and 4) inconsistent visual attributes or <b>verbal</b> <b>syntax.</b> This review finds 29 types of ineffective graphic tactics, which may result in ambiguous messages due to illogical linking sequences, implicit circulating elements, and confusion about chemical transfer and transformations. Based on these analysis indings, the design process in educational publishing is investigated. This identifies the rationale informing the transformation of information into network diagrams, based on semi- structured interviews with 19 editors, authors, designers, and illustrators in six publishing houses (3 in UK, 3 in Denmark). The rationale is mapped using phenomenographic analysis method and existing theories on the design process, namely brief development and translation stages (Crilly, 2005), choice points and the problem setting process (Schön, 2006), problem- solution co-evolution (Dorst and Cross, 2001), and design constraints (Lawson, 2006). The curriculum purpose of the ecological cycle network diagram is found to tightly constrain the identiied rationale and the graphic decision-making based mainly on tacit knowledge. In a final discussion the research indings are integrated by identifying models of design activities (Dumas and Mintzberg, 1993) present in investigated professional practice. This reveals how design decisions may inluence the occurrence of inefective graphic tactics. Recommendations for alternative information transformation strategies are then presented, centred on integrating graphic syntax knowledge into the current processes. These recommendations are anchored in suggestions by the interviewed participants...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{characteristics}} of the Argentine writer Juan Jose Saer’s Nadie nada nunca (1980) and how literary perception is explored in this novel. The first part of the thesis deals with Saer’s works in general, and includes a short overview of his novels, his short stories, his poems and his essays, with special emphasis on his theoretical discussions about literature. It also studies the literary context in which Saer’s first novels emerged, and how they have been received by the critics. The second part of the thesis analyzes how literary perception is narrated in Nadie nada nunca, one of Juan Jose Saer’s most theoretical novels. The thesis draws on four different perspectives—narratology, stylistics, thematics and different aspects of temporality—and defines a number of important techniques in order to describe how perception is utilized as a literary method. All four perspectives and analyses of this study consistently demonstrate that fragmentation is indeed a fundamental technique, in terms of the chapters and sentences as well as the characters’ reflections and the description of the surroundings, which serve to create and describe a distinct reality in Saer’s novel. His style is characterized by the emphasis on <b>syntax,</b> <b>verbal</b> forms and the symbolism of the words of the title, as well as his tendency to reflect unknown sides of reality. Along with these specific structures of his literary style, fragmentation tums out to be the technique that best describes the perception of Nadie nada nunca...|$|R

An estimated 70, 000 to 80, 000 Kalingas live in the mountainous Kalinga subprovince of Kalinga Apayo in northern Luzon, Republic of the Philippines. Linimos itself is spoken by about 8, 000 people living in about ten villages along the lower Saltan river in the municipality of Pinokpok. The Grammar comprises an Introduction, followed by {{a survey of the}} basic grammar of the language. This survey includes a chapter on word classes, including the distinction between nouns and verbs, a hazy area in Philippine linguistics. Then the noun phrase is described, with the focus on the complex deictic component of the determiner. The third chapter introduces the structure of the verb, and the focus morphology in particular. The relationship between the focus affixes and transitivity is of particular interest, as a transitivity continuum emerges along the lines of that proposed by Hopper and Thompson (1980). The next major section of the Grammar describes both <b>verbal</b> and non-verbal. <b>syntax,</b> including subject and topic. Areas chosen for closer attention here are topicalization and identification sentences. The most detailed section of the thesis is the final one on Aspect. The perfectivity/imperfectivity distinction is described first, followed by the complex system of reduplication. There are three major types of reduplication, one of which frequently combines with consonant gemination, which produce aspectual distinctions on verbs. The results are significant for the comparative study of Philippine linguistics, as little has been done on the topic of aspect, particularly that indicated by reduplication.

The phonological section comprises an analysis of phonemes, phonotactic properties, prosody and the phonological behaviour of loanwords. Features of special interest include phonemic vowel nasality and peculiar realisations of word-final nasal consonants. Particular emphasis is placed on the morphological system, which involves intricate and diverse processes of affixation, cliticisation and reduplication. Such processes are analysed within the framework of Prosodic and Template Morphology. A fundamental distinction is made between 'inner' and 'outer' affixation. Verbal morphology is particularly complex, involving a range of derivational categories related to e. g. aspect, Aktionsart and nominalisation. Nominal morphology includes a typologically unusual derivational category of unitisation connected to quantification. The section on syntax analyses tentatively the structure of phrases and clauses and addresses problems of agreement and argument structure. The marginal phenomenon of expressive elaboration deviates in several respects from the ordinary linguistic system and therefore receives separate treatment. In several respects, Jahai conforms to the patterns described for most other languages of the Aslian branch of Mon-Khmer. It also exhibits features hitherto undocumented elsewhere among its relatives. A pervasive feature of the Jahai linguistic system is its readiness to incorporate foreign elements, notably from Malay, the Austronesian majority language of the Malay Peninsula...|$|R

Linguistic features can be classified in two main groups: grammatical features and lexical features. Leaving aside {{the analysis of the}} lexicon, in this work we develop an analysis of features of different areas of the grammar: phonology, nominal morphology, <b>verbal</b> morphology, and <b>syntax,</b> which we propose can be analysed separately on the basis of lists features. We will thus be able to measure linguistic distances within each area of the grammar and globally. After proposing a specific list of features, we discuss the following issues: the number of features to be considered, the adequate proportion of differents areas of the grammar. Since lingusitc features are abstract in nature, we also discuss the matching between data and linguistic features. In the last part we consider several proposals for the analysis of the lexicon. Geolinguistikaren ikuspuntutik hizkerak bereizteko eta elkarren artean konparatzeko, eta, ondorioz, hizkuntz distantziak neurtzeko metodologiaren puntu bat aztertzen da artikulu honetan: hizkuntz ezaugarrien hautaketa. Hizkuntz ezaugarriok bi multzo handitan bana daitezke: gramatika eta lexikoa. Artikuluan zehar gramatika ezaugarriak lantzen dira, lexikoa beste ikerketa baterako utziz. Gramatikari lotuz, ezaugarrion aukeraketarako hizkuntzaren arlo desberdinak jorratzen dira: fonologia, izen morfologia, aditz morfologia eta sintaxia. Arlo hauek bereiziz lantzea proposatzen da. Horregatik ezaugarrien zerrenda arloka lantzea proposatzen da. Horrela hizkuntz distantziak neurtzean gramatika arlo bakoitzean hizkeren arteko hizkuntz distantziak ezagutzeko aukera izango da eta ondoren, arlo guztiak bildurik, orokorki aztertzeko. Ezaugarrien zerrenda zehatza aurkeztu ondoan, hauen kopuruaz eta gramatika arlo desberdinen arteko orekaz gogoeta egiten du egileak, arlo desberdinek pisu bera behar ote duten edo arlo desberdinetan ezaugarri kopuru berbera erabili behar den itaunduz. Hizkuntz ezaugarriok izaera abstraktua dutenez, datuekin hornitzeko bidea eta prozedura ere aztergai hartzen da. Azkenik, lexikoa beste ikerketa baterako gaia den arren, garatzeko urrats desberdinak proposatzen dira...|$|R
40|$|After an {{overview}} of Swahili's linguistic situation and a basic description of its nominal morphology, <b>verbal</b> morphology, and <b>syntax,</b> I focus on a description of relative clauses. The two basic relative clause formation strategies (the first utilizing the '-o of Reference' as a verbal infix, and the second involving 'amba-') are examined, along with their use in various semantic contexts. I then examine canonical examples of relative clauses from the literature and from corpora in order to highlight the various constraints and generalizations {{on the use of}} the different relativization strategies. The goal of these discussions is an analysis of the strategy distribution from within the syntactic framework of Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG), which itself receives a brief overview. For the analysis, I lay out the basic phrase structure rules that characterize Swahili syntax from the perspective of LFG. Important questions are the status of the '-o' particle and the word 'amba-'. I argue, contrary to e. g., Barrett-Keach (1980), where amba- is considered to be a verb, that amba- is in fact a relative pronoun appearing in the specifier of CP. This structural configuration triggers the activation of various rules which predict the grammaticality of relative clause word orders. In other words, the difference between verbal infix relatives and amba- relatives is primarily structural; in verbal infix relative constructions, -o is also taken to be a relative pronoun. This analysis is made coherent by claiming that Swahili syntax regularly makes use of resumptive pronouns, e. g., when both amba- and -o are used in a single construction, and this notion is formalized using LFG's 'r-structure' (reference structure). In evaluating the analysis given in this thesis, I point out problems with the data used in the literature to argue for different positions. It is in many cases uncertain whether there is a clear grammaticality judgment, and this opens up the possibility that competing analyses capture the data in non-insightful ways. That being said, this work shows that an analysis of the facts within the framework of LFG is not only possible but also renders the linguistic claims made by the analysis more perspicuous than on other approaches...|$|R
40|$|Análise de relações ordinais nos quais o {{responder}} estaria sob controle de propriedades relacionais do tipo primeiro, segundo, terceiro e assim por diante, a partir do paradigma de equivalência, constitui uma importante forma de compreender o comportamento verbal (sintaxe). Cinco estudos buscaram avaliar a emergência de novas sentenças com três ou quatro palavras (artigos, substantivos, adjetivos ou verbos e advérbios), com base nas posições ocupadas pelas mesmas em cada sentença ensinada independentemente. Participaram do Estudo 1 cinco crianças da pré-escola. Todos os participantes foram submetidos a procedimentos de ensino com três palavras através de emparelhamento de acordo com o modelo, testes de equivalência, treino por encadeamento de respostas, testes de produção de seqüências, conectividade e testes de leitura com compreensão. No Estudo 2, outras cinco crianças do ensino fundamental foram expostas aos mesmos procedimentos de ensino e testes, com quatro palavras. No Estudo 3, quatro crianças eram submetidas ao procedimento por encadeamento, testes de produção de seqüências, conectividade e de leitura com compreensão com quatro palavras. No Estudo 4 outras quatro crianças com história de fracasso escolar foram submetidas ao mesmo procedimento de ensino e testes dos Estudos 1 e 2, com quatro palavras. No Estudo 5 três outras crianças também com história de fracasso escolar foram submetidas ao mesmo procedimento adotado no Estudo 3 com quatro palavras. Os participantes não tinham leitura fluente de frases, mas liam palavras isoladamente. As sessões experimentais ocorreram numa sala da escola freqüentada pelas crianças. Um microcomputador forneceu suporte ao estudo e um software específico exerceu o controle e registro dos dados comportamentais. Utilizaram-se três conjuntos de estímulos: A (desenhos), B (palavras maiúsculas) e C (palavras minúsculas), para ensinar as relações condicionais AB e AC e testes BC/CB. No treino por encadeamento eram usadas três sentenças diferentes. Na primeira tentativa, a palavra UM, por exemplo, era apresentada na área de escolha. Um toque sobre a palavra produzia como conseqüência seu deslocamento para a área de construção na parte superior da tela, uma animação gráfica era apresentada acompanhada de um som muito bem, legal, certo. Em seguida, duas palavras eram apresentadas 10 simultaneamente na tela e o participante deveria tocar em uma delas e depois, na outra. Caso as palavras fossem ordenadas corretamente, a mesma conseqüência anterior era apresentada, e a mesma configuração de palavras era reapresentada em posições diferentes na área de escolha. Caso a resposta fosse diferente da programada pela experimentadora, produzia um escurecimento na tela por 3 s e uma nova configuração de palavras era apresentada, lado a lado na área de escolha. Após o ensino da linha de base, testes de produção de seqüências e de conectividade eram aplicados para verificar a emergência de seis novas sentenças (exceto Estudo 1), a partir da recombinação das palavras ensinadas anteriormente. Finalmente, um teste de compreensão de leitura com novas frases era apresentado aos participantes. Por exemplo, na presença de uma figura, três sentenças diferentes em letras maiúsculas eram apresentadas e o participante deveria selecionar qual a sentença correta. Em todos os estudos, os participantes alcançaram o critério de acerto, três vezes consecutivas, sem erro, embora alguns tenham precisado de re-exposições. No Estudo 1 e 2 todos os participantes responderam consistentemente aos testes e leram as novas sentenças fluentemente e com compreensão. No Estudo 3, um participante construiu as seis novas sentenças prontamente. Nenhum participante leu com compreensão aos testes finais de leitura. No Estudo 4, três participantes construíram duas novas sentenças prontamente e um participante não respondeu aos testes de conectividade. Dois participantes responderam aos testes de leitura com compreensão. No Estudo 5 dois participantes construíram quatro novas sentenças prontamente. Nos Estudos 3 e 5 os participantes não responderam aos testes de nomeação oral. Estes resultados demonstraram a emergência de novas sentenças, sem qualquer treino adicional, a partir do ensino com três sentenças independentes. Os resultados dos testes de leitura com compreensão mostraram uma coerência com o paradigma de equivalência. Conclui-se que os estímulos utilizados eram funcionalmente equivalentes e exerceram ainda funções ordinais pela posição que cada um ocupou nas sentenças. ABSTRACT: The {{analysis on}} ordinal relations {{in which the}} responding is under control of relational properties such as first, second, third and so on, based on the equivalence paradigm, constitutes an important way to comprehend <b>verbal</b> behavior (<b>syntax).</b> Five studies aimed to evaluate the emergency of new sentences {{with three or four}} words(articles, nouns, adjectives or verbs and adverbs), based on the positions taken by them in each sentence taught independently. Five pre-school children participated on the Study 1, envolving three words. All the participants were given matching-to-sample training procedures, equivalence tests, training through response chaining, sequences production training, conectivity and reading and comprehension tests. On Study 2, other five children from middle-school were given the same training procedures and tests, with four words. On Study 3, four children were submitted to the procedure by chaining, sequence production tests, conectivity and reading with comprehension using four words. On Study 4, other four children with school failure history were given the same tests and teaching procedures of Studies 1 and 2, with four words. On Study 5, three other children also with school failure history were given the same procedure adopted on Study 3, with four words. Participants didnt have fluent phrase reading, but readed words separately. Experimental sessions occured in a room of the School. A microcomputer was used in the study as well as a specific software to control the stimulus presentation and record the behavioral data. Three sets of stimuli were used: A (drawins), B (upper case words) and C (lower case words), to teach AB and AC conditional relations and BC/CB tests. On training by chaining, three different sentences were used. On first trial, the word UM, for example, was presented on the choice area. A touch on the word produced as a consequence its displacement to the construction area on {{the upper part of the}} screen, a graphic animation was presented with a sound muito bem (very good), legal (cool), certo (right). Following, two words were presented simultaneously on the screen and the participants should touch one of them and then the other one. In case the words were put in the correct 12 order, the same previous consequence were presented and the same set of words were presented again in different positions on the choice area. In case of an answer different from the programed by the experimenter, a blackout of the screen was produced for 3 s and a new set of words were presented, side-by-side on the choice area. After teaching the baseline, sequences production and conectivity tests were applied to verify the emergence of six new sentences (except Study 1), based on previously taught words recombination. Finally, a reading comprehension test with new phrases were presented the participants. For example, on the presence of a picture, three different sentences on capital letters were presented and the participant should choose which was the correct sentence. In all the studies, the participants reached the rightness criteria, three consecutive times, without no mistake, though some of them have needed re-exposure. On Studies 1 and 2, all participants responded consistently to the tests and read the new sentences fluently and with comprehension. On Study 3, a participant built the six new sentences readily. None read with comprehension the reading tests. On Study 4, three participants built the new sentences readily and a participant didnt respond to the conectivity test. Two participants responded to the reading with comprehension tests. On Study 5, two participants built four new sentences readily. On Studies 3 and 5, participants didnt respond to the reading with comprehension tests. These results demonstrated the emergency of new sentences, without any aditional train, based on the teaching with three independent sentences. The results of the reading with comprehension tests shown a coherence with the equivalence paradigm. Its concluded that stimuli used were functionally equivalents and exerted ordinal functions by the position that each one took place on the sentences...|$|R
