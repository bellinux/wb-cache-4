5|$|The fox-like canids, {{which include}} the kit fox (Vulpes velox), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Cape fox (Vulpes chama), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), and fennec fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda).</b>|$|R
50|$|Other common fauna {{include the}} Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Egyptian jackal (Canis aureus hupstar), sand fox (Vulpes rueppelli) and more rarely the fennec fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda).</b> Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) were once common {{throughout}} but now are few in numbers.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} mammals are the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros), both highly threatened by uncontrolled hunting. The sand cat (Felis margarita), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) and the fennec fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda)</b> are {{observed in the}} area only rarely. Rodents found in the area include sand rat (Psammomys obesus), greater Egyptian gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum) and the Libyan jird (Meriones libycus).|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the occurrence of intestinal parasites found in captive wild carnivores at the Johannesburg Zoological Gardens. Faecal samples were collected from the enclosures of 22 different carnivore species from the families Canidae (Canis adustus, Lycaon pictus, <b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda,</b> Otocyon megalotis); Felidae (Acinonyx jubatus, Caracal caracal, Felis silvestris lybica, Leopardus wiedii, Leptailurus serval, Panthera leo, Panthera tigris altaica, Puma concolor, Uncia uncial); Hyaenidae (Hyaena hyaena); Mustelidae (Lutra maculicollis, Mellivora capensis); Procyonidae (Nasua nasua); Ursidae (Tremarctos ornatus, Ursus arctos, Ursus martimus) and Viverridae (Civettictis civetta, Genetta genetta). The samples were collected during routine cage cleaning. Faecal samples collected from 7 carnivore species, namely, cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), caracal (Caracal caracal), African wild cat (Felis silvestris lybica), small spotted genet (Genetta genetta), margay (Leopardus wiedii), honey badger (Mellivora capensis) and fennec fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda),</b> tested positive for cysts of Giardia sp. All infections were clinically inapparent. Two strobilar stages of a tapeworm recovered from a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) during necropsy at Johannesburg Zoological Gardens were identified as Hydatigera taeniaeformis.

50|$|Otarocyon {{was a small}} borophagine {{characterized}} by a short, broad skull, a specialized middle ear, simple, tall premolar teeth, and molars that are incipiently adapted to a hypocarnivore diet. Despite its Oligocene age, the skull of Otarocyon shows several striking similarities to the living fennec fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda),</b> particularly {{in the structure of}} its middle ear. The similarities are probably convergent, but they suggest that Otarocyon may have been similar in its appearance and habits.|$|R
25|$|The {{species was}} {{previously}} {{classified in the}} genus Fennecus, but has since been reclassified to the genus Vulpes which includes {{a variety of other}} types of foxes. Scientists have noted that while there are similarities, there are many differences that set the fennec fox apart from other fox species, including both physical and social traits. This has led to two conflicting classifications: <b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda,</b> implying that the fennec fox is a true fox, and Fennecus zerda, implying that the fennec fox belongs to its own genus.|$|R
25|$|The {{fennec fox}} or fennec (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda)</b> {{is a small}} nocturnal fox found in the Sahara of North Africa. Its most {{distinctive}} feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Arabic word فنك (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat. The fennec is the smallest species of canid. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. In addition, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.|$|R
40|$|A 2. 5 -year-old male {{castrated}} {{fennec fox}} (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda)</b> presented to Cornell’s Ophthalmology Service with a chief complaint of running into objects at home. According to the owner, the suspected vision deficit had started approximately seven months ago, but had become progressively {{worse in the}} past month. Ophthalmic examination revealed bilateral retinal degeneration, characterized by avascular retinas, atrophy of the optic nerves, and increased reflectivity of the tapetal fundus. Primary differential diagnoses included progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and taurine deficiency retinopathy. A blood sample was submitted to OptiGen (Ithaca, NY) to genetically screen for known mutations causing PRA in domestic dogs. The fox was negative for the progressive rod cone degeneration (PRCD) mutation. An echocardiogram was performed to rule out dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), a known sequela of taurine deficiency in foxes. No evidence of DCM was present. Prognosis was grave for return of vision and very good for quality of life. Like dogs and cats, the fox acclimated well to blindness at home...|$|R
40|$|Species Red-rumped Agouti (Dasyprocta leporina), Fennec Fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda),</b> Rodrigues Flying Fox (Pteropus rodricensis) Tawny Frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) Bolivian Night Monkey (Aotus azarae ssp. boliviensis) and Common Scops-owl (Otus scops) are breed {{together}} in reversed light/dark cycle exhibit in zoo Olomouc. Most {{of these species}} have similar environmental living conditions in the wild, but they are zoogeographically heterogeneous. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess success of this mixed-species exhibit and propose possible measures for breeding practice. Observation passed in the range of 6 x 24 hours divided into two periods according to the number of visitors to assess the impact of visitors on the animal behavior. This influence was seen in some species. Interspecific aggression was not observed. There were no signs of stress, except stereotypical behavior of Fennec fox. Some species do not prosper. It suggests, that some interspecific relations could be present. Replacement of some species (with regard to potential risks of surgery) could be advisable...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{reproduction}} for Canidae {{species is}} a challenge for zoological institutions and wildlife sanctuaries. There are four basic options for contraception: separation of sexes, surgical procedures, immunological and hormonal methods. Animal managers face potential challenges for each option, and advantages and disadvantages {{should be taken into}} consideration when making a decision. This paper evaluates four common Canidae species with results from hormonal monitoring: Gray wolves Canis lupus/Mexican gray wolves Canis lupus baileyi, Maned wolves Chrysocyon brachyurus, Fennec fox <b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda</b> and African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Special focus is given to individuals treated with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, Suprelorin®. To date there are considerably more data for African wild dogs than other canids, as extensive field observations are available for this species. Therefore, African wild dogs are more extensively covered in this paper. GnRH agonists have been designated the safest reversible method of contraception for carnivores and so continued studies are important. Results outlined below demonstrate individual dosing differences that occur not only across species but also between similar individuals. Although dosing and duration of efficacy still need further investigating, GnRH agonists are still considered to be the safest and most appropriate method available. As evident in this paper, contraception is a much-needed tool for reproductive management...|$|R
40|$|The {{pituitary}} gland of carnivore mammals {{in the world}} was described, but that of those in Egypt may be low, so the present study is carried out on some carnivore mammals such as <b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda,</b> to elucidate the similarities and the differences of the pituitary cells between the mammals in the world and those in Egypt. The results indicate that, the gland is pyramidal in shape. The acidophilic cells and the basophilic cells are distributed heterogeneously {{in the body of the}} gland. The STH cells are numerous, the nucleus is irregular, lobed and eccentric with the endoplasmic reticulum. The secretory granules are light with a large size. The LTH cells have eccentric nucleus near the plasma membrane, the mitochondrium is spherical or elongated, the endoplasmic reticulum is rough and the granules are collected at the cell periphery. The ACTH cells are found singly, irregular with eccentric nucleus. Its secretory granules are small and spherical shaped, while the TSH cells have very small secretory granules, but the FSH and LH cells are found singly, angular shape with eccentric nuclei and the its secretary granules are spherical or ovoid shaped and exhibit variation in electron density than STH cells. The differences in shape and distribution may be related to the phylogeny...|$|R
25|$|The {{large mammals}} {{present in the}} {{ecoregion}} are the addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), and rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). However, rodents are the most represented order of mammals in the Tibesti, and include the Agag gerbil (Gerbillus agag), Balochistan gerbil (Gerbillus nanus), Cairo spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus), lesser Egyptian jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), Libyan jird (Meriones libycus), Mzab gundi (Massoutiera Mzabi) and the North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris). Also present are cats such as the African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and, more rarely, the caracal (Caracal caracal) and the Sudan cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), {{as well as several}} canine species including the Egyptian wolf (Canis anthus lupaster), fennec fox (<b>Vulpes</b> <b>zerda)</b> and Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii). The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) may also occupy the range. There may be as many as 50 endangered painted hunting dogs (Lycaon pictus) in the Tibesti, although some regard these relict populations as extirpated, partially due to the Darfur refugee turmoil and other Sudan generated conflicts. Bats are heavily represented in the Tibesti, including the desert long-eared bat (Otonycteris hemprichii), greater mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma microphyllum), Hamilton's tomb bat (Taphozous hamiltoni), Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) and the trident bat (Asellia tridens). The Cape hare (Lepus capensis), desert hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) and the Saharan striped polecat (Ictonyx libyca) also populate the area.|$|R
