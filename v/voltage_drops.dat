5|$|The {{earliest}} electrical {{application of}} SiC was in lightning arresters in electric power systems. These devices must exhibit high resistance until the voltage across them reaches a certain threshold VT {{at which point}} their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> below VT.|$|E
5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a low-power device, with high-power mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The charging port may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before the <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> to 2V.|$|E
25|$|Resistors of {{extremely}} high precision are manufactured for calibration and laboratory use. They may have four terminals, using one pair to carry an operating current {{and the other}} pair to measure the voltage drop; this eliminates errors caused by <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> across the lead resistances, because no charge flows through voltage sensing leads. It is important in small value resistors (100–0.0001ohm) where lead resistance is significant or even comparable with respect to resistance standard value.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> value. Once current is applied, resistance and <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. <b>Voltage</b> <b>drop</b> often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) type fuses.|$|R
5000|$|National {{and local}} {{electrical}} codes may set {{guidelines for the}} maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> allowed in electrical wiring, to ensure efficiency of distribution and proper operation of electrical equipment. The maximum permitted <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> varies {{from one country to}} another. [...] In electronic design and power transmission, various techniques are employed to compensate for the effect of <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> on long circuits or where voltage levels must be accurately maintained. The simplest way to reduce <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is to increase the diameter of the conductor between the source and the load, which lowers the overall resistance. In power distribution systems, a given amount of power can be transmitted with less <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> if a higher voltage is used. More sophisticated techniques use active elements to compensate for the undesired <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b>|$|R
30|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is {{calculated}} by the equation LU[*]=[*]ZJ. Z is the impedance and LU 1 ×f is the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> of each branch.|$|R
25|$|The {{output voltage}} of the {{stabilizer}} {{is equal to}} the Zener diode voltage minus the base–emitter voltage of the transistor, UZ − UBE, where UBE is usually about 0.7V for a silicon transistor, depending on the load current. If the output <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing a decrease in the Collector-Emitter junction voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base–emitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.|$|E
25|$|A strobe {{without a}} {{capacitor}} storage device simply discharges mains voltages across the tube once it's fired. This type of strobe requires no charging time {{and allows for}} much quicker flash rates, but drastically reduces the lifetime of the flash tube if powered for significant periods of time. Such strobes require a form of current limiting, because as mentioned above, an arc acts {{as a kind of}} short circuit. If this current limiting were to be eliminated, the flash tube would attempt to draw high currents from the electricity source, potentially tripping electrical breakers or causing <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> in the power supply line.|$|E
25|$|The semi-resonant start circuit {{was invented}} by Thorn Lighting for use with T12 {{fluorescent}} tubes. This method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to thermionic emission temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube <b>voltage</b> <b>drops,</b> the circuit provides current limiting.|$|E
25|$|The {{on-state}} forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> in IGBTs behaves {{very differently}} from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> can be modeled as a resistance, with the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> (typically {{of the order}} of 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel input pattern {{generator}} for dynamic power network simulation. The obtained patterns successfully identify critical <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> areas {{for a set}} of industrial designs, which are difficult to be found using functional vectors. The search engine of the pattern generator for worst-case IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is based on the multiobjective genetic algorithm. To achieve high coverage for critical <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> cells, we propose to model the search criteria into the maximum weighted matching of a bipartite graph, and guide the search direction according to the matching results.

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE This {{application}} note describes {{the advantages of}} using Low Forward Voltage (Vf) Schottky diodes {{in a variety of}} applications. The lower <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> results in a significant increase in efficiency. Lower Forward <b>Voltage</b> <b>Drop</b> Figure 1 shows the relative improvement in forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> Vf, with the DSN 2 Schottky diodes technology. The comparison is made to industry SOD− 323 EP Schottky diodes. It is clear that such a significant improvement can have major impact on the efficiency of many circuit applications. The forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> of the DSN 2 Schottky diodes is shown in Table 1. The data are taken from the typical data charts on the data sheet at 25 °C at the devices rated specifications. A comparison can be made between a 20 V device and a 30 or 40 V device. Four surface mount footprints are shown, 0201, 0402, 0502 and 0603. The forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is presented at rated currents. All Schottky diodes have a negative temperature coefficient of approximately 1 mV/°C. The forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> can be as much as 0. 100 V lower at 125 °C when compared to the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> at 25 °C...|$|R
25|$|In the {{electrical}} schematic to the right, a typical silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) based light dimmer dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is {{wired in series}} with the load. Diodes (D2, D3, D4 and D5) form a bridge which generates pulsed DC. R1 and C1 form a circuit with a time constant. As the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C1 will charge up. When C1 is able to make Zener diode D6 conduct and inject current into the SCR, the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D1 will discharge C1 via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> {{at the end of}} the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle. This is an example of a Leading Edge Dimmer.|$|E
25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled <b>voltage</b> <b>drops.</b> If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the input offset voltage below) can be produced. This offset voltage can create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|E
25|$|A major {{design flaw}} {{with the class}} was that the {{traction}} current circuits of each bogie were not isolated. The third rail supply is generated close to the rail line {{and there are many}} areas where it changes from one substation to another. Although great effort is made to ensure the voltages are the same between sections, at the extreme ends of supply there can be very large differences due mainly to <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> caused by other electric trains. There are examples of fires in class 73 where the locomotive has acted as an electrical bridge between two different substations causing the traction circuit inside the locomotive to take the brunt of the huge surges in supply as trains move {{in and out of the}} sections behind and in front. This problem was particularly noticeable at junctions where conductor rails cannot be separated by a good distance and many of the class were damaged by fire caused in this manner over the years. Class 73s were well known for incredible displays of arcing at the collector shoes for this exact reason.|$|E
50|$|An LED has a <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> {{specified}} at {{the intended}} operating current. Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's circuit laws {{are used to}} calculate the appropriate resistor value to obtain the desired current. The value is computed by subtracting the LED <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> from the supply voltage and dividing by the desired operating current. If the supply voltage is equal to the LED's <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> no resistor is needed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors(IGBTs) have {{received}} wide attention {{because of their}} high current conduction and good switching characteristics. To {{reduce the power loss}} of IGBT, the on-state <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> should be lowered and the switching time should be shortened. However, there is trade-off between the breakdown voltage and the on-state <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> The FLoatingIsland(FLI) structure can lower the on-state <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> without reducing breakdown voltage. In this paper, The FLI IGBT shows an on-state <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> that is 22. 5 % lower than the conventional IGBT, even though the breakdown voltages of each IGBT are almost identical...|$|R

500|$|USB {{supplies}} bus power across V and GND at {{a nominal}} voltage 5V±5%, at supply, to power USB devices. Power is sourced solely from upstream devices or hosts, and is consumed solely by downstream devices. USB provides for various <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> and losses in providing bus power. As such, the voltage at the hub port is specified {{to be in}} the range [...] by USB2.0, and [...] by USB3.0. It is specified that devices' configuration and low-power functions must operate down to 4.40V at the hub port by USB2.0 and that devices' configuration, low-power, and high-power functions must operate down to 4.00V at the device port by USB3.0.|$|E
2500|$|A {{resistor}} {{is often}} inserted between the non-inverting input and ground (so both inputs [...] "see" [...] similar resistances), reducing the {{input offset voltage}} due to different <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> due to bias current, and may reduce distortion in some op-amps.|$|E
2500|$|These {{currents}} {{flow through}} the resistances connected to the inputs and produce small <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> across those resistances. Appropriate design of the feedback network can alleviate problems associated with input bias currents and common-mode gain, as explained below.

50|$|A diode {{in series}} with the fan will reduce the voltage being output to the fan. A silicon diode {{provides}} a relatively constant <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> of about 0.7 V per diode; data sheets for a specific diode specify its <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> for example the 1N4001 silicon diode's <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> varies from approximately 0.7 to 0.9 V as the current varies from 0.01 to 1 A. The power rating should be noted and some diodes may require cooling to operate at their rated current. It {{should also be noted}} that the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across the diode will fall with temperature, causing the fan to speed up.|$|R
40|$|The {{protocol}} for charging a lithium-ion battery would be modified, {{according to a}} proposal, {{to compensate for the}} internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> (charging current internal resistance of the battery). The essence of the modification is to provide for measurement of the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> and to increase the terminal-voltage setting by the amount of the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> Ordinarily, a lithium-ion battery is charged at constant current until its terminal voltage attains a set value equal to the nominal full-charge potential. The set value is chosen carefully so as not to exceed the lithium-plating potential, because plated lithium in metallic form constitutes a hazard. When the battery is charged at low temperature, the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is considerable because the electrical conductivity of the battery electrolyte is low at low temperature. Charging the battery at high current at any temperature also gives rise to a high internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> In some cases, the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> can be as high as 1 volt per cell. Because the voltage available for charging is less than the terminal voltage by the amount of the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> the battery is not fully charged (see figure), even when the terminal voltage reaches the set value. In the modified protocol, the charging current would be periodically interrupted so that the zero-current battery-terminal voltage indicative of the state of charge could be measured. The terminal voltage would also be measured at full charging current. The difference between the full-current and zero-current voltages would equal the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> The set value of terminal voltage would then be increased beyond the nominal full-charge potential by the amount of the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> This adjustment would be performed repeatedly, in real time, so that the voltage setting would track variations in the internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> to afford full charge without risk of lithium plating. If the charging current and voltage settings were controlled by a computer, then this method of charge control could readily be implemented in software...|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{capacitor}} C1 {{is often}} constructed as {{a stack of}} smaller capacitors connected in series. This provides a large <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across C1 and a relatively small <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across C2. As {{the majority of the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is on C1, this reduces the required insulation level of the voltage transformer. This makes CVTs more economical than the wound voltage transformers under high voltage (over 100kV), as the latter one requires more winding and materials.|$|R
2500|$|The noise {{generated}} at the resistor {{can transfer}} to the remaining circuit; the maximum noise power transfer happens with impedance matching when the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the remaining circuit {{is equal to the}} noise generating resistance.

Since only half of the source <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> across any one of these resistors, the resulting noise power is given by ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of [...] "simple" [...] theories of field electron emission, {{and in particular}} the {{development of}} Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relies on all five of the above factors being true. For materials other than metals (and for atomically sharp metal emitters) {{one or more of the}} above factors will be untrue. For example, crystalline semiconductors do not have a free-electron-like band-structure, do have surface states, are subject to field penetration and band bending, and may exhibit both internal <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> and statistical decoupling of the surface-state electron distribution from the electron distribution in the surface region of the bulk band-structure (this decoupling is known as [...] "the Modinos effect").|$|E
2500|$|A more {{efficient}} {{alternative to a}} shunt voltage regulator is an active voltage regulator circuit. [...] An active regulator employs reactive components to store and discharge energy, so that most or all current supplied by the rectifier is passed to the load. It may also use negative and positive feedback in conjunction {{with at least one}} voltage amplifying component like a transistor to maintain output voltage when source <b>voltage</b> <b>drops.</b> [...] The input filter must prevent the troughs of the ripple dropping below the minimum voltage required by the regulator to produce the required output voltage. [...] The regulator serves both to significantly reduce the ripple and to deal with variations in supply and load characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Currents {{stronger}} than 60A are rarely used, since 60A current already requires 8 AWG or even thicker cables. Cables are dimensioned to prevent 5% or higher <b>voltage</b> <b>drop.</b> Larger <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> {{could lead to}} excessive power losses and increased danger of fire.|$|R
50|$|Longer wiring runs {{are more}} limited by <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> in the conductors. Because the supply voltage is doubled, a {{balanced}} load can tolerate double the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> allowing quarter-sized conductors to be used; this uses 3/8 the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.|$|R
50|$|As every {{solid-state}} device {{has a small}} <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across it, this <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> limits the amount of current a given SSR can handle. The minimum <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> for such a relay {{is a function of}} the material used to make the device. Solid-state relays rated to handle as much as 1,200 amperes have become commercially available. Compared to electromagnetic relays, they may be falsely triggered by transients and in general may be susceptible to damage by extreme cosmic ray and EMP episodes.|$|R
2500|$|Developing the {{approximate}} theory of CFE from metals above is comparatively easy, {{for the following}} reasons. (1) Sommerfeld's free-electron theory, with its particular assumptions about the distribution of internal electron states in energy, applies adequately to many metals as a first approximation. (2) Most of the time, metals have no surface states and (in many cases) metal wave-functions have no significant [...] "surface resonances". (3) Metals have a high density of states at the Fermi level, so the charge that generates/screens external electric fields lies mainly {{on the outside of}} the top atomic layer, and no meaningful [...] "field penetration" [...] occurs. (4) Metals have high electrical conductivity: no significant <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> occur inside metal emitters: this means that there are no factors obstructing the supply of electrons to the emitting surface, and that the electrons in this region can be both in effective local thermodynamic equilibrium and in effective thermodynamic equilibrium with the electrons in the metal support structure on which the emitter is mounted. (5) Atomic-level effects are disregarded.|$|E
2500|$|A high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25°C cell temperature, {{may produce}} 0.60V {{open-circuit}} (VOC). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25°C air temperature, {{will probably be}} close to 45°C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55V per cell. The <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> modestly, {{with this type of}} cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (ISC). Maximum power (with 45°C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43V in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current. This output can be up to 70% of the VOC x ISC product. The short-circuit current (ISC) from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (VOC) may drop only 10% with an 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2VOC at 1/2ISC. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the VOC x ISC product to 50% or even as little as 25%. Vendors who rate their solar cell [...] "power" [...] only as VOC x ISC, without giving load curves, can be seriously distorting their actual performance.|$|E

[...] "Full-wave" [...] versions with two separate plates were popular because they could be used with a center-tapped transformer to make a full-wave rectifier. [...] Vacuum tube rectifiers were made for very high voltages, such as the {{high voltage power supply}} for the cathode ray tube of television receivers, and the kenotron used for power supply in X-ray equipment. [...] However, compared to modern semiconductor diodes, vacuum tube rectifiers have high internal resistance due to space charge and therefore high <b>voltage</b> <b>drops,</b> causing high power dissipation and low efficiency. [...] They are rarely able to handle currents exceeding 250mA owing to the limits of plate power dissipation, and cannot be used for low voltage applications, [...] such as battery chargers. Another limitation of the vacuum tube rectifier is that the heater power supply often requires special arrangements to insulate it from the high voltages of the rectifier circuit.|$|E
