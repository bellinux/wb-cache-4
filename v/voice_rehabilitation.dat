40|$|Total {{laryngectomy}} is {{a radical}} procedure that leads to permanent loss of the voice generator {{and a part of}} the voice resonator, the larynx, where the basic laryngeal tone is created. One method of <b>voice</b> and speech <b>rehabilitation</b> is implantation of tracheoesophageal prosthesis.

This paper presents the results of <b>voice</b> and speech <b>rehabilitation</b> in 48 laryngectomized patients aged 44 to 77 years, with implanted vocal prosthesis during the period from 2008 to 2010 at the Clinic for Ear, Nose and Throat of the Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The assessment of voice and speech characteristics included: maximum phonation time for the sound /a/, the length of phrases, reading of phonetically balanced word lists, intelligibility of words, reading phonetically balanced text and self-assessment of speech quality of patients referred to their communicative needs. Characteristics of voice and speech in patients who underwent primary vocal prosthesis in relation to secondary placement show no statistically significant difference. In patients under the age of 60, statistically significant better result in terms of speech intelligibility was found. There were no statistically significant differences depending on the patients' gender. Only one patient (1 / 48) assessed his speech as unsatisfactory. As developing countries cannot provide adequate number of prostheses and their continuous supply for all laryngectomy patients, the installation of a secondary vocal prosthesis could be an adequate method of rehabilitation.

40|$|Patients {{who suffer}} larynx and voice box {{deficiencies}} are typically {{unable to speak}} anything more than hoarse whispers {{without the aid of}} <b>voice</b> prostheses or <b>rehabilitation</b> techniques such as oesophageal speech. Speech therapists and researchers working in this field have, for many years, pursued the goal of rehabilitation of such patients so as to return to them the ability to speak in a natural sounding voice. Typically due to removal of, or damage to, the voice box in a surgical operation such as laryngectomy, the pitch generation mechanism within these patients voice production systems, is lacking. Without a source of excitation for voiced speech, only hoarse, whisper like and sometimes not easily perceptible sounds can be produced. This speech is obviously different to that from normal speakers, and will have lost many of the distinctive characteristics of the original speech. However, these patients typically retain the ability to whisper in a similar way to normal speakers...|$|R

She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat. (However, Andrews has recently stated that it was due to [...] "a certain kind of muscular striation that happens on the vocal cords" [...] as a result of strain from Victor/Victoria, adding [...] "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.") She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999 she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter Jennifer Edwards said in 1999 [...] "it's been two years, and it singing voice still hasn't returned." [...] The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount. Andrews admits that she has never recovered from the botched attempt to remove nodules from her vocal cords back in 1997.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{describe}} the effects of radiotherapy following laryngeal cancer on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and voice function {{as well as to}} assess the efficiency of <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Patients treated by radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer were included in the study and randomised into two groups, one intervention group receiving <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and one control group. Patients were assessed prospectively pre-radiotherapy and one, six and 12 months post-radiotherapy completion. <b>Voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> took place between one and six months post-radiotherapy. Endpoints included patient-reported outcomes, such as HRQL measured by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC QLQ) as well as communication function according to Swedish Self-Evaluation of Communication Experiences after Laryngeal cancer (S-SECEL). Perceptual, acoustic and temporal analyses of voice recordings were also performed. Additionally, a vocally healthy control group was included for comparison. Results demonstrated that although HRQL deteriorated for both glottic and supraglottic tumours one month post-radiotherapy, the latter group reported the largest deteriorations. In terms of voice quality, acoustic measures revealed that glottic tumours deviated significantly from vocally healthy controls pre-radiotherapy with some parameters improving post-radiotherapy. Supraglottic tumours however, demonstrated no difference compared to the vocally healthy control group at either time-point. Twelve months post-radiotherapy, laryngeal cancer patients demonstrated no significant difference when compared to pre-treatment in terms of HRQL, communication dysfunction or voice quality, albeit still had abnormal values. HRQL declined immediately post-radiotherapy and recovered to pre-treatment values at six months post-radiotherapy. All patients presented with perceptually perceived dysphonia, with only the variable “roughness” changing significantly during the study period. Roughness improved post-radiotherapy but deteriorated again between six and 12 months post-radiotherapy. The intervention group receiving <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> demonstrated more improvements in HRQL and communication function domains compared to the control group, which remained static during the study period. The improvements were maintained up to six months post-voice rehabilitation (12 months post-radiotherapy). <b>Voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> also appeared to prevent the perceptual deterioration observed in the control group between six and 12 months. Lastly, the likelihood of experiencing a clinically significant communication improvement at 12 months post-radiotherapy was positively influenced by undergoing <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and negatively influenced by smoking continuation. This thesis concludes that the majority of laryngeal cancer patients have impaired voice quality, communicative function and HRQL prior to radiotherapy with no significant improvements seen 12 months post-radiotherapy. <b>Voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> has positive effects on HRQL and communication function as well as seems to hinder a perceived deterioration of the voice quality roughness.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of radiotherapy and <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> on voice function and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) following treatment for laryngeal cancer. Patients treated for laryngeal cancer were prospectively studied pre-radiotherapy and 1, 6 and 12 months post-radiotherapy. Patients were randomized into a <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> group, in which they received <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> between 1 and 6 months post-radiotherapy, or a control group. Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures included the S-SECEL (Swedish Self-Evaluation of Communication Experiences after Laryngeal cancer), EORTC QLQ (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire) and questions regarding hoarseness and vocal loudness. Acoustic, perceptual and temporal analyses were performed. The patients were also compared to a vocally healthy control group. After radiotherapy, a general deterioration of HRQL was observed in all patients treated for laryngeal cancer, the supraglottic cohort generally had inferior scores compared to the glottic cohort. Regarding voice quality, the glottic cohort appeared inferior to the vocally healthy control group both pre- and post-radiotherapy, while the supraglottic cohort was comparable to the vocally healthy control group. According to the S-SECEL results, improvement {{was seen in the}} <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> group, results were maintained at the follow-up six months later. The control group had no statistically significant change in S-SECEL results. No statistically significant changes regarding acoustically measured voice quality were present in the short- or long-term follow-up. HRQL measures according to the EORTC improved after <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> and remained at follow-up 6 months later. The control group showed no statistically significant change except for the Social function domain, which improved from baseline to 6 months post radiotherapy. Perceptually assessed roughness did not change during <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> however, a statistically significant deterioration was present for the control group between 6 and 12 months post-radiotherapy. Factors increasing the likelihood of communication improvement 12 months post radiotherapy were <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> poor speech scores and experiencing less voice use one month post-radiotherapy compared to pre-radiotherapy. Smoking affected communication negatively. In order to facilitate clinical interpretation of the S-SECEL, cut-off values as well as estimates of Minimum Clinically Important Differences (MCID) were identified for the instrument. Laryngeal cancer patients filled out the S-SECEL instrument and a question about acceptability of speech in a social context pre- and 12 -months post oncologic treatment. Results at 12 months as well as the change between pre-treatment and 12 -months follow-up were used for identification of cut-off values and estimates of MCID for each domain of the S-SECEL. When using the cut-off value, 36 % of the participants scored above the value indicating the need for vocal rehabilitation at the 12 -month follow-up. The results of this thesis demonstrated that voice function and HRQL is affected after radiotherapy. A large proportion had communication functioning indicating the need for vocal rehabilitation. <b>Voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> prevented voice deterioration and improved the self-perceived communication function and HRQL. The effects remained in the long-term. The findings suggest that <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> could be beneficial to patients after radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rationale for training in voice emission and voice prophylaxis among teachers and to assess the effects of <b>voice</b> disorders <b>rehabilitation</b> in the selected group of teachers participating in the program “Protect your voice. ” Material and Methods: An anonymous survey was conducted among 463 teachers participating in the training part of the program. The effectivness of rehabilitation of teachers with occupational voice disorders was evaluated among 51 subjects (average age: 43 years) taking part in diagnostic and rehabilitation part of the program. Phonation voice exercises with speech therapist and physiotherapy (iontophoresis, inhalations and elektrostimulation) were administered. Evaluation of rehabilitation was based on phoniatric examination, including videostroboscopy and statistical calculations. Results: The survey showed that among teachers there is high demand (98 %) for training in proper voice emission, hygiene and prevention of voice. The effectiveness of rehabilitation has been confirmed by the observed improvements in phonatory activities of larynx, proper breathing during phonation (p = 0. 0000), the voice quality (p = 0. 0022), prolonged phonation time (an average of 1. 39 s), increased number of people who correctly activated resonators (p = 0. 0000) and increased number of people with phonation without excesive muscle tension of the neck. Conclusions: The results indicate that among all the professionally active teachers, there is a need for regular training of proper voice emission and vocal hygiene and then conduct individually phonation and breathing exercises, supported by the physiotherapy. This should be an effective method of voice disorders prevention in teachers. Med Pr 2017; 68 (5) : 593 – 60...|$|R
40|$|Binder-Macleod, Stuart A. The {{restoration}} of walking ability {{is the most}} commonly <b>voiced</b> goal of <b>rehabilitation</b> by stroke survivors. However, despite an emphasis on walking retraining during rehabilitation, limitations in walking ability persist. Current walking therapies {{have been reported to}} produce comparable gains in walking function regardless of the mode or sophistication of the training used, with all therapies failing to improve the majority of subjects' capacity for community walking. Rehabilitation efforts have been limited by a poor understanding of the clinical and biomechanical mechanisms underlying intervention-induced functional recovery, as well as a poor understanding of how the heterogeneous nature of poststroke motor impairment confounds optimal treatment. Through cross-sectional (ie, pretraining) and longitudinal (ie, posttraining changes) analyses, this dissertation identified changes in poststroke maximum walking speed (aim 1) and the function of the paretic limb during its late stance phase (aim 2) as key determinants of functional recovery after stroke. In aim 3 of this dissertation, the efficacy of a novel, hypothesis-driven locomotor intervention (FastFES) designed to improve the walking ability of persons poststroke through specific effects on these key clinical and biomechanical variables was demonstrated. Moreover, the hypothesized effects of the FastFES intervention were validated and the best candidates for FastFES training were explored.

40|$|Purpose: Prosthetic voice {{restoration}} is {{an increasingly}} popular method of postlaryngectomy <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation.</b> Despite its success in non-tonal languages, {{the efficacy of}} tracheoesophageal speech in tonal languages was largely unknown. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the long-term results of <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> using a Blom-Singer valve (BSV) in the tonal language of Cantonese. Patients and Methods: The records of 159 patients who underwent total laryngectomy and primary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) between May 1985 and December 1994 were retrospectively reviewed. Tracheoesophageal speech was regarded as functional if effective communication could be made during face-to-face conversation and telephone conversation. Any TEP-related complications were noted. Perioperative factors that might contribute to nonfunctional speech were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Six hospital mortalities were excluded from speech analysis. Of the remaining 153 patients, the median follow-up was 25 months, ranging from 3 to 113 months. Seventy-three patients had closure of tracheoesophageal fistulae (TEF), and the main causes were ineffective voice production, dislodgment, and tracheostomal stenosis. Only 15 of them acquired functional speech before closure. The other 80 patients used a BSV as the chief modality of <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> with functional results achieved in 64 patients. None of the perioperative factors were found to be statistically significant in relation to nonfunctional speech.

The Nijdam prosthesis can be used clinically {{for longer periods of time}} when compared to such other indwelling voice prostheses as the Provox prosthesis and the low-resistance Groningen prosthesis. However, trans-device pressure loss during speech has been unknown. Adjustment of the shaft length of the Nijdam voice prosthesis to tracheo-esophageal wall thickness was expected to affect trans-device pressure loss during speech. We report the results of in vitro tests to quantify the effect of tracheo-esophageal wall thickness on trans-device pressure loss. In the present study pressure loss was measured at different air flow rates in relation to tracheo-esophageal wall thickness. Findings demonstrated that when shaft length of the Nijdam prosthesis corresponded exactly to tracheo-esophageal wall thickness, trans-device pressure loss was comparable to that of the Provox prosthesis. If a relatively shorter Nijdam prosthesis was chosen to prevent aspiration from occurring, the pressure loss across the prosthesis increased to that of the low-resistance Groningen prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{this review}} is to {{systematically}} assess {{the effects on}} voice and speech of advanced head and neck cancer and its treatment by means of chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The databases Medline, Embase and Cochrane were searched (1991 – 2009) for terms head and neck cancer, chemoradiation, <b>voice</b> and speech <b>rehabilitation.</b> Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria, whereof 14 reported on voice outcomes and 10 on speech. Within the selected 20 studies, 18 different tools were used for speech or voice evaluation. Most studies assessed their data by means of patient questionnaires. Four studies presented outcome measures {{in more than one}} dimension. Most studies summarised the outcomes of posttreatment data that were assessed at various points in time after treatment. Except for four studies, pre-treatment measurements were lacking. This and the fact that most studies combined the outcomes of patients with radiated laryngeal cancers with outcome data of non-laryngeal cancer patients impedes an interpretation in terms of the effects of radiation versus the effects of the disease itself on voice or speech. Overall, the studies indicated that voice and speech degenerated during CRT, improved again 1 – 2  months after treatment and exceeded pre-treatment levels after 1  year or longer. However, voice and speech measures do not show normal values before or after treatment. Given the large-ranged posttreatment data, missing baseline assessment and the lacking separation of tumour/radiation sites, there is an urgent need for structured standardised multi-dimensional speech and voice assessment protocols in patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with CRT...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Assessment {{of a novel}} {{adhesive}} baseplate (Provox StabiliBase) {{for heat}} and moisture exchanger (HME) and/or automatic speaking valve (ASV) application. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, clinical, multicenter trial. METHODS: This was a trial in laryngectomized patients comparing their usual adhesive with the trial adhesive. Primary outcome measure was overall patient preference; additional outcome parameters possibly explaining patients' preferences were 1) patient tolerance and preference with respect to daily handling of the adhesive; 2) adhesive lifespan, and 3) voice and speech with the adhesives. Study specific questionnaires, visual analog scales, patients' diaries, and stoma assessments were used for data collection. RESULTS: In total, 58 of the 65 laryngectomized individuals entered in the study completed the trial. Patients' overall preference for the new device was high (76 %; P <. 001). Significantly better performance was found for the trial adhesive with respect to ease of application (P =. 034), fit (P <. 001), and air leakage through the adhesive (P <. 001). Comfort and stoma depth correlated weakly (r = 0. 297; P =. 024; deeper stoma-more comfort with StabiliBase). The adhesive lifespan with HME is significantly increased (1. 7 times and 15. 7 hours-plus airtight use; P <. 001). This longer lifespan coincided with somewhat increased dirtying of the adhesive (P =. 02). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The StabiliBase adhesive for peristomal attachment of HMEs and/or ASVs was preferred by 76 % of study participants and showed a promising prolonged lifespan. This new device further increases the options for stoma attachment in laryngectomized individuals, and subsequently the availability of optimal <b>voice</b> and pulmonary <b>rehabilitation</b> for {{a larger proportion of}} patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} the Provox® voice prosthesis provides good <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> following a total laryngectomy in the urban, suburban and rural populations served by a tertiary referral hospital in South Africa. Between 1995 and 1999, a cohort of 128 patients at Tygerberg Hospital was rehabilitated with the Provox™ voice prosthesis after laryngectomy. In 104 patients primary placement of the prosthesis was done {{at the time of the}} laryngectomy. Mean device life and adverse events were determined. Voice quality was assessed subjectively in 104 patients and objectively in 26 patients. The mean device life was 303 days and adverse events occurred in 16 patients. Subjectively, 77 of 104 patients had a good voice, and objectively 22 of 26 patients had good voice intelligibility.

40|$|Background: After total {{laryngectomy}} and <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> using a tracheoesophageal shunt valve, patients often have valve-related complications such as leakage. To solve these problems, a tracheoesophageal tissue connector (TE-TC) was devised {{to serve as}} an interface between the patient's tissue (trachea and esophagus) and the shunt valve. Methods: The TE-TC is a permucosal connection constructed from a titanium ring (filled with a silicon rubber plug) combined with polypropylene or titanium mesh. After implantation in adult goats for 12 weeks the implants were submitted to histologic investigation. Results: Firm implant fixation was achieved. In nearly all (18 / 19), no signs of infection of the implant were seen; 11 of 19 animals died {{before the end of the}} experiment owing to complications not related to the implant.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{cognitive}} and behavioral scientists have been researching the most effective practices for training muscles to produce specific movements consistently and accurately. That research has led to relatively wide acceptance of several best practices for the training of motor skills. One such practice is {{the reduction in the}} frequency with which augmented (external) feedback is provided by the instructor/trainer during skill-acquisition. This theory of low-frequency feedback has been examined by research {{in a wide variety of}} fields ranging from exercise and sport to <b>voice</b> therapy and <b>rehabilitation.</b> Prior to the study reported here, however, this theory had not been applied the acquisition of vocal skills associated with classical singing techniques. The current research consisted of an alternating treatment single-subject study, which was conducted on a college campus over the course of a 15 -week semester. 8 college voice students (3 male and 5 female) ranging in age from 18 to 25 participated in voice lessons provided by the researcher and aimed at improving the overall quality of the voices of the participants. Over the course of the 15 weeks, the instructor alternated between providing a high-frequency feedback (HFF) instruction condition and a low-frequency feedback (LFF) instruction condition. At the beginning of each session, a vocal sample was recorded to test the retention of the skills trained in the previous lesson. Those recordings were evaluated by a panel of five college voice instructors who provided a numerical score (out of a possible 100 pts.) for each sample on the basis of tone quality, breath management, and intonation. The results of this study indicated that three of the eight subjects retained more vocal skill ability during the HFF phases of the study, while the remaining five subjects retained less vocal skill ability during the HFF phases of the study. It was also seen that the three subjects who responded favorably to the HFF instruction condition were also those whose scores were higher throughout the duration of the study. These findings would appear to indicate that an HFF instruction condition may be more beneficial to more experienced or more skilled singers, while an LFF instruction condition may be more beneficial to more novice singers. In the final chapter of this report, several modifications to this study are suggested along with suggestions for future research regarding the application of other principles from motor-learning theory to the acquisition of new vocal skills...|$|R
40|$|Treball Final de Grau en Periodisme. Codi: PE 0932. Curs acadèmic: 2016 / 2017 Cabanyalitzats is {{a digital}} {{publication}} specialized in the Cabanyal neighborhood. This neighborhood of seafaring tradition {{located in the}} city of Valencia a few meters from the beach La Malvarrosa has been for years subject to political will. In 1997 the old Valencian government announced the PEPRI an urban plan that sought to demolish more than 1600 houses to prolong the avenue Blasco Ibañez. During this period of time, the neighbours grouped in neighbourhood platforms fought for the survival of their neighbourhood and to keep alive all the houses, many of them in Art Noveau style. Also, other institutions such as the World Monument Found or Tribunal Superior de Justicia described the plan as a plunder and managed to delay its execution. Today, years later the neighbourhood goes through a new stage. In 2015, {{with the arrival of the}} new government, the plan was annulled and the rehabilitation process started. At first glance this change is positive especially considering that the neighbourhood has quite high vulnerability indexes. However, many <b>voices</b> warn that <b>rehabilitation</b> it entails another threat to gentrification. This term refers to a socio-economic process characterized by the displacement and replacement of the original population of an area by a higher social class. In addition, there is a transformation in the dynamics of urban growth characterized by the emergence of hotel businesses or focused on leisure and tourism. Given the activity of the neighbourhood in all its social, cultural and political spheres, it has been considered that its agenda is of journalistic interest and may provide a sufficient volume of content to devote a means of communication. It should be noted that his digital character responds to the current communicative picture led by new technologies and the internet which have modified the journalistic world and have given way to digital journalism defined by three unique aspects: hypertextuality, interactivity and multimedia. Cabanyalitzats aims at providing information to all types of people with Internet access and with knowledge of Valencian, about the current situation and the cultural calendar of the neighborhood as well as to deepen through journalistic pieces in the subject of gentrification. This theme has, in effect, a considerable weight in the media. Likewise, the use of Valencian in all published pieces, aims to claim the use of this language in the local media. Cabanyalitzats plans to publish a minimum of three weekly publications. However, the number and content of post it depends on calendar. In order to start Cabanyalitzats it was necessary to analyze the existing models and publications related to Cabanyal to delimit with accuracy the thematic strategy and the desing of this digital publication. The analysis led to the following conclusions. On the one hand that there is no specialized media in the Cabanyal and, on the other hand, that Cabanyal neighbours get involved in the communicational processes and generate debate. They use to use social networks to generate content responding to the practise of citizen journalism. After selecting the contents, analyzing the competence and determining the objectives, the name of the publication was chosen. It was important that name included the word Cabanyal to enable the user to find easier this media and also, to identify automatically this media with the district of Cabanyal. Cabanyilzats has been designed with the platform Wix (free versión). The main colours of the website are green and blue because they predominate in the tiles of the modernist houses of the Cabanyal. As they are visually powerful, white, gray and black have been chosen for everything related to publications and texts. The site is divided into three sections: Actualitat, Agenda Cultural and Contacte. Actualitat is focused on the main news and reportages that take place in the district. The post appears in order of publication from the most recent to the oldest. In Agenda Cultural, users are provided with information as the location or the timetable about the main events in Cabanyal. Contact explains what this media is, what are his goals and the audience who is aimed. In this section readers can also contact with Cabanyalitzats sending an email to ask any type of question. It’s important to point out that all publications are provided with links and hiperlinks in order to comply with the principle of hipertextuality. The links has serves to contextualize information and address issues related to the news furthermore they are easily identifiable by the user because the text appears with underlined and he has only to press the button. In addition, all information is devoted to images and different formats are combined: video and text, audio and text [...] . So it can be stated that Cabanyalizats and meets the multimedia requirement. Social networks Facebook and Twitter have been used to maintain interaction with the public, to initiate a direct contact with the reader and also to distribute the content. All the information post on Cabanyalizats’s website is published immediately on these social networks. As well, on the website the reader can share directly by simply clicking the button. With the goal of having a good position in Google, each post contains tags. Before starting to write, it was essential to make a research about Cabanyal (number of people, history, social problems, official data) and also about gentrification. Since gentrification is a complex issue the investigation in this area has been deeper. The next step was contact with the sources. It was not difficult because all of them accept to be interviewed. In others cases, it has been used press releases to make the news. The cost has been very low because university provides the material (camera, programs, editation tolos). Wix has been also free. Most of the expenses are related with public transport to move to the places where interviews take place or with the ticket of the train to go to university to take material. Time has been the main limitation. As the same time I was developing Cabanyalitzats, I was also doing the final project of publicity and working as a trainee in an advertising agency for that reason i could not go to events held in Cabanyal during the morning. I have had more problems linked to the technical part than problems in the textual elaboration. The result of the audiovisual reportage would improve if i had done static shot. Likewise, I think that in the interviews I have to be more concrete. I have interviews that last an hour and although they are very interesting, they have too much content and then it’s difficult to select information. All in all, it has been a good experience. I have learnt to manage the sources, to know the journalistic routine, and to realise the importance of the social networks in but also I have discovered which are my strengths and my weaknesses professional...|$|R
40|$|This study {{gives an}} {{overview}} of publications on factors {{that are associated with}} the outcome of <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> after laryngectomy. A systematic literature review was conducted. Fifty-six manuscripts were analyzed regarding the parameters investigated, the number of participants included, the study designs used, the assessment instruments, and the results. A broad range of factors were considered to contribute to successful <b>voice</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> whereby psychosocial attributes related to success are mentioned as often as medical and treatment-related characteristics. The results of the studies are mostly inconsistent. It can be concluded, however, that active communication behavior, employment status, type of alaryngeal speech and the general physical condition are associated with rehabilitation outcomes, whereas alcohol consumption is not. More comprehensive prospective studies are needed which analyze the impact of psychosocial factors with validated and standardized instruments. A large sample size would be necessary to calculate all possibly relevant factors and their interaction. Clinicians should be careful about considering their patients to be “unmotivated” if the rehabilitation fails; instead, they should encourage them to communicate actively and take part in social activities...|$|E
