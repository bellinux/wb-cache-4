5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder flavour than Dark and <b>Very</b> <b>dark,</b> which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple flavour. The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and <b>Very</b> <b>Dark</b> is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E
5|$|In midsummer the strigs {{of green}} fruit ripen to edible berries, <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> purple in colour, almost black, with glossy skins and {{persistent}} calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year.|$|E
5|$|All of Neptune's inner moons {{are dark}} objects: their {{geometric}} albedo ranges from 7 to 10%. Their spectra {{indicate that they}} are made from water ice contaminated by some <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> material, probably complex organic compounds. In this respect, the inner Neptunian moons {{are similar to the}} inner Uranian moons.|$|E

5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, <b>very</b> <b>dark,</b> and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Dark beers {{are usually}} brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. <b>Very</b> <b>dark</b> beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.|$|E
5|$|Falco peregrinus ernesti, {{described}} by Sharpe in 1894, is found from Indonesia to Philippines and south to Papua New Guinea {{and the nearby}} Bismarck Archipelago. Its geographical separation from nesiotes requires confirmation. It is non-migratory. It differs from the nominate subspecies in the <b>very</b> <b>dark,</b> dense barring on its underside and its black ear coverts.|$|E

5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The 55 Cancri {{system is}} located fairly {{close to the}} Solar System: the Hipparcos {{astrometry}} satellite measured the parallax of 55 Cancri A as 81.03 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 12.3 parsecs (40.3 light years). 55 Cancri A has an apparent magnitude of 5.95, making it just {{visible to the naked}} eye under <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> skies. The red dwarf 55 Cancri B is of the 13th magnitude and only visible through a telescope. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of 1065 AU (one thousand times the distance from the Earth to the Sun). Despite their wide separation, the two stars appear to be gravitationally bound, as they share a common proper motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), {{and a black}} band on the upper back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10-11 mm. The forewings are whitish, irrorated {{with dark}} fuscous {{and with a}} <b>very</b> indistinct <b>darker</b> slender transverse fascia at one-third, slightly oblique. There is an oblique bar {{from the middle of}} the dorsum, and a spot on the tornus <b>darker,</b> <b>very</b> obscure. The hindwings are light grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 18-21 mm. The forewings are fuscous, or brownish-ochreous {{tinged with}} fuscous, especially towards {{the base of}} the costa, usually with <b>very</b> indistinct scattered <b>darker</b> fuscous strigulae. There is a <b>very</b> indistinct <b>darker</b> fuscous transverse mark on the upper angle of the cell. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 10-12 mm. Adults are dirty yellowish with a <b>very</b> light <b>darker</b> sprinkling on the forewings.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is <b>very</b> <b>dark,</b> with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 20-21 mm. Adults are suffused gray {{brown with}} transverse lines faintly indicated by <b>very</b> slightly <b>darker</b> borders.|$|R
2500|$|True seal {{brown is}} best {{described}} as a black or nearly-black coat with reddish or tan hairs on the [...] "soft parts": the muzzle, eyes, inner ears, underbelly, behind the elbow, {{and in front of}} the stifle. Like other coat colors, seal browns can range in shade. The <b>very</b> <b>darkest</b> are just about black except for their tan areas. Lighter examples are easily confused with dark bays. The mane, tail, and legs are always black.|$|R
5000|$|... 211 Isolda is a <b>very</b> large, <b>dark</b> main-belt asteroid. It is {{classified}} as a C-type asteroid and is probably composed of primitive carbonaceous material.|$|R
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes light pollution from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that tend to be <b>very</b> <b>dark,</b> like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E
50|$|Special {{requirements}} for infrared astronomy include: <b>very</b> low <b>dark</b> currents to allow long integration times, associated low noise readout circuits and sometimes very high pixel counts.|$|R

5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> background of space.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear <b>very</b> <b>dark,</b> whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or <b>very</b> <b>dark.</b> Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E
