5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities after the Peace of Amiens, Murray returned to sea {{in command of the}} 74-gun , but word soon reached him that Nelson had requested him to be his captain of the fleet in the Mediterranean. Murray was initially reluctant to accept the offer, and on being asked why, replied that the nature of the service was such, as <b>very</b> <b>frequently</b> terminated in disagreement between the admiral and the captain; and he should be extremely unwilling to hazard any possible thing that should diminish the regard and respect which he should ever entertain for his lordship.|$|E
5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises <b>very</b> <b>frequently</b> when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E

5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife.
