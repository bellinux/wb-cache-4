A fourth <b>variable,</b> <b>item</b> memory, was included as the experimental complement of order memory (Healy, 1974). Performance {{on each of these}} four variables and memory span was obtained for 90 college-aged subjects. Moderate to high reliability was evidenced for each of the tasks.

Additionally, using a multiple regression analysis, each variable was shown to contribute significant, independent variance in the joint prediction of memory span. Subjects' scores on the four predictor variables were used in a cluster analysis which identified four subsets of individuals. An ANOVA determined that the four groups differed in their mean memory span scores. The differences among these groups were examined using a multiple discriminant analysis.

In Experiment 1 we taught adult participants an artificial language containing unpredictable variation in 1 grammatical feature. We manipulated the amount of inconsistency {{and the meaning of}} the inconsistent item. Postexposure testing showed that participants learned the language, including the <b>variable</b> <b>item,</b> despite the presence of inconsistency. However, their use of variable items reflected their input. Participants exposed to consistent patterns produced consistent patterns, and participants exposed to inconsistency reproduced that inconsistency; they did not make the language more consistent. The meaning of the inconsistent item had no effect. In Experiment 2 we taught adults and 5 - to 7 -year-old children a similar artificial language. As in Experiment 1, the adults did not regularize the language. However, many children did regularize the language, imposing patterns that were not the same as their input. These results suggest that children and adults do not learn from variable input in the same way. Moreover, they suggest that children may play a unique and important role in creole formation by regularizing grammatical patterns...|$|E

In particular, attention {{has been focused on}} typicality of words produced on semantic verbal fluency tasks, because the tendency to produce only the more typical members of various categories points to an impoverishment of semantic memory. The aim of our study was to compare in aMCI, AD, and control subjects a lexical (word frequency) and a lexical-semantic <b>variable</b> (<b>item</b> typicality) in a semantic verbal fluency task, and to evaluate the possible value of these variables in predicting conversion from aMCI to AD during a 2 years follow-up period. We found no difference in mean typicality of words produced by aMCI and AD subjects whereas both groups produced words of higher mean typicality than control subjects. Furthermore, to assess the relationship between typicality values and risk of conversion to AD, the aMCI group was split in two subgroups, including subjects who obtained a mean typicality value lower or higher than the median value of the whole aMCI group.

A pupil received two points if he spelled a given word correctly, and zero points if he spelled it incorrectly. This re-sulted directly in a percentage score that could range from zero through 100, a very common method of scoring to this day.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 The Thurstone-Mosteller and Bradley-Terry Models are {{commonly}} used to rank items from paired comparisons experiments in which one item in each pair "wins," and to assess the importance of time-independent explanatory variables on such rankings. The {{first part of this}} thesis clarifies the use of probit and logistic regression models for such designs, including the incorporation of time-dependent explanatory variables and the analysis of unbalanced designs. In addition, likelihood inference, using the EM Algorithm, is proposed for Thurstone's Case HI Model allowing the estimation of variance parameters to account for <b>variable</b> <b>item</b> performances. The second half of this thesis presents an extension of the model to permitting the "performances" or "worths" of each competitor to be serially correlated. As an example, the performance of a basketball team in its current game is allowed to be correlated with its performance from the previous game. The Thurstone-Mosteller Model is sometimes motivated through the use of an underlying, normally-distributed performance distribution for each item or competitor, with a competitor winning a trial if a draw from its performance distribution exceeds that from its competitor's. The observed outcome is solely the win or loss for each team, but regression models, using either time-dependent or time-independent explanatory variables, may be specified for the performance means. The extension in this thesis comes from supposing the error structure for the performance distribution for each team is normal with first-order autocorrelation. The EM Algorithm is used, treating the underlying draws from the performance distributions as "missing data. " This provides approximate maximum likelihood estimates; the approximation is due to the use of Monte Carlo integration in the E-step of the algorithm. Unfortunately, the heavy computational requirement and the inability to calculate the maximized likelihood function or the information matrix, make the approach unattractive for practical use. Two approximations are presented, however, which can be carried out with standard routines and some minor programming.

It examines the commentaries on three <b>variable</b> usage <b>items</b> (-ise/-ize spellings, alright v. all right, and data in singular/plural agreement) in dictionaries, style manuals and usage guides published in Australia and Britain from 1966 to 1995. The treatment of each usage item in terms of prescription/proscription or acceptance is then compared with quantitative evidence of actual usage, using (a) a set of standard corpora (Australian and British) from 1966 to 1995, and (b) twenty-first century data from the internet (Google searches of Australian and UK sites). Changes in relative frequencies of the variants for each pair are then analysed as reflections of the standardization process and/or the putative hyperstandardizing influence of usage commentaries. Despite markedly different treatments in Australian and British references, the trends for the three <b>variable</b> usage <b>items</b> in twenty-first century English are found to be much the same. Hyperstandardization may be seen where prescribed spellings replace the alternatives previously available; but the outcomes for the other <b>variable</b> <b>items</b> suggest they are rationalized by common usage sooner or later, whether the local usage commentary is prescriptive or descriptive. 18 page(s...|$|R
