25|$|In November 1996, Mike Eidson, a Miami attorney, {{said in an}} {{interview}} that many of the passengers had survived the initial impact but had drowned afterward. Eidson represented 41 passengers and crew in a lawsuit contending that the aircraft's manufacturer, Boeing, bore responsibility for the disaster, as the company ought to have foreseen the misuse of its products. The suit was filed against Boeing in federal court in Miami in May 1997. According to the complaint, the flightdeck errors were caused by careless maintenance by Aeroperú and negligence and defective design by Boeing. Boeing argued that it was not at fault, and that responsibility for the accident lay with the employee who did not remove the tape from the static ports, and the aircraft's pilot for not noticing the tape still applied by <b>visual</b> <b>check.</b> Richard Rodriguez of the NTSB said that it was understandable that Schreiber did not find the tape because the maintenance worker had used duct tape instead of the brightly colored tape that he was supposed to use. In addition, Rodriguez said that the pitot-static ports were high above the ground. Therefore, Schreiber could not have seen the tape against the fuselage. After extensive litigation, the parties agreed to transfer the case against Boeing and Aeroperú to an international arbitration in Santiago, Chile, for a determination of the damages. The defendants agreed not to contest liability in Chile.|$|E

2500|$|The US {{continued}} the blockade; {{in the following}} days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet R-12 missile bases located in the Caribbean region. The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final <b>visual</b> <b>check</b> as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet IL-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6.

5000|$|New York—annually. Newly {{registered}} {{vehicles with}} a current inspection sticker from another state are exempt until the out-of-state sticker expires or {{for one year}} after registration in New York, whichever is sooner. Model year 1996 and newer vehicles are subject to an OBD-II emissions inspection, while older cars receive a <b>visual</b> <b>check</b> of emissions components. Until December 31, 2010, vehicles registered in the five boroughs of New York City, {{as well as on}} Long Island, in Westchester County or in Rockland County required a tailpipe smog-test if they are not OBD II equipped (they now receive a visual only check of emissions control devices). All OBD II vehicles in those areas (1996 model year or newer, 1997 and newer for diesel) require and OBD II test plus a <b>visual</b> <b>check</b> of emissions components. Any vehicle 26 model years old or more does not require an emissions check of any sort, and vehicles 2 model years old or newer are exempt. Diesel trucks over 8500 lbs. GVWR are required to have a diesel emissions inspection if they are registered in the NYC metropolitan area.|$|E

40|$|Failure {{to perform}} {{appropriate}} <b>visual</b> <b>checks</b> at intersections {{may have contributed}} to the 2069 cyclist fatalities in the European Union in 2015. This study investigates whether and when car drivers perform <b>visual</b> <b>checks</b> for potentially encroaching cyclists during right-turn maneuvers at urban intersections. UDrive naturalistic data from instrumented vehicles in France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Great Britain were used. The dataset consisted of 852 right-turn maneuvers (UK: left-turn, throughout this document) across 56 drivers. In the six seconds prior to the maneuver, drivers checked their blind spot in 4 % of the cases. This frequency increased to 8 % when the maneuver was included. The prevalence of cyclist facilities was highest in the Netherlands, which is also the country where blind spot checks were performed most often. When not checking the blind spot, drivers mostly looked toward the road they were turning into. Country predicted neither the timing of sideway glances, nor whether there was any (right) sideways glance. Our findings may inform driver training to increase awareness of cyclists at urban intersections, as well as the design of other traffic safety measures...|$|R
40|$|Researchers use {{multiple}} {{methods for}} data checking. Each method can help identify and fix errors that were introduced during {{the data entry}} process. Fixing the errors that were introduced during the data entry process increases {{the accuracy of the}} research results. Accuracy is impor­tant because if a researcher publishes inaccurate results other researchers {{would not be able to}} replicate those results and draw the same conclusions. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of four different data checking methods: double entry with one person, double en­try with two people, <b>visual</b> <b>checking,</b> and solo read aloud. So far, previous research has shown that double entry is more accurate than <b>visual</b> <b>checking</b> (Barchard 2 ̆ 6 Pace, 2011) and partner read aloud (Kawado, Hinotsu, Matsuyama, Yamaguchi, Hashimoto, 2 ̆ 6 Ohashi, 2003). Although there has not been many studies done on the comparison of these four methods and only one study has used solo read aloud, double entry has been shown to produce the highest quality data. I therefore hypothesize that the two double entry methods will have the highest accuracy...|$|R

At this time, HPV test for males are used only in research.|$|E
