5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, {{ignoring}} {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of booty.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government literature was outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E

5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E

5|$|By late 1989, the Communist Parties of {{the republics}} of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania had largely been {{weakened}} in power. In Nagorno-Karabakh, the intercommunal relations between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had worsened due to violence and pogroms. Gorbachev's policies hastened {{the collapse of the}} Soviet system and many Armenians and Azerbaijanis sought protection by arming themselves with Soviet military weaponry. His preoccupation in dealing with the numerous demands by the other republics saw the disappearance of <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and other small arms munitions stored in caches throughout Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the conquest of Egypt in 30 BCE regular {{commerce}} began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians. The Roman Senate {{tried in vain to}} prohibit the wearing of silk, for economic reasons as well as moral ones. The import of Chinese silk resulted in <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of gold leaving Rome, {{to such an extent that}} silk clothing was perceived as a sign of decadence and immorality.|$|E
5|$|Tarrare (c.1772–1798), {{sometimes}} spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, {{noted for}} his unusual eating habits. Able to eat <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of meat, {{he was constantly}} hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned {{out of the family}} home as a teenager. He travelled France {{in the company of a}} band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction could trigger multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E
5|$|The total {{casualty}} {{figures for}} North Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, Hmong, and Thai units are unknown. According to official Vietnamese history, the VPA 41st Special Forces Battalion lost one soldier killed and two wounded in their fight for Lima Site 85. Against those losses, the Vietnamese claimed {{a total of}} 42 Hmong and Thai soldiers were killed, {{and a number of}} others were wounded. A large number of weapons were captured by the NVA, including one 105mm howitzer, one 85mm artillery piece, four recoilless rifles, four heavy mortars, nine heavy machine guns, and <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of ammunition. The North Vietnamese victory proved to be a significant one, as they had succeeded in knocking out a major asset of the USAF, which had inflicted heavy damages to North Vietnam's limited industrial infrastructures.|$|E
5|$|While {{religion}} {{played a}} role in politics, politics also {{played a role}} in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the laity. In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative Inexhaustible Treasury, which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their banking practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.|$|E

5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of ore from the northern mines to the steel mills. In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Snow {{hurricane}} (also {{known as}} the Storm of October1804) was the first tropical cyclone in recorded history known to produce snowfall, with Hurricane Ginny in 1963 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 being the next such systems to do so. An unusual late-season storm in 1804, it yielded <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of snow, rain, and powerful winds across the northeastern United States. Prior to its approach towards the East Coast of the United States, it passed through the Caribbean Sea on 4October, and later emerged near Georgetown, South Carolina. By early on 9 October, a trough near the Virginia Capes turned the disturbance toward New England. Soon thereafter, the hurricane's abundant moisture clashed with an influx of cold Canadian air, leading to the deepening of the resulting pressure gradient and provoking inland intensification. While situated over Massachusetts, it attained its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), undergoing an extratropical transition. Even as it drifted towards the Canadian maritimes, consequently gradually weakening, precipitation persisted for another {{two days before the}} snowstorm finally subsided on 11October.|$|E
5|$|The American Revolutionary War was a {{war between}} the nation of England and the 13 colonies in the North American continent. This war lasted from 1775 to 1783 and began with the Battle of Bunker Hill, where over 1,150 British {{soldiers}} were killed or wounded. This equated to {{almost half of the}} entire British army that were present at the engagement. American casualties were far less severe, totaling an estimated at 450 killed and wounded. The British, however, were able to take the ground and push the newly formed Continental Army back to the city of Boston, which also soon fell to British forces. Before the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April, 1775, saw British troops begin their assault into the American colonies. British troops were searching for colonist supply depots, however, were met by heavy resistance and the British forces were turned around at Concord by outnumbering Minutemen forces. On July 4, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was signed by the Second Continental Congress and officially declared the colonies of North America to be a sovereign nation, free from England’s rule. Also, the Congress permitted funding for a Continental Army, which is the first instance of an American political body handling military affairs. The British were dominating {{in the beginning of the}} war, holding off Continental regulars and militia and gaining <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> of territory throughout North America. However, the tide began to turn for the colonists in 1777 with their first major victory over British forces at the Battle of Saratoga. Victory for the rest of the war pushed back and forth between the British and colonists, but the alliance with France in 1778 by the American colonists leveled the playing field and aided in the final push for the defeat of the British Army and Navy. In 1781, American and French forces were able to trap the escaping southern British Army at Yorktown, thus ending the major fighting of the Revolution. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, and recognized the American colonies as an independent nation. The newly formed United States would undergo numerous transitions to becoming one of the top economic and military powers in the world.|$|E
