5000|$|Triadica sebifera, {{also known}} as Sapium sebiferum, is {{commonly}} known as the Chinese tallow, Chinese tallowtree, Florida aspen, chicken tree, gray popcorn tree, and candleberry tree. [...] The tree is native to eastern Asia, and is most commonly associated with eastern China, Taiwan, and Japan. In these regions, the waxy coating of the seeds is used for candle and soap making, and the leaves are used as herbal medicine to treat boils. The plant sap and leaves are reputed to be toxic, and decaying leaves from the plant are toxic to other species of plant. The specific epithets sebifera and sebiferum mean [...] "wax-bearing" [...] and refer to the <b>vegetable</b> <b>tallow</b> that coats the seeds.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Seeds were {{collected}} from locally and naturally grown Chinese tallow trees (CTT) and characterized for general {{physical and chemical properties}} and fatty acid composition of the lipids. The effects of four different solvents (petroleum ether, hexane, diethyl ether, and 95 % ethanol) and two extraction methods (supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) and conventional Soxhlet) on the properties of the CTT seed oil, including Chinese <b>vegetable</b> <b>tallow</b> (CVT) and stillingia oil (SO), were also investigated. In general, the yields of CVT and SO did not vary based on solvent for Soxhlet extraction and solvent-free SC-CO 2 extraction, except that the yield of CVT from SC-CO 2 extraction was substantially lower. Nevertheless, the CTT seed oil, extracted by SC-CO 2 displayed better quality than those extracted by Soxhlet extraction in terms of color, residual precipitation, and acid value of the oils. The pretreatment of CTT seed by 3 % aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution likely promoted the hydrolysis o...|$|E

5000|$|A {{chemical}} tanker {{is a type}} of tanker ship designed to transport chemicals in bulk. As defined in MARPOL Annex II, {{chemical tanker}} means a ship constructed or adapted for carrying in bulk any liquid product listed in chapter 17 of the International Bulk Chemical Code. [...] As well as industrial chemicals and clean petroleum products, such ships also often carry other types of sensitive cargo which require a high standard of tank cleaning, such as palm oil, <b>vegetable</b> oils, <b>tallow,</b> caustic soda, and methanol.|$|R
50|$|Kerosene {{lighting}} {{was much}} more efficient and less expensive than <b>vegetable</b> oils, <b>tallow</b> and whale oil. Although town gas lighting was available in some cities, kerosene produced a brighter light until {{the invention of the}} gas mantle. Both were replaced by electricity for street lighting following the 1890s and for households during the 1920s. Gasoline was an unwanted byproduct of oil refining until automobiles were mass-produced after 1914, and gasoline shortages appeared during World War I. The invention of the Burton process for thermal cracking doubled the yield of gasoline, which helped alleviate the shortages.|$|R

Candles provide illumination and can help start a fire. Alcohol, DIY and commercial alcohol stoves are made and carried by hikers. Oil, petroleum, <b>vegetable,</b> and <b>tallow</b> can help start and feed a fire. Propane bottles are made for backpacking. Charcoal or briquettes could be packed in the fire.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{feedstock}} used in biodiesel production include yellow grease (recycled vegetable oil), [...] "virgin" [...] <b>vegetable</b> oil, and <b>tallow.</b> Recycled oil {{is processed}} to remove impurities from cooking, storage, and handling, such as dirt, charred food, and water. Virgin oils are refined, {{but not to}} a food-grade level. Degumming to remove phospholipids and other plant matter is common, though refinement processes vary.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} Biodiesel from various <b>vegetables</b> and <b>tallow</b> oils. The {{objective}} of this thesis is to produce the biodiesel from various feedstocks which are palm oil, corn oil, chicken fat oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil and waste cooking oil and also to analyze the physical properties each of biodiesel oil. The thesis describes the proper biodiesel extraction process, using proper catalyst and solvent {{in order to get}} the biodiesel physical properties standard of B 100, ASTM 6571. The studies of physical properties of biodiesel that are involved in this thesis consist of density, viscosity, cetanenumber, flash point, cloud and pour point and also acid value. As result, we observedthat palm oil has a nearest physical properties standard, ASTM 6571. We comparedthese six different feedstock physical properties with some literature. As for therecommendation, conduct engine testing operating with various biodiesel and also perform one-dimensional simulation of internal combustion engine which operating with simulation such as GT-Power...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of biodiesel {{as an alternative}} to fossil fuels has gained world interest nowadays due to global energy crisis and environmental awareness. Biodiesel is the preferred choice because it is environmental friendly as it decreases the possibility of acid rain and greenhouse effect by reducing the emission amount of COx, SOx and hydrocarbons that are incompletely burned during fuel combustion compared to diesel 1. The strict regulations made {{by the environmental protection agency}} (EPA) to reduce the noxious emissions and the governmental legislations have motivated the biodiesel industry to formulate the new makeup diesel/biodiesel blends (B 10 and B 20) 2. According to research by US Geological Oil and Gas Journal (1995 - 2000), Malaysia petroleum resources only can last for less than 50 more years 3. Despite new oil reservoir discoveries in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Tupi and Guara fields off South-East Brazil, Sudan, the Caspian Sea, Sakhalin, and in the Artic 4, fossil fuels is no longer reliable as it is expensive and depleting sources. Biodiesel sources are renewable as it can be produced from <b>vegetable</b> oil, <b>tallow,</b> lard and waste cooking oil 5. Vegetable oil can be categorized into two, edible and non-edible. Numerous research of biodiesel has been made using edible feedstock like palm, soybean, and sunflower oils. However, considering that edible vegetable oils are expensive, researchers has prompted to establish a cheap feedstock for biodiesel from non-edible crops. This study reports a catalyst screening process for biodiesel production from Moringa oil via transesterification process using various heterogeneous catalysts with methanol. The reaction condition is fixed throughout the process which are 3 wt. % catalyst loading, 9 : 1 methanol to oil ratio, reaction temperature of 60 oC and 60 min reaction duration to determine the best catalyst for the biodiesel conversion from Moringa oil...|$|R
