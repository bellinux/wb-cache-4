The distinguishing feature of the ATP is that the drying and pyrolysis of the oil shale or other feed, {{as well as the}} combustion, recycling, and cooling of spent materials and residues, all occur within a single rotating multi-chamber horizontal retort. Its feed consists of fine particles.In its shale-oil applications, fine particles (less than 25 mm in diameter) are fed into the preheat tubes of the retort, where they are dried and preheated to [...] indirectly by hot shale ash and hot flue gas. In the pyrolysis zone, oil shale particles are mixed with hot shale ash and the pyrolysis is performed at temperatures between [...] and [...] The resulting shale oil vapor is withdrawn from the retort through a <b>vapour</b> <b>tube</b> and recovered by condensation in other equipment. The char residues, mixed with ash, are moved to the combustion zone, and burnt at about [...] to form shale ash. Part of the ash is delivered to the pyrolysis zone, where its heat is recycled as a hot solid carrier; the other part is removed and cooled in the cooling zone with the combustion gases by heat transfer to the feed oil shale.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a comprehensive modelling and simulation of a heat-driven gravity-assisted solution pump for an aqua ammonia absorption refrigeration unit. The pump {{is essentially a}} hermetic vessel located at an intermediate elevation between the absorber and generator. It is connected to both components with <b>vapour</b> and liquid <b>tubes.</b> The flow in the <b>vapour</b> <b>tubes</b> is controlled by solenoid valves, while a regulating valve and two non-return valves are incorporated in the liquid tubes. The developed pump overcomes the leakage problem which is still a major constraint in developing ammonia-water refrigeration and heat pumping systems of small capacities. The simulation results revealed that {{the diameter of the}} pump vessel has no effect on its flow rate. The elevation differences have a slight effect on the flow rate. The most important parameters are the diameter of the liquid tubes and the pressure loss coefficients of the incorporated regulating and non-return valves. The obtained results pave the way to implement this type of solution pumps in the development of small capacities ammonia-water absorption refrigeration units...|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} difference which is log mean {{temperature difference}} between the heating media and the boiling liquid must be high enough to generate sufficient ascending force of the steam <b>vapour</b> in the <b>tube</b> side to force the liquid film to flow upwards. In general, the greater the temperature difference, the better {{the driving force of}} the steam. Additionally, having a high temperature difference will also increase the flow rate of the liquid and <b>vapour</b> within the <b>tube.</b> This increase in flow rate causes higher turbulence which results in an increase of the heat transfer coefficient. However, the overall temperature difference has to be within the range of boiling points of the two components as it could affect the quality and the purity of the products.|$|R

50|$|A rising film or {{vertical}} long tube evaporator {{is a type}} of evaporator that {{is essentially}} a vertical shell and tube heat exchanger. The liquid being evaporated is fed from the bottom into long tubes and heated with steam condensing {{on the outside of the}} tube from the shell side. This is to produce steam and <b>vapour</b> within the <b>tube</b> bringing the liquid inside to a boil. The vapour produced then presses the liquid against the walls of the tubes and causes the ascending force of this liquid. As more vapour is formed, the centre of the tube will have a higher velocity which forces the remaining liquid against the tube wall forming a thin film which moves upwards. This phenomenon of the rising film gives the evaporator its name.|$|R

40|$|Evaporative {{emissions}} {{account for}} 15 - 20 % of total hydrocarbon emission from a gasoline engine. Evaporative emissions from {{the fuel tank}} and the carburettor are inevitable from gasoline or gasoline like fuel operating vehicle because of their highly evaporative nature.

40|$|Evapotranspiration is {{a source}} of water vapour to the atmosphere, and as a crucial {{indicator}} of landscape behaviour its accurate measurement has widespread implications. Here we investigate errors that are prevalent and systematic in the closed-path eddy-covariance measurement of latent heat flux: the attenuation of fluxes through dampened cospectral power at high frequencies. This process is especially pronounced during periods of high relative humidity through the adsorption and desorption of water <b>vapour</b> along the <b>tube</b> walls. These effects are additionally amplified during lower air temperature conditions. Here, we quantify the underestimation of evapotranspiration by a closed-path system by comparing its flux estimate to simultaneous and adjacent measurements from an open-path sensor. We apply models relating flux loss to relative humidity itself, to the lag time of the cross-correlation peak between the water vapour and vertical wind velocity signals, and to models of cospectral attenuation relative to the cospectral power of simultaneous sensible heat-flux measurements. We find that including the role of temperature in modifying the attenuation-humidity relationship is essential for unbiased flux correction, and that physically based cospectral attenuation methods are effective characterizers of closed-path instrument signal loss relative to the unattenuated flux value...|$|R

Of all fluxes, the latent heat flux &#x 2013; as measured with a closed-path gas analyser &#x 2013; was most prone to systematic calculation errors due to water <b>vapour</b> interactions with <b>tube</b> walls: using a lag window that is too small can cause a 15 % lack of data (due to the dependency of lag time on relative humidity) and omitting spectral corrections can cause on average a 26 % underestimation of the flux.
