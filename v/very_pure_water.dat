6000|$|There are old yew-trees {{of unknown}} antiquity in this garden, {{and many other}} {{interesting}} things; and among them may be reckoned a fountain of <b>very</b> <b>pure</b> <b>water,</b> called the [...] "Holy Well," [...] of which we drank.

Coming in front of the Abbey, the gardener showed us the oak that Byron planted, now a vigorous young tree; and the monument which he erected to his Newfoundland dog, and which is larger than most Christians get, being composed of a marble, altar-shaped tomb, surrounded by a circular area of steps, as much as twenty feet in diameter. The gardener said, however, that Byron intended this, not merely as the burial-place of his dog, but for himself too, and his sister. I know not how this may have been, but this inconvenience would have attended his being buried there, that, on transfer of the estate, his mortal remains would have become the property of some other man.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{there is}} {{continuous}} withdrawal of steam and continuous {{return of condensate}} to the boiler, losses due to blowdown and leakages {{have to be made}} up to maintain a desired water level in the boiler steam drum. For this, continuous make-up water is added to the boiler water system. Impurities in the raw water input to the plant generally consist of calcium and magnesium salts which impart hardness to the water. Hardness in the make-up water to the boiler will form deposits on the tube water surfaces which will lead to overheating and failure of the tubes. Thus, the salts have to be removed from the water, and that is done by a water demineralising treatment plant (DM). A DM plant generally consists of cation, anion, and mixed bed exchangers. [...] Any ions in the final water from this process consist essentially of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions, which recombine to form <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Very</b> <b>pure</b> DM <b>water</b> becomes highly corrosive once it absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere because of its very high affinity for oxygen.|$|R

At the time of these studies many mycologists thought that calcium {{played a role in}} fungal morphology and were disinclined to believe that the labelling of agents such as the chelator EGTA and the ionophore A23187 could have been incorrectly said to be specific for calcium in many studies. Indeed it is still not clear how the error occurred because stability constants for EGTA chelated with Fe, Zn and Mn had been published before any claim of specificity for Ca. Calculations of the availability of free ions of essential divalent cations like Fe and Zn showed that experiments with EGTA were better explained as having caused deficiencies in these essential ions. Classical demonstration of the requirements for trace metals requires careful cleaning of all glassware or plastic dishes and the use of <b>very</b> <b>pure</b> distilled <b>water,</b> and AR grade chemicals. By this method A.macrogynus and Achlya species were shown to require Fe, and Zn but not Ca. The traditional supply of calcium salts to fungal cultures may have met the need for trace elements as even A.R. calcium salts always contain other divalent cations.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to develop a method to {{simulate}} the transfer conditions (energy and water) of spray-drying. Typical curves were registered with the water activity meter on water, dairy and food concentrates (Fig 1.) [1]. These curves showed that the relative humidity (RH) from the pressure sensor as a function of time can be represented by a sigmoid equation. Two phases can be identified on the curves obtained for <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> and milk concentrates: Initially, at the beginning of desorption, there was a constant RH (ie rate of drying) phase. This constant phase corresponds to free water evaporation. The second phase was the falling rate period, which was <b>very</b> short for <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> and much longer for milk concentrates, whatever the total solid content. We assumed that this corresponded to the evaporation of bound water, which involves extra energy (EE) in order to overcome binding (indirectly the bound strength of water). The area under the curve of each part thus represents the amounts of free and bound water desorbed, respectively. EE is calculated as a function of the drying kinetics according to the desorption curves (Fig 1.). When the drying kinetic of a concentrate is similar to the drying kinetic of <b>pure</b> <b>water,</b> no EE is required. If the drying kinetic is two slower, energy requirement is two higher than for <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> The difference with the latent heat of evaporation required for <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> determines EE. The calculation method to determine EE was computerized to obtain new software (SD 2 P®, Spray Drying Parameter Simulation & Determination). From the desorption curve, the software SD 2 P® (Spray Drying Parameters Simulation & Determination) is a way, among others, to predict the value of these parameters when they are not known [2, 3]. The combined results provide more precise determination of spray-drying parameters (including inlet/outlet air temperature, mass/powder flow rate, powder temperature, etc.), powder state during spray-drying (stickiness) and the cost of spray-drying with respect to weather conditions (Fig 2). Several cases will be presented to show the interest of this strategy in order to anticipate the spray-drying parameters and the powder behavior...|$|R

40|$|TutorialSince the {{introduction}} of mechanical seals in nuclear boiling water reactor (BWR) feed pumps operating with high drive ratings, keeping mechanical seal reliability high became a challenge. A problem also encountered in fossil feed pump applications using similar electrically low conductive feed water, referred to as Combined Water Treated (CWT) feed water operation. After a short number of operating hours, rotating seal faces made from various kinds of silicon- or tungsten carbide materials show severe forms of edge chipping and crater type damages, while the opposing carbon graphite seal faces, may display a significant loss of seal face binder material, which inevitably results {{in the formation of}} uncontrolled radial flow channels across the seal face gap. A unique phenomenon referred to as ?seal face generated electro corrosion? (EC). This tutorial discusses the pragmatic approach, which was applied to investigate what major contributing factors {{play a role in the}} development of seal face generated electro corrosion and how it can be avoided.

40|$|In this paper, {{the average}} heat {{transfer}} characteristics for a cross flow cylinder of 16 mm diameter in a vertical pipe {{has been studied}} for single-phase flow (water/oil) and multicomponent (non-boiling) flow (water-air, water-oil, oil-air and water-oil-air). The cylinder is uniformly heated by electrical heater placed at {{the centre of the}} element. The results show that the values of average heat transfer coefficients for water are around four times the values for oil flow. Introducing air as a second phase with water has very little effect on heat transfer rate, while the heat transfer increased by 70 % in case of oil. For water–oil flow, the heat transfer coefficient values are reflecting the percentage of water up to 50 %, but increasing the water more than 50 % leads to a sharp increase in the heat transfer coefficients to become close to the values of <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> The enhancement of heat transfer by mixing two phases may be attributed to the changes in flow structure near to cylinder surface which lead to thinner boundary layer and higher turbulence. For three-phase flow, the heat transfer coefficients for all cases fall within the limit of single-phase flow of water and oil and are <b>very</b> close to <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> values.

40|$|Acid {{mine water}} from a South African gold mine was characterised and treated by the {{precipitation}} of heavy metals with lime and sulphides, followed by ion exchange. The novelty of the proposed process lies {{in the use of}} carrier magnetic materials for more effective separation of water and solids, as well as the oxidation pretreatment that is also used to sterilize the water. The process can generate <b>very</b> <b>pure</b> <b>water</b> from acid mine water with a great flexibility and an acceptable cost. The oxidation and precipitation of heavy metals with lime and subsequent sulphide-carrier magnetic separation appeared to be particularly suitable for the removal of heavy metal ions from the effluent of the particular gold mine that was investigated. The cation exchange resin IR 120 can be used to reduce the salinity of the effluent of mine water after removal of heavy metals by precipitation. Low cost sulphuric acid can be used as the cation resin regenerator. The anion exchange resin A 375 could reduce the anions (sulphate, chloride, bromide and fluoride) to acceptably low levels in the mine water after precipitation of heavy metals. A combination of sodium hydroxide and saturated lime solution can be used as the anion resin regenerator. A mixture of acidic gypsum from the cation elution section and alkaline gypsum from the anion elution section could generate high quality gypsum as by-product, which could be sold as a valuable raw material to the gypsum industry, to offset process cost. Although these experiments were conducted on the acid mine water of a specific mine, the process could be extended to other mine waters contaminated with heavy metals and high salinities.

40|$|Membrane {{distillation}} desalination is {{an emerging}} technology {{with a promise}} to considerably reduce environmental impacts associated with traditional desalination technologies such as thermal and reverse osmosis. Various membrane module configurations {{have been reported in}} the literature. The most popular configuration reported in the literature was the direct contact and can be used for both flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes. The literature study has shown that the bulk of studies involved either flat sheet or hollow fiber modules separately and no single study involved both configurations in a single research work. This investigation was therefore aimed at comparing the flux performance of flat sheet and hollow fiber direct contact modules under similar conditions using real seawater from the Qatar coastal area of the Arabian Gulf. Our work has shown that the flat sheet direct contact membrane distillation module gave consistently higher fluxes than the hollow fiber module. The highest flux measured for the flat sheet module at 65 C and 3 L/min was 37. 1 L/m 2. h compared to 5. 2 L/m 2. h for the hollow fiber module under identical experimental conditions. The large difference in flux between the flat sheet module and the hollow fiber module was explained in terms of difference in flow regime and convective heat transport in the flow compartment of the two modules. The flow channel Reynolds numbers ranged between 283 to 770 for the flat sheet module while the Reynolds numbers ranged between 106 to 287 for the hollow fiber module. Our work also indicated that the Nusselt number Nu can be as much as 11 times higher for the flat sheet module than for the hollow fiber. This clearly indicates that the convective heat transfer coefficient in the hot side is much greater in the flat sheet module than in the hollow fiber module. The maximum hot side convective heat transfer coefficient for the flat sheet module was estimated to be 17044 W/m 2. h compared to 2163 W/m 2. h for the hollow fiber module. The values of thermal coefficients obtained in this work were consistent with literature values. The observed salt rejection for all used membranes is above 99. 8 % thus confirming the ability of DCMD desalination to produce <b>very</b> <b>pure</b> <b>water.</b> This work has shown that more work needs to be done in hollow fiber module design to enhance flow turbulence and therefore improve convective thermal coefficients which will lead to higher permeate fluxes.

5000|$|A spring creek {{is a type}} of {{free flowing}} river whose name derives from its origin: an {{underground}} spring or set of springs which produces sufficient water to consistently feed a unique river. The water flowing in a spring creek may additionally be fed by snow pack or rain run-off, as in most traditional free-flowing rivers, but often the entire water source for a spring creek is an aquifer or other underground water source. For this reason, spring creeks are often filled with <b>very</b> <b>pure,</b> clean <b>water</b> and also demonstrate water flows that are smooth, consistent, and unwavering throughout the seasons of the year - unlike rivers filled with run-off or spring and summer melt-off from snow pack, whose water flows, water clarity, and water conditions often vary highly {{over the course of the}} year. In addition, water temperatures in spring creeks tend to vary less throughout the seasons of the year than traditional creeks and rivers because they are fed by underground water sources. Because of the depths of these water sources, spring creeks often emerge from their source or headwaters very cold and stay that way over the length of their runs. In addition, due to the consistent water flows and the fact that spring creek water is [...] "pushed" [...] by the force of pressure from the source rather than [...] "pulled" [...] by the force of gravity downhill, spring creeks can flow through very flat sections of land with minimal depths over grades that might not sustain run-off creeks and rivers. In these low-grade or flat sections of spring creeks, water flows can appear almost laminar with the surface of the creek appearing to be nearly flat and without the prominent riffles and surface disturbances caused by more rough or uneven surface bottoms found below free-stone run-off creeks and rivers surfaces.|$|R
