50|$|Drawn by the großer Berggeschrey (“Great Call of the Mountains”) to the Ore Mountains in the 16th century (silver, tin, cobalt, white {{earth and}} gravel mining), many {{settlers}} came {{here from the}} Harz Mountains and found a new home. Bockau received status as a mining area, comparable to status as a mining town, although Bockau was not actually considered a town. Specialists and academics, too, settled here. In 1750, Gottlieb Lorenz introduced <b>vitriolic</b> <b>acid</b> distilling into Bockau. From gravelly ores mined in the area, such as pyrite, which yield sulphur salts (vitriol) came, after weeks of heating and “cooking” in stone vats, concentrated sulphuric acid, also called <b>vitriolic</b> <b>acid.</b> This was put to use in medicine and was an important raw material for both inorganic and organic chemistry. About 1760 there were already 7 vitriol plants in town, and by 1812 there were 24 distilleries in operation. Important sidelines for the farmers were tree felling, charcoal making, resin harvesting (this was limited by decree to a patch of the woods known as the Harzweide, or “resin meadow”, to prevent widespread damage to the forest https://web.archive.org/web/20081120185657/http://www.beerheide.net/home/geschichte.htmhttp://www.wanderer-familie.de/html/genealogie.html) and log driving.|$|E

Ledyard proposed an expedition from the Red Sea to the Atlantic.He arrived in Alexandria in August 1788, but the expedition was slow to start.Late in November 1788, Ledyard accidentally poisoned himself with <b>vitriolic</b> <b>acid</b> (sulfuric acid) and died in Cairo, Egypt on 10 January 1789.John Ledyard {{was buried in the}} sand dunes lining the Nile, in a modestly marked grave, the location of which is unknown today.|$|E
50|$|Early in the 16th century, {{iron ore}} {{was found by}} the monks from the Grünhain Monastery at the Emmlerfelsen, which {{triggered}} the establishment of mining, foundries and ironworks in and around Raschau. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, other stone worthy of mining was found at the Raschauer Knochen (551 m), mainly tin ore, iron ore and gravel, and also small amounts of silver, whereupon new lodes began to be mined, although their yields were mostly only small. Only two of Raschau’s pits brought rich deposits to light. The Allerheiligen-Fundgrube (“All Hallows Lode”) worked, besides silver, bismuth and cobalt ores, also gravel, which served as the basis for sulphur and <b>vitriolic</b> <b>acid</b> making. The Seegen Gottes (“God’s Blessing”) Lode brought up silver and tin ores.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{publication}} of the first volume of Experiments and Observations, Priestley undertook another set of experiments. In August 1774 he isolated an [...] "air" [...] that appeared to be completely new, but he did not have an opportunity to pursue the matter because he was about to tour Europe with Shelburne. While in Paris, however, Priestley managed to replicate the experiment for others, including Antoine Lavoisier. After returning to Britain in January 1775, he continued his experiments and discovered <b>vitriolic</b> <b>acid</b> air (sulphur dioxide, SO2). In March he wrote to several people regarding the new [...] "air" [...] that he had discovered several months earlier. One of these letters was read aloud to the Royal Society, and he published a paper in Philosophical Transactions titled [...] "An Account of further Discoveries in Air." [...] Priestley called the new substance [...] "dephlogisticated air" [...] and described it as [...] "five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air." [...] He had discovered oxygen gas (O2). As revised for Experiments and Observations, his paper begins:The contents of this section will furnish a very striking illustration of the truth of a remark which I have more than once made in my natural philosophical writings … that more is owing to what we call chance—that is, philosophically speaking, to the observations of events rising from unknown causes than to any proper design or preconceived theory in this business. … For my own part, I will frankly acknowledge that at the commencement of my experiments recited in this section I was so far from having formed any hypothesis that led to the discoveries I made in pursuing them that they would have appeared very improbable to me had I been told of them; and when the decisive facts did at length obtrude themselves upon my notice it was very slowly, and with great hesitation, that I yielded to the evidence of my senses. Priestley'sPriestley assembled his oxygen paper and several others into a second volume of Experiments and Observations on Air and published it in 1776. He does not emphasise his discovery of [...] "dephlogisticated air" [...] (leaving it to Part III of the volume) but instead argues in the preface how important such discoveries are to rational religion. His paper narrates the discovery chronologically, relating the long delays between experiments and his initial puzzlements. Thus, {{it is difficult to determine}} when exactly Priestley [...] "discovered" [...] oxygen. Such dating is significant as Lavoisier and Swedish pharmacist Carl Wilhelm Scheele both have strong claims to the discovery of oxygen as well, Scheele having been first to isolate the gas (although he published after Priestley) and Lavoisier having been first to describe it as purified [...] "air itself entire without alteration" [...] (not [...] "dephlogisticated air").|$|E
