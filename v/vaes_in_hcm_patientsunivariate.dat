40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} if patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), both with and without myocardial fibrosis, have altered aortic stiffness as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurements. BackgroundAbnormal aortic stiffness implies an unfavorable prognosis and has been established in a variety of aortic diseases and ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, the relationship between aortic stiffness and HCM has not been studied previously. MethodsThe study was institutional review board approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 compliant. Velocity-encoded MRI was performed <b>in</b> 100 <b>HCM</b> and 35 normal control subjects. PWV was determined between the mid-ascending and -descending thoracic aorta. Delayed-enhancement MRI was acquired for identification of myocardial fibrosis. ResultsMean age was 52. 4 years <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> and 45. 3 years in control subjects. The prevalence of myocardial fibrosis <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> was 70 %. PWV was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients compared with control subjects (8. 72 ± 5. 83 m/s vs. 3. 74 ± 0. 86 m/s, p < 0. 0001). PWV was higher (i. e., increased aortic stiffness) <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients with myocardial fibrosis than in those without (9. 66 ± 6. 43 m/s vs. 6. 51 ± 3. 25 m/s, p = 0. 005). ConclusionsIncreased aortic stiffness, as indicated by increased PWV, is evident <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients, and is more pronounced in those with myocardial fibrosis. Further, aortic stiffening may adversely affect left ventricular performance.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} assess {{myocardial}} perfusion and tissue oxygenation during vasodilator stress in patients with overt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), as well as <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> mutation carriers without left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and to compare findings to those in athletes with comparable hypertrophy and normal controls. BACKGROUND: Myocardial perfusion under vasodilator stress is impaired <b>in</b> patients with <b>HCM.</b> Whether this is associated with impaired myocardial oxygenation and tissue ischemia is unknown. Furthermore, {{it is not known}} whether perfusion and oxygenation are impaired <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). METHODS: A total of 27 patients with overt HCM, 10 HCM mutation carriers without LVH, 11 athletes, and 20 healthy controls underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scanning at 3 -T. Myocardial function, perfusion (perfusion reserve index [MPRI]), and oxygenation (blood-oxygen level dependent signal intensity [SI] change) under adenosine stress were assessed. RESULTS: MPRI was significantly reduced <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> (1. 3 ± 0. 1) compared to controls (1. 8 ± 0. 1, p < 0. 001) and athletes (2. 0 ± 0. 1, p < 0. 001), but remained normal <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> mutation carriers without LVH (1. 7 ± 0. 1; p = 0. 61 vs. controls, p = 0. 02 vs. overt HCM). Oxygenation response was attenuated <b>in</b> overt <b>HCM</b> (SI change 6. 9 ± 1. 4 %) compared to controls (18. 9 ± 1. 4 %, p < 0. 0001) and athletes (18. 7 ± 2. 0 %, p < 0. 001).

Background AF is the most common arrhythmia <b>in</b> <b>HCM.</b> Myocardial scarring is also identified frequently <b>in</b> <b>HCM.</b> However, the impact of myocardial scarring assessed by LGE CMR on the presence of AF has not been evaluated yet. Methods 87 HCM patients underwent LGE CMR, echocardiography and regular ECG recordings. LV function, volumes, myocardial thickness, left atrial (LA) volume and the extent of LGE, were assessed using CMR and correlated to AF. Additionally, the presence of diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation were obtained by echocardiography and also correlated to AF. Results Episodes of AF were documented in 37 patients (42 %). Indexed LV volumes and mass were comparable between HCM patients with and without AF. However, indexed LA volume was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients with AF than <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients without AF (68 ± 24 ml·m - 2 versus 46 ± 18 ml·m - 2, p = 0. 0002, respectively). The mean extent of LGE was higher <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients with AF than those without AF (12. 4 ± 14. 5 % versus 6. 0 ± 8. 6 %, p = 0. 02). When adjusting for age, gender and LV mass, LGE and indexed LA volume significantly correlated to AF (r = 0. 34, p = 0. 02 and r = 0. 42, p Conclusion HCM patients with AF display significantly more LGE than HCM patients without AF.

We investigated to what extent myocardial functional defects {{can be explained by}} alterations in the passive and active properties of human cardiac myofibrils. Skinned ventricular myocytes were prepared from patients with obstructive HCM (two patients with MYBPC 3 mutations, one with a MYH 7 mutation, and three with no mutation in either gene) and from four donors. Passive stiffness, viscous properties, and titin isoform expression were similar <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> myocytes and donor myocytes. Maximal Ca 2 +-activated force was much lower <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> myocytes (14 ± 1 kN/m 2) than in donor myocytes (23 ± 3 kN/m 2; P< 0. 01), though cross-bridge kinetics (ktr) during maximal Ca 2 + activation were 10 % faster <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> myocytes. Myofibrillar Ca 2 + sensitivity <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> myocytes (pCa 50 = 6. 40 ± 0. 05) was higher than for donor myocytes (pCa 50 = 6. 09 ± 0. 02; P< 0. 001) and was associated with reduced phosphorylation of troponin-I (ser- 23 / 24) and MyBP-C (ser- 282) <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> myocytes. These characteristics were common to all six HCM patients and may therefore represent a secondary consequence of the known and unknown underlying genetic variants. Some HCM patients did however exhibit an altered relationship between force and cross-bridge kinetics at submaximal Ca 2 + concentrations, which may reflect the primary mutation. We conclude that the passive viscoelastic properties of the myocytes are unlikely to account for the increased stiffness of the HCM ventricle. However, the low maximum Ca 2 +-activated force and high Ca 2 + sensitivity of the myofilaments are likely to contribute substantially to any systolic and diastolic dysfunction, respectively, <b>in</b> hearts of <b>HCM</b> patients...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{examined}} the relationship between peak-to-peak (common invasive measurement), peak instantaneous (common Doppler measurement), and mean pressure gradients in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and aortic stenosis (AS). BackgroundIn patients with AS, the peak-to-peak gradient and peak instantaneous gradient are discrepant, and the mean gradient best represents obstruction severity. The pathophysiology of outflow obstruction differs <b>in</b> <b>HCM,</b> with the maximum gradient occurring in late systole, thus the optimal method for quantifying gradient severity <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> remains undefined. MethodsFifty patients with HCM and 50 patients with AS underwent gradient characterization at cardiac catheterization (age 55 ± 15 years vs. 72 ± 9 years; 48 % vs. 42 % male, respectively). All HCM patients were studied with high-fidelity, micromanometer-tip catheters and transseptal measurement of left ventricular inflow and central aortic pressures. In AS, simultaneous left ventricular and central aortic pressures were recorded. ResultsThe peak instantaneous gradient was linearly correlated with peak-to-peak gradient <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> (R 2 = 0. 98, p < 0. 0001), with the relationship close to the line of identity. In AS, more scatter and further deviation from the line of identity occurred when comparing the peak instantaneous gradient to the peak-to-peak gradient (R 2 = 0. 70, p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Infective {{endocarditis}} (IE) complicating {{hypertrophic cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is a poorly known entity. Although current guidelines do not recommend IE antibiotic prophylaxis (IEAP) <b>in</b> <b>HCM,</b> controversy remains. This {{study sought to}} describe the clinical course of a large series of IE HCM and to compare IE <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients with IE patients with and without an indication for IEAP. Data from the GAMES IE registry involving 27 Spanish hospitals were analyzed. From January 2008 to December 2013, 2000 consecutive IE patients were prospectively included in the registry. Eleven IE HCM additional cases from before 2008 were also studied. Clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic characteristics were analyzed <b>in</b> IE <b>HCM</b> patients (n= 34) and <b>in</b> IE <b>HCM</b> reported <b>in</b> literature (n= 84). Patients with nondevice IE (n= 1807) were classified into 3 groups: group 1, HCM with native-valve IE (n= 26); group 2, patients with IEAP indication (n= 696); group 3, patients with no IEAP indication (n= 1085). IE episode and 1 -year follow-up data were gathered. One-year mortality <b>in</b> IE <b>HCM</b> was 42 % in our study and 22 % in the literature. IE was more frequent, although not exclusive, <b>in</b> obstructive <b>HCM</b> (59 % and 74 %, respectively). Group 1 exhibited more IE predisposing factors than groups 2 and 3 (62 % vs 40 % vs 50 %, P< 0. 01), and more previous dental procedures (23 % vs 6 % vs 8 %, P< 0. 01). Furthermore, Group 1 experienced {{a higher incidence of}} Streptococcus infections than Group 2 (39 % vs 22 %, P< 0. 01) and similar to Group 3 (39 % vs 30 %, P= 0. 34). Overall mortality was similar among groups (42 % vs 36 % vs 35 %, P= 0. 64). IE occurs <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients with and without obstruction. Mortality of IE HCM is high but similar to patients with and without IEAP indication. Predisposing factors, previous dental procedures, and streptococcal infection are higher <b>in</b> IE <b>HCM,</b> suggesting that HCM patients could benefit from IEAP...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the role of atrial function by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) for the evaluation of diastolic physiology in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) compared to healthy controls. Materials and methods: We enrolled 23 consecutive patients affected by HCM and 43 healthy subjects as age-matched control cases (CC). CMR was performed through acquisition of cine steady-state free precession sequences using a 1. 5 -T scanner. Image postprocessing was carried out using Tracking Tool software. Results: Atrial volumes were significantly higher <b>in</b> patients with <b>HCM</b> compared to CC: maximum atrial volume (p =  0. 007) and minimum atrial volume (p =  0. 01). A statistically significant difference was also observed in atrial ejection fraction <b>in</b> patients with <b>HCM</b> (p <  0. 0001). The atrial volume curves defined as cavity volume over time (dV/t) showed significant differences: early atrial peak emptying rate (PERE) (maximum rate of emptying independent of atrial contraction) <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> was − 146  ±  53  ml/s versus − 227  ±  86  ml/s in CC (p <  0. 0001); active atrial peak emptying rate (PERA) (maximum rate of emptying secondary to atrial contraction) <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> was − 256  ±  80  ml/s versus − 216  ±  104  ml/s in CC (p =  0. 05); the atrial PER E/A ratio <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> was 0. 6  ±  0. 2 versus 1. 05  ±  0. 5 in CC (p <  0. 0001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients with early diastolic dysfunction the parameters of left atrial function assessed by CMR are impaired before the ventricular diastolic indexes such as the early peak filling rate and the active peak filling rate...|$|R

40|$|More {{than two}} decades have elapsed since the {{discovery}} that sarcomere gene defects cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Since then, genetic testing <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> has developed and expanded, and is now widely available as a potential clinical service in the Western countries. In the meantime, however, the cross-talk between geneticists and clinicians has developed slowly, and still remains unstandardized, with modalities of interaction and degree of mutual comprehension that vary wildly in various settings. In addition, clinicians often question the clinical utility of genetic testing <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients and their families. The apparent lack of practical benefit, {{in the face of}} considerable costs, has long hindered large-scale diffusion of genetic testing, particularly in developing countries, and still accounts for understandable (but not always justifiable) resistance {{on the part of the}} physicians. However, such resistance is in contrast with considerable evidence supporting a role for molecular diagnosis in tailoring management for HCM patients. We here review several sound clinical reasons in favour of systematic genetic testing <b>in</b> <b>HCM,</b> ranging from identification of complex genotypes, heralding severe disease expression and outcome, to the added benefit of multidisciplinary genetic teamwork, enhancing awareness towards inheritable diseases in the cardiology community. We hope to show that to underestimate the clinical potential of genetic testing <b>in</b> <b>HCM,</b> and to defer its implementation until more advanced knowledge becomes available, is to lose an important opportunity for present improvement in care...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) disease {{process is not}} only limited to cardiomyocyte abnormalities but also engages the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronan (HA) and its receptor CD 44 are involved in cellular growth and tissue proliferation but have so far been less studied in myocardial hypertrophy. <b>In</b> <b>HCM,</b> collagens are abundant but their histological distribution and relation to hyaluronan have not been described. Material and Methods. Myocardial specimens from 5 patients with symptomatic left ventricular tract obstruction undergoing myectomy due to HCM were processed for histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Results. HA staining was more intense <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients. The histological distribution of HA was the same in patients and controls, that is, interstitial staining including the space between cardiomyocytes, in fibrous septa, and in the adventitia of intramyocardial blood vessels. CD 44 was not detected in the myocardium of patients or controls. Collagen I showed the same general localisation as HA but detailed distribution differed. Conclusions. This is the first study that describes the distribution of hyaluronan <b>in</b> human <b>HCM.</b> HA staining is more intense <b>in</b> <b>HCM</b> patients but without coexpression of its receptor CD 44, {{at least not in}} the chronic phase of HCM. HA and collagen I have the same localisation...|$|R
