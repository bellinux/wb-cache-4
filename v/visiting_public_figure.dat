40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the diffusion of}} the legal concept of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> in Chinese right to reputation law. <b>Public</b> <b>figure</b> developed in the US context {{as an extension of}} New York Times v. Sullivan from public officials to <b>public</b> <b>figures.</b> In libel suits brought by public officials and <b>public</b> <b>figures,</b> the US Supreme Court casts the balance strongly in favor of freedom of expression by requiring that plaintiffs show that the media acted with actual malice. The Court has recognized the intrinsic value of freedom of expression as well as the fact that <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> have greater power and greater access to the media than private figures. As the idea of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> diffused into China, several local courts adopted this concept in their rulings to define the limits of the right to reputation. Due to the power of public officials in China, the right to reputation can be used to silence critics. Questions of equality arise with respect to the actual power of the parties as well as whether <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> should be expected to be more tolerant of public criticism, even when it could harm reputation. This paper examines the diffusion of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> {{as a response to the}} development of the right to reputation in the broad context of citizenship construction, a process that started in China in the late 1970 s. By investigating the channels, levels, and agents of diffusion, the paper demonstrates that the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> has been accepted locally but not nationally for both institutional and ideational reasons. Institutionally judges find themselves in a vulnerable position as they apply the concept to cases involving public officials. Ideationally, the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> calls for sufficient justification that fits the current legal thinking of the recipient country. Right to reputation law in China has been exercised to stifle dissenting and critical voices, an example of the pathos of law. Chinese academics, lawyers and judges have explored using the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> to balance right to reputation. As we explore the diffusion of the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figure,</b> we consider how the development of this promising concept has been stunted by national-level institutions...|$|R

40|$|As a {{study of}} {{diffusion}} of law, this paper analyzes {{the ways in which}} the US legal concept of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> spread in China. In New York Times v. Sullivan, the US Supreme Court made it clear that when it comes to libel cases involving public officials, the Court casts the balance strongly in favor of freedom of expression by requiring that public officials show that the newspaper acted with actual malice. This principle was later extended to <b>public</b> <b>figures.</b> In addition to the intrinsic value of freedom of expression, the rational for introducing the doctrine of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> is the need to rebalance the unequal power relationship the fact that <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> have greater power and greater access to the media than private figures. As the idea of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> migrated into China, several local courts adopted this concept in their rulings to define the limits of the right to reputation. Due to the power of public officials in China, there is some risk that the right to reputation can be used to silence critics. Questions of equality arise with respect to the actual power of the parties as well as whether <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> should be expected to be more tolerant of public criticism, even when it could harm reputation. This paper examines the development of the right to reputation in China and the diffusion of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> in the broad context of citizenship construction, a process started in China with a nation-wide discussion of equality before the law in the late 1970 s. By investigating the channels, levels, and agents of diffusion, the paper demonstrates that the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> has been accepted locally but not nationally for both institutional and ideational reasons. Institutionally judges find themselves in a vulnerable position as they apply the concept to cases involving public officials. Ideationally, the concept of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> calls for sufficient justification that fits the current legal thinking of the recipient country. One such justification is the need to address the inequality in the actual power of parties and, therefore, a renewed discussion of equality before the law may facilitate the acceptance of <b>public</b> <b>figures</b> at higher levels...|$|R

Prior research on managing the threat presented by <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> stalkers concludes that although direct threats rarely precede attacks, there is usually evidence of pre-planning. Furthermore, some <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> attackers do attempt to communicate with their future intended victim prior to attack. Thus, early warning signs from unusual contact behavior {{can be a powerful}} tool in threat assessment and risk management. The current paper offers a systematic concept fo...|$|R

40|$|Research {{examining}} stalking with <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> {{and community}} samples overlap but have developed separately {{as a consequence}} of different focal points. It has been demonstrated that if ex-intimates are removed from analyses, research using <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> and community stalker samples can produce very similar findings. The present study examines whether 5 independent variables previously identified as predictors of stalker approach in <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> samples (Meloy et al., 2011) were related to stalker approach within a self-defined community sample of stalking victims (N = 1, 440). These variables have been found to predict stalker approach within <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> and community stalker samples. None predicted stalker approach in the present study. Our sample differed from earlier samples in important ways, recording far lower rates of serious mental disorder in stalkers and including stalkers who were not apprehended by police and/or referred to forensic mental health services. In addition, research examining stalking using <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> samples categorizes attempted approaches as approaches whereas the present study used a more literal classification. It is concluded that findings from research within a <b>public</b> <b>figure</b> context cannot simply be extrapolated to a community context. Caution must be applied, {{and the nature of the}} base sample appears to dictate the transferability of findings...|$|R
