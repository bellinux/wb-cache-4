40|$|Several {{categories}} of networks allow the users <b>to</b> transmit at <b>variable</b> bit-rates on their channels. DQDB and ATM networks can be mentioned as such examples. This paper will {{be concerned with}} describing the digital television and the high-definition television coders as <b>variable</b> bit-rate sources <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> on ATM networks. The variable bit-rates will be studied and modeled bottom up, starting at the sub image level with time scale orders of a few microseconds, and ending up at the program level with time scales of several hours, To validate the theoretical approach, an experiment has <b>been</b> set up <b>to</b> process 25 h of actual television images with digital television coders at different image quality levels. Bit-rates and cell inter-arrival times have been collected allowing statistics <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried out. As a matter of fact, the television coders involved in variable bit-rate applications <b>are</b> designed <b>to</b> encode images with a quasi-constant quality and to take an optimum benefit from the offered variability. The levels of image quality considered in this paper range from secondary distribution quality up to contribution quality...|$|R
