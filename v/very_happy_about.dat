500|$|The {{image was}} shot by {{photographer}} Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> being woken up early to shoot ("we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|E

500|$|Several Harrison biographers {{likewise}} hold Extra Texture in low esteem, with Alan Clayson {{describing it}} as his [...] "artistic nadir" [...] and [...] "a bedsit record rather than a dancing one". Simon Leng writes that Harrison's post-Dark Horse [...] "rehabilitation disc" [...] came way too soon, resulting in an uncharacteristically passionless work, with its singer sounding [...] "punch drunk". Aside from the uplifting [...] "You", both authors identify [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as the only saving grace. Gary Tillery notes the [...] "darkly sarcastic" [...] album title for a collection full of such [...] "downbeat" [...] tracks, the darkest of which is [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies". Harrison himself rated Extra Texture as his worst solo release of the 1970s. Speaking to Musician magazine in 1987, he dismissed it as [...] "a grubby album" [...] and added: [...] "The production left {{a lot to be}} desired, as did my performance... Some songs I like, but in retrospect I wasn't <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|Hill set a {{provisional}} pole position time of 1:20.081 {{during the first}} qualifying session, ahead of Berger, Coulthard, Alesi, Häkkinen and Schumacher. The session was disrupted after Schumacher crashed heavily into the tyre barrier at turneight, a corner normally taken at a speed of [...] As a precaution, Benetton opted to keep Schumacher's teammate, Johnny Herbert, in the garage while the team found out {{what was wrong with}} the car. This meant that Herbert did not set a time in the session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that [...] "there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head {{did a good job of}} protecting me. For sure I am not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> this, but I believe that the team will spend a lot of time investigating the situation for tomorrow and they will find the problem." [...] The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car's steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.|$|E

Jones County played in the Junior Rose Bowl, now the Pasadena Bowl, against Compton Community College in Compton, California.

30|$|With {{respect to}} {{cultural}} factors, {{it became clear}} that parents like the valorisation of their cultural origin as an element that facilitates reciprocal trust between teachers and immigrant parents.

5000|$|An {{adjective}} phrase (or adjectival phrase) is {{a phrase}} whose head word is an adjective, e.g. fond of steak, <b>very</b> <b>happy,</b> quite upset <b>about</b> it, etc. The adjective in an adjective phrase can initiate the phrase (e.g. fond of steak), conclude the phrase (e.g. <b>very</b> <b>happy),</b> or {{appear in a}} medial position (e.g. quite upset about it). The dependents of the head adjective—i.e. the other words and phrases inside the adjective phrase—are typically adverbs or prepositional phrases, {{but they can also}} be clauses (e.g. louder than you do). Adjectives and adjective phrases function in two basic ways in clauses, either attributively or predicatively. When they are attributive, they appear inside a noun phrase and modify that noun phrase, and when they are predicative, they appear outside the noun phrase that they modify and typically follow a linking verb ...|$|R

5000|$|The claims {{regarding}} this portrait follow from research into another portrait in the Cobbe collection, also displayed at Hatchlands Park, {{which came to}} public attention in 2002 when the painting, which for three centuries had {{been identified as a}} portrait of a woman, [...] "Lady Norton", was correctly identified as a portrait of a young man. The coincidence of distinctive features, the extraordinarily long hair, the high forehead, the long nose terminating in a bulb and the slender upper lip with known portraits of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, led to the conclusion that it depicted Shakespeare's patron the 3rd Earl of Southampton himself, whose great-granddaughter was Lady Elizabeth Norton. The portrait is the earliest extant oil portrait of the androgynous-looking youthful Earl to survive and shows him at the time that Shakespeare dedicated his long poems Venus and Adonis (1593) and The Rape of Lucrece (1594) to him. The Earl has often been suggested as the [...] "Fair Youth" [...] who is the love object in some of Shakespeare's sonnets. Alastair Laing of the National Trust wrote at the time that, [...] "I am <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> indeed <b>about</b> the identification. Given the connection to Shakespeare and his sonnets, it is a very, very exciting discovery." ...|$|R

She is often seen as unattractive when {{compared}} to her beautiful older sister, Bridget. She was accused by Bridget of stealing her (ex-) boyfriend, Kyle, though clearly Bridget's actions drove Kyle away. Kerry is sarcastic, often making snide remarks about essentially everybody, though less to her mother. She is also a passionate activist who cares about animal rights. She lost her virginity to Bruno (her boyfriend in Europe) later in the third season. She is often annoyed at her sister and is easily upset, yet frequently the two girls team up against their parents' authority or {{at the expense of}} their younger rascal brother. Kerry is also very artistic and keeps a sketchbook. She is the smart child, but often shows naiveté.

Sandford and Wiseman are seen putting the phone down on their boyfriends after singing the lyrics, [...] "there's nothing left to say". As the chorus kicks in, White is seen walking out of the house, slamming the door, singing the lyrics, [...] "forever is over", which means she's left her boyfriend, she has had enough.

Wiseman is later seen having lunch with her boyfriend, which she is not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> and starts pulling faces, and later throws her glass of wine over him, and throws her engagement ring away. Sandford is also seen trying to phone her boyfriend, but he does not pick up the phone, and she puts her head against the wall, and King comes comfort her by putting her arm around her.
