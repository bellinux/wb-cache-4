A new methodology for determining the representative strain for <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentation</b> is presented in this article. Following a procedure based on finite element simulations of indentation of elastoplastic materials, two representative strains are defined: the representative strain characteristic of the mean pressure and the representative strain characteristic of the Martens hardness or the indentation loading curvature. The results obtained from this methodology show that there is no universal value of representative strain independent of the mechanical parameters of materials indented by <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentation.</b> It is also shown that the representative strain, obtained by <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentation</b> is much lower when it is obtained from the relationship between the applied force and the penetration depth, F-h, rather than from the relationship between the applied force and the contact radius, F-a.

A new methodology for determining the representative strain for spherical and for <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentation</b> is presented in this article. The results obtained from this methodology show that there is no universal value of representative strain independent of the mechanical parameters of materials indented by <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentation</b> and spherical indentation. It is also shown that the representative strain, obtained by Vickers or by spherical indentation, is much lower when it is obtained from the relationship between the applied force and the penetration depth, F-h, rather than from the relationship between the applied force and the contact radius, F-a. By choosing the same representative strain value in spherical indentation and in <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentation,</b> the results show that the same constraint factor is obtained. Hence, it is possible to determine a perfect analogy between the two types of indentation.

The respective flaw sizes of the <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentations</b> were also reduced (10. 5 %) and inherently increased the K Ic (12 %). Residual stress state by X-ray diffraction method showed an average stress of − 64 MPa after LSP, whilst the untreated surface stress measured + 219 MPa. Further verification with the fluorescence method revealed surface relaxation with a maximum compressive stress of − 172 MPa induced after LSP within the Al 2 O 3 armour ceramic. These findings are attributed to a microstructural refinement, grain size reduction and an induction of compressive stress that was relaxing the top/near surface layer (post LSP) from the pre-existing tensile stresses.

40|$|Birefringence {{has been}} used to study {{transparent}} materials since 1815, and is based on the decomposition of a polarized ray of light into two distinct rays when passing through an optically anisotropic material. This thesis uses this phenomenon in a study of phase retardation in crystalline materials. Single and multicrystalline silicon was chosen as the model material. Silicon is an interesting and important material in its own right, and the use of photoelasticity to determine stresses at linear and planar defects can have important consequences in the electrical performance of devices such as electronics and photovoltaic cells. This thesis presents the results of an experimental investigation of residual stresses in multicrystalline silicon wafers using near-infrared (NIR) transmission photoelasticity. NIR transmission through multicrystalline silicon is found to vary with crystallographic orientation and relate to planar atomic density, enabling the assignment of appropriate stress-optic coefficients to different grains. Noise in the data is reduced with the Ramji and Ramesh 10 -step phase shifting algorithm when compared to the Patterson and Wang process. Normal stresses at points of zero maximum shear stress can be characterized based on isoclinic behavior around the point. Points at which all normal stresses are zero serve as boundary conditions for shear difference integration and allow for stress separation from a point that is not a free boundary. The second part of this work focuses on residual stresses in silicon wafers subjected to known physical damage such as indentations. Residual stress fields around <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentations</b> in silicon are found to be larger in size than predicted by contact mechanics. Placing <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentations</b> in close proximity creates a secondary stress field surrounding the entire indentation array, and a relationship is developed to explain this behavior. High residual stresses measured at grain boundaries are found to be consistent with models of atomic displacement. Placement of <b>Vickers</b> <b>indentations</b> near grain boundaries results in a change in stress state at the grain boundaries. The results of this study demonstrate the capacity of birefringence as a non-destructive evaluation tool and describe the effects of residual stress concentrations in silicon wafers. Ph. D...|$|R
