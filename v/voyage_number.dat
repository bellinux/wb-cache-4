5|$|Bon <b>Voyage</b> debuted at <b>number</b> one on {{both the}} Japanese Daily and Weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with over 46,000 units sold in its first week. It became Koda's sixth studio album {{to reach the top}} spot, but became her lowest first week sales since her debut album Affection (2002). It fell to 21 in its second week, {{shifting}} over 5,000 units. The album stayed in the top 100 for four weeks, and the overall top 300 for twelve weeks. As of January 2016, Bon Voyage has sold an estimated 59,499 units, making it her first album to not sell over the 100,000 limit. Because of this, it failed to achieve a certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ).

40|$|Surveys {{conducted}} among vessels, ship chandlers, {{ports and}} waste disposal firms produced the following results. The following average quantities of waste were ascertained for cargo vessels: person-related: 1. 81 kg per person and day; ship's operations-related: 0. 43 kg per person and day; cargo-related 14. 8 kg per ship and day. The daily volume of ship's waste generated globally amounts to approx. 7700 m/t {{in the person}} and ship's operations sectors. The ships are generally inadequately equipped to cope with this. Ship's waste is not disposed of sufficiently in the ports. A lack of storage facilities in particular prevents storage of waste for the complete duration of a <b>voyage.</b> A <b>number</b> of weak points hinder the vessels from delivering solid waste to port facilities. The main cause {{is the lack of}} standardisation coupled with inadequate equipment and organisational shortfalls {{on the part of both}} shore and vessel. The costs of delivering ship's waste differ from port to port in Germany. The existing need for regulations and action calls for cooperation on the part of all concerned (shipowners, crews, shipyards, waste disposal undertaking, public authorities). Comprehensive disposal standards should be implemented in both technical design-specific and organisational terms and be established in law. (orig.)

40|$|The {{colonization}} {{of the western}} Pacific Islands around 3000 years ago by neolithic groups known as the Lapita people was an extraordinary achievement. It has long been assumed that the colonisation process was driven by international inter-island <b>voyages</b> involving large <b>numbers</b> of pioneer settlers and all the plants and animals they needed to establish a broad marine and horticulture based lifestyle on the uninhabited islands they expected to find. This paper suggests {{that at least some}} of these groups may not have been tethered to the island but were 'sea nomads' who chose to spend most of their time on boats rather than on land. The stimulas for this idea came from geoarchaeological research on the Lapita settlement on Qoqo Island, southwest Viti Levu Island, Fiji, where traces of large numbers of Lapita people are found on what was a short narrow tombolo at the time of the island's colonisation, about 1000 BC...|$|R

[...] By virtue of its geography, as well as a minuscule African American population, it was literally the farthest removed from the heat of the slavery issue.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{theory of}} the naming of America {{is that it was}} named in honour of Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator. At the turn of the sixteenth century, Vespucci undertook a series of <b>voyages</b> (the <b>number</b> of which remains unresolved) in search of a western passage to the Indies. After the voyage of 1501-1502, he proposed that the areas that he and, separately, Christopher Columbus had explored were not part of Asia, but rather a New World. America first received its name in the Cosmographiae Introductio, published by cartographer Martin Waldseemüller in 1507. Vespucci's published letters (the authenticity of which is contested) were the inspiration for that work, which was authored by a group of scholars in Saint-Dié, Lorraine, France. They revised Ptolemy's Geography to include the New World and reasoned that, as the three previously known continents, Europe, Asia, and Africa, had feminine names, so should the New World. Accordingly, the feminised version of the Latin form of the baptismal name of the [...] "discoverer" [...] of the New World, Vespucci, was utilised. The appendix of the book included Waldseemüller's map {{of the world in which}} the New World was labelled [...] "America." [...] The map, rediscovered in a German castle in 1901, was the first to use the name America and the first to depict a Western Hemisphere. The Library of Congress purchased the 1507 Waldseemüller map in 2003. On 30 April 2007, German Chancellor Angela Merkel transferred the map, also known as America's [...] "birth certificate," [...] to the people of the United States in a ceremony at the Library of Congress.|$|R

The system is also useful for fishing vessels to control the power of generators during the draw in fishing gears for a long time in low speed. Although，the drawback to a fishing vessel with this system is that it will be a worry to the course stability in the <b>voyage.</b> A large <b>number</b> of studies have been made on maneuverability of conventional ships. What seems to be lacking，however，is the course stability of the fishing vessel with the azimuthing podded drive system. "In this paper，a new evaluation method of course stability is proposed on the basis of experimental study that is conducted in a circulating water channel on survey of slewing motion in at owed condition. As a towing point moves to forward in a constant speed, the amplitude of slewing motion (a) decreases and its period (T) is getting longer. Accordingly，the index of evaluation is represented by the point of towing from the center of gravity of ship and the value of the amplitude divided by the period (2 πa/T). The results are checked that compared with the course stability criterions by means of derivatives of hydrodynamic forces and moments. By using the present method， newly fishing vessels can be designed to achieve the improvement of propulsive efficiency and maneuverability. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} sleep {{characteristics}} of submariners during a long-term voyage, {{so as to}} provide scientific evidence for ensuring submariners with good sleep during long-term voyages. Methods The sleep status of submariners who participated in a long-term voyage was tested by Self-Rating Scale of Sleep (SRSS) before the voyage, and before and after each voyage section during the voyage. The sleep status variation of submariners who performed different types of tasks, {{from the beginning to}} the end of each voyage section and of each resting-on-the-sea section was analyzed respectively. Comparison of sleep scores was performed between submariners and surface ship crew in the second <b>voyage</b> section. <b>Numbers</b> of submariners with sleep problem were compared in each voyage section. Results Generally speaking, submariners' sleep status at the end of voyage section was significantly worse than that at the beginning of voyage section and that before the whole voyage (P 0. 05). After finishing a voyage section and taking a resting-on- the-sea, submariners' sleep status returned to the level of pre-voyage (P> 0. 05), and was significantly better than that before the resting-on-the-sea (P 0. 05). Compared with that of surface ship crew who accomplished the same voyage section, submariners had an obviously better sleep status after taking a resting-on-the-sea (P 0. 05), but the latter was significantly more than the former when the second voyage section was finished (P< 0. 05). During the resting-on-the-sea period, the numbers of submariners with sleep problems in both the second and the third voyage section were significantly more than those in the first voyage section (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01). The numbers of submariners with sleep problems who implemented the third voyage section were significantly more than those who implemented the first and the second voyage section (P< 0. 01). Conclusions Generally, the sleep quality of submariners is significantly worse after accomplished a voyage section task, and the degree of sleep problems may be accumulated to worse and worse along with the increase of long-term voyage time. Whereas, submariners may have a significantly better sleep status after taking a resting-on-the-sea, implying that resting- on-the-sea is an effective way to ensure submariners a good sleep during a long-term voyage.
