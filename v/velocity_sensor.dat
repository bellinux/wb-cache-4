50|$|The XC60 {{includes}} traditional Volvo {{safety features}} including a whiplash protection system, side impact protection system, roll stability control, dynamic stability and traction control, inflatable curtain airbags, hill descent control (AWD only), collision warning with brake support, active bi-xenon lights (optional on some models), and patented front, side, and rear structures. The XC60 also {{introduced a new}} technology feature that Volvo has named City safety. The system {{is described as a}} driver support system with the goal of preventing or mitigating vehicle-on-vehicle collisions below 30 km/h; it does so {{through the use of a}} closing <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> that helps determine whether a collision is likely. Depending on the speed, if a collision is likely, the Volvo's computer system will either prepare the car to brake or automatically brake the vehicle to avoid or mitigate a rear-end collision. Volvo also implemented the system to assist in towing caravans and trailers.|$|E
50|$|In those {{instances}} where a velocity measurement is additionally {{used as a}} surrogate, an index velocity determination is conducted. This analysis uses a <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor,</b> often either magnetic or acoustic, to measure the velocity of the flow at a particular location in the stream cross section. Once again, discrete measurements of streamflow discharge are made by the technician or hydrologist {{at a variety of}} stages. For each discrete determination of streamflow discharge, the mean velocity of the cross section is determined by dividing streamflow discharge by the cross-sectional area. A rating curve, similar to that used for stage-discharge determinations, is constructed using the mean velocity and the index velocity from the permanently mounted meter. An additional rating curve is constructed that relates stage of the stream to cross-sectional area. Using these two ratings, the automatically collected stage produces an estimate of the cross-sectional area, and the automatically collected index velocity produces an estimate of the mean velocity of the cross section. The streamflow discharge is computed as the estimate of the cross section area and the estimate of the mean velocity of the streamflow.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are often}} {{required in the}} automotive industry to optimize not only the acoustic performance, but also the durability and crash behaviour of cars. Therefore, validating the model when a prototype is built is remarkably important for improving the current design. Most conventional updating techniques for adjusting the acoustic numerical models inside the cabin use microphones located at different reference positions to compare predictions with real measurements. However, sound pressure is a scalar quantity which does not give information about the often unknown excitation distribution across the structure. This problem can also be addressed by using particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> close to the radiating surfaces due to their vector nature. In this paper, the use of particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> for updating and validating acoustic models is studied. Furthermore, the spatial resolution for pressure and velocity methods is derived. It {{has been shown that}} the use of a combined solution (pressure and particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors)</b> improves the numerical model optimization since both materials and excitation sources can be characterized in situ...|$|R

The transducer element is a circularly shaped divider/combiner, whereas the sensing element is an electricLC resonator, {{attached to the}} rotating object and magnetically coupled to the circular (active) region of the transducer. The angular variables are measured by inspection of the transmission characteristics, which are modulated by the magnetic coupling between the resonator and the divider/combiner. The degree of coupling is hence sensitive to the angular position of the resonator.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} vector-sensor (also {{known as}} vector-hydrophone in underwater applications) {{is composed of}} two or three spatially collocated but orthogonally oriented acoustic <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors,</b> plus possibly a collocated acoustic pressure sensor. Such an acoustic vector sensor is versatile for direction-finding, due to its azimuth-elevation spatial response's independence from the incident source's frequency, and bandwidth. However, previously unavailable in the open literature is how the acoustic vector sensor's far-field direction-of-arrival estimates may be adversely affected by any unknown nonideality in the acoustic vector sensor's gain response, phase response, collocation, or orthogonal orientation among its constituent <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors.</b> This paper pioneers a characterization of how these various unknown nonidealities degrade direction-finding accuracy, via Cramer-Rao bound analysis.

5000|$|Marine survey {{acquisition}} is {{not just}} limited to seismic vessels; {{it is also possible}} to lay cables of geophones and hydrophones on the sea bed in a similar way to how cables are used in a land seismic survey, and use a separate source vessel. This method was originally developed out of operational necessity in order to enable seismic surveys to be conducted in areas with obstructions, such as production platforms, without having the compromise the resultant image quality. [...] Ocean bottom cables (OBC) are also extensively used in other areas that a seismic vessel cannot be used, for example in shallow marine (water depth <300m) and transition zone environments, and can be deployed by ROVs in deep water when repeatability is valued (see 4D, below). Conventional OBC surveys use dual-component receivers, combining a pressure sensor (hydrophone) and a vertical particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> (vertical geophone), but more recent developments have expanded the method to use four-component sensors i.e. a hydrophone and three orthogonal geophones. Four-component sensors have the advantage of being able to also record shear waves, which do not travel through water but can still contain valuable information.|$|E
40|$|To improve {{performance}} of a "dual voice coil" (DVC) actuator speaker in an active noise control (ANC) system, a speaker model that includes coupling dynamics and source of noise pressure is first derived to design an adaptive feed-forward controller based on modified, filtered-X, recursive-least-squares (MFXRLS) algorithm in this investigation. A novel <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> measuring velocity of the speaker face is further developed by use of a frequency-response method. Two transfer functions required for the <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> are identified in two steps: (i) the adaptive feed-forward controller is applied to keep speaker face velocity zero to identify the first transfer function; and (ii) the second transfer function is then obtained experimentally using the first transfer function. Performance of the established <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is similar to that}} of a Polytec OFV 2100 laser velocity transducer. This <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> is then incorporated with the adaptive feed-forward controller to control the DVC actuator speaker in the ANC system. For a sinusoidal command input of frequency below 390 Hz, the controlled speaker acquires a unit-gain magnitude and zero phase degree, showing that the controller can effectively reduce effects of the speaker dynamics, including coupling dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The advent of particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> {{as a viable}} addition to traditional pressure-based sensors in acoustics has fueled considerable research into the additional capabilities they might bring. Previous thesis work performed at NPS successfully demonstrated a working acoustic beamformer using a hybrid array comprised of a single conventional omnidirectional microphone and two 3 D Microflown Ultimate Sound Probes in an anechoic chamber. These Microflown sensors are vector sensors. They have integrated directionality through the inclusion of three orthogonal particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> with a microphone. Unfortunately, the signals of the particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> obtained outside in a light, gusting wind were unusable due to broadband noise. Since the fundamental limit to detecting quiet targets depends on the noise floor, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to perform an in situ measurement of the pressure equivalent noise floor of all sensors in the array and to minimize the wind noise. Noise levels measured in an anechoic chamber were 915 dB higher than the levels expected from the sensors alone. The additional noise is attributed to the data acquisition equipment. The use of an ACO WS 7 windscreen was shown to be extremely effective in mitigating broadband wind noise. ME 5, Republic of Singapore Nav...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical study of decentralized velocity feedback control {{systems for the}} reduction of sound transmission through double panels. The system studied consists of two plates which are coupled acoustically by {{the air in the}} cavity between them and structurally by four elastic mounts. The geometrical and material properties of the double panel have been chosen so as to approximate a section of an aircraft fuselage skin. The outer panel of the skin (the source panel) is excited by oblique plane waves and the consequent sound power radiated from the inner panel (the radiating panel) is calculated. First, a parametric study of passive sound transmission of double panels with different geometrical and material properties is carried out. Second, active vibration control is implemented using 16 decentralized direct velocity feedback loops. Performance of such a control system is assessed for four control cases. The first two cases deal with skyhook force actuators with collocated <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors,</b> which implement active damping either on the source panel or on the radiating panel. In the third case, skyhook actuators and collocated <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> are located on both panels. Finally, an approach using actuators that react between the two panels with collocated relative <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> is considered...|$|R

40|$|An {{acoustic}} «particle velocity sensor» (a. k. a. a geophone) {{exhibits a}} gain-response with a cosine-like directivity. The particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> may be realized in hardware by two «pressure sensors» (of isotropic directivity) displaced in space, and by computing the spatial first-order finite {{difference between the}} data of the two isotropic component-sensors. As each component-sensor's data are degraded by additive noises (modeled here with much generality as stochastically distributed as «stable» (a. k. a. «alpha stable» or « alpha stable»), and not restricted to being Gaussian), the particle <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> as a whole would also experience noise, the statistics of which is analytically derived here.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the frequency response function of a matched volume <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> and uniform force actuator for active structural acoustic control. The paper first reviews {{the design of a}} volume <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> and uniform force actuator on a panel, using piezoelectric film with quadratic shaping of the electrodes. The frequency response function of a matched volume <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> and uniform force actuator bonded on either sides of a panel is then studied in detail. This analysis shows that below 100 Hz the sensor-actuator response is controlled by the bending vibration of the panel and a good estimate of the volumetric component of the transverse vibration of the panel is achieved. At higher frequencies, however, the sensoractuator response is controlled by the in-plane longitudinal and shear vibration of the panel, which causes the real part of the frequency response function to be not strictly positive and to be characterized by large amplitudes at higher frequencies. These two phenomena are important since they limit the possibility of implementing a stable direct velocity feedback control system using these transducers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the noise statistics of a tri-axial <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor.</b> This tri-axial sensing system comprises three orthogonal axes. Along each axis, a uni-axial <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> is realized through two isotropic pressure sensors displaced along that axis. Hence, a tri-axial <b>velocity</b> <b>sensor</b> may be implemented with {{as few as}} four isotropic sensors: one at the Cartesian origin and one at each Cartesian axis. Each isotropic sensor's noise would contribute to its axis' effective noise. As the three axes share one isotropic sensor in common, the three axes' effective noises would be cross-correlated, but how? This is answered in this paper, through rigorous mathematics that analytically derive the statistical codifference across the three axes' effective noises. This analysis models the noises accommodatingly as α-stable distributed, which includes the special cases of the Gaussian distribution, the Cauchy distribution, and many other heavy-tailed probability distributions. This finding is then generalized from the aforementioned velocity sensors (i. e., differential sensors of the first order) to differential sensors of arbitrarily high orders.

40|$|The {{following}} document {{sets out}} to determine the key limitations to existing methods of acquiring body slip angle data and how could accurate live body slip angle provide better information about a vehicle’s current behavior to aid vehicle safety systems. Initially, body slip angle estimation techniques are evaluated as these methods are currently used in electronic stability control systems, as current vehicles do not have body slip angle sensors. It is clear to see that all the different estimations methods have clear limitations. With this in mind existing methods of measuring body slip angle were investigated, such as optical sensors, GPS and Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors.</b> It is clear that laser Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> could be an accurate method of measuring body slip angle on consumer vehicles, therefore a body slip angle based electronic stability control system using laser doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>sensors</b> is proposed. In order to further validate body slip angle based electronic stability control systems, several multi body simulations are carried out. The multi body simulations show that an electronic stability control system based on body slip angle is feasible. The simulations also show that in low coefficient of friction conditions the body slip angle is a better indicator of vehicle behavior than yaw rate. In conclusion, {{it is clear to}} see {{that there is a need}} in the automotive industry for direct real time slip angle sensors, but further research is required to determine the robustness and viability of body slip angle targeted ESC systems...|$|R
