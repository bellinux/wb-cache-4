40|$|Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, or 5 -HT) receptors mediate {{a plethora}} of {{physiological}} phenomena {{in the brain and}} the periphery. Additionally, serotonergic dysfunction has been implicated in nearly every neuropsychiatric disorder. The effects of serotonin are mediated by fourteen GPCRs. Both the therapeutic actions and side effects of commonly prescribed drugs are frequently due to nonspecific actions on various 5 -HT receptor subtypes. For more than 20 years, the search for clinically efficacious drugs that selectively target 5 -HT receptor subtypes has been only occasionally successful. This review provides an overview of 5 -HT receptor pharmacology and discusses two recent 5 -HT receptor subtype–selective drugs, lorcaserin and pimavanserin, which target the 5 HT 2 C and 5 HT 2 A receptors and provide new treatments for obesity and Parkinson’s disease psychosis, respectively. Serotonin receptors and signal transduction Serotonin, which was known to be the principal <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substance</b> found in serum, was chemically identified as 5 -hydroxy-tryptamine by Rapport and colleagues in 1948 (1). Although the effects of serotonin on smooth muscle and other peripheral organs were long appreciated, it wasn’t until its structural similarity to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was noted that serotonin and it...|$|E
40|$|In June 2012 DMAA (1, 3 -dimethylamylamine), an ephedrine-like <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substance</b> {{which had}} been {{included}} in many popular sports supplements, became a scheduled substance in Australia, following bans in several other countries. The underlying rationale for this ban was that DMAA use is unsafe. This paper aimed to critically review the available evidence on the acute and/or long-term harms of DMAA. Using five research databases (PubMed, Embase, ProQuest Health and Medical Complete, and Web of Science) and the key terms 2 ̆ 7 methylhexaneamine 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 DMAA 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 dimethylamylamine 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 71, 3 -dimethylpentylamine 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 72 -amino- 4 -methylhexane 2 ̆ 7, 842 articles were identified once duplicates removed. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria and {{were included in the}} review. Of the included studies, eight were case studies, which reported on eight patients who presented to emergence departments. All were retrospective in their reporting. The patients displayed various outcomes; while the patients were presenting with serious problems, in most patients conditions subsided on cessation of supplement use. The remaining eight experimental studies were low powered, with a number of studies conducted by a single research group with industry ties, and broadly investigated the effects of DMAA on physiological outcomes. Mixed findings were apparent, although escalations of blood pressure were present on acute dosing, as well as decreases in measures of body weight and body fat. There is a shallow evidence base describing the adverse effects of DMAA and the dose above which such effects may occur. The scheduling of DMAA in many countries may now impede research efforts to determine whether there are safe doses at which DMAA can be consumed...|$|E
50|$|In {{vascular}} diseases, endothelial dysfunction is {{a systemic}} pathological {{state of the}} endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) and can be broadly defined as an imbalance between vasodilating and <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances</b> produced by (or acting on) the endothelium. Normal functions of endothelial cells include mediation of coagulation, platelet adhesion, immune function and control of volume and electrolyte content of the intravascular and extravascular spaces.|$|R
50|$|In portal hypertension, blood will shunt from portal to {{systemic}} circulation, {{bypassing the}} liver. This leaves unmetabolized potentially toxic or <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances</b> to reach and attack the pulmonary circulation. Serotonin, normally metabolized by the liver, {{is returned to}} the lung instead where it mediates a smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy.Moreover, a key pathogenic factor in the decline in status of PPH patients related to this shunting is the cirrhotic cardiomyopathy with myocardial thickening and diastolic dysfunction.|$|R
40|$|Endothelial {{dysfunction}} is a {{key event}} {{in the development of}} vascular disease, and it precedes clinically obvious vascular pathology. Abnormal activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway has been found to elevate vascular tone through unbalancing the production of vasodilating and <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances.</b> Inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK pathway can prevent endothelial dysfunction in a variety of pathological conditions. This review, based on recent molecular, cellular, and animal studies, focuses on the current understanding of the ROCK pathway and its roles in endothelial dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|The {{endothelium}} {{releases a}} powerful vasodilating and anti-aggregant substance, the EDRF, both under basal conditions and after stimulation {{by a large}} number of hormones and endogenic factors. Endothelial lesions or dysfunction may play important roles in causing coronary spasm although other changes related to atherosclerosis must also be taken into consideration. One possible stimulus is aggregating platelets as they are an important source of <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances.</b> The endothelium also secretes other vasoactive substances, EDHF and/or EDCF, the physiopathological role of which has not yet been established. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Summary Necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC) is {{the most}} common serious, acquired gastrointestinal disorder in the newborn infant. Although many variables are associ-ated with development of NEC, only prematurity has been consistently identified in case-controlled studies. Traditionally, the diving seal reflex has been invoked as the mechanism responsible for ischaemic injury and necrosis. Intestinal ischaemia {{is likely to be the}} final common pathway in NEC; however, it is due to the release of <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances,</b> such as platelet activating factor, rather than perinatal asphyxia. Bacteria and/or bacterial toxins are likely to have a key role in the pathogenesis of NEC by fostering production of inflammatory mediators. The role of feeding practices in the pathogenesis of NEC remains controversial. Treatment of infants with NEC generally includes a regimen of bowel rest, gastric decompression, systemic antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Infants with perforation are generally operated upon; however, there has been recent interest in primary peritoneal drainage as an alternative. Prevention of NEC still remains elusive. Avoidance of preterm birth, use of antenatal steroids and breast-milk feeding are practices that offer the greatest potential benefits. Use of any other strategy should await further trials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the in vivo effect of acetylcholine on endothelial-damaged canine epicardial coronary arteries and the potential contribution of platelets to those acetylcholine-induced responses. Changes in left anterior descending artery cross-sectional area were determined by quantitative angiography in the closed chest anesthetized dog. Baseline cross-sectional area of the left anterior descending artery was not changed by removal of the endothelium by balloon-tipped catheter. Increased constrictor tone produced by prostaglandin Fα was comparable in endothelium-intact and endothelium-removed vessels, supporting an endothelium-independent mechanism for prostaglandin F 2 α in vivo. Acetylcholine produced anterior descending artery vasodilation with the endothelium intact; a comparable maximal dilator response was also obtained in the presence of increased constrictor tone (prostaglandin F 2 α). In contrast, acetylcholine produced vasoconstriction of the anterior descending artery when the endothelium was removed. To evaluate the mechanism of acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction in endothelium-removed vessels, the same protocol was completed {{in the presence of the}} platelet inhibitor indomethacin. Indomethacin did not alter baseline cross-sectional area or the dilator response to acetylcholine in endothelium-intact vessels. In contrast, the constrictor response in endothelium-removed vessels was antagonized, and a dilator response comparable with that in endothelium-intact vessels was produced by acetylcholine. The results of this study provide an experimental basis for the observations in human studies in which apparently atherosclerotic vessels constrict in response to acetylcholine. Removal of the endothelium in vivo abolishes the dilator response to acetylcholine and converts the acetylcholine response to vasoconstriction or vasospasm. This vasoconstrictor response is reversed to a dilator response by indomethacin, suggesting that acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction in endothelial-damaged arteries in vivo may, in part, be facilitated by platelet-released <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} literature clearly establishes {{the occurrence of}} cardiovascular (CV) accidents and myocardial ischemic episodes is unevenly distributed during the 24 h. Such temporal patterns result from corresponding temporal variation in pathophysiologic mechanisms and cyclic environmental triggers that elicit the onset of clinical events. Moreover, both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many, though not all, CV medications {{have been shown to}} be influenced by the circadian time of their administration, even though further studies are necessary to better clarify the mechanisms of such influence on different drug classes, drug molecules, and pharmaceutical preparations. Twenty-four-hour rhythmic organization of CV functions is such that defense mechanisms against acute events are incapable of providing the same degree of protection during the day and night. Instead, temporal gates of excessive susceptibility exist, particularly in the morning and to a lesser extent evening (in diurnally active persons), to aggressive mechanisms through which overt clinical manifestations may be triggered. When peak levels of critical physiologic variables, such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), rate pressure product (systolic BP × HR, surrogate measure of myocardial oxygen demand), sympathetic activation, and plasma levels of endogenous <b>vasoconstricting</b> <b>substances,</b> are aligned together at the same circadian time, the risk of acute events becomes significantly elevated such that even relatively minor and usually harmless physical and mental stress and environmental phenomena can precipitate dramatic life-threatening clinical manifestations. Hence, the delivery of CV medications needs to be synchronized in time, i. e., circadian time, in proportion to need as determined by established temporal patterns in risk of CV events, and in a manner that averts or minimizes undesired side effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} thoracic artery is the gold-standard {{conduit for}} coronary artery bypass surgery. Until recently, it was used almost exclusively as a pedicle, with construction of 1 distal anastomosis. Skeletonization of the {{internal thoracic artery}} has recently been advocated {{in order to increase}} the number of arterial anastomoses and decrease the occurrence of sternal wound infections. When skeletonized, the vessel loses its “milieu”, which raises the question of whether this technique sacrifices the superior longevity of the conduit. The current status of research on the effects of skeletonization (depriving the internal thoracic artery of vasa vasorum, innervation, and lymphatic and venous drainage, together with creating an imbalance between <b>vasoconstricting</b> and vasodilating <b>substances)</b> appears to support the superiority of the pedicled graft. Long-term patency studies of the skeletonized ITA, with meticulous follow-up and confirmation by angiography, are not currently available. Theoretically, skeletonization of the ITA might adversely affect its long-term resistance to atherosclerosis. More data are needed before this technique can be universally recommended. If the skeletonized ITA has decreased long-term patency, bypass surgery may be at a disadvantage when compared with the new generation of drug-eluting stents.
