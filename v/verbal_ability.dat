40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of a wider {{research}} in the domain of educability of primary mental abilities. Using the longitudinal approach, the children from nine to fifteen years old have been observed, with the aim of finding the answers to the following questions: 1.

What are the changes that happen in these abilities in normal conditions and in the conditions of the experimental program? <b>Verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> are defined as <b>abilities</b> of <b>verbal</b> comprehension, verbal reasoning and verbal conceptions of materials. The analysis of the results in the research confirmed the growing trend in the development of <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> in the control and experimental situation, which shows that in this period, positive developmental and tranferal changes happen. The experimental program conditioned considerably a better and more durable progress of the experimental group in comparison to the control group on the tests of <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities.</b> Therefore, the research has shown that there are significant and more durable transferal effects of the experimental program in the <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> of pupils from nine to fifteen years old. ...|$|R

Particular attention is given to examine whether a verbal WM deficit is due to difficulties in <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> often showed by individuals with DS, {{or whether it is}} a deficit per se. A group of 20 individuals with DS was compared to a group of 20 typically developing (TD) children matched on vocabulary comprehension and to a group of 20 TD children matched on general verbal intelligence. The groups received a battery of 3 verbal and 3 visuospatial WM tasks requiring different degrees of control, and tests assessing <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> (WPPSI <b>verbal</b> scale, PPVT), nonverbal skills (WPPSI performance scale), and logical thinking (LO). The results revealed that individuals with DS have deficits in both central executive (control) and verbal components of the WM system, and the latter one is independent of the general <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> deficit. The data suggest that the development of central executive proceeds at a slower rate in individuals with DS and differently from TD children with comparable <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities.</b> The performance of individuals with DS on high-control WM tasks requires additional general resources that are strictly linked to intelligence...|$|R

Questions were all in multiple-choice format. Each subtest was given a single score, and the total score was derived from the sum of the scores from the subtests. The total score ranged from 200–800. The individual scores helped medical school admission committees to differentiate the individual abilities among their candidates. Admission committees, however, did not consider the [...] "understanding modern society" [...] section to be of great importance, even though it was created to reward those with broad liberal arts skills, which included knowledge of history, government, economics, and sociology. Committees placed greater emphasis on scores on the scientific achievement section as it was a better predictor of performance in medical school.|$|E

[...] A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. [...] Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems.

In addition, individuals were interviewed on their weight and height (to calculate body mass index; BMI), educational attainment, occupation, and engaging in different activities throughout adulthood. Results: Obesity (BMI ≥ 30) {{was significantly associated with}} a lower performance in <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities,</b> processing speed, and cognitive flexibility.

Different factors such as visuo-spatial and <b>verbal</b> <b>abilities</b> have been discussed to contribute to the {{development of}} these foundational skills. To understand the cognitive nature of verbal number skills in young children, the present study assessed the relation of preschoolers’ <b>verbal</b> and visuo-spatial <b>abilities</b> to their <b>verbal</b> number skills.
