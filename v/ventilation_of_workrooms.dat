40|$|Introduction: In {{the steel}} industry,air blowers used to supply {{compressed}} air are considered {{as sources of}} annoying noise. This study aims to acoustics analysis of theairblower workroomand sound source characteristics in order to present noise controlmeasuresinthe steel industry.. Material and Method: Measurement of noiselevel and its frequency analysis was performed usingsound levelmetermodelof CASELLA-Cell. 450. Distribution of noise level in the investigated <b>workroom</b> in form <b>of</b> noise map was provided using Surfer software. In addition, acoustic analysis <b>of</b> <b>workroom</b> and control room was performed in view point of soundabsorption andinsulation. Redesignofdoor and window of controlroom and installation of soundabsorbing materialson theceiling <b>of</b> the <b>workroom</b> were proposed and the efficiency of these interventionswasestimated.. Result: The totalsound pressurelevelin the blower workroom was 95. 4 dB(L) and the dominant frequency was 2000 Hz. Sound pressure level inside the room control was 80. 1 dB(A). The average absorption coefficient and reverberation time in the blower workroom was estimated equal to 0. 082 Sab. m 2 and 3. 9 seconds respectively. These value in control room was 0. 04 Sab. m 2 and 3 / 4 seconds respectively. In control room, sound transmission loss between the {{two parts of the}} wall dividing was 13. 7 dB(A). The average of noise dose in blower operators was 230 %. With the installation of sound absorber on ceiling <b>of</b> <b>workroom,</b> average <b>of</b> absorption coefficient can increase to 0. 33 Sab. m 2 and sound transmission loss of the new designed door and window was estimated equal to 20 dB.. Conclusion: The main cause of noise leakage in the control room was insufficient insulation properties of door and windows. By replacing the door and window and installation of sound absorbing on ceiling <b>of</b> <b>workroom,</b> the noise dose can reduce to 49. 6 %. New Improved door and window of control room can reduce noise dose to 69. 65 % solely...|$|R

40|$|The use <b>of</b> the {{non-invasive}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> {{the lungs}} {{is connected with}} the positive pressure ventilation. When the endotracheal tube was developed, this method was put aside. Recently, its use has gone up again. It is indicated for the patients with acute respiratory insufficiency, cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs does not require any sedation. In addition, there is no risk of intubation of the airways. The contraindication includes acute ischemic myocardium, a non-cooperating patient and inability to ensure the face seal. The research used qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The qualitative research {{was done in the}} form of interviews and content analyses of data. The research sample composed of six patients from the intensive care units in the hospital Nemocnice Tábor, a. s. The research sample of the quantitative data collection was made up of nurses from four hospitals in the Czech Republic, who work at the intensive care units and at the anaesthesiology and resuscitation unit. In total, 100 questionnaires were distributed and 84 properly filled in questionnaires were returned. The questionnaire included 40 closed questions. Objective 1 was to find out whether the nurses know and use the standard of the nursing care for the patient with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs. Objective 2 was to map actual conditions of the nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs. Objective 3 was to map which problems the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs have. The objectives of the work were fulfilled. This work has got one research question. Which problems do the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs have? The research found out that the patients most often have problems with rubbing and soreness to their face, dry mouth and throat and problems with sleeping. Hypothesis 1 (the nurses know standards of the nursing care for patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs) was disproved. The standard is not established in any hospitals. Hypothesis 2 (the nurses use the standards of the nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs) was disproved. The output is the development of the standard called "The nurse assistance of the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs". Hypothesis 3 (the way of the nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs is different in the selected hospitals) was disproved. The nursing care in the selected hospitals is provided at the same level. The nursing care for these patients is a very demanding task for a nurse. An important element of successful treatment is a good psychological preparation of the patient and almost continuous presence of the nurse at the patient´s bedside. We hope that some of the results of this research will draw attention to the problems of the nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the lungs and will help to solve them. The developed standard could also {{become a part of the}} nursing care procedures in medical facilities. ...|$|R

Aperture design is very {{important}} in the design process of rainwear, as garment aperture {{is one of the main}} pathways for air exchange between clothing microclimate and the environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of aperture design on whole and local <b>ventilations</b> <b>of</b> rainwear. <b>Ventilation</b> was measured by a tester developed based on the steady-state method. A rainwear suit with top and bottom was chosen as the basic ensemble. Apertures were added at the arm, chest, back and knee separately. Local <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the arm, chest, back and whole <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the top and bottom in different walking and wind conditions were measured. Local and whole ventilations at five aperture conditions for the top and four for the bottom were studied. The results indicated that local <b>ventilation</b> value <b>of</b> the chest was the biggest and the arm was the smallest. Whole <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> the suit was the biggest when walking at 5. 6 km/h, with all the designed apertures opened. Local ventilation value was bigger when opening arm aperture than that of opening chest or back aperture. The bottom ventilation was the highest when both front and back apertures were opened...|$|R
