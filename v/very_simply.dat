25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} of {{the mysteries}} of Jesus and Mary.“The gentle repetition of its prayers makes it an excellent means to moving into deeper meditation.

The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin <b>very</b> <b>simply</b> and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation. The meditator learns to hear an interior voice, the voice of God”.|$|E
25|$|Emily Davies first mooted {{plans for}} a chapel in Girton college in 1890; however, {{building}} only started in 1899, {{four years after the}} death of Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley, who had opposed the idea and instead favoured improving staff salaries and equipment. The chapel, which was designed by Alfred and Paul Waterhouse, was completed in 1901, and inaugurated on 23 May 1902. It seats about 200 people and the interior is held <b>very</b> <b>simply</b> with the exception of oak carvings at the Chancel end and on two long desks in front of the choir seats, which were crafted by the mathematician Margaret Meyer, along with students and friends of the college.|$|E
25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. <b>Very</b> <b>simply,</b> we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a blind {{deconvolution}} method to enhance the resolution of images obtained by near-eld microwave nondestructive techniques using an open ended rectangular waveguide probe. In fact, we model such images {{to be the result of}} a convolution of the real input images with a point spread function (PSF). This PSF depends mainly on the dimensions of the waveguide, the operating frequency, the nature of the object under test and stando distance between the waveguide and the object. Unfortunately, it is very dicult to model this PSF from the physical data. For this reason, we consider the problem as a blind deconvolution. The proposed method is based on regularization, and the solution is obtained iteratively, by successive estimations of the input and the PSF. The algorithm is initialized with a PSF obtained from a <b>very</b> <b>simplied</b> physical model. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on some real data. Several examples of real image enhancement will be prese [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In STOC 2000, Canetti, Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Micali {{put forward}} and exemplied, under {{standard}} complexity assumptions, the strongest notion of zero knowledge to date: resettable zero knowledge, or RZK. (Essentially, RZK proofs remain zero knowledge {{even if a}} malicious verier forces the prover to execute many times, each time starting with the same state and the same coin tosses.) In addition, to achieve constant-round RZK protocols, they put forward the public key model, where the <b>verier</b> <b>simply</b> has a public key registered before any interaction with the prover. In this paper, we demonstrate the exact round-saving capability of the public key model by showing a 3 -round black-box RZK protocol for NP, and by proving that 3 is indeed the minimum possible number of rounds. The result stresses the surprising power of this simple model. In fact, Goldreich and Krawcyk [GK 96] prove that, without public keys, 3 -round black-box protocols for non-trivial languages do not exist, ev [...] ...|$|R

Plasma was first identified in a Crookes tube, and so described by Sir William Crookes in 1879 (he called it [...] "radiant matter").

In July 1998, the Fox Broadcast Company announced the purchase of Family Guy for a January 1999 debut. Family Guy was originally intended to be a series of shorts on MADtv, much in the same way The Simpsons had begun on The Tracey Ullman Show a decade earlier. Negotiations for the show's MADtv connection fell through early on as a result of budgetary concerns. At age 24, MacFarlane was television's youngest executive producer.|$|E

500|$|The 1989 album Lukather {{came about}} after Toto had been {{recording}} and playing for 11years, and the consensus among {{the band members}} was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, {{with the intention of}} presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced <b>very</b> <b>simply,</b> and that a lot of ambient studio noise—counting off on various tracks, for instance—is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album.

500|$|Martin {{deliberately}} {{ignored the}} writing rule of never giving two characters names {{starting with the}} same letter. Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific royal houses and where even the secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly. The Ice and Fire story therefore has children called [...] "Robert" [...] in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a [...] "Brandon" [...] in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable [...] "Ty" [...] commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister. Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a given name by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. Henry V of England). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see backstory): the First Men in the North of Westeros had <b>very</b> <b>simply</b> descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas {{the descendants of the}} Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.|$|E
