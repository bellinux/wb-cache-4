40|$|The <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> <b>environment</b> {{enables the}} use of same personalised {{services}} with familiar interfaces in any location regardless of access networks or terminal devices. The realisation of the <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> <b>environment</b> requires advanced intelligence to be incorporated to networks for handling the diversity of the terminal and network landscape. In order to fulfil these requirements and to hide the complexity, enabling technologies, usage and development interfaces and service architectures have emerged. This paper explores the concept of <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> <b>environment</b> and presents existing solutions for service development, deployment and usage. Standards for service control and execution as well as for network and terminal adaptation are discussed. Furthermore, a complete end-to-end architectural solution for providing services is described. ...|$|E

Intelligent <b>home</b> <b>environments</b> are one of the major application areas of pervasive computing. Safety and security are two most important issues in the remote monitoring and control of intelligent <b>home</b> <b>environments.</b> This article takes safety and security into consideration together and proposes a phone-out-only policy for ensuring security and <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> <b>environments</b> for safety. A remote monitoring and control system for a security camera is used to illustrate the new methodologies for safety and security. By using the demonstration system people are able to easily monitor and control a security camera, central heating, microwave oven and washer from anywhere by using mobile phones. Our system distinguishes from the existing DTI (Department of Trade and Industry in the UK) next wave technologies and a few of on-going EU projects in the ways of dealing with safety and security and its simplicity. Remote monitoring and control of intelligent <b>home</b> <b>environments</b> can be of great benefits to the working families and holiday makers and has a great commercial potential...|$|R
40|$|Portable devices {{come with}} {{different}} individual limitations in user interaction like limited display size, small keyboard and different sorts of {{input and output}} channels. To allow ubiquitous, peripheral interaction, a flexible way to provide user interfaces for multiple devices and their different modalities is needed. However, current systems and formats do not sufficiently integrate advanced multimodal interaction and multiple devices. In that context, we present our approach on an advanced system for Multimodal Interaction and Rendering (MIRS) tackling three angles of the problem: UI description, selection of best device and modality, and the UI transformation/adaptation to the selected device. While the UI description is handled by our newly developed XML-based Dialog and Interface Specification Language (DISL), the device- and modality selection employs a profile-based approach, whereas the advanced UI transformations are built upun rule-based transcoding techniques. 1. Background Our research regarding multimodal user interfaces, and their support on different equipped devices, has its origin in the ITEA VHE-Project (Middleware for <b>Virtual</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Environments)</b> [2]. Goal of this project {{was to provide a}} middleware which is able to combine the great variety of existing devices, wired and wireless networks and services for in-home and out-home use, in order to establish a <b>virtual</b> <b>home.</b> One key issue to make these services usable on almost any device, rangin...|$|R

30|$|A user {{interface}} {{is considered an}} essential part of a building operating system in a smart home since it is supposed to help keeping residents in the loop by providing them with useful information and interactive options. In Orpwood et al. (2005), design methodologies and evaluation approaches of {{user interface}}s for people with dementia in smart <b>home</b> <b>environment</b> are elaborated. There is, however, no user interface prototype that is implemented, based on the methods mentioned in this article. In Borodulkin et al. (2002), a working prototype of 3 D virtual graphical user interface for a smart home is described. In the prototype, a sophisticated 3 D <b>virtual</b> smart <b>home</b> <b>environment</b> has been designed by using a Virtual Reality (VR) approach. The virtual reality user interface enables residents to view consumption values and manipulate appliances. Nevertheless the evaluation of the prototype is missing in the paper. In Becker et al. (2012), a user interface for providing the connection between the resident and the energy management named Energy Management Panel (EMP) is presented. The EMP is designed specially for the Energy Smart Home Lab (ESHL) (The Energy Smart Home Lab at KIT). It is evaluated in the scope of test residents by students at the KIT. Macık (2016) proposes a method for context-sensitive automatic user interface generation which has been showed the possibility of supporting solutions for the domain of the Internet of Things. However when it comes to put the theories into practice, namely generating a user interface for a specific building operating system, the author claims that there are still many challenges which need to be further addressed, therefore there is no available user interface instance for building operating systems in the article.|$|R

I {{would also like to thank}} Rebbecca Montanari for her assessment of the original system design, and providing access to a number of relevant papers. The ability to access coherent information services such as email and address books between multiple devices has so far been a result of static implementations that favour fast reliable connections and large-footprint web browser software. As a result, information access on the move via mobile devices is far from satisfactory, despite the fact that this is where access to coherent information services such as email come into their own.

40|$|Introduction: The {{level of}} {{assessment}} and intervention received by patients prior to discharge varies widely across stroke services in the United Kingdom. This study aimed to explore the potential value of virtual reality in preparing patients for discharge following stroke. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 13 occupational therapists, eight patients with a stroke and four community stroke survivors. Views were sought of the perceived acceptability, potential utility and limitations of a ‘virtual home’ environment for use in pre-discharge education and assessment. Data were analysed thematically. Findings: Interviewees found the <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> to be an acceptable and visual means of facilitating discussions about discharge. It was perceived as valuable in assessing patient insight into safety risks and exploring the implications of installing assistive equipment at home. Limitations were identified relating to specific software issues {{and the use of}} virtual reality with patients with cognitive or perceptual impairments. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the potential utility of the <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> within stroke rehabilitation.

40|$|Abstract—Managing a home server within {{individual}} {{house is}} a major obstacle to practical use of home network system (HNS). Delegating the home server to a cloud is a promising approach. However, the conventional multi-tenant SaaS-based solution has the following risks among different households: security/privacy violation, failure propagation and insufficient resource demand. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-based architecture for the home network system that achieves security isolation, fault isolation and resource isolation. Specifically, we first create a <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> server for every household using IaaS. On top of every <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> server, we then create additional virtual machines, each of which contains a single service or application. Finally, using dynamic scaling, we allocate resources needed for individual <b>virtual</b> <b>home</b> servers. Based on the idea, we construct the proposed architecture by three layers: HNS Lite, House Cloud and Service Provider.
