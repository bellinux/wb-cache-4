This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the throttle were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers. Modern automobiles still use a vacuum motor of a kind, however, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo.</b> <b>Brakes</b> are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver.

5000|$|This article mainly {{refers to}} the {{mechanical}} device {{in the context of}} a brake power booster or vehicular braking-system assist. The term [...] "vacuum servo" [...] is actually a generic term for any device which uses a vacuum to amplify/boost the mechanical effort of a device by use of a vacuum in an assisting chamber, either attached to the input or output, or placed between the input and output. In a <b>Vacuum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> the unit is placed between the brake pedal and the hydraulic master cylinder, using stored vacuum to amplify the drivers pedal efforts, giving a greater braking force.|$|R

Chassis-wise the vehicle featured a <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> assisted split-contour <b>braking</b> system, front disc brakes, radial tyres and [...] "aerodynamic" [...] hub caps. The prototypes were powered by a 2990 cc GAZ-24-14 V6 with a cast iron cylinder block originally developed for the GAZ-24, and the identical GAZ-24-18, with an aluminium block.

40|$|A method {{constructing}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> {{control system}} with a combined vacuum generator is proposed and the single neural adaptive PID control strategy is also proposed due to the inherent defects of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system in this paper. The influence of the system parameters to {{the characteristics of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system is analyzed and discussed. The simulation and the experiment show that the kind of <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system has the characteristics of faster response, higher control accuracy and stronger robustness. The control strategy presented can improve the static and dynamic behavior of the system effectively. PREFACE The vacuum technology has been widely used in various kinds of industrial fields, e. g. food industry, automotive manufacturing industry, metallurgy industry, et al. The applications are just limited in open-loop control [1][2]. But the reports to <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> control technology are few. It is because the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system has the inherent defects of larger time const, greater nonlinear and change with time. Considering the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> control technology will be widely used in the field of aviation and space flight, and it is very important especially in the closed to semi-practicality simulation system of the low altitude aircraft. According to the characteristics of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>servo</b> system, the single neural adaptive PID control strategy is proposed based on the reasonable constructing of system in this paper. The servo control of the vacuum signal with higher accuracy and faster response has been realized, and the achievement solves the simulation problem of the dynamic pressure and the static pressure in the semi-practicality simulation system of the low altitude aircraft...|$|R
