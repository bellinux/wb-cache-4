40|$|Macro {{velocity}} {{model building}} {{is important for}} subsequent pre-stack depth migration and full waveform inversion. Wave equation migration velocity analysis (WEMVA) utilizes the band-limited waveform to invert for the velocity. Normally, inversion would be implemented by focusing the subsurface offset common image gathers (SOCIGs). We re-examine this concept with a different perspective: In subsurface offset domain, using extended Born modeling, the recorded data {{can be considered as}} invariant with respect to the perturbation of the position of the <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> and velocity at the same time. A linear system connecting the perturbation of the position of those <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> and velocity is derived and solved subsequently by Conjugate Gradient method. In theory, the perturbation of the position of the <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> is given by the Rytov approximation. Thus, compared to the Born approximation, it relaxes the dependency on amplitude and makes the proposed method more applicable for real data.

40|$|Seismic {{reflection}} imaging is {{a popular}} method to image, characterize and monitor the Earth's subsurface. In this method, seismic signals are sent into the subsurface and their reflections are collected. Strong heterogeneities in upper sections of the subsurface often pose a problem for imaging deeper sections. To overcome these problems, it has been proposed to place receivers in a horizontal, deviated or vertical borehole and to turn these receivers into <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> by seismic interferometry. In this thesis, the correlation-based formalism that undergirds seismic interferometry is replaced by multidimensional deconvolution, yielding several important advantages. It is shown that multidimensional deconvolution improves the radiation pattern of the generated <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> and that it removes undesired artifacts.

40|$|In the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> (VS) method we crosscorrelate seismic {{recordings}} at two receivers {{to create}} a new data set as if one of these receivers were a <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> and the other a receiver. We focus on the amplitudes and kinematics of VS data, generated by an array of active sources at the surface and recorded by an array of receivers in a borehole. The quality of the VS data depends on the radiation pattern of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source,</b> which in turn is controlled by the spatial aperture of the surface source distribution. Theory suggests that when the receivers are surrounded by multi-component sources completely filling a closed surface, then the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> has an isotropic radiation pattern and VS data possess true amplitudes. In practical applications, limited sourceaperture and deployment of a single source type create an anisotropic radiation pattern of the <b>virtual</b> <b>source,</b> leading to distorted amplitudes. This pattern can be estimated by autocorrelating the spatial Fourier transform of the downgoing wavefield in the special case of a laterally invariant medium. The VS data can be improved by deconvolving the VS data with the estimated amplitude radiation pattern in the frequency-wavenumber domain. This operation alters the amplitude spectrum but not the phase of the data. We can also steer the <b>virtual</b> <b>source</b> by assigning it a new desired amplitude radiation pattern, given sufficient illumination exists in the desired directions. Alternatively, time-gating the downgoing wavefield before crosscorrelation, already common practice in implementing the VS method, can improve the radiation characteristics of a <b>virtual</b> <b>source.</b> GeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} the illumination of the subsurface and {{to eliminate the}} dependency of FWI on the source wavelet, we propose multiples waveform inversion (MWI) that transforms each hydrophone into a <b>virtual</b> point <b>source</b> with a time history {{equal to that of}} the recorded data. These <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> are used to numerically generate downgoing wavefields that are correlated with the backprojected surface-related multiples to give the migration image. Since the recorded data are treated as the <b>virtual</b> <b>sources,</b> knowledge of the source wavelet is not required, and the subsurface illumination is greatly enhanced because the entire free surface acts as an extended source compared to the radiation pattern of a traditional point source. Numerical tests on the Marmousi 2 model show that the convergence rate and the spatial resolution of MWI is, respectively, faster and more accurate then FWI. The potential pitfall with this method is that the multiples undergo more than one roundtrip to the surface, which increases attenuation and reduces spatial resolution. This can lead to less resolved tomograms compared to conventional FWI. The possible solution is to combine both FWI and MWI in inverting for the subsurface velocity distribution...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of interaural time differences (ITDs) to the localization of <b>virtual</b> sound <b>sources</b> {{with and without}} head motion was examined. Listeners estimated the apparent azimuth, elevation and distance of <b>virtual</b> <b>sources</b> presented over headphones. Stimuli (3 sec., white noise) were synthesized from minimum-phase representations of nonindividualized head-related transfer functions (HRTFs); binaural magnitude spectra were derived from the minimum phase estimates and ITDs were represented as a pure delay. During dynamic conditions, listeners were encouraged to move their heads; head position was tracked and stimuli were synthesized in real time using a Convolvotron to simulate a stationary external sound source. Two synthesis conditions were tested: (1) both interaural level differences (ILDs) and ITDs correctly correlated with source location and head motion, (2) ITDs correct, no ILDs (flat magnitude spectrum). Head movements reduced azimuth confusions primarily when interaural cues were correctly correlated, although a smaller effect was also seen for ITDs alone. Externalization was generally poor for ITD-only conditions and was enhanced by head motion only for normal HRTFs.
