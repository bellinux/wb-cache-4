50|$|This {{evolutionary}} {{redesign of}} the American 2.9 solved {{many of the}} reliability issues that plagued its predecessor. A stronger cylinder head design eliminated the 2.9's common failure of cracked heads. Hydraulic roller lifters replaced the simple hydraulic lifters used in the 2.9, which were sometimes overly sensitive to oil contamination, often requiring the lifters to be replaced prematurely. However, one major design fault was not completely eliminated: <b>Valve</b> <b>rockers</b> and upper pushrod tips still received poor oil supply, resulting in eventual wear to these areas, and consequential valvetrain noise {{as a result of}} the increased clearance. Required replacement of these parts is common in older engines.|$|R

50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their collapsed state, the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> arms, resulting in valves that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together rocker arms that are employed for each valve. One rocker follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, solenoid-controlled oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two rocker arms. While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|E
40|$|Maintenance, when optimized, {{has become}} {{in recent years}} {{one of the most}} {{important}} functions contributing to profitability. As a significant component in the overall cost budget, maintenance optimization can lead to benefits in terms of important reductions in operating costs. Therefore any model that contributes to improving the prediction procedures of the equipment condition is a tool of the upmost importance. In fact, by predicting the state of equipment it is possible to forecast its ability to produce in conformity with quality norms and requirements. Reliability models are a tool serving Maintenance in the achievement of this aim. Among the range of options available, non parametric models enable us to avoid establishing at the outset defined hazard or reliability functions; within the non parametric range the proportional hazards model allows simultaneous evaluation of the various factors involved in failure modes. In this work the proportional hazard model is applied to two complex types of equipment for which maintenance costs assume significant values, a mineral mill and four grinding machines for automobile engine parts. The proportional hazard model, which implies that hazards are proportional to each other within each given group of co variables that affect the occurrence of failures, and the relative influence of each factor within the group, provides a forecast of the future reliability of the equipment to which it is applied. The Maintenance Manager is able, on the basis of this data, to define the optimal maintenance to carry out on the equipment during the period covered by the forecast. In the case of the four grinders, the proportional hazard model with time dependent co variates is applied to two machines, both producing the same type of component - <b>valve</b> <b>rocker</b> arms. A relation is established between the condition and quality co variates. In conclusion the advantages and disadvantages of the model, from the phase of defining co variates and failure modes through to results analysis are summarizedAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

5000|$|An [...] "Oilhead" [...] {{is a name}} to {{describe}} BMW flat-twin motorcycle engines with partial oil-cooling, and to distinguish these engines from the earlier air-cooled [...] "Airhead" [...] models. [...] The Oilhead's finned cylinders have conventional air-cooling, but the four-valve cylinder-heads are oil-cooled. Unlike earlier BMW boxers which had a single camshaft in the crankcase (variously above or below the crankshaft), the Oilhead has a camshaft in each head. (It is still technically an ohv engine rather than a true sohc unit, as the camshaft bears onto very short pushrods which operate <b>valve</b> <b>rockers).</b> In 2013, BMW introduced water-cooling to its boxer range. The engine is still used in just one line of motorcycles the BMW R nineT.|$|R

50|$|Engine: In-line 6-cylinder, {{overhead}} pushrod operated {{valve engine}} with 3699cc capacity. Separate cast iron block and aluminum crankcase with detachable cast iron 6-plug head.

5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the cylinder head and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with exhaust valves operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two exhaust valves through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four exhaust <b>valves.</b> <b>Rocker</b> arms are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate valve lash. Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-stroke}} engine's six cylinders {{and upper}} half of the crankcase are all in one block, like the detachable cylinder head, of cast-iron. The head carries the <b>valves</b> and <b>rocker</b> gear operated by pushrods from the chain-driven camshaft running in an oil bath within the block below. The pistons are of aluminium alloy. The crankshaft runs in four bearings and has a vibration damper.|$|R

50|$|A top {{overhaul}} only covers {{the replacement of}} components inside the cylinder head without removing the engine from the vehicle, such as <b>valve</b> and <b>rocker</b> arm replacement. It {{may or may not}} include a valve job. A major overhaul however covers the whole engine assembly, which requires the engine to be removed from the vehicle and transferred to an engine stand. An overhauled engine refers to a major overhaul. By comparison, a major overhaul costs more than a {{top overhaul}}.|$|R
50|$|The oil {{and water}} pumps are located {{at the rear of}} the engine and the {{lubrication}} system uses a dry sump. Titanium is used for the <b>valves</b> and the <b>rocker</b> arms have a diamond-like coating. Each cylinder has an independent, electronically controlled throttle body.|$|R
5000|$|On 16 April 1925 [...] "The Motor Cycle" [...] {{published}} {{drawings by}} Turner of an OHC single he had designed, using {{a series of}} vertically stacked gears to drive the overhead camshaft. A subsequent redesign used bevel gears to drive a vertical camshaft, operating the <b>valves</b> through <b>rockers.</b> The only shared aspects of the two designs were the bore and stroke, 74 x 81 mm, with the barrel being sunk into the crankcases. The head could be removed from either design complete with undisturbed valve gear.|$|R
50|$|No springs are {{involved}} in the sleeve valve system, therefore the power needed to operate the valve remains largely constant with the engine's RPM, meaning that the system can be used at very high speeds with no penalty for doing so. A problem with high-speed engines that use poppet valves is that as engine speed increases, the speed at which the valve moves also has to increase. This in turn increases the loads involved due to the inertia of the valve, which has to be opened quickly, brought to a stop, then reversed in direction and closed and brought to a stop again. Large poppet valves that allow good air-flow have considerable mass and require a strong spring to overcome their inertia when closing. At higher engine speeds, the valve spring may be unable to close the valve before the next opening event, resulting in a failure to completely close. This effect, called valve float, can result in the valve being struck by the top of the rising piston. In addition, camshafts, push-rods, and <b>valve</b> <b>rockers</b> can be eliminated in a sleeve valve design, as the sleeve valves are generally driven by a single gear powered from the crankshaft. In an aircraft engine, this provided desirable reductions in weight and complexity.|$|R
