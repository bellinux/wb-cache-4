5|$|The {{most stable}} oxide of {{samarium}} is the sesquioxide Sm2O3. As many other samarium compounds, {{it exists in}} several crystalline phases. The trigonal form is obtained by slow cooling from the melt. The melting point of Sm2O3 is rather high (2345°C) and therefore melting is usually achieved not by direct heating, but with induction heating, through a radio-frequency coil. The Sm2O3 crystals of monoclinic symmetry can be grown by the flame fusion method (<b>Verneuil</b> <b>process)</b> from the Sm2O3 powder, that yields cylindrical boules up to several centimeters long and about one centimeter in diameter. The boules are transparent when pure and defect-free and are orange otherwise. Heating the metastable trigonal Sm2O3 to 1900°C converts it to the more stable monoclinic phase. Cubic Sm2O3 has also been described.|$|E

25|$|The {{process was}} {{designed}} {{primarily for the}} synthesis of rubies, which became the first gemstones to be synthetically produced, thanks {{to the efforts of}} Fremy and Verneuil. However, the <b>Verneuil</b> <b>process</b> could also be used for the production of other stones, including blue sapphire, which simply required ferric oxide to be substituted for chromium oxide, as well as more elaborate ones, such as star sapphires, where titania (titanium dioxide) was added and the boule was kept in the heat longer, allowing needles of rutile to crystallise within it.

25|$|National Lead {{was also}} where {{research}} into the synthesis of another titanium compound—strontium titanate (SrTiO3, pure tausonite)—was conducted. Research was done during the late 1940s and early 1950s by Leon Merker and Langtry E.

Dopants were also used to give synthetic titanate a variety of colors, including yellow, orange to red, blue, and black. The material is also isotropic like diamond, meaning there is no distracting doubling of facets as seen in synthetic rutile.|$|E
25|$|The first {{crystalline}} artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white sapphire (Al2O3, pure corundum) and spinel (MgO·Al2O3, pure magnesium aluminium oxide).

The <b>Verneuil</b> <b>process</b> involves an inverted oxyhydrogen blowpipe, with purified feed powder mixed with oxygen that is carefully fed through the blowpipe. The feed powder falls through the oxy-hydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or boule crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5nbsp&inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern Czochralski process may weigh several kilograms.|$|E
25|$|The {{continued}} {{success of}} synthetic rutile was also {{hampered by the}} material's inescapable yellow tint, which producers {{were never able to}} remedy. However, synthetic rutile in a range of different colors, including blues and reds, were produced using various metal oxide dopants. These and the near-white stones were extremely popular if unreal stones. Synthetic rutile is also fairly soft (hardness ~6) and brittle, and therefore wears poorly. It is synthesized via a modification of the <b>Verneuil</b> <b>process,</b> which uses a third oxygen pipe to create a tricone burner; this is necessary to produce a single crystal, due to the much higher oxygen losses involved in the oxidation of titanium. The technique was invented by Charles H. Moore, Jr. at the South Amboy, New Jersey-based National Lead Company (later NL Industries). National Lead and Union Carbide were the primary producers of synthetic rutile, and peak annual production reached 750,000 carats (150nbsp&kg). Some of the many commercial names applied to synthetic rutile include: Astryl, Diamothyst, Gava or Java Gem, Meredith, Miridis, Rainbow Diamond, Rainbow Magic Diamond, Rutania, Titangem, Titania, and Ultamite.|$|E

The highly purified feed powder is derived by first producing titanyl double oxalate salt (SrTiO(C2O4)2·2H2O) by reacting strontium chloride (SrCl2) and oxalic acid ((COOH)2.2H2O) with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The salt is washed to completely eliminate chloride, heated to 1000 °C in order to produce a free-flowing granularpowder of the required composition, and is then ground and sieved to ensure all particles are between 0.2-0.5 micrometres in size.|$|E
