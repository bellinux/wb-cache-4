60|$|The duke looked sad; {{his wife}} seemed plunged in {{profound}} thought; {{there was a}} silence of many moments. At length the duchess looked up, and said, in a calmer tone, and with an air of great seriousness, 'It seems that we have mistaken the character of our son. Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to us so quickly in our trouble, Mr. Bernard. It was very kind, as you always are.' Mr. Bernard took the hint, rose, bowed, and retired.|$|R
40|$|Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> today. It’s a {{pleasure}} to be here in Salt Lake City. You’ve got nearly everything here—mountains, desert, and, of course, the lake. In fact, as a native Californian, I would say the only thing that’s missing is the ocean. My subject today is the outlook for the economy. We are now two full years into the economic recovery, yet progress on restoring the economy from the damage caused by the financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession remains discouragingly slow. The news from the jobs front has been particularly disappointing, with the unemployment rate—currently 9. 2 percent—stubbornly high. This afternoon, I’ll give my perspective on why economic growth has been so modest and offer my outlook for the future, which anticipates some improvement during the second half of this year and next year. I’ll also talk about inflation, which has seesawed in recent months. Finally, I’ll explain what the Federal Reserve is doing to promote maximum employment and price stability. As usual, my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. Before I go any further, I should say a few words about the budget and debt limit situation in Washington, which is going down to the wire. I’ll refrain from commenting o...|$|R
40|$|Thank you <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> today. This {{afternoon}} I’ll {{be talking}} about the economy—where it’s headed and my thoughts about why it hasn’t done better. I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those of my Federal Reserve colleagues. My title is “Sailing into Headwinds: The Uncertain Outlook for the U. S. Economy. ” You’ll notice that I use the word “sailing, ” not “sinking. ” Given the very real economic disappointments we’ve experienced lately, it’s {{important to keep in mind}} that we are making forward progress. Our economy continues to expand, even if the pace is slow. For those of you who are familiar with sailing, it’s like beating to the windward with a very stiff breeze in our face. You don’t get there fast and the voyage is rough, but eventually you do reach safe harbor. I am confident we will find safe harbor, even if we feel a little seasick right now. Certainly we have experienced lackluster growth over the past several months and we face significant risks that could hold back the tempo of recovery. But the situation is much improved from the depths of the recession. The private sector is adding jobs and a truly terrible financial crisis is largely behind us. To keep things in perspective, think back to where we were just tw...|$|R
5000|$|... "On the 24th of April, 2013, I {{went into}} Blast Studios, Newcastle, UK {{to record a}} {{souvenir}} CD for the Acoustic tour in May/June. With the help of studio engineer, Mark Broughton I started recording at 11.00AM and finished at 17.10PM. It was just myself on an acoustic with a few mikes placed around me. Most of the tracks were first takes apart from Meat Abstract where I was finding my feet, Our Love Must Die because I forgot the lyrics and had to Google them and a new song, Meltdown Bound which I had to abandon for a later date as my fingers were too tired to play the tricky fingerpicking bits I'd written a few days earlier.It's mostly Therapy? tunes but also some new ones, written in the previous couple of weeks especially for the session. The track Lost In Care was written for the 'A Brief Crack of Light' album but only a snippet of it {{was used in the}} track The Buzzing. We also meant to record Living in the Shadow of the Terrible Thing, Exiles, Crooked Timber and Six Mile Water but ran out of time.Thanks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to the show and picking up this CD, I hope you enjoy it and thanks also for your continued support of Therapy? After this short tour we'll be getting together to work on our next album and look forward to seeing you all soon.Best, Andy C 30/4/13"- (liner notes) ...|$|R
60|$|That {{farewell}} {{had been}} spoken {{nearly two years}} since, and Lily Dale was then seventeen. Since that time, John Eames had been home once, and during his month's holiday had often visited Allington. But he had never improved upon that occasion of which I have told. It had {{seemed to him that}} Lily was colder to him than in old days, and he had become, if anything, more shy in his ways with her. He was to return to Guestwick again during this autumn; but, to tell honestly the truth in the matter, Lily Dale did not think or care <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> his <b>coming.</b> Girls of nineteen do not care for lovers of one-and-twenty, unless it be when the fruit has had the advantage of some forcing apparatus or southern wall.|$|R
