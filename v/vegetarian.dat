40|$|Abstract: This paper, a work-in-progress, {{uses the}} dining {{experiences}} of two <b>vegetarians</b> in Victoria, British Columbia {{to explore the}} unequal treatment they generally receive from Victoria‟s dining industry. Even though the participants felt that Victoria {{is a great place}} for <b>vegetarians,</b> findings from three interviews, four food menus, and my direct experience as a cook suggest that the restaurant industry—which is primarily geared towards non-vegetarians—treats diners in Victoria unequally, especially <b>vegetarians.</b> By identifying <b>vegetarians</b> as a distinct social group this project shows how inequality against <b>vegetarians</b> in Victoria operates. The thesis of the research project, however, cannot be generalized to include the larger body of <b>vegetarians</b> in Victoria because of the small sample group. This research project recognizes that far more interviews and further research are needed to verify its hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Two studies {{document}} do-gooder derogation (the {{putting down}} of morally-motivated others), {{by studying the}} reactions of meat-eaters to <b>vegetarians.</b> In Study 1, 47 % of participants freely associated negative terms with <b>vegetarians</b> and the valence of the words was negatively related to how much participants expected <b>vegetarians</b> {{to see themselves as}} morally superior to non-vegetarians. In Study 2 we manipulated the salience of anticipated moral reproach by varying whether participants reported these expectations before or after rating <b>vegetarians.</b> As predicted, participants rated <b>vegetarians</b> less positively after imagining their moral judgment of meat-eaters. These studies empirically document the backlash reported by moral minorities and trace it back to resentment by the mainstream against feeling morally judged. (114 words...|$|R
25|$|Packaged and {{processed}} foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so {{may be a}} special concern for <b>vegetarians</b> due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, <b>vegetarians</b> will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some <b>vegetarians</b> may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role {{in the production of}} cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other <b>vegetarians</b> may not take issue with its consumption.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{consistent}} findings of lower total cancer incidence in <b>vegetarians</b> than in meat-eaters in the UK, {{the results of}} studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) risk in British <b>vegetarians</b> have largely been null. This was {{in contrast to the}} hypothesis of a decreased risk of CRC in this population due to null intake of red and processed meats and increased intake of fibre. Although the data are inconsistent, {{it has been suggested that}} selenium (Se) status may influence CRC risk. METHODS: A literature review was performed of studies on CRC risk in <b>vegetarians,</b> Se intakes and status in <b>vegetarians,</b> and changes of Se intakes and status in the UK throughout the follow-up periods of studies on CRC risk in British <b>vegetarians.</b> RESULTS: <b>Vegetarians</b> in the UK and other low-Se areas were found to have low Se intakes and status compared to non-vegetarians. There was some evidence of a reverse J-shaped curve of Se intakes and status in the UK throughout the last three decades. These presumed patterns were followed by the changes in CRC mortality or incidence in British <b>vegetarians</b> during this period. CONCLUSIONS: Available data on Se intake and status in British <b>vegetarians,</b> as well as the relationship between their secular changes in the UK and changes in CRC risk in this dietary group, are compatible with the hypothesis that low Se status may contribute to the largely null results of studies of CRC risk in <b>vegetarians</b> in the UK...|$|R

5|$|Glamorgan sausage (Welsh: Selsig Morgannwg) is a {{traditional}} Welsh <b>vegetarian</b> sausage for which the main ingredients are cheese (usually Caerphilly), leeks and breadcrumbs.

The modern <b>vegetarian</b> version became popular during the Second World War when meat was harder to come by, and is now mass-produced by at least two companies. Variations include swapping the leeks for onions, as well as different herbs and spices, and various types of cheese.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor thesis "Preferences and {{consumer}} behavior when purchasing food for vegetarians" discusses how interest in a healthy lifestyle influences consumer preferences and behavior.

The results show that <b>vegetarians</b> are shopping more in specialized stores and traditional consumers prefer hypermarkets and supermarkets. <b>Vegetarians</b> are more interested in a healthy lifestyle and both groups maintain a healthy lifestyle for health reasons. <b>Vegetarians</b> and traditional consumers are also influenced by the impact of products on the environment and on products increasingly follow the label...|$|R

Vegetables such as spinach and cauliflower must be checked for insect infestation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{prospective}} {{studies have}} examined cancer incidence among <b>vegetarians.</b> METHODS: We studied 61 566 British men and women, comprising 32 403 meat eaters, 8562 non-meat eaters who did eat fish (‘fish eaters’) and 20 601 <b>vegetarians.</b> After an average follow-up of 12. 2 years, there were 3350 incident cancers of which 2204 were among meat eaters, 317 among fish eaters and 829 among <b>vegetarians.</b> Relative risks (RRs) were estimated by Cox regression, stratified by sex and recruitment protocol and adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol, body mass index, physical activity level and, for women only, parity and oral contraceptive use. RESULTS: There was significant heterogeneity in cancer risk between groups for the following four cancer sites: stomach cancer, RRs (compared with meat eaters) of 0. 29 (95 % CI: 0. 07 – 1. 20) in fish eaters and 0. 36 (0. 16 – 0. 78) in <b>vegetarians,</b> P for heterogeneity 0. 007; ovarian cancer, RRs of 0. 37 (0. 18 – 0. 77) in fish eaters and 0. 69 (0. 45 – 1. 07) in <b>vegetarians,</b> P for heterogeneity 0. 007; bladder cancer, RRs of 0. 81 (0. 36 – 1. 81) in fish eaters and 0. 47 (0. 25 – 0. 89) in <b>vegetarians,</b> P for heterogeneity 0. 05; and cancers of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissues, RRs of 0. 85 (0. 56 – 1. 29) in fish eaters and 0. 55 (0. 39 – 0. 78) in <b>vegetarians,</b> P for heterogeneity 0. 002. The RRs for all malignant neoplasms were 0. 82 (0. 73 – 0. 93) in fish eaters and 0. 88 (0. 81 – 0. 96) in <b>vegetarians</b> (P for heterogeneity 0. 001).
