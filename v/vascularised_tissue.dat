Therefore, the level of success of tissue regeneration {{is related to the}} nature of the tissue (Huey et al. 2012).

5|$|The {{biochemical}} {{basis for}} the toxicity of oxygen is the partial reduction of oxygen by one or two electrons to form reactive oxygen species, which are natural by-products of the normal metabolism of oxygen and have important roles in cell signalling. One species produced by the body, the superoxide anion (−), is possibly involved in iron acquisition. Higher than normal concentrations of oxygen lead to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Oxygen is necessary for cell metabolism, and the blood supplies it to {{all parts of the}} body. When oxygen is breathed at high partial pressures, a hyperoxic condition will rapidly spread, with the most <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissues</b> being most vulnerable. During times of environmental stress, levels of reactive oxygen species can increase dramatically, which can damage cell structures and produce oxidative stress.|$|R

They circulate in the blood in an immature form before migrating to <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissues,</b> where they undergo final differentiation and maturation with the help of stem-cell factor and other cytokines secreted by endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Mast cells are found in most tissues of the body, particularly in locations that are in close contact with the external environment, such as skin, airways, and intestines. They are, therefore, ideally placed to participate in the early recognition of pathogens. Activation of mast cells results in the release of a variety of solubl...|$|R

40|$|Vascularisation is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} greatest challenges in tissue engineering. Different strategies exist but cell-based approaches have emerged as a promising therapy to achieve successful vascularisation. The use of endothelial cells to engineer <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissues</b> has been extensively investigated. This field of research has evolved with the discovery of endothelial progenitor cells, a subpopulation with a high regenerative potential. However, the survival of endothelial cell populations alone seems to be impaired. To overcome this problem, co-culture systems, involving supporting cells, like mural cells, fibroblasts, or more tissue-specific cells have been developed. Endothelial cells benefit from the extracellular matrix components and growth factors produced by the supporting cells, which results in neovessel stabilisation and maturation. The use of endothelial progenitor cells in co-culture systems appears to be a promising strategy to promote vascularisation in approaches of increasing complexity. Herein, the authors provide an overview of the cellular strategies that can be used for increasing vascularisation in tissue engineering and regeneration...|$|R

In these complex wounds it is not uncommon for the metalwork to be covered primarily or with <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissue</b> transfers, while more distant portions of the same wound remain open, with topical negative pressure dressings in place.

40|$|Abstract: The hand {{is often}} {{thought of as a}} key {{discriminator}} in what makes humans human. The hand is both intricate and fascinating in its design and function, allowing humans to interact with their surroundings, and each other. Due to its use in manipulation of the person’s environment, injury to the hand is common. Devastating hand injuries have a profound, physical, psychological, financial and socially crippling effect on patients. Advances in operative techniques and improvements in microscopes and instruments allowed Malt &McKhann to perform the first successful arm replantation in 1962 [1]. This was followed by a myriad of autologous free flaps of varying composition, that were discovered after the mapping of the cutaneous blood circulation by Taylor and Palmer [2] and Mathes & Nahai’s classification of muscle flaps [3] providing us with countless options to harvest and transfer healthy, well <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissues</b> into areas of injury.

40|$|SummaryBackground and aimReconstruction {{of large}} and chronically {{infected}} recurrent abdominal wall defects with exposed bowel in a scarred wound environment, when component release {{has been previously}} performed but failed, is a veritable challenge. We use a pedicled innervated vastus lateralis muscle with a fasciocutaneous anterolateral thigh flap (PIVA flap) to restore {{the continuity of the}} abdominal wall with <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissues</b> and create a dynamic component that improves the functional outcome. Materials and methodsA one-stage PIVA flap was used in 15 patients with grade 4 transmural chronically infected defects. They had a mean of 4. 53 previous laparotomies and important co-morbidities. We determined post-operative reconstructive abdominal wall strength using a validated quality-of-life (QoL) hernia-related questionnaire and modified it to quantify donor-site morbidity at the thigh. We measured the maximal force generated at 60 °/s and the force velocity at 120 °/s by isokinetic dynamometric analysis at 3 and 12 months. Electromyography (EMG) was performed 12 months after the reconstruction to analyse the contractile integrity of the vastus lateralis segment. A two-sided sign test was used to analyse data. ResultsAll transmural chronic wounds healed without recurrence. Dynamometric strength increased significantly in the abdominal wall musculature (p <  0. 016) and in the donor thigh (p <  0. 023) between 3 months and 12 months after the intervention, which reflected in the EMG outcome and the high scores in the QoL measurements after 12 months. ConclusionsThe PIVA flap revascularises the scarred milieu, adds a dynamic component to improve function and may reach up to the xiphoid process. Donor-site morbidity is limited...|$|R

The multilineage potential of pericytes was assessed by testing their capability to differentiate towards osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineage in vitro. Pericytes and endothelial cells were co-seeded on Matrigel™ and the formation of tube-like structures was examined to study the angiogenic potential of pericytes. MSCs from AT and BM were used as controls. CD 34 -CD 146 + cells were successfully enriched from AT and BM. Only BM-derived cells exhibited trilineage differentiation potential. AT-derived cells displayed poor chondrogenic differentiation upon stimulation with transforming growth factor-β 1. Interestingly, osteogenic differentiation was more efficient in AT-PC and BM-PC compared to the respective full MSC population. Matrigel™ assays revealed that pericytes from all tissues integrated into tube-like structures. We show that MACS®-enriched pericytes from BM and AT have the potential to regenerate tissues of different mesenchymal lineages and support neovascularisation. MACS® represents a simple enrichment strategy of cells, which is of particular interest for clinical application. Finally, our results suggest that the regenerative potential of pericytes depends on their tissue origin, which is an important consideration for future studies...|$|R

This is the first time distribution, metabolism, and excretion data of N 9 -GP have been presented. ADME studies were performed using single i. v. doses of radiolabelled N 9 -GP administered to rats, focussing on the biological fate of the 40 -kDa PEG. Results indicated that N 9 -GP-related radioactivity was distributed throughout the body, being most abundant in highly <b>vascularised</b> <b>tissues,</b> and with lowest levels seen in the central nervous system. N 9 -GP was cleared from plasma within 1 week after dosing, while total radioactivity was eliminated more slowly, in a more pronounced biphasic manner. N 9 -GP seems to be cleared via receptor-mediated uptake (e. g., in the liver) or via the reticuloendothelial system with subsequent proteolysis. PEG is thereafter either cleared alongside the protein or released back into circulation. Furthermore, N 9 -GP-related radioactivity was excreted in both faeces and urine as 40 kDa PEG and degradation products. Some PEG-related radioactivity (not in any particular organ) was present in the carcass 12 weeks postdose, consistent with the long terminal elimination t½ of plasma radioactivity. As shown here for N 9 -GP, and previously for other protein-PEG conjugate products, disposition kinetics of conjugates and individual constituents appears to be compound specific. In addition to the size/structure of the PEG and protein moieties, protein-specific clearance pathways may contribute to the disposition of intact conjugate and PEG moiety...|$|R
