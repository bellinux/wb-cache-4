40|$|A case of {{posterior}} urethral valve {{found in}} a 11 -y e ar-old boy was presented. A diagnosis was made by means of voiding cystourethrogram and cystourethroscopy. He was successfully treated with retropubic resection of urethral valve and anterior Y-V plasty. Literatures of congenital posterior urethral <b>vavle</b> was reviewed and rarity of this abnormality in this country was discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effect of niobium {{content on}} laminar {{precipitate}} and high temperature mechanical properties of 21 - 2 N <b>vavle</b> steel was systematically studied, using specimens contain 0. 26 %, 0. 43 %, 0. 65 % 0. 82 % and 1. 06 % Nb. After different solid solution treatment and 750 °C aging heat treatment, experimental {{results showed that}} laminar precipitate was suppressed by niobium addition, and with the increasing of niobium content, laminar precipitate content decreased and size, distribution and morphology of laminar precipitate was meliorated. Then creep rupture strength and fatigue strength of experimental steels are improved with increasing of niobium...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the anatomy}} and the {{physiology}} {{of the larynx}} have been described qvite extensively we lack {{a deeper understanding of}} how it works, This is especially true for how the larynx is used in normal speech. Thanks to a new glottographic method invo i g the use of fiber optics which can be inserted through the nose (lfbf new informative data are now available. This paper describes some preliminary results with this technique. It also presents a tentative descriptive model of glottal articulation which is developed from assumptions about the innate laryngeal function. Ba sical laryngeal functions An important function of the larynx is to work as a sphincter. Phylo-genetically this sphincter exhibits two functions, one related to air-trapping an 5 one to protection. The air-trapping in and outlet <b>vavles</b> have been the true and false vocal folds, respectively. Air-trapping, which has some influenc...|$|R
