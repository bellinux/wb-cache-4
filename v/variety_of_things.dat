Reliability is not considered an intrinsic, unchanging property of tests because it could change when used under different conditions or {{in a different context}} than where it had been studied before.|$|E

In addition, the spider has inspired creations from an ancient geoglyph to a modern steam-punk spectacle. Spiders have been the focus of fears, stories and mythologies of various cultures for centuries.|$|E

In 1993, he voiced for a character in another one of Burton's productions, The Nightmare Before Christmas. (Reubens would later voice Lock for the video game [...] in 2004.) During the mid-1990s, Reubens played a recurring role on the TV series Murphy Brown.

Afterward, Reubens began working on an NBC pilot entitled Meet the Muckles, a show that {{would be based on}} You Can't Take It with You. The project got stuck in development hell, and was later dropped when Reubens' ideas grew too elaborate and expensive, although Philip Rosenthal blamed NBC's negative response on Reubens being on a [...] "blacklist".|$|E

Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman believed that the tweed jacket was [...] "a bit old for him" [...] but showed that he was a [...] "professor and student at the same time" [...] and gave him [...] "that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority". Smith suggested a bow tie, which Holman and others did not approve of, but once he had put it on they decided they had the costume. Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other influences included the [...] "element of a professor" [...] and [...] "big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones". The men's clothing store Topman reported that their bow tie sales had risen 94% for the month of April 2010, connected to when the series began airing.|$|E

[...] Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be. [...] Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, Chemical & Engineering News carried a 4-part debate.|$|E
