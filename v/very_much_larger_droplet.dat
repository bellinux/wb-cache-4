60|$|If now {{we compare}} the seeds with the quartz grains, {{we find that}} several are from twice to three times {{the weight of the}} grains found by Mr. Murray, and others five times, eight times, and fifteen times as heavy; but they are proportionately <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger,</b> and, being usually {{irregular}} in shape or compressed, they expose a <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> surface to the air. The surface is often rough, and several have dilated margins or tailed appendages, increasing friction and rendering the uniform rate of falling through still air immensely less than {{in the case of the}} smooth, rounded, solid quartz grains. With these advantages it is a moderate estimate that seeds ten times the weight of the quartz grains could be carried quite as far through the air by a violent gale and under the most favourable conditions. These limits will include five of the seeds here given, as well as hundreds of others which do not exceed them in weight; and to these we may add some larger seeds which have other favourable characteristics, as is the case with numbers 11-13, which, though <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>larger</b> than the rest, are so formed as in all probability to be still more easily carried great distances by a gale of wind. It appears, therefore, to be absolutely certain that every autumnal gale capable of conveying solid mineral particles to great distances, must also carry numbers of small seeds at least as far; and if this is so, the wind alone will form one of the most effective agents in the dispersal of plants.|$|R
