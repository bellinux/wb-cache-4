500|$|Windows Server 2012, {{along with}} Windows 8, {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Hyper-V, as presented at the Microsoft BUILD event. Many new features have been added to Hyper-V, including network virtualization, multi-tenancy, storage resource pools, cross-premises connectivity, and cloud backup. Additionally, many of the former restrictions on resource consumption have been greatly lifted. Each virtual machine in this version of Hyper-V can access up to 64 virtual processors, up to 1 terabyte of memory, and up to 64 terabytes of <b>virtual</b> <b>disk</b> space per virtual hard disk (using a new [...]vhdx format). Up to 1024 virtual machines can be active per host, and up to 8000 can be active per failover cluster. SLAT is a required processor feature for Hyper-V on Windows 8, while for Windows Server 2012 it is only required for the supplementary RemoteFX role.|$|E

Instead of writing data to an actual disc, it creates a <b>virtual</b> <b>disk</b> image. A virtual burner, by definition, appears as a disc drive in the system with writing capabilities (as opposed to conventional disc authoring programs that can create <b>virtual</b> <b>disk</b> images), thus allowing software that can burn discs to create virtual discs.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStorage {{elasticity}} on IaaS clouds is {{a crucial}} feature {{in the age of}} data-intensive computing. However, the traditional provisioning model of leveraging <b>virtual</b> <b>disks</b> of fixed capacity and performance characteristics has limited ability to match the increasingly dynamic nature of I/O application requirements. This mismatch is particularly problematic in the context of scientific applications that interleave periods of I/O inactivity with I/O intensive bursts. In this context, overprovisioning for best performance during peaks leads to significant extra costs because of unnecessarily tied-up resources, while any other trade-off leads to performance loss. This paper provides a transparent solution that automatically boosts I/O bandwidth during peaks for underlying <b>virtual</b> <b>disks,</b> effectively avoiding overprovisioning without performance loss. Our proposal relies on the idea of leveraging short-lived <b>virtual</b> <b>disks</b> of better performance characteristics (and thus more expensive) to act during peaks as a caching layer for the persistent <b>virtual</b> <b>disks</b> where the application data is stored. We show how this idea can be achieved efficiently at the block-device level, using a caching mechanism that leverages iterative behavior and learns from past experience. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal both for microbenchmarks and for two real-life applications using large-scale experiments...|$|R
