40|$|Management {{strategy}} evaluation (MSE) is {{a structured}} approach to designing fishery management {{systems that are}} likely to meet the objectives of stakeholders and managers. Management objectives are essential to the MSE process because they identify things that are important for a stock/fishery and they are used to evaluate and distinguish between alternative <b>management</b> <b>procedures.</b> <b>A</b> <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> maps the pathway from fisheries data to fisheries management actions, and it describes when management actions occur and what management actions occur in response to changes in <b>a</b> stock/fishery. <b>A</b> <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> includes three components: fishery monitoring data, the evaluation of the data (e. g., the stock assessment), and harvest decision rules or harvest control rules (HCR). A HCR sets catch or effort limits based on estimates of stock status. Reference points are control points that are used to determine which HCR is used based on stock status in <b>a</b> <b>management</b> <b>procedure.</b> <b>Management</b> <b>procedures</b> can be set up so that they are identical except for their reference points (thus they are alternative candidate procedures) and in this way the MSE process can be used to evaluate the performance of alternative candidate reference points, e. g., target reference points for north Pacific albacore as requested by NC 10.

The <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed from an accepted assessment of the CRA 4 (Wellington-Hawke's Bay) fishery, which used an integrated length-based assessment model fitted to commercial fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) biomass indices, commercial length-frequency data, and tag-recapture data. The assessment model had been Bayesian, and used the joint posterior distribution of parameters to predict the effect of 384 alternative harvest control rules on the future size of the CRA 4 stock. The harvest control rules all used CPUE as their input, and generated annual changes in catch, which were then simulated by the population dynamics of the operating model. Uncertainty was added to evaluations through observation error, added to the simulated CPUE observations, and stochastic serial auto-correlation variation in recruitment. We describe how this <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was used to effect a voluntary reduction in catch {{to address the problem of}} a rapidly declining population. ...|$|R

40|$|An age-structured {{production}} model (ASPM) {{is used to}} assess the Carpenter resource off the south western coast of South Africa. The model is fitted to standardized CPUE and length frequency linefish data. Problems encountered when attempting to fit the model to these data are explored. Reasons may include conflicting data, or complexities in the resource dynamics that are not incorporated in the simple density-dependent ASPM dynamics. Plausible parameter estimates are only achieved when fixing or imposing penalty functions for key parameters. However, this leads to deterioration in the fit to the data with systematic trends in the residuals which render results suspect and management advice based on such assessments dubious.

40|$|Simulations of {{management}} plans generally aim {{to demonstrate the}} robustness of the plans to assumptions about population dynamics and fleet dynamics.

Relative paucity of older fish in either or both of catches or surveys is a frequent occurrence which has a number of alternative explanations, including doming in selectivity, and estimates of many biological reference points are not robustto this uncertainty.

40|$|For many fisheries, {{there is}} a need to develop {{appropriate}} indicators, methodologies, and rules for sustainably harvesting marine resources. Complexities of scientific and financial factors often prevent addressing these, but new methodologies offer significant improvements on current and historical approaches. The Australian spanner crab fishery is used to demonstrate this. Between 1999 and 2006, <b>an</b> empirical <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> using linear regression of fishery catch rates was used to set the annual total allowable catch (quota). A 6 -year increasing trend in catch rates revealed shortcomings in the methodology, with a 68 % increase in quota calculated for the 2007 fishing year. This large quota increase was prevented by <b>management</b> decision rules. <b>A</b> revised empirical <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> was developed subsequently, and it achieved a better balance between responsiveness and stability.

40|$|The Canadian government&#x 27;s current <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> for harp seals is {{described}} by Fisheries and Oceans Canada as using the Precautionary Approach. Employing a similar underlying population model, we simulated the effects of uncertainty involving bias in estimates of human induced mortality, natural mortality, and pup production estimates {{as a set of}} robustness trials. Our results indicated that for the range of annual total allowable catches (TAC) considered and set for Canada&#x 2019;s commercial harp seal hunt (250, 000 &#x 2013; 350, 000), there were plausible circumstances under which the government&#x 27;s <b>management</b> <b>procedures</b> failed to meet their own conservation objectives. By contrast, <b>a</b> precautionary <b>management</b> regime should be robust to such levels of uncertainty. For some scenarios the current management strategy, although not fully specified, is likely to maintain a high TAC despite a declining population. In particular, once a high TAC has been set, the assessments are unlikely to provide the necessary evidence that the TAC should be reduced until the population is at a low level. Hence there is a substantial risk that the population may be depleted below the &#x 2018;minimum&#x 2019; (N 50) and &#x 2018;critical&#x 2019; (N 30) population reference points. There is a need for <b>a</b> <b>management</b> <b>procedure</b> based on risk analysis to be fully specified and tested. In the interim, reducing TACs to within limits calculated from a well-established precautionary procedure, such as Potential Biological Removal, would be a step towards more precautionary management. |$|R

We consider the German and Italian transmission grids. We remove links either randomly to mimic random failure events, or according to a topological characteristic, their so-called betweenness centrality, to mimic an intentional attack and test whether the resulting fragments are self-sustainable. We test this option via the tool of optimized DC power flow equations. When transmission lines are removed according to their betweenness centrality, the resulting islands have a higher chance of being dynamically self-sustainable than for a random removal. Less connections may even increase the grid’s stability. These facts should be taken into account in the design of future power grids...|$|R
