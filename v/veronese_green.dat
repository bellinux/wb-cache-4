50|$|Paolo <b>Veronese</b> <b>green</b> was a color {{formulated}} {{and used}} by the noted 16th-century Venetian artist Paolo Veronese.|$|E
50|$|Paolo <b>Veronese</b> <b>green</b> {{began to}} be used as a color name in English {{sometime}} in the 1800s (exact year uncertain).|$|E
2500|$|On {{two other}} {{occasions}} around this time, Van Gogh {{used the word}} [...] "arrangement" [...] to refer to color, {{similar to the way}} James Abbott McNeill Whistler used the term. In a letter to Gauguin in January 1889, he wrote, [...] "As an arrangement of colours: the reds moving through to pure oranges, intensifying even more in the flesh tones up to the chromes, passing into the pinks and marrying with the olive and <b>Veronese</b> <b>greens.</b> As an impressionist arrangement of colours, I’ve never devised anything better." [...] (The painting he is referring to is La Berceuse, which is a realistic portrait of Augustine Roulin with an imaginative floral background.) And to Bernard in late November 1889: [...] "But this is enough for you to understand that I would long to see things of yours again, like the painting of yours that Gauguin has, those Breton women walking in a meadow, the arrangement of which is so beautiful, the colour so naively distinguished. Ah, you’re exchanging that for something — must one say the word — something artificial — something affected." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to artnet.com Caullery {{probably}} {{came from}} the village of Caulery near Cambrai, but moved to Antwerp in 1594 where he trained with Joos de Momper. The date he went to Italy cannot be determined; his works prove that he did however reside in Venice, Florence and Rome. Caullery was inclined toward genre painting and dealt with a highly variety of scenes: carnivals on ice, fireworks, bull-fights, open-air collections, allegories of the five senses and meetings painted {{in the spirit of the}} Fontainebleau School. The tallness of his characters, their exquisite postures, smooth faces and bare foreheads characterize his style. His colours are highly sophisticated. Under the influence of the Italian Masters, his palette proved to be an innovation in Flanders: half tones, ocher-yellow, <b>Veronese</b> <b>green</b> and Burgundy red. His depiction of buildings shows him to be concerned with fine precision, while being very skillful at presenting perspective." [...] He died in Antwerp.|$|E
30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig.  3 a, {{the distribution of}} the arsenic and copper elements clearly appears correlated in most of the green areas. The concomitant presence of both elements evidences the use of Cu/As green pigment(s), for instance Emerald green and Scheele’s green. The frequent mention of <b>Veronese</b> <b>green,</b> a commercial name generally referring to Emerald or one of its variants [16], throughout the Gauguin’s writings [15, 17], evidenced the wide use of Cu/As-based green colours by the painter. Emerald green has been identified from numerous Gauguin’s paintings (at least seventeen), executed in France as well as in South Pacific [18]. This one was also found in the green overpaints, attributable to Gauguin, in Van Gogh’s Self-portrait dedicated to Gauguin [19]. The XRF scans recorded for Cu and As elements revealed the use of a similar green pigment in some areas considered as overpainted or retouched. For example, it was found in the darker and greener brushstrokes applied subsequent to the blue background (on the left side), but also in the greenish blue inpaintings above the signature and applied over chalk based-fillers (the MA-XRF map of Ca makes possible to stand out their presence in the whole painting). Emerald green oil colour was successfully identified by micro-FTIR, in the fragment taken from the small green leave painted over cracks after being filled, probably with a lead white/oil-based material.|$|E
40|$|I {{have decided}} to die in December. But before my death, I still want to paint a picture that I have had in my head, and for a month I have been working feverishly day and night [...] . Sure, one cannot judge one 2 ̆ 7 s own work properly: but I believe anyway that this {{painting}} not only surpasses all my earlier ones but also that I will never paint anything better or equal [...] . It is a canvas four-and-a-half meters long and one meter seventy high. The upper corners are chrome yellow, left an inscription, right the signature, like a fresco that has been painted on a golden wall {{and has not been}} finished in the corners. Lower down on the right is a sleeping child, then three women in a squatting position. Two figures are intimating each other their thoughts. Another one, larger than life-size -intentionally disregarding perspective - cowers, raises her arms, and looks with astonishment at those two beings who dare to reflect on their destiny. A figure in the center plucking fruit. Two cats next to a child. A white goat. The idol raises its arms mysteriously and rhythmically and seems to look into the future. A sitting figure appears to harken the deity. And finally, an old woman, close to death. She seems to be having her final thoughts, thus completing the legend; at her feet is a strange bird holding a salamander in his claws. This stands for the futility of idle talk. All this is happening {{at the edge of a}} spring in the woods. In the background there is the sea and the mountains of a neighboring island. Despite the transition in tones, the landscape changes from one side to the other between blue and <b>Veronese</b> <b>green.</b> From this the naked figures stand out in a bright orange. If somebody told students of the Beaux-Arts at the competition for the Prix de Roma: "Paint a picture on the theme: Où Venons-Nous? Que Sommes-Nous? Où Allons-Nous? -what would you do?" I have completed a philosophical work on this theme, a parallel to the Gospel. I believe it is good...|$|E
