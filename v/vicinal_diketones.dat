In this work were analysed beer wort flavor compounds, during primary fermentation, taking into study two beer wort types: one obtained from Pilsner malt (100 %), other from a mixture of Pilsner malt (80 %) and Caramel Malt (20 %). An Shimadzu GC/MS-QP 2010 equipment was used for samples analysis. The major compounds founded in beer wort samples, was derived from {{a vast array of}} compounds that arise from a number of sources. In this way, during fermentation and conditioning we founded different categories of secondary products: higher alcohols, esters, <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones</b> (VDK), organic acids and aldehydes. The concentration of this aroma compounds depends on malt type and the moment of wort examination.

An LC/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of diacetyl and 2, 3 -pentanedione in beer. A method allowing {{the determination of the}} amino acids (AA) related to the formation of VDK during fermentation was also developed. VDK were derivatized with o-phenylenediamine (OPDA) to form quinoxaline compounds. The reaction of VDK with OPDA was studied to optimize reaction time. Conversion of the diacetyl precursor, alpha-acetolactate, was tested using multiple oxidative decarboxylation techniques. Attempts were also made to determine simultaneously the AA, leucine, isoleucine and valine with the VDK. Simultaneous determination was unsuitable for the AA levels found in beer fermentation and separate methods for the determination of AA were developed. Total VDK were measured over a concentration range of 10 mug/L to 10 mg/L with less than 10 % variation. These analytical methods were tested using a laboratory scale experiment {{to assess the impact of}} fermentation temperature on total VDK production and AA absorption. Samples collected in a local brewery were analyzed for total VDK using the developed method...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} is an important, global cause of respiratory disease. Unlike many other non-communicable lung diseases, the proximal causes of many occupational lung diseases are well understood {{and they should}} be amenable to control with use of established and effective approaches. Therefore, the risks arising from exposure to silica and asbestos are well known, as are the means of their prevention. Although the incidence of occupational lung disease has decreased in many countries, in parts of the world undergoing rapid economic transition and population growth-often with large informal and unregulated workforces-occupational exposures continue to impose a heavy burden of disease. The incidence of interstitial and malignant lung diseases remains unacceptably high because control measures are not implemented or exposures arise in novel ways. With the advent of innovative technologies, new threats are continually introduced to the workplace (eg, indium compounds and <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones).</b> In developed countries, work-related asthma is the commonest occupational lung disease of short latency. Although generic control measures {{to reduce the risk of}} developing or exacerbating asthma are well recognised, there is still uncertainty, for example, with regards to the management of workers who develop asthma but remain in the same job.

The ligands were characterised by 1 H, 13 C–{ 1 H} NMR, MS and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Reaction of the ligands with one equivalent of {ReBr(CO) 5 } gave a series of Re-Ln complexes based upon the general formula fac-{ReBr(CO) 3 (L) } (where L = pyrido[2, 3 -b]pyrazine-derived ligands, L 1 –L 6). Solution IR studies confirmed the retention of the facially capped, tri-carbonyl coordination geometry at rhenium, and 1 H NMR studies confirmed coordination of the ligand to Re(I). EI HR MS data were obtained for each complex confirming the proposed formulation and stoichiometry. Single crystal X-ray structures were obtained for three of the complexes (Re-L 1, Re-L 2, Re-L 6), with each demonstrating that the ligands coordinate to Re(I) in a bidentate manner, via a four-membered chelate ring, which was unsymmetrical in the former two cases. The electronic absorption spectra of the complexes showed absorption into the visible region ca. 375 – 500 nm, (the complexes are orange-red in appearance). Following irradiation at 350 – 450 nm, the complexes display a solid-state broad emission peaking between 600 – 700 nm.

40|$|The gene {{encoding}} a putative (R,R) -butane- 2, 3 -diol dehydrogenase (bdhA) from Bacillus clausii DSM 8716 T was isolated, sequenced {{and expressed}} in Escherichia coli. The {{amino acid sequence}} of the encoded protein is only distantly related to previously studied enzymes (identity 33 – 43 %) and exhibited some uncharted peculiarities. An N-terminally StrepII-tagged enzyme variant was purified and initially characterized. The isolated enzyme catalyzed the (R) -specific oxidation of (R,R) - and meso-butane- 2, 3 -diol to (R) - and (S) -acetoin with specific activities of 12 U/mg and 23 U/mg, respectively. Likewise, racemic acetoin was reduced with a specific activity of up to 115 U/mg yielding a mixture of (R,R) - and meso-butane- 2, 3 -diol, while the enzyme reduced butane- 2, 3 -dione (Vmax 74 U/mg) solely to (R,R) -butane- 2, 3 -diol via (R) -acetoin. For these reactions only activity with the co-substrates NADH/NAD+ was observed. The enzyme accepted a selection of <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones,</b> α-hydroxy ketones and vicinal diols as alternative substrates.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of immobilized yeast bioreactors were examined for continuous fermentation of high-gravity worts. One of these is a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) that employs porous glass beads for yeast immobilization. The second system is a loop reactor containing a porous silicon carbide cartridge (SCCR) for immobilizing the yeast cells. Although there was some residual fermentable sugar in the SCCR system product, nearly complete attenuation of the wort sugars was achieved in either of the systems when operated as a two-stage process. Fermentation could be completed in these systems in only half the time required for a conventional batch process. Both the systems showed similar kinetics of extract consumption, and therefore similar volumetric productivity. As compared to the batch fermentation, total fusel alcohols were lower; total esters, while variable, were generally higher. The yeast biomass production {{was similar to that}} in a conventional fermentation process. As would be expected in an accelerated fermentation system, the levels of <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones</b> (VDKs) were higher. To remove the VDKs, the young beer was heat-treated to convert the VDK precursors and processed through a packed bed immobilized yeast bioreactor for VDK assimilation. The finished product from the FBR system was found to be quite acceptable from a flavor perspective, albeit different from the product from a conventional batch process. Significantly shortened fermentation times demonstrate the feasibility of this technology for beer production...|$|E
40|$|The brewing {{industry}} is facing challenges on rising commodity prices and utility prices that rise {{by a high}} margin on a yearly basis. Effective methods are required to reduce other process variables which elevate the operational costs {{in the production of}} beer. The aim {{of this study was to}} design and investigate the optimal control philosophy for beer fermentation using the proportional integral derivative (PID) control algorithm in the Micro-Brewery at the University of the Witwatersrand. This will be achieved by controlling the cooling regimes of the fermenter jacket in order to compute the gain constant (K 1) that would minimise the dead time (Td) and process reaction time (Ti) and produce a beer which will have desirable palatability attributes. All investigations were performed using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain and wort of 14. 30 P apparent extract. The controller constant, the dead time and rise time were found to be 9. 6 second, 2 seconds and 1 second, respectively. The Isoamyl acetate, Ethyl acetate and Ethyl Caproate esters were found to be 6. 8, 25 and 9 ppm, respectively and the <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones</b> (VDK) level was found to 20 ppb at the end of the fermentation. This study showed that beer colour (EBD) was found to improve with fermentation temperature for the first 2 days then remain unchanged and showed that temperature is a possible process variable in the optimisation of colour. The study also showed that the fermentation rate and duration increase with increase in temperature. The flavour ratio (R) improves as the temperature increases. The developed simulation program helped in selecting optimal profiles to reduce dead time and improve the controller efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Butanediol {{dehydrogenase}} (Bdh 1 p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{belongs to}} the superfamily of the medium chain dehydrogenases/reductases and converts reversibly R-acetoin and S-acetoin to (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -butanediol and meso- 2, 3 -butanediol, respectively. It is specific for NAD(H) as a coenzyme {{and it is the}} main enzyme involved in the last metabolic step leading to (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -butanediol in yeast. In this study, we have used the activity of Bdh 1 p, in different forms: purified enzyme, yeast extracts, permeabilized yeast cells, and as a fusion protein (with yeast formate dehydrogenase, Fdh 1 p) to transform several <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones</b> to the corresponding diols. We have also developed a new variant of the "delitto perfetto" methodology to place BDH 1 {{under the control of the}} GAL 1 promoter, resulting in a yeast strain that overexpresses butanediol dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase activities in the presence of galactose and regenerates NADH in the presence of formate. While the use of purified Bdh 1 p allows the synthesis of enantiopure (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -butanediol, (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -pentanediol, (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -hexanediol and (3 R, 4 R) - 3, 4 -hexanediol, the use of the engineered strain (as an extract or as permeabilized cells), yields mixtures of the diols. The production of pure diol stereoisomers has also been achieved by means of a chimeric fusion protein combining Fdh 1 p and Bdh 1 p. Finally, we have determined the selectivity of Bdh 1 p towards the oxidation/reduction of the hydroxyl/ketone groups from (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -pentanediol/ 2, 3 -pentanedione and (2 R, 3 R) - 2, 3 -hexanediol/ 2, 3 -hexanedione. In conclusion, Bdh 1 p is an enzyme with biotechnological interest that can be used to synthesize chiral building blocks. A scheme of the favored pathway with the corresponding intermediates is proposed for the Bdh 1 p reaction...|$|E
40|$|Beer is {{the most}} common {{alcoholic}} drink around the world. When talking about the beer quality, flavor of the beer is more concerned. Most of the brewers in Sri Lanka are using traditional methods to brewing beer. Most of brewers using pre identified recipe to produce mass production of beer. Therefore, beer quality i. e. flavor is varying brand by brand. It is important to study the variation of temperature, how will affect to the final alcohol production and the flavor compound formation. Beer manufacturing industry can be used this knowledge to increase the production efficiency and the product quality. It is very important to know about dynamics of forming flavor compounds. In this work the fermentation process is concerned since all the flavor compounds are formed during the fermentation. The mechanistic model is developed by based on the knowledge of biochemical processes in the yeast cell and previously developed mathematical models which are available in the literature. There are many beer models can be found such as Engasser et al.,(1981);Growth kinetic model, Gee at al.,(1988), Phisalaphong et al. (2006);Growth kinetic model and effect on temperature, W. F. Ramirez and J. Maciejowski.,(2007);Optimal beer fermentation, etc. The beer fermentation process is modeled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Growth model, nutrient model, and the flavor model are considered and developed. Growth model consists of sugar consumption, biomass growth and ethanol formation models. Those models are developed with temperature dependent parameters to observe the effect of the temperature. Three amino acids which are valine, leucine and iso leucine are considered for the Nutrient model. Consumption of these three amino acids is considered during fermentation. Flavor model is developed based on the growth model and the nutrient model. Flavor compounds are categorized into three groups which are fusel alcohols, esters and <b>vicinal</b> <b>diketones.</b> Altogether nine parameters are considered as flavor compounds and the effects of temperature on those are simulated with MATLAB/Simulink and JModelica. Industrial temperature profile is obtained and applied for the developed model and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the results are analyzed.

40|$|Traditional beer {{fermentation}} is a {{batch process}} in which an amount of yeast cells are suspended in the wort. The fermentation process usually takes five to ten days for complete attenuation. To increase the productivity, several strategies could be adopted, such as increasing the fermentation temperature, increased agitation, the application of continuous fermentation, the use of immobilised yeast, or a combination. However, these variables have a pronounced influence on beer flavour and on the physiology of the yeast. Another promising strategy may be to enhance the amount of suspended yeast cells in the batch fermenter, as this has beenproven effective in decreasing the fermentation time without major deleterious influences on beer quality. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} work was to contribute to a more systematic and complete understanding of the yeast physiology in relation to flavour formation upon so-called high cell density (HCD) fermentations. First of all, the response of different lager yeast strains to the HCD fermentation conditions was investigated. The results pointed out that the rate of fermentation was 2 - 4 times increased when high initial cell levels were used. High viabilities for all yeasts were observed throughout the fermentations. Except for diacetyl, the cell density had only an moderate influence on the flavour profile. Furthermore, yeast strain specific characteristics could not be overlooked as they determined the sensitivity of the yeast to the application of higher cell densities. As the oxygen availability decreased when higher yeast concentrations were pitched, the build-up of unsaturated fatty acids in the initial phase of the fermentation was repressed, and consequently, lower yeast growth rates were obtained. The expression levels of the genes HSP 104 and HSP 12 and the concentration of trehalose were higher with increased pitching rates, suggesting a moderate exposure to stress in case of higher cell concentrations. Though, the viability and the vitality of the yeast population were not affected. With exception of totaldiacetyl and the limited aerobic formation of essential membrane lipids, these results demonstrate that most aspects of the yeast physiology and flavour balance were not negatively affected when the pitching rate was changed. The decreased yeast net growth observed in HCD fermentations can have anegative impact on the physiological stability throughout subsequent yeast generations. Therefore, the use of different oxygen conditions was investigated to improve the growth yield during HCD fermentations. The results showed that increasing the oxygen supply to the yeast, by means ofpreoxygenation or intensive wort oxygenation, stimulated the build-up of essential membrane lipids essential for yeast growth. Wort oxygenationhad a significant decreasing effect on the formation of esters, which was caused by a decreased expression of ATF 1, compared with the other conditions. Lower glycogen and trehalose levels at the end of fermentation were observed in case of the HCD fermentations with oxygenated wort. Next to this, oxidative stress markers (CTT 1 and SOD 1) were induced in case of oxygenated wort, but this had no effect on the viability. However, repetitive exposure to too high concentrations of oxygen is known to be deleterious for the yeast viability. Therefore, optimum oxygen levels for HCD fermentations are needed through the application of yeast preoxygenation in combination with wort aeration. Preoxygenation increased the extent of growth without significantly affecting the yeast physiology, and was selected for further research. Next, successive fermentations of HCD populations were evaluated. It was shown that preoxygenating the yeast was essential for the yeast physiological stability and beer flavour compound consistency of high cell density fermentations during the process of serial repitching. In contrast,the use of non-preoxygenated yeast resulted in inadequate growth, whichcaused insufficient yield of biomass to repitch all eight generations, a decrease in viability, a moderate increase of yeast age, and a dramatic increase of the unwanted flavour compounds acetaldehyde and total diacetyl during the sequential fermentations. Therefore, in order to achievesustainable HCD fermentations throughout serial repitching, adequate yeast growth turned out to be essential. The combination of HCD and high gravity brewing (HGB) was investigated. It was shown that HGB exerted an extra source of stress upon the yeast cells in HCD populations. It was postulated that increased osmotic stress and ethanol stress, as a result of HGB, induced the expression of stress related genes (e. g., GPD 1, HSP 12, SSA 3, and CTT 1) and also triggered higher trehalose levels. Notonly the wort density, but also the relative proportion of sugars dramatically influenced the yeast fermentation performance. As sucrose fully activated the cAMP/PKA signal pathway, stress resistance decreased, lowering the viability of the yeast populations. Hence, it was suggested that the use of sucrose should be restricted to maintain a healthy yeast population. In addition, it was shown that optimisation of the wort FAN content clearly reduced the residual amount of total diacetyl in the HCD beers. Finally, pilot-scale fermentation trials showed that HCD beers could beproduced with similar characteristics as conventionally brewed beers. In conclusion, provided that an appropriate yeast strain is used and that the oxygen supply and wort composition are optimised, HCD fermentations do not negatively affect the yeast physiology and can produce beer ofacceptable quality with great time savings.
