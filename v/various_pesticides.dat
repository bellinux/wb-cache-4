25|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} soil erosion and sediment deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover. It {{is estimated that}} agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year. The accumulation of sediments (i.e. sedimentation) in runoff water affects water quality in various ways. Sedimentation can decrease the transport capacity of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also {{limit the amount of}} light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from sedimentation can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. Sedimentation also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and <b>various</b> <b>pesticides.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyse the {{alterations}} in the cortical and peripheral electrophysiological activity of rats acutely treated with combinations of insecticides. Young adult male Wistar rats were treated with 1 / 5 and 1 / 25 LD 50 of the insecticides dimethoate, propoxur, cypermethrin and amitraz, given alone or in triple or quadruple combinations. After 24 h, spontaneous cortical activity, and stimulus-evoked cortical and peripheral responses, was recorded and analysed. All treatments changed the cortical activity spectrum. The effect of the 1 / 5 LD 50 combinations indicated non-additive interactions. In the cortical-evoked responses, dimethoate and its combinations gave the strongest change in the latency, while amitraz and its combinations, in the response duration. In the tail nerve, relative refractory period was the most sensitive parameter. The frequency dependence of the cortical responses was the most strongly altered by propoxur, and the least, by amitraz. Our results indicate that simultaneous exposure by <b>various</b> <b>pesticide</b> agents, which happens possibly also in humans, deserves further investigation in, among others, neurotoxicological points of view...|$|R

50|$|Vector {{control of}} citrus {{greening}} {{began when the}} disease was first introduced in 2005. All commercial citrus growers are advised in applying two dormancy pesticide sprays. These broad-spectrum pesticide sprays are applied in winter when adult psyllid populations decline to almost exclusive overwintering adults. With this strategy, significant reductions of populations withhold for up to 6 months. This fact is crucial as it protects the spring flush, which accounts for over 70% of new leaves for the year, from the infectious psyllid attacks. The spring flush typically occurs 3 months past winter. More aggressive citrus grove care-takers may employ a wide host of pesticides {{to try to keep}} psyllid populations low year round. These growers may spray pesticides up to 7 times a year rotating <b>various</b> <b>pesticides</b> to employ different modes of actions against the psyllid. This is done in an attempt to prevent resistances of psyllids to the <b>various</b> <b>pesticides.</b> The spraying of pesticides is the only method of control for the citrus greening vector, the psyllid. It is impossible to kill all psyllids through pesticides, thus strategic timing of pesticide sprays are done to try and slow the gradual spread of HLB throughout the citrus grove. Unfortunately, at this time it is inevitable that a commercial citrus grove will reach 100 percent infection rates even with aggressive sprays.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the import of {{pesticides}} in Pakistan since February 1980, when import and sale of pesticide was shifted to private sector and subsidy on ground spraying was withdrawn. <b>Various</b> <b>pesticide</b> registration schemes of import have been discussed and number of pesticides registered in each scheme has been reported. The pros and cons of registration schemes have been discussed. An appropriate regression model satisfying basic assumptions has been developed for the import and consumption of pesticides.

The same growth rate has been calculated till 2002. The agricultural growth rate has been recorded lower than that of pesticide import excepting 1995 - 96, when highest agricultural growth rate of the decade was recorded to be 11. 7 % and with pesticide import growth rate of 10 %.

40|$|Owing to the {{intensive}} {{use of pesticides}} and their potential persistence in the environment, <b>various</b> <b>pesticide</b> residues {{can be found in}} the diet. Consumers are therefore exposed to complex pesticide mixtures which may have combined adverse effects on human health. By modelling food exposure to multiple pesticides, this paper aims to determine the main mixtures to which the general population is exposed in France. Dietary exposure of 3337 individuals from the INCA 2 French national consumption survey was assessed for 79 pesticide residues, based on results of the 2006 French food monitoring programmes. Individuals were divided into groups with similar patterns of co-exposure using the clustering ability of a Bayesian nonparametric model. In the 5 groups of individuals with the highest exposure, mixtures are formed by pairs of pesticides with correlations above 0. 7. Seven mixtures of 2 - 6 pesticides each were characterised. We identified the commodities that contributed the most to exposure. Pesticide mixtures can either be components of a single plant protection product applied together on the same crop or be from separate products that are consumed together during a meal. Of the 25 pesticides forming the mixtures, two-DDT and Dieldrin are known persistent organic pollutants. The approach developed is generic and can be applied to all types of substances found in the diet in order to characterise the mixtures that should be studied first because of their adverse effects on health.
