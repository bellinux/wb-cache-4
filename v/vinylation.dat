Aryl phosphates and ammoniums react through the SRN1 pathway, which involves the generation of an aryl radical anion, fragmentation, and bond formation with a nucleophile.

40|$|Decarboxylation and decarbonylation are {{important}} reactions in synthetic organic chemistry, transforming readily available carboxylic acids and their derivatives into various products through loss {{of carbon dioxide}} or carbon monoxide. In the past few decades, palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative and decarbonylative reactions experienced tremendous growth due to the excellent catalytic activity of palladium. Development of new reactions in this category for fine and commodity chemical synthesis continues to draw attention from the chemistry community. The Stoltz laboratory has established a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective decarboxylative allylic alkylation of β-keto esters for the synthesis of α-quaternary ketones since 2005. Recently, we extended this chemistry to lactams due to the ubiquity and importance of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. A wide variety of α-quaternary and tetrasubstituted α-tertiary lactams were obtained in excellent yields and exceptional enantioselectivities using our palladium-catalyzed decarboxylative allylic alkylation chemistry. Enantioenriched α-quaternary carbonyl compounds are versatile building blocks that can be further elaborated to intercept synthetic intermediates en route to many classical natural products. Thus our chemistry enables catalytic asymmetric formal synthesis of these complex molecules. In addition to fine chemicals, we became interested in commodity chemical synthesis using renewable feedstocks. In collaboration with the Grubbs group, we developed a palladium-catalyzed decarbonylative dehydration reaction that converts abundant and inexpensive fatty acids into value-added linear alpha olefins. The chemistry proceeds under relatively mild conditions, requires very low catalyst loading, tolerates a variety of functional groups, and is easily performed on a large scale. An additional advantage of this chemistry is that it provides access to expensive odd-numbered alpha olefins. Finally, combining features of both projects, we applied a small-scale decarbonylative dehydration reaction to the synthesis of α-vinyl carbonyl compounds. Direct α-vinylation is challenging, and asymmetric <b>vinylations</b> are rare. Taking advantage of our decarbonylative dehydration chemistry, {{we were able to}} transform enantioenriched δ-oxocarboxylic acids into quaternary α-vinyl carbonyl compounds in good yields with complete retention of stereochemistry. Our explorations culminated in the catalytic enantioselective total synthesis of (–) -aspewentin B, a terpenoid natural product featuring a quaternary α-vinyl ketone.

The resultant arylpalladium species are shown to undergo addition to the least substituted end of a variety of olefins including methyl acrylate, acrylonitrile and styrene. Subsequent palladium-hydride elimination leads to overall palladium catalysed <b>vinylation</b> of the chromone and the synthesis of a number of novel compounds. <b>Vinylation</b> occurs regiospecifically at the site of chromone bromination and is shown to allow clean substituent introduction into each of the three sites. The palladium catalysed reaction of 3, 6 -dibromo-chromone with methyl acrylate leads to <b>vinylation</b> at both the C 3 and C 6 positions. Carbonylation of the 6 -bromochromone in ethanol or butanol leads to the 6 -ethyl or 6 -butyl esters respectively. The palladium catalysed <b>vinylation</b> of the 6 -bromochromone with ethyl vinyl ether leads to a mixture of products from addition of the chromone to either end of the olefin. With p -bromophenol or p -bromo- N, N -dimethylaniline the reaction gives exclusively the acetylated product arising from addition to the more substituted end of the olefin. This change in orientation is rationalised by considering the polarisation of the olefin and the arylpalladium species.

(η 6 -Chroman) Cr(CO) 3 is synthesised and is shown to undergo regiospecific ring deprotonation at C 8 under kinetic conditions or regiospecific benzylic deprotonation at C 4 under thermodynamic conditions.
