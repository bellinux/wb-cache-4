500|$|Station {{reconstruction}} {{to accommodate}} the Victoria line was described as the most time-consuming for the Victoria line project. To handle the additional Victoria line passenger loads, a new ticket hall was constructed directly under the road junction. Separate banks of escalators to each line were to be built, with the existing structure {{to be used as}} exits with The lifts to be removed. A new one-way interchange subways system was to be built between the Bakerloo/Victoria lines and the Central line. To excavate the new ticket hall below the roadway, traffic was diverted for {{five and a half years}} (August 1963 to Easter 1968) onto a temporary bridge-like structure known as the [...] "umbrella" [...] covering the Regent Street/Oxford Street intersection. It consisted of 245 pieces of separate prefabricated steel work. The deck plates were placed on top of a system of steel girders which in turn rested on 25 cylindrical 3ft diameter concrete foundations, sunk from 43 up to 73ft deep at night. The cylindrical piles had to clear the sites of the main and secondary roof beams of the new ticket hall and various low-level obstructions. The piles had to be built with wide footings to avoid them from collapsing. Service tunnels were constructed to carry water mains and telecom cables past the new ticket hall. The umbrella deck was extended eastwards along Oxford Street to facilitate the construction of a connecting passageway between the old and new ticket halls during the weekend of the August Bank Holiday in 1966. Construction of the Victoria line station tunnels with their platforms, the new escalator shafts and the linking passages to the Central line platforms was carried out from access shafts sunk from nearby Cavendish Square, Upper Regent Street and Argyll Street. For the construction of the southbound Victoria line platform tunnel, a special design of tunnel segment, fabricated with mild steel was adopted as there was limited space available for the construction of the platform tunnel. A pre-stressed concrete raft was constructed below the Peter Robinson's third basement level as an extra precaution against settlement before driving the platform tunnel.

50|$|Several {{incidents}} have coloured {{the history}} of the line. On 1 August 1904 the passenger building of Bellegarde station went up in flames, to be rebuilt in 1913. 1922 saw the two biggest incidents on the line, a landslide and a tunnel accident. On 11 April, a huge landslide near Neyrolles station completely cut the line. On June 3 a new alignment was opened. The most difficult operational feature of the line was its longest tunnel, the Mornay tunnel. Over 1300m of the tunnel is at 2.4% gradient; running towards Bellegarde, steam locomotives had to operate at full power, filling the tunnel with smoke. The natural ventilation was poor. In May 1922, 7 members of a train crew were asphyxiated and died. Subsequently a special <b>ventilation</b> <b>plant</b> was opened in 1924, one of only two of it kind in France. It blew air into the tunnel when trains were passing through in the Bourg to Cluse direction.In 1932 a new station was built at le Neyrolles on the new alignment. During the second world war, the line had strategic importance, as {{there was a lot of}} resistance activity in the Ain and on the Jura plateeau. Several bridges were destroyed in 1944, starting with the bridge over the Suran on July 8, followed by the Cize Bolozon viaduct on the 8th and the Reyssouze bridge on 2 September.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the risk {{analysis}} evaluation about argon release from the GERDA experiment in the Gran Sasso underground National Laboratories (LNGS) of the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN). The GERDA apparatus, located in Hall A of the LNGS, is a facility with germanium detectors located in a wide tank filled with about 70 m 3 of cold liquefied argon. This cryo-tank sits in another water-filled tank (700 m 3) at atmospheric pressure. In such cryogenic processes, the main cause of an accidental scenario is lacking insulation of the cryo-tank. A preliminary HazOp analysis has been carried out on the whole system. The risk assessment identified two possible top-events: explosion due to a Rapid Phase Transition - RPT and argon runaway evaporation. Risk analysis highlighted a higher probability of occurrence of the latter top event. To avoid emission in Hall A, the HazOp, Fault Tree and Event tree analyses of the cryogenic gas extraction and <b>ventilation</b> <b>plant</b> have been made.

40|$|Pressurized {{ventilation}} acts {{to increase}} the oxygen supply to roots and rhizomes in some species of emergent plants. In a greenhouse experiment, we investigated how pressurized ventilation affected growth, biomass allocation and mineral content of Phragmites australis in two water depths (15 cm or 75 cm) and two substrates (organic sediment or sand). Through perforating each stem above the water surface, pressurized ventilation was inhibited without affecting oxygen diffusion. In controls, 10 - 20 % of the stems were perforated {{to make certain that}} lack of efflux sites would not limit pressurized <b>ventilation.</b> <b>Plants</b> with inhibited pressurized ventilation had lower oxygen concentrations in their stem bases than control plants. Growth was lower in plants with inhibited pressurized ventilation compared to controls except when plants grew in a combination of sand and shallow water. In plants grown in an organic sediment, but not in those grown in sand, inhibition of pressurized ventilation resulted in decreased biomass allocation to soil roots but increased allocation to aquatic roots. Stem perforation affected the tissue concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese and aluminium but not of calcium or iron. We suggest that the lower growth in plants with inhibited pressurized ventilation was caused by decreased mineral uptake, which may have resulted from the decreased proportional allocation to soil root weight, from decreased mineral availability or from impaired root function. In plants grown in sand in shallow water, diffusion seemed to cover the oxygen demand, as pressurized ventilation did not affect growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of window frames with low air permeability, {{due to the}} energy saving regulations, has implied in several cases the worsening of the indoor microclimate and air quality. On the other hand, air-tight window frames imply uncontrolled and too high air change rates. The mechanical ventilation not always is a practicable solution because of economic reasons and because it implies energy waste. Various Italian and European environmental and energetic laws take into consideration and promote the use of controlled natural ventilation, though this definition is not associated to well defined and tested technical solutions.

However, since the semi-passive grille has a one-way flow, in the natural ventilation of a flat the proper functioning of the system could be ensured with a more complex configuration, with respect to the passive self-regulating grilles, able to limit the flow of fresh air in the presence of high levels of p; conversely, it could have widespread use in applications requiring a more accurate control of airflow in case of mechanical <b>ventilation</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

40|$|Air {{ionization}} is an {{air cleaning}} technology used to additionally clean air from particles and gases {{in order to}} achieve good indoor air quality. The technology mimics nature´s own ability to purify air of particles, microorganisms, organics and odors. The report includes an experimental study of air ionization as air cleaning in <b>ventilation</b> <b>plants.</b> The experimental study is made in a laboratory with two experimental arrangements with the purpose of studying the removal efficiency of particles, gases and odors when using point ionization (spetsjonisering) and an ionization tube. Since humans spend most of their lives indoors, it is an important factor that particles, gases and odors are removed so that good indoor air quality can be achieved. The study is made in a filter rig and in a constructed chamber. The filter rig studies are made to see the effect of point ionization and its efficiency to increase the separation degree of air-filters. Trials in the filter rig are made with different settings to study what gives the point ionization its best effect. Best effect is achieved with long distance between the point ionization and the air-filter, low flow and with re-circulated air. Experiments are also made with two different materials of air-filter where the results show that a synthetic filter gives the point ionization better condition than with glass fibre filters. Overall, the experimental study of the air-filter rig shows no clear effect of point ionization. Experiments conducted in the chamber with 100 % re-circulated air show however on a marked improvement of the separation degree of air-filter when point ionization gets turned on. The experiment with point ionization shows that measurements made with a Dust Trak (particles ≤ 2. 5 μm) gives the highest efficiency. The decay speed of particles in size of 0. 3 - 0. 5 μm reduces when using ionization tube in the chamber compared to when only using air-filter and point ionization. The experimental study in the filter rig with point ionization does not show big improvement compared with the study made in the chamber. This could be {{due to the fact that}} the point ionization´s aggregate supplies the point tassels with too little voltage in relations to the flows used in the filter rig. The experimental studies from both arrangements show however that re-circulated air has a positive effect when using point ionization...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} system facilitates gaseous exchanges in in vitro plants promoting {{changes in the}} leaf tissue, which can be evaluated through the leaf anatomy, and it allows a cultivation closer to the photoautrophic micropropagation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects on in vitro growth and on the leaf anatomy of Cattleya walkeriana grown in natural and conventional {{ventilation system}} with different concentrations of sucrose (0; 15; 30 and 45 L- 1) combined with different cultivation systems (conventional micropropagation and natural ventilation system). The culture medium was composed of MS salts, solidified with 7 g L- 1 of agar and pH adjusted to 5. 8. Forty milliliters of culture medium were distributed in 250 mL flasks, autoclaved at 120 ºC for 20 minutes. The greater plant growth, {{as well as the}} greater thickness of the mesophyll was observed with the use of 20 g L- 1 sucrose in natural <b>ventilation</b> system. <b>Plants</b> grown in natural ventilation system showed a thicker leaf mesophyll, which is directly related to photoautotrophic crops. The natural ventilation system induced more elliptical stomata and probably more functional formats...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cost}} of energy has {{prompted}} industry to look {{for new ways to}} reduce operating expenses. Often ignored are the large amounts of recoverable energy present in the ventilation and process airstreams discharged from the plant. The recovery methods available range from fairly simple, well-known devices that have been around for years to new sophisticated equipment that is constantly entering the marketplace. Commonly applied to <b>plant</b> <b>ventilation</b> and process airstreams are these three general energy-recovery methods: 1. Substituting source-capture hoods and high-efficiency air cleaners for exhaust ventilation systems to permit recirculation. 2. Placing heat exchangers in process stacks and general ventilation airstreams, and 3. Collecting hydrocarbon contaminants from process stacks and reusing or selling them. In this paper I will touch on condensation and electrostatic precipitation as methods {{that can be used to}} collect and reuse in some form, hydrocarbons from process stacks...|$|R
