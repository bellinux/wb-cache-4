30|$|When the <b>Bubble</b> <b>Index</b> is 1, the L 2 -IBI {{processor}} calculates {{the correlation}} coefficient between filtered residual strength and filtered plasma density.

If the <b>Bubble</b> <b>Index</b> is not 1, or there is no plasma density data around the magnetically detected events (‘Unconfirmed Bubble’), the Bubble Probability is set to 0 automatically.

30|$|For further {{processing}} the filtered residual strength is rectified. The filtered/rectified residual strength (Fig. 1 (c)) is then {{compared with an}} event detection threshold (e.g., 0.2 nT): see the upper dashed line in Fig. 1 (c). Fluctuations exceeding the threshold are considered as an event. If two events are separated by less than a certain time interval (e.g., 60 seconds), they are merged to one event including the interval in-between. An event {{can be considered as}} an ‘EPB’ if it first satisfies the following morphological criteria (Stolle et al., 2006): fluctuations should not stand alone, but be accompanied by similar fluctuations in the surrounding (i.e. data points above the lower dashed line in Fig. 1 (c)) as well as by calm background (i.e. data points below the lower dashed line in Fig. 1 (c)). Our EPB detection approach goes one step beyond that of Stolle et al. (2006) by considering also the concurrent change in plasma density. In this final step filtered residual strength (Fig. 1 (b)) and plasma density filtered in the same way (Fig. 1 (e)) are correlated around the detected events (Fig. 1 (g)). If the square of the correlation coefficient (the ‘Bubble Probability’: see Subsection 3.3 for details) is higher than a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5), which confirms the diamagnetic effect, the event is deemed a ‘Confirmed Bubble’. In Fig. 1 (f) a ‘Confirmed Bubble’ appears with <b>Bubble</b> <b>Index</b> 1 with nonzero Bubble Probability: detailed descriptions of the <b>Bubble</b> <b>Index</b> and the <b>Bubble</b> Probability will be given in Section 3. If (1) the square of the correlation coefficient is lower than the threshold, (2) there is no plasma density data, or (3) the morphological criteria are not satisfied, the event remains an ‘Unconfirmed Bubble’. In Fig. 1 (f) an ‘Unconfirmed Bubble’ appears with <b>Bubble</b> <b>Index</b> 1 and <b>Bubble</b> Probability 0.

The enzymatic deinking of different types of waste paper demonstrated a high efficiency of 86. 6 % on laser-printed paper, but a low deinking efficiency of 12. 9 % was obtained with newspaper. All enzymatic treatments significantly improved the drainage rate of the deinked waste paper.

40|$|Background: Free ranging {{foraging}} {{animals can}} vary their searching intensity {{in response to}} the profitability of the environment by modifying their movements. Marine diving animals forage in a three dimensional space and searching intensity can be varied in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Therefore understanding the relationship between the allocation of searching effort in these two spaces can provide a better understanding of searching strategies and a more robust identification of foraging behaviour from the multitude of foraging indices (FIs) available. We investigated the movement of a widespread marine coastal predator, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), and compared two sets of foraging indices reflecting searching intensity respectively in the horizontal plane (displacement speed, extensive vs. intensive movement types, residence time) and in the vertical dimension (time {{at the bottom of a}} dive). We then tested how several factors (dive depth, direction of the trip with respect to haul-out site, different predatory tactics, the presence of factors confounding the detection of foraging, and temporal resolution of the data) affected their relationships. Results: Overall the indices only showed a very weak positive correlation across the two spaces. However controlling for various factors strengthened the relationships. Resting at sea, a behaviour intrinsically static in the horizontal plane, was found to be strongly negatively related to the time spent at the bottom of the dives, indirectly weakening the relationship between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> foraging <b>indices.</b> Predatory tactic (benthic vs. pelagic) was found to directly affect the relationship. In benthic (as opposed to pelagic) foraging a stronger positive relationship was found between <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>indices.</b> Conclusions: Our results indicated that movement responses, leading to an intensification of search, are similar in the two spaces (positive relationship), but additional factors need to be taken into account for this relationship to emerge. Foraging indices measuring residence in the horizontal plane tend to be inflated by resting events at sea, while <b>vertical</b> <b>indices</b> tend to distinguish mainly between periods of activity and inactivity, or of benthic and pelagic foraging. The simultaneous consideration of horizontal and vertical movements, as well as topographic information, allows additional behavioural states to be inferred, providing greater insight into the interpretation of foraging activity...|$|R

The result is shown in Fig. 7, which resembles the well-known seasonal-longitudinal (S/L) variation of EPB occurrence (e.g. Stolle et al., 2006; Xiong et al., 2010). During December solstice the occurrence rate is high around Brazil. During June solstice the occurrence rate is lower than during the other seasons; an occurrence peak exists around Africa. During equinox the occurrence rate maximizes near the Atlantic Ocean. All these results are consistent with previous studies on EPBs, and support that the L 2 -IBI processor correctly identifies EPB events. Note that the general level of occurrence rates in our Fig. 7 is lower than that of Stolle et al. (2006, figure 6) although both figures are based on CHAMP data. The difference simply reflects different definitions of occurrence rates, and does not signify inconsistency. In our Fig. 7 the occurrence rates are calculated for each GLAT × GLON bin while in the case of Stolle et al. (2006, figure 6) each CHAMP pass within a GLON bin is considered as a whole.|$|R

We obtain inhibition of emission only close to the slab center. However, enhancement of emission persists even outside the membrane, with a distance dependence which dependence can be understood by analyzing the contributions to the spontaneous emission rate of the different vertically guided modes of the membrane.
