Such a study is useful for understanding how the proposed mathematical models behave which represents a system with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> in homogenous wireless networks. We also propose to optimise the system characteristics {{in an attempt to}} provide better Quality of Service (QoS) for systems with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The proposed models have two dimensions; one for <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> and one for data calls. A channel is assigned for two input traffic <b>call,</b> namely, <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The incoming <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> are queued when the channel is busy. Since <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are delay-sensitive, priority is given to <b>voice</b> <b>calls.</b> Also, since there is only one channel, data calls are only serviced if there are no <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> in the system. For such systems, it is important to analyse the impact of buffering the <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> as well as data calls for various mean rates of call requests, and mean service times. The analytical models presented are generic which is applicable for various systems with similar characteristics. Numerical results are also provided.
