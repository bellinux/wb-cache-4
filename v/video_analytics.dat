25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a wide-angle time-of-flight camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and <b>video</b> <b>analytics</b> applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from sleep mode.|$|E

40|$|Movement {{classification}} {{or activity}} analysis {{is one of}} the most important areas in video surveillance. However, manually detecting, classifying and analyzing interesting moving objects by humans does not guarantee absolute correctness. When considering thereal environment and trying to relate the way objects interact in a surveillance covered area, it is not so easy interpreting every activity correctly. These challenges posed by defining and classifying objects â€Ÿ behaviours as normal or abnormalmovements. These challengescan be tackled using <b>video</b> <b>analytic</b> technologies. The objective of <b>video</b> <b>analytic</b> technologies is to detect the presence of objects that are moving in its field of view and to classify their movements for security, traffic monitoring and safety applications. There are a lot of hurdles faced by <b>video</b> <b>analytic</b> systems that impede their ability to perform accurately. This study presents a review of movement classification techniques and algorithms, which can tackle the challenges of realistic and practical outdoor surveillance scenarios.

50|$|The v1.0 <b>Video</b> <b>Analytics</b> Specification (VAS) {{specifies}} an interface {{that enables}} IP devices and video management/surveillance systems to communicate <b>video</b> <b>analytics</b> {{data in a}} standardized way.

Video analytic capabilities discovery will include standard configuration data exchange to enable any analytic device to communicate to another device or application its basic analytic capabilities at the device level and the video channel level (for multichannel devices). This includes information such as the PSIA VAS version number supported, analytic vendor information (name, software version number, etc.), event types and mechanisms supported, and other supported configurations. From an analytic output perspective, the v1.0 VAS includes the definition of multiple types of analytic events, including alerts and counts, as well as <b>video</b> <b>analytics</b> metadata output.|$|E

40|$|Myotonia congenita {{is a human}} muscle {{disorder}} caused by mutations in CLCN 1, which encodes human chloride channel 1 (CLCN 1). Zebrafish is becoming an increasingly useful model for human diseases, including {{muscle disorder}}s. In this study, we generated transgenic zebrafish expressing, {{under the control of}} a muscle specific promoter, human CLCN 1 carrying mutations that have been identified in human patients suffering from myotonia congenita. We developed <b>video</b> <b>analytic</b> tools that are able to provide precise quantitative measurements of movement abnormalities in order to analyse the effect of these CLCN 1 mutations on adult transgenic zebrafish swimming. Two new parameters for body-wave kinematics of swimming reveal changes in body curvature and tail offset in transgenic zebrafish expressing the disease-associated CLCN 1 mutants, presumably due to their effect on muscle function. The capability of the developed <b>video</b> <b>analytic</b> tool to distinguish wild-type from transgenic zebrafish could provide a useful asset to screen for compounds that reverse the disease phenotype, and may be applicable to other movement disorders besides myotonia congenita...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{proposes a}} color-based <b>video</b> <b>analytic</b> system for {{quantifying}} limb movements in epileptic seizure monitoring. The system utilizes colored pyjamas to facilitate limb segmentation and tracking. Thus, it is unobtrusive and requires no sensor/marker attached to patientâ€™s body. We employ Gaussian mixture models in background/foreground modeling, and detect limbs through a coarse-to-fine paradigm with graphcut-based segmentation. Next, we estimate limb parameters with domain knowledge guidance, and extract displacement and oscillation features from movement trajectories for seizure detection/analysis. We report studies on sequences captured in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Experimental evaluations {{show that the}} proposed system has achieved comparable performance to EEG-based systems in detecting motor seizures.
