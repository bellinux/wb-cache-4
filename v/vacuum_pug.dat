50|$|Pottery is made {{by forming}} a ceramic (often clay) body into objects of a {{required}} shape and heating them to high temperatures in a kiln which removes all {{the water from the}} clay, which induces reactions that lead to permanent changes including increasing their strength and hardening and setting their shape. A clay body can be decorated before or after firing; however, prior to some shaping processes, clay must be prepared. Kneading helps to ensure an even moisture content throughout the body. Air trapped within the clay body needs to be removed. This is called de-airing and can be accomplished either by a machine called a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pug</b> or manually by wedging. Wedging can also help produce an even moisture content. Once a clay body has been kneaded and de-aired or wedged, it is shaped by a variety of techniques. After shaping, it is dried and then fired.|$|E

At present, {{the dynamic}} {{analysis}} for non-stationary stochastic noise of ceramic paste inner stress {{is a difficult}} problem because a non-stationary stochastic noise has a time variant model and dynamic characteristics. In this paper, dynamic analysis ability of Short Time Power Spectrum (STPS) was systematically studied and improved in accordance with theoretical research and simulation analysis. The pressure signals between ceramic paste and head inwall of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pug</b> mill were studied so as to obtain {{the distribution of the}} ceramic paste inner stress. Experiments about the pressure signals had been carried out to verify the research result. Theoretical analysis and experimental result shows that: STPS with filtering performs well in analyzing non-stationary stochastic noise of ceramic paste inner stress in mutation situation. 1...|$|E
