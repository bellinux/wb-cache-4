5|$|A further £8,000, {{raised with}} the help of the society's members, was set aside for the {{construction}} and stocking of the park. Initially the zoo occupied only the southernmost , while the land to the north was used as a golf course. The park was designed by town planner Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law Frank Mears. Following Gillespie's vision, they modeled the park after the open designs of zoos like the New York Zoological Park and Hagenbeck's zoo in Hamburg. These modern zoological parks promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, and stood in stark contrast to the steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The Scottish National Zoological Park, as it was initially called, opened to the public with a large collection of donated and borrowed animals on 22 July 1913, after only 15 weeks of work. The zoo still occupies <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> area of land today, though the park is being extensively redeveloped.|$|E

The typical umlauts (for example fylla from *fullijan) were better preserved in the West due to later generalizations in the east where many instances of umlaut were removed (many archaic Eastern texts as well as eastern runic inscriptions however portray the same extent of umlauts as in later Western Old Norse).|$|E

Two days later on 23 June, she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters, {{one of whom was}} Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to [...] "Munshi": teaching her Hindustani, and acting as a clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled, and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League, and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby (the son of Sir Henry) discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage, and reported to Lord Elgin, Viceroy of India, [...] "the Munshi occupies <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position as John Brown used to do."

500|$|In the 1940s, Salinger {{confided to}} several {{people that he}} was working on a novel {{featuring}} Holden Caulfield, the teenage protagonist of his short story [...] "Slight Rebellion off Madison", and The Catcher in the Rye was published on July 16, 1951, by Little, Brown and Company. The novel's plot is simple, detailing 16-year-old Holden's experiences in New York City following his expulsion and departure from an elite college preparatory school. Not only was he expelled from his current school, he had also been expelled from three previous schools. The book is more notable for the persona and testimonial voice of its first-person narrator, Holden. He serves as an insightful but unreliable narrator who expounds on the importance of loyalty, the [...] "phoniness" [...] of adulthood, and his own duplicity. In a 1953 interview with a high school newspaper, Salinger admitted that the novel was [...] "sort of" [...] autobiographical, explaining, [...] "My boyhood was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as that of the boy in the book... t was a great relief telling people about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The characters' resolutions in Lightning Returns {{received}} much criticism. Marty Silva of IGN found the {{writing for the}} characters uninteresting, and that the game had [...] "forgotten why we ever liked these characters in the first place." [...] VanOrd stated that every character was [...] "defined by {{the most basic of}} traits, all of which serve the needs of the plot, rather than the plot flowing from the needs of the characters." [...] He also felt that their dialogue was overly frequent and poorly written. GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick found Lightning off-putting, and saw the inclusion of the other characters as [...] "more like a ham-fisted attempt at fan-service than a critical plot element." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey was also unimpressed both with Lightning and how the other characters had stayed <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> between XIII-2 and Lightning Returns, with them needing Lightning to move on. Dave Riley of Anime News Network found that the characters had improved slightly over their previous appearances, saying [...] "Dropping the pretense of stoic seriousness transmutes some of the sub-series's most insufferable elements into something marginally more tolerable, especially as it regards its main character." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were not}} {{unanimous}} in their praise. The Phoenixs Jeffrey Gantz felt that character was unoriginal, inaccurate and Westernized, writing, [...] " [...] costumes (particularly the kimono and obi Mulan wears to the Matchmaker) and hairdos look Japanese... Give Mulan Native American features {{and you have}} Pocahontas." [...] Similarly, James Berardinelli of ReelViews felt that the character's depiction was too [...] "familiar," [...] reviewing, [...] "Although she looks different from Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Pocahontas, Mulan is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> type of individual: {{a woman with a}} strong, independent streak who is unwilling to bend to the customs of her culture, which decree that the role of the female is to be ornamental. The film isn't very subtle in reinforcing the idea of equality between the sexes". Additionally, some critics, such as Alex von Tunzelmann of The Guardian, have criticized Mulan for her violence, writing, [...] "Disney struggles to make Mulan both a killer and a heroine... Gingerly, the film attempts to tread a middle path, implying that Mulan annihilates most of the Hun army by causing an avalanche, and having her dispatch Shan Yu with a load of fireworks. Very pretty. But still technically killing." [...] However, von Tunzelmann did conclude more positively, [...] "as Disney heroines go, Mulan herself is a clear improvement on the standard-issue drippy princess." ...|$|E

[...] Ronson said the same month however that he had not started to record the album. She performed [...] "Valerie" [...] with Ronson at a movie premiere but forgot some of the song's lyrics. In October Winehouse performed a four-song set to promote her fashion line. In December 2010, she played a 40-minute concert at a Russian oligarch's party in Moscow, the tycoon hand picking the songs.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} seven episodes, Brian Lowry of Variety said, the season begins [...] "on an uneven note", {{comparing}} {{some of the early}} moments to the works of Sam Peckinpah, [...] "complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt {{the first seven}} episodes of the season seemed [...] "to have learned the best of both" [...] from season one and Jessica Jones, [...] "placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city." [...] He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed [...] "the improved spotlight" [...] for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, [...] "So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and Daredevils particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original." [...] However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence Vondie Curtis-Hall brought as Ben Urich in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression [...] "feels much cleaner" [...] than the first's, [...] "moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless." [...] Merrill Barr of Forbes said, [...] "Daredevil season two is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> excellent show Daredevil season one was...but in the places it isn’t, it’s also very much improved". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of [...] "thick blacks" [...] in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.|$|E

In writing about its significance shortly after its loss, the Commander of Submarine Force Atlantic – in the March 1964 issue of the U.S. Naval Institute's monthly journal Proceedings – stated that, [...] "the Navy had depended upon this performance {{to the extent that it}} had asked for and received authority to build 14 of these ships, as well as an additional 11 SSNs with <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> characteristics.
