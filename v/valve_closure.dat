25|$|Multiple causes {{exist for}} AI {{in the setting}} of {{ascending}} aortic dissection. The dissection may dilate the annulus of the aortic valve, so that the leaflets of the valve cannot coapt. Another mechanism is that the dissection may extend into the aortic root and detach the aortic valve leaflets. The third mechanism is that if there was an extensive intimal tear, the intimal flap may prolapse into the LV outflow tract, causing intimal intussusception into the aortic valve preventing proper <b>valve</b> <b>closure.</b>|$|E
25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to <b>valve</b> <b>closure</b> have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E

2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral <b>valve</b> <b>closure)</b> and T1 (tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>closure).</b> Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act a bit like the strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow back flow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E

These results emphasize the risk of extrapolating results from one area to another, since the same species inhabiting different areas may be affected differently when exposed to the same stressors. Furthermore, the results obtained showed that, when combined, the impact of pH decrease and carbamazepine was lower than each stressor acting alone, which {{could be related to}} the defence mechanism of <b>valves</b> <b>closure</b> when bivalves are under higher stressful conditions...|$|R

50|$|The stem {{serves as}} a {{connector}} from the actuator {{to the inside of}} the valve and transmits this actuation force.

This packing is a wearable material and will have to be replaced during maintenance. With a smooth stem the ends are threaded to allow connection to the plug and the actuator. The stem must not only withstand a large amount of compression force during <b>valve</b> <b>closure,</b> but also have high tensile strength during valve opening. In addition, the stem must be very straight, or have low run out, in order to ensure good <b>valve</b> <b>closure.</b> This minimum run out also minimizes wear of the packing contained in the bonnet, which provides the seal against leakage.

40|$|Abstract. Piping systems {{commonly}} {{experience the}} transient-state situation {{as the result}} of changes to ow conditions during pump failures, <b>valve</b> <b>closures</b> or turbine load rejection. This paper addresses transients {{as a consequence of the}} load rejection of a Francis hydropower plant (Karun 4, Ahwaz, Iran). To control the turbine system and related equipment during load rejection, the valve closing law of wicket gates is of paramount importance. The pressure rise at the end of the pressure shaft, the pressure drop in the draft tube and the speed rise while the electromagnetic braking torque disappears are solely dependent on the closing curve. Thus, an optimum closing law can eliminate the probable risk of damage to the units. This paper develops a computational model to calculate water-hammer system components, such as pressure rise, speed rise, discharge variations and pressure uctuations. Results obtained from the present model are compared and validated with those obtained by a consultant at the Karun project. The eects of dierent valve-closing laws on the maximum head rise at the end of the pressure shaft and other components are also investigated...|$|R
40|$|Water hammer during {{multi-phase}} flow is rather complex, {{but in some}} cases an upper limit to the pressure surge magnitude during water hammer can be estimated. In the case considered here, a two mile long pipeline with a single high point was permitted to partially drain. Due to gravitational effects, air bubbles up through the pipe line to its highest point, but the time required for air to reach the top of the pipe is rather long. Consequently, some transients caused by valve operations are affected by air entrapment and some are not. The intent of this research was to investigate the complex interactions between air, water vapor, and liquid during water hammer in a long pipe with one end of the pipe open to atmospheric conditions. To understand the system dynamics, experimental data was obtained from a long pipeline with an open end and also from a short, transparent tube.
