5000|$|To use the colorimeter, {{different}} solutions must be made, {{including a}} control or reference of known concentration. With a <b>visual</b> <b>colorimeter,</b> {{for example the}} Duboscq colorimeter illustrated, {{the length of the}} light path through the solutions can be varied while filtered light transmitted through them is compared for a visual match. The concentration times path length is taken to be equal when the colors match, so the concentration of the unknown can be determined by simple proportions. [...] Nessler tubes work on the same principle.|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} notion that {{variations}} in cone spectral sensitivities could cause variations in color-name boundaries between individuals. Fifteen observers made color matches to a test stimulus (580 nm) with three primary lights in a <b>visual</b> <b>colorimeter.</b> The same observers took part in two psychophysical experiments to determine the color-naming boundary between two focal colors (yellow and green). In one experiment observers used a slider bar to indicate the boundary; in the other they were presented with a color stimulus and asked to state whether it was yellow or green in a 2 afc design. In {{the case of the}} 2 afc experiment the results indicate some evidence to suggest a correlation in the position of the name boundary and the ratio of red and green lights used in visual color matches...|$|E
40|$|The Munsell Color Science Laboratory has {{developed}} a new method for determining color matching functions. It relies on a mathematical model that expresses color matching functions {{as the product of}} linear transforms of the cone action spectra and variable transmittances of the lens and macula for each observer. With this model, the full spectral tristimulus functions can be computed from a minimum of five visual matches. A <b>visual</b> <b>colorimeter</b> was designed to implement the MCSL model. The current instrument utilizes CRT primaries and seven interference filters to make matches to simulated daylight in a 2 bipartite field. The system was designed to minimize the strain on observers. Color matching functions of naive observers can be measured in approximately 30 minutes. Results from an individual observer correlated well with data collected on the National Research Council of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s Trichromator. Color matching data for a single observer for 20 repetitions and 18 observers were measured. The variability for the single observer for 20 repetitions over a month 2 ̆ 7 s time was found to be similar to the uncertainty of matching within a measurement session. The variability of the 18 observers was found to be much larger. The results were compared with the CIE standard deviate observer. The CIE standard deviate observer showed variability {{similar to that of the}} single observer but much larger than the variability of the 18 observers evaluated in this research...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} quantitative {{procedure for}} bilirubin of Van den Bergh (1) {{was based upon}} comparison {{of the color of}} an ether extract, first with ferric thiocyanate solutions and later with cobalt sulfate standards. This inaccuracy of standardization has been eliminated by the availa-bility of purified bilirubin in both solid form and in comparatively stable solutions, and by the adaptation of the procedure to spectrophotometers and photoelectric colorimeters, both of which isolate narrow bands of light as compared to the entire spectrum used with <b>visual</b> <b>colorimeters.</b> The second problem was that of precipitation of the proteins by the addition of ethanol in the determination of total bilirubin, accompanied by subsequent loss of some bilirubin by adsorption, and by incomplete dissociation from the assumed protein-bilirubin complex. The solution to this problem was worked out by Malloy and Evelyn (2), who found that the serum proteins did not precipitate in 50 % methanol provided the final protein concentration was below a certain level. At this con-centration of methanol, full color development of the azorubin takes place. The final dilution in the original method was about 1 to 40 or 50, with a protein concentration of 300 - 400 mg. per 100 ml. Observa-tions during the present study indicate that protein precipitation in methanol does not occur under the proposed test conditions, if the serum dilution is 1 to 8 or more-that is, a protein concentration of not more than 1 %. Above this protein concentration precipitation almost in-variably occurs...|$|R
40|$|The methods most {{commonly}} employed for {{the estimation of}} blood glucose are dependent upon the ability of glucose to reduce alkaline copper solutions. Reagents containing phosphomolybdic acid are then frequently used to form a blue com-plex by combination with the reduced copper. All these methods suffer the disadvantage that the final colour fades at such a rate as to imperil its accu-rate comparison with a standard glucose solution similarly treated. Fading was neither very apparent nor of much importance when <b>visual</b> <b>colorimeters</b> were em-ployed with direct comparison of standard and unknown colours. Folin (1929) first recorded the existence of fading and described a method to combat it. Interest was aroused by the general adoption of the photoelectric colorimeter, and many technical modifications were introduced to circumvent fading. These were remarkable for their variety rather than for their success in routine use. In the present investigation the factors influenc-ing fading have been determined and a new modifi-cation of the Folin and Wu technique has been evolved which simplifies the standard technique {{at the same time}} as it eliminates fading. Although the Folin and Wu (1920) method was chosen for this investigation the principles involved are applicable to other methods of blood glucose esti-mation in which similar reagents are used. Reagents and Apparatus Analar grade materials were used in the prepara-tion of all reagents.

40|$|The colour of 30 cultivars is {{described}} using <b>visual</b> scores, a <b>colorimeter</b> generating 'L' (light-dark), 'a' (green-red) and 'b' (yellow-blue) parameters, a reflectance ratio (near infra red:red) meter and a chlorophyll extraction procedure. A combination of 'L' and 'b' values gave the closest correlation with visual colour score but neither parameter {{was associated with}} visual merit score. Reflectance ratios of both field plots and clippings were significantly correlated with visual colour, merit and colorimeter 'a' values.

40|$|Food {{security}} {{and sustainable development}} are interdependent. Development can be hindered by food insecurity as undernourished people have a reduced working capacity, greater vulnerability to illness, and lower school performance. Having sufficient caloric intake is necessary for survival, but having nutritious food is also necessary for health. Micronutrient deficiencies contribute to the global burden of disease by increased rates of illness, death and disability. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) {{is a serious problem}} in the developing world affecting an estimated 250 million pre-school age children. Between 250, 000 and 500, 000 of the affected children become blind every year, and half of these then die within one year. Diets that lack diversity, in which people are mainly dependent on staple crops such as rice, wheat, maize and white flesh sweet potato, can lead to VAD. HarvestPlus is developing and releasing orange high provitamin A maize germplasm in Zambia, and this program will be expanded to include other sub-Saharan African countries where maize is a staple food. This maize is bred through the process known as biofortification, the nutritional enhancement of staple crops to provide micronutrients. While white maize is traditionally preferred for human consumption in many areas. ^ The provitamin A compounds, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin and α-carotene are produced in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, and can be metabolized by humans to form Vitamin A, or retinol. While the enzymes in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway are well known, the allelic variation required to produce high provitamin A maize grain is not fully understood. Recent research has produced informative results. Natural polymorphisms in the lcyE gene in maize affect flux through the α-branch versus β-branch of the carotenoid pathway. Flux towards the β-branch is desirable to produce higher levels of β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin. A weak allele of crtRB 1 has been identified that results in lower expression of the enzyme. Reduced expression of crtRB 1 results in decreased conversion of β-carotene to β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin and thus a greater accumulation of β-carotene. ^ Different phenotypic and statistical methods were successfully used to further characterize the nature of allelic variation in a number of maize genes encoding enzymes in the carotenoid pathway, upstream to the pathway, and in the degradation of carotenoids. QTL mapping for carotenoid related traits in biparental populations using <b>visual</b> color-score, <b>colorimeter,</b> and NIR-VIS data identified a number of regions containing genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation including psy 1, crtRB 1, and z-iso. A genome-wide association study of carotenoid levels in a panel of 201 diverse maize inbreds identified four major loci (zep 1, lut 1, lcyE and crtRB 1) contributing to variation in the abundance of various carotenoid compounds and carotenoid ratios and the dxs 2 and lut 5 loci were also identified at the pathway level. A genome-wide association study of colorimeter data in a panel of 1471 diverse maize inbreds identified three major loci (dxs 2, psy 1 and lcyE) affecting color and the dmes 2 and zep 1 loci were identified in pathway level analysis. These collective results provide further support for the concept that genes responsible for orange color and carotenoid concentration overlap. The genes reported here provide a logical focus for breeding efforts to enhance provitamin A and orange color in maize. ...|$|R
