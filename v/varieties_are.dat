5|$|Banksia sessilis has a {{somewhat}} complicated taxonomic history. It was collected from King George Sound in 1801 and described by Robert Brown in 1810 as Dryandra floribunda, a name {{by which it}} was known for many years. However, Joseph Knight had published the name Josephia sessilis in 1809, which had precedence due to its earlier date, and the specific name was formalised in 1924. Four <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> recognised. It is a prickly plant with little apparent horticultural potential, {{and none of the}} <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> commonly seen in cultivation. A profuse producer of nectar, B.sessilis is valuable to the beekeeping industry.|$|E
5|$|Many unique {{varieties}} of mango are {{native to the}} country, most having been developed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. New and improved mango <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> still introduced to markets every few years. Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small to medium in size, fragrant, colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango season begins in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.|$|E
5|$|Most modern cultivars lack any {{fragrance}} although 'Dancing Queen' {{represents an}} exception. Fragrance is genetically related to flower colour (white, or pastel shades) {{and is a}} recessive characteristic, so that when fragrant and non fragrant <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> crossed, not all progeny will be fragrant, whereas two fragrant progenitors will produce an all fragrant progeny.|$|E
25|$|A quasi-{{projective}} <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> a Zariski open {{subset of}} a projective variety. Notice that every affine <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> quasi-projective. Notice {{also that the}} complement of an algebraic set in an affine <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> a quasi-projective variety; {{in the context of}} affine varieties, such a quasi-projective <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> usually not called a variety but a constructible set.|$|R
50|$|The Lango {{language}} is spoken by the Lango people, {{who live in}} mountainous areas of Ikotos County in Eastern Equatoria State, South Sudan. According to the Ethnologue, the Lorwama <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> spoken in Losite payam, Lofos and Lotome; the Logir <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> spoken in Ikotos and Lomohidong payams, Kidepo and Ludwera; the Logire (Imatong) <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> spoken in Ikotos payam between Ikotos and Chukudum; the Lokwaa <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> spoken in Kikire and Ikotos, and the Ketebo <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> spoken in Losite payam, Bira.|$|R

5|$|Some {{companies}} mass-produce commercial {{varieties of}} prepared clam dip and market them to consumers in {{grocery stores and}} supermarkets. Commercial <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> typically packaged in plastic tubs. Prepared clam dip mixes have also been commercially manufactured and marketed to consumers. One such product comes packaged with dried sour cream that is reconstituted using water.|$|E
5|$|While {{some wild}} {{narcissi}} are specific {{in terms of}} their ecological requirements, most garden <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> relatively tolerant of soil conditions, however very wet soils and clay soils may benefit from the addition of sand to improve drainage. The optimum soil is a neutral to slightly acid pH of 6.5–7.0.|$|E
5|$|As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value. However, some date and mint mark <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known {{variety of the}} 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands a higher price than the regular issue.|$|E

5|$|Cirrus clouds, like {{cirrostratus}} clouds, {{can produce}} several optical effects, such as halos {{around the sun}} and moon. Halos are caused by interaction of the light with hexagonal ice crystals present in the clouds, which, depending on their shape and orientation, {{can result in a}} wide variety of white and colored rings, arcs and spots in the sky. Common halo <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> the 22° halo, sun dogs, the circumzenithal arc and the circumhorizontal arc (also known as fire rainbows). Halos produced by cirrus clouds tend to be more pronounced and colorful than those caused by cirrostratus.|$|E
5|$|English has {{undergone}} many historical sound changes, {{some of them}} affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.|$|E
5|$|Green tea: This tea has {{undergone}} {{the least amount}} of oxidation. The oxidation process is halted by the quick application of heat after tea picking, either with steam, the method preferred in Japan, or by dry roasting and cooking in hot pans, preferred in Chinese tea processing. Tea leaves may be left to dry as separate leaves or they may be rolled into small pellets to make gunpowder tea. This process is time consuming and is typically done with pekoes of higher quality. The tea is processed within one to two days of harvesting, and if done correctly retains most of the chemical composition of the fresh leaves from which it was produced. Variation in steaming time for fixation or processing from additional stages of rolling and drying are sometimes used to improve or altering the flavour for types of green tea. Green tea leaves undergo fixation by either roasting (panning) or steaming. Generally, roasted <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> richer in flavor, while steamed <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> more vivid in color.|$|E

5|$|In 1858, the Mint {{tried to}} {{alleviate}} the breakage problem using {{a new version of}} the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Scots {{is today}} {{considered}} a separate language from English, {{but it has}} its origins in early Northern Middle English and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself {{has a number of}} regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, Scottish English are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland, most <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.|$|E

50|$|This <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> highly {{susceptible}} to blight, however it often avoids blight because it flowers so early. The plant of this variety flowers freely and the blooms are white and have yellow centres. The {{dry matter content}} of this <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> high and the texture is light and floury. This <b>variety</b> <b>is</b> said {{to be one of}} the best for mashing.|$|R

5|$|The {{most popular}} {{alcoholic}} drink in Switzerland is wine. Switzerland is notable for {{the variety of}} grapes grown {{because of the large}} variations in terroirs, with their specific mixes of soil, air, altitude and light. Swiss wine is produced mainly in Valais, Vaud (Lavaux), Geneva and Ticino, with a small majority of white wines. Vineyards have been cultivated in Switzerland since the Roman era, even though certain traces can be found of a more ancient origin. The most widespread <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> the Chasselas (called Fendant in Valais) and Pinot noir. The Merlot is the main variety produced in Ticino.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous display is at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> on display there.|$|E
5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and table grape <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt.|$|E

5|$|The family Cucurbitaceae {{has many}} species used as human food. Cucurbita species are some {{one of the}} most {{important}} of those, with the various species being prepared and eaten in many ways. Although the stems and skins tend to be more bitter than the flesh, the fruits and seeds of cultivated <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> quite edible and need little or no preparation. The flowers and young leaves and shoot tips can also be consumed. The seeds and fruits of most varieties can be stored for long periods of time, particularly the sweet-tasting winter varieties with their thick, inedible skins. Summer squash have a thin, edible skin. The seeds of both types can be roasted, eaten raw, made into pumpkin seed oil, ground into a flour or meal, or otherwise prepared.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Kota Kinabalu mainly speak Malay, with a {{distinct}} Sabahan creole. However, as almost 50% of Kota Kinabalu residents are of Chinese descent, Chinese is also widely spoken. Among the Chinese, the most commonly spoken <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> Huiyang Hakka (Simplified Chinese: 惠阳客家话; Traditional Chinese: 惠陽客家話) and Mandarin. Additionally, most Chinese can speak Cantonese, although with widely varying levels of fluency. Almost all residents are also able to speak English, especially the younger generation. However, some {{find it difficult to}} speak fluently due to a limited vocabulary and the general lack of usage of the English language as a conversational lingua franca among Sabahans as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting <b>varieties</b> <b>are</b> typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E
