5|$|In 1809, the {{industrialist}} Sir Joseph Bailey leased the castle, {{going on}} to purchase it outright in 1844, and established a walled kitchen garden known as Castle Gardens to the south-west of the main castle. It {{was used as a}} vicarage from 1825 onwards, including by Archdeacon William Bevan. The terraced gardens were maintained during the 19th century, with <b>various</b> <b>trees</b> planted behind the castle in the 1860s and 1870s, and a stable block was built within the grounds.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata, {{commonly}} known as the frosty fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. First described by Jean Louis Émile Boudier in 1885, I. maculata can be found throughout Europe, Asia and North America. It is a medium-sized brown mushroom with a fibrous, brown cap with white remnants of a universal veil in the middle. The stem is cream or brown. The species is ectomycorrhizal and grows at the base of <b>various</b> <b>trees,</b> including beech. Inocybe maculata is poisonous, containing muscarine. Possible symptoms after consumption of I.maculata mushrooms are salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and vomiting, with the possibility of death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Lake Chillisquaque {{is owned}} by Pennsylvania energy company Talen. It was {{constructed}} in 1972 and was originally created {{to serve as a}} supply of cooling water for the Montour Power Plant (a purpose which it still serves), but has also come to be used for recreational purposes. Approximately 200 bird species have been observed on or near the lake and more than 50 species of waterfowl pass by the lake during migration. It is also inhabited by numerous species of fish, some of which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. <b>Various</b> <b>trees,</b> shrubs, and herbaceous plants live {{in the vicinity of the}} lake as well. The main recreational activities on or near Lake Chillisquaque include fishing, boating, and hiking. The lake is also surrounded by the Montour Preserve, a nature preserve.|$|E

5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with <b>various</b> <b>trees,</b> especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 micrometers in diameter.|$|E

25|$|The Arboretum Trail is {{a walking}} trail winding through {{a wooded area}} {{on the west side}} of the grounds. The trail takes walkers past 60-million-year-old petrified tree stumps from the Amidon, North Dakota area, as well as 75 {{different}} species of trees and shrubs which are all labeled with ground plaques. Various statues and memorials are also on the trail. The trail was created in 1985 in anticipation of the state's centennial and also as an opportunity for state employees and the general public to exercise while learning about <b>various</b> <b>trees</b> and the history of the buildings on the grounds. Many area schools take their students to the trail for nature walks and students in the past have used the <b>various</b> <b>trees</b> for leaf collections. This damaged some of the trees, so signs that forbid leaf picking were posted.|$|E
25|$|When nests {{are also}} found built among the {{branches}} of <b>various</b> <b>trees,</b> {{the architecture of the}} nest is changed because of the substrate to which it has to attach. The most noticeable difference is that R. romandi nests connected to branches are sphericsl rather than hemispherical and mostly double-layered, with only a few single-layered sections. The envelope is not a gray color, but instead a creamy brown, suggesting differences in the plants available to construct the nest. The saliva coating of the envelope is thicker when built in trees, suggesting that the thickness of the coat might be related to the rain exposure of the nest location. Instead of a roof, the nests often use leaves from the tree, incorporated into the envelope, to cover the top of the nest. The number of combs in a branch-built nest is almost double that of one built on a solid surface, however they are much more irregular in shape and arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The firm land of {{the delta}} used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut down almost entirely and {{replaced}} with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees (Salix alba, Salix fragilis, Salix purpurea, Salix petandra, Salix triandra etc.) can still be found, mixed with white poplar (Populus alba). Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the levees of Letea and Caraorman, mixed forests of oak (Quercus robur, Quercus pedunculiflora) with <b>various</b> <b>trees</b> (Fraxinus pallisae, Ulmus foliacea, Populus tremula), shrubs (Prunus spinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Rosa canina, Berberis vulgaris etc.), and vines (Vitis sylvestris, Hedera helix, Humulus lupulus, Periploca graeca, which reaches up to 25m) grow on sand dune areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called hasmace. Fauna of this region include the meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo), etc.|$|E

Palm fronds in Karratha were blown off palm trees due to strong winds. In Whim Creek, where the cyclone had made landfall, the top floor of a 113-year-old pub and hotel was destroyed. A temporary roof made up of tarpaulins later collapsed in a flood event the following month. 140windmills between Whim Creek and Newman were destroyed by the cyclone.|$|E
500|$|<b>Various</b> <b>trees</b> are {{claimed to}} be [...] "the" [...] apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was {{purchased}} by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. The staff of the (now) National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale can supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.|$|E
500|$|A {{mycorrhizal}} species, L.torminosus {{associates with}} <b>various</b> <b>trees,</b> most commonly birch, and its fruit bodies (mushrooms) grow {{on the ground}} singly or in groups in mixed forests. The caps of L.torminosus mushrooms are convex with a central depression, and attain a diameter of up to [...] A blend of pink and ochre hues, the cap sometimes has concentric zones of alternating lighter and darker shades. The edge of the cap is rolled inward, and shaggy when young. On {{the underside of the}} cap are narrow flesh-colored gills that are crowded closely together. The cylindrical stem is a pale flesh color with a delicately downy surface and brittle flesh; it is up to [...] long and [...] thick. When cut or injured, the fruit bodies ooze a bitter white latex that does not change color upon exposure to air. The variety nordmanensis, in contrast, has latex that changes from white to yellow. Lactarius torminosus can be distinguished from similar species like L.pubescens or L.villosus by differences in morphology and coloration, or by microscopic characteristics like spore shape and size.|$|E

The Victoria Hotel and the Spa Baths were greatly modified by the syndicate, a group of investors including Lord Alverstone, Lord Iddesleigh and Edward Stanhope MP in 1887.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1860 and 1873, most of {{the major}} hurdles to {{construction}} were overcome, and the park was substantially completed. Construction combined the modern with the ageless: up-to-date steam-powered equipment and custom-designed wheeled tree-moving machines augmented massive numbers of unskilled laborers wielding shovels. The work was extensively documented with technical drawings and photographs. During this period, more than [...] of topsoil had been transported from New Jersey, because the original soil was neither fertile nor sufficiently substantial to sustain the <b>various</b> <b>trees,</b> shrubs, and plants called for by the Greensward Plan. When the park was officially completed in 1873, more than 10 million cartloads of material had been transported out of the park, including soil and rocks, and more than four million trees, shrubs, and plants representing approximately 1,500 species were transplanted to the park. More gunpowder was used to clear the area than was used at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|Sacred trees remain {{common in}} India. They {{are found in}} villages, in the {{countryside}} and the heart of some temples (e.g. Jain temples). Shripad Vaidya of Nagpur, Maharashtra has been dubbed an [...] "eco-worship center" [...] (Nakshatravan). It {{is the first in}} the world and is known for worship of the environment through plants. The Indian shastras and panchang [...] mention several ways of doing so, one of them being to offer prayers to <b>various</b> <b>trees.</b> There is even a belief in yakshas or yakshis, or nature spirits, who may dwell in trees or other natural places. By worshipping trees in which yakshas may inhabit, people seek to placate the spirits and bring health and prosperity into their lives. This is often done by placing incense and candles {{at the root of the}} tree or performing [...] "tree puja". Sometimes the statues of deities and nāgas may be nestled in between the roots since the tree grants the deity's murti shade and protection.|$|E

2500|$|The Chesapeake Bay is {{also home}} to a diverse flora, both land and aquatic. Common {{submerged}} aquatic vegetation includes eelgrass and widgeon grass. A report in 2011 suggested that information on underwater grasses would be released, because [...] "submerged grasses provide food and habitat for a number of species, adding oxygen to the water and improving water clarity." [...] Other vegetation that makes its home {{in other parts of the}} Bay are wild rice, <b>various</b> <b>trees</b> like the red maple and bald cypress, and spartina grass and phragmites. Invasive plants have taken a significant foothold in the Bay; plants such as Brazilian waterweed, native to South America, have spread to most continents with the help of aquarium owners, who often dump the contents of their aquariums into nearby lakes and streams. It's highly invasive, and has the potential to flourish in the low-salinity tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dense stands of Brazilian waterweed can restrict water movement, trap sediment and affect water quality. Various local K-12 schools in the Maryland and Virginia region often have programs that cultivate native bay grasses and plant them in the Bay.|$|E
