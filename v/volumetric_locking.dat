50|$|The generalized-strain mesh-free (GSMF) {{formulation}} {{is a local}} meshfree {{method in}} the field of numerical analysis, completely integration free, working as a weighted-residual weak-form collocation. This method was first presented by Oliveira and Portela (2016), in order to further improve the computational efficiency of meshfree methods in numerical analysis. Local meshfree methods are derived through a weighted-residual formulation which leads to a local weak form that is the well known work theorem of the theory of structures. In an arbitrary local region, the work theorem establishes an energy relationship between a statically-admissible stress field and an independent kinematically-admissible strain field. Based on the independence of these two fields, this formulation results in a local form of the work theorem that is reduced to regular boundary terms only, integration-free and free of <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking.</b>|$|E

In the 2 D setting, the Q 1 element is a standard four-node quadrilateral (Q) element with four integration points and shape functions of polynomial order one (1), whereas the Q 1 SP element possesses only one integration point in the element center combined with a special hourglass stabilization (S) technique which applies the equivalent parallelogram (P) concept and is thus free of <b>volumetric</b> and shear <b>locking</b> (see [50] for more information). In the 3 D case, the Q 1 and Q 1 SP elements are hexahedrals with trilinear shape functions.

40|$|Locking in finite {{elements}} {{has been a}} major concern since its early developments. It appears because poor numerical interpolation leads to an over-constrained system. This paper proposes a new formulation that asymptotically suppresses locking for the element free Galerkin (EFG) method in incompressible limit, i. e. the so-called <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking.</b> Originally it was claimed that EFG did not present <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking.</b> However, recently, performing a modal analysis, the senior author has shown that EFG presents <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking.</b> In fact, it is concluded that an increase of the dilation parameter attenuates, but never suppresses, the <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking</b> and that, as in standard {{finite elements}}, an increase in the order of reproducibility (interpolation degree) reduces the relative number of locking modes. Here an improved formulation of the EFG method is proposed in order to alleviate <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking.</b> Diffuse derivatives are defined in the thesis of the second author and their convergence to the derivatives of the exact solution, when the radius of the support goes to zero (for a fixed dilation parameter), it is proved. Therefore, diffuse divergence converges to the exact divergence. Since the diffuse divergence-free condition can be imposed a priori, new interpolation functions are defined that asymptotically verify the incompressibility condition. Modal analysis and numerical results for classical benchmark tests in solids corroborate this issue. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a {{position}} based tetrahedral finite element method of any order to accurately predict the mechanical behavior of solids constituted by functionally graded elastic materials and subjected to large displacements. The application of high-order elements makes it possible to overcome the <b>volumetric</b> and shear <b>locking</b> that appears in usual homogeneous isotropic situations or even in non-homogeneous cases developing small or large displacements. The use of parallel processing to improve the computational efficiency, allows employing high-order elements instead of low-order ones with reduced integration techniques or strain enhancements. The Green-Lagrange strain is adopted and the constitutive relation is the functionally graded Saint Venant-Kirchhoff law. The equilibrium is achieved by the minimum total potential energy principle. Examples of large displacement problems are presented and results confirm the locking free behavior of high-order elements for non-homogeneous materials. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{key factors}} for obtaining {{accurate}} and reliable results using the Finite Element Method (FEM) is the dis-cretization of the domain. Traditionally, two main types of elements are used for three-dimensional mesh generation: tetrahedral and hexahedral elements. Tetrahedral meshes are automatically generated but standard displacement-based tetrahedral elements generally suffer from performance issues in terms of convergence rate and accuracy of the solution associated with <b>volumetric</b> and shear <b>locking.</b> Because of these distinct disadvantages, hexahedral meshes have been used up until now {{for the design of}} biomechanical models of the orofacial system in particular for medical applications.

40|$|This paper {{promotes}} {{the development of}} a novel family of finite elements with smoothed strains, offering remarkable properties. In the smoothed finite element method (FEM), elements are divided into subcells. The strain at a point is defined as a weighted average of the standard strain field over a representative domain. This yields superconvergent stresses, both in regular and singular settings, as well as increased accuracy, with slightly lower computational cost than the standard FEM. The one-subcell version that does not exhibit <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking</b> yields more accurate stresses but less accurate displacements and is equivalent to a quasi-equilibrium FEM. It is also subject to instabilities. In the limit where the number of subcells goes to infinity, the standard FEM is recovered, which yields more accurate displacements and less accurate stresses. The specific contribution {{of this paper is to}} show that expressing the volumetric part of the strain field using a one-subcell formulation is sufficient to get rid of <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking</b> and increase the displacement accuracy compared with the standard FEM when the single subcell version is used to express both the volumetric and deviatoric parts of the strain. Selective integration also alleviates instabilities associated with the single subcell element, which are due to rank deficiency.

40|$|The DMS-FEM, {{which enables}} {{functional}} approximations with C(1) or still higher inter-element continuity within an FEM-based meshing of the domain, {{has recently been}} proposed by Sunilkumar and Roy [39, 40]. Through numerical explorations on linear elasto-static problems, the method {{was found to have}} conspicuously superior convergence characteristics as well as higher numerical stability against locking. These observations motivate the present study, which aims at extending and exploring the DMS-FEM to (geometrically) nonlinear elasto-static problems of interest in solid mechanics and assessing its numerical performance vis-a-vis the FEM. In particular, the DMS-FEM is shown to vastly outperform the FEM (presently implemented through the commercial software ANSYS (R)) as the former requires fewer linearization and load steps to achieve convergence. In addition, in the context of nearly incompressible nonlinear systems prone to <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking</b> and with no special numerical artefacts (e. g. stabilized or mixed weak forms) employed to arrest locking, the DMS-FEM is shown to approach the incompressibility limit much more closely and with significantly fewer iterations than the FEM. The numerical findings are suggestive of the important role that higher order (uniform) continuity of the approximated field variables play in overcoming <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking</b> and the great promise that the method holds for a range of other numerically ill-conditioned problems of interest in computational structural mechanics.

In addition to convenient formulation for constitutive law, solid element provides a straightforward extension to geometrically non-linear problems, particularly in the presence of large rotations, since only translational degrees of freedom are involved. Also, compared with shell elements, it is valid to consider double-sided contact because of real physical nodes on top and bottom surfaces without any further modification. However, for low order elements, as thickness/length ratio value tends to zero, the transverse shear-locking phenomenon becomes more evident. Also, plasticity leads to isochoric deformation, which is the main source of the <b>volumetric</b> <b>locking</b> phenomenon. Concerning bending dominant problems, it is difficult to use a single layer of solid elements due to the limitation of integration points along thickness direction. Multi-layered solid element increases the CPU time dramatically.
