25|$|The PlayStation Portable {{became the}} most {{powerful}} portable system when launched, just after the Nintendo DS in 2004. It was the first real competitor to Nintendo's handheld domination, where many challengers, such as SNK's Neo Geo Pocket and Nokia's N-Gage, failed. Its GPU encompassed high-end graphics on a handheld, while its 4.3 inch <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> and multi-media capabilities, such as its video player and TV tuner, made the PlayStation Portable a major mobile entertainment device at the time. It also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3, other PSPs and the Internet. It is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage medium.|$|E
25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a wide-angle time-of-flight camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen,</b> allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from sleep mode.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{splicing}} is {{done with}} a specialized instrument. The fiber ends are first stripped of their protective polymer coating (as well as the more sturdy outer jacket, if present). The ends are cleaved (cut) with a precision cleaver to make them perpendicular, and are placed into special holders in the fusion splicer. The splice is usually inspected via a magnified <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> to check the cleaves {{before and after the}} splice. The splicer uses small motors to align the end faces together, and emits a small spark between electrodes at the gap to burn off dust and moisture. Then the splicer generates a larger spark that raises the temperature above the melting point of the glass, fusing the ends together permanently. The location and energy of the spark is carefully controlled so that the molten core and cladding do not mix, and this minimizes optical loss. A splice loss estimate is measured by the splicer, by directing light through the cladding on one side and measuring the light leaking from the cladding on the other side. A splice loss under 0.1dB is typical. The complexity of this process makes fiber splicing much more difficult than splicing copper wire.|$|E

2500|$|The PSP {{received}} generally positive reviews {{soon after}} launch and most reviewers cited similar strengths and weaknesses. CNET awarded the system an 8.5 out of 10 and praised the console's powerful hardware and its multimedia capabilities while lamenting {{the lack of}} a screen guard or a guard over the reading surface of UMD cartridges. Engadget applauded the console's design, stating that [...] "it is definitely one well-designed, slick little handheld". PC World commended Sony's decision to include built-in Wi-Fi capability, but criticized {{the lack of a}} web browser at launch and the glare and smudges that resulted from the console's shiny exterior. Most reviewers also praised the console's large and bright <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> and its audio and video playback capabilities. In 2008, Time listed the PSP as a [...] "gotta have travel gadget", citing the console's movie selection, telecommunications capability, and upcoming GPS functionality.|$|E

2500|$|When {{television}} came to Australia in 1956, many radio figures {{sought and}} achieved {{employment in the}} new medium. Pearce was no exception, moving to HSV Channel 7 in Melbourne working as a newsreader and quiz show host. Pearce provided the first TV news report for that channel on 4 November 1956. The Argus reviewer F. Keith Manzie described Melbourne's first TV broadcast [...] "I liked Eric Pearce as a compere. His easy-mannered, genial personality came right through the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> in the quiz show, I've Got a Secret ... reading of the news was illustrated with appropriate newsreel shots". In 1956 he was also co-host of the series Eric and Mary, and in 1957 he was host of Be My Guest. Pearce resigned from HSV-7 in the late 1950s. He believed that newsreaders required credibility and that doing anything other than news for a job was ill-advised. When GTV Channel 9 offered him employment as chief news reader without him having to do any other shows, he took it. In 1961, he appeared in Let Me Read to You, {{in which he would}} read from popular works.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} form of electron microscope, the {{transmission electron microscope}} (TEM) uses a high voltage electron beam to illuminate the specimen and create an image. The electron beam is produced by an electron gun, commonly fitted with a tungsten filament cathode as the electron source. The electron beam is accelerated by an anode typically at +100 keV (40 to 400 keV) {{with respect to the}} cathode, focused by electrostatic and electromagnetic lenses, and transmitted through the specimen that is in part transparent to electrons and in part scatters them out of the beam. When it emerges from the specimen, the electron beam carries information about the structure of the specimen that is magnified by the objective lens system of the microscope. The spatial variation in this information (the [...] "image") may be viewed by projecting the magnified electron image onto a fluorescent <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> coated with a phosphor or scintillator material such as zinc sulfide. Alternatively, the image can be photographically recorded by exposing a photographic film or plate directly to the electron beam, or a high-resolution phosphor may be coupled by means of a lens optical system or a fibre optic light-guide to the sensor of a digital camera. The image detected by the digital camera may be displayed on a monitor or computer.|$|E

30|$|Although Dinehart (2015) was an {{advocate}} {{against the use}} of technology in early learning, citing that it diminished children’s fine motor skills, she did not consider apps designed for early childhood education that fostered fine motor skills through writing letters and numbers. Other concerns {{against the use of}} technology in early learning focused on {{the amount of time spent}} <b>viewing</b> <b>screens.</b> Vanderloo (2014) reported that children between 4 and 7  years of age spent an average 1.5 to 7.0  h <b>viewing</b> <b>screens</b> each day. Unfortunately, there was no differentiation between <b>viewing</b> <b>screens</b> for different activities such as watching a movie, watching a lesson on the interactive whiteboard, or playing games on an iPad (Vanderloo 2014). The sedentary nature of <b>viewing</b> <b>screens</b> was the catalyst for Vanderloo’s work, which is undoubtedly a concern; however, moderation of <b>screen</b> <b>viewing</b> may better guide the use of technology in early learning rather than banning it all together. This position is more aligned with the National Association for Education of Young Children (2012) who differentiated between <b>screen</b> <b>viewing</b> for interactive activities (e.g., mathematical apps) and non-interactive activities (e.g., movies) to promote active learning using technology.|$|R

50|$|Twin-lens reflex cameras used a pair {{of nearly}} {{identical}} lenses, one to form the image and one as a viewfinder. The lenses were arranged with the viewing lens immediately above the taking lens. The viewing lens projects an image onto a <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> which {{can be seen from}} above. Some manufacturers such as Mamiya also provided a reflex head to attach to the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> to allow the camera to be held to the eye when in use. The advantage of a TLR was that it could be easily focussed using the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> and that under most circumstances the view seen in the <b>viewing</b> <b>screen</b> was identical to that recorded on film. At close distances however, parallax errors were encountered and some cameras also included an indicator to show what part of the composition would be excluded.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} costs and effects of routine {{mammography}} screening by a single mediolateral-oblique view and two views (mediolateral-oblique plus craniocaudal) of each breast. DESIGN [...] A cost effectiveness analysis of a prospective non-randomised trial comparing one and two <b>view</b> mammography <b>screening</b> was carried out at St Margaret's Hospital, Epping. All women in the study had two view mammography. The mediolateral-oblique view was always the first image read by the radiologist. After reading the films for a clinic session, the same radiologist then went back and read both the mediolateral-oblique and craniocaudal views together. Each set of films was read by two radiologists. The main outcome measures were recall rates, number of cancers detected, screening and assessment costs, and cost effectiveness ratios. SUBJECTS [...] A total of 26, 430 women who attended for breast screening using both one and two view mammography participated. A sample of 132 women attending for assessment provided data on the private costs incurred in attending for assessment. RESULTS [...] There was {{a reduction in the}} recall rate from 9. 1 % (2404 of 26, 430) after one <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> to 6. 7 % (1760 of 26, 430) after two <b>view</b> <b>screening.</b> The results also suggest that for every 10, 000 women screened an additional five cancers would be detected earlier with two <b>view</b> <b>screening.</b> The additional health service screening cost associated with two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> was estimated to be 3. 63 pounds: the costs associated with one and two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> policies were estimated to be 41. 49 pounds and 32. 99 pounds respectively. Private costs incurred were estimated to be 0. 35 pounds per woman screened and 32. 75 pounds per woman assessed. Two cost effectiveness ratios were calculated: an incremental health service cost per additional cancer detected of 4129 pounds and an incremental health service plus private cost per additional cancer detected of 2742 pounds. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the results were sensitive to relatively large changes in a number of parameters. These included screening costs, assessment costs, equipment life, and recall rates. CONCLUSIONS [...] Use of two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> increased early cancer detection and also costs. The reduction in the recall rate with two views was not sufficiently large to make the cost of two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> neutral. While these results are not completely generalisable, a framework is provided to allow other centres to estimate the cost effectiveness of two <b>view</b> <b>screening</b> in their locality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Let APB ∠ be {{an angle}} {{in the three}} {{dimensional}} Euclidean space. When {{we look at this}} angle from various view points, the angle APB ∠ changes its appearance, which we call “visual angle”. Mori and Maeda [5] studied the relations among three visual angles of three dimensional orthogonal axes. They found out several geometric properties of these visual angles. In this paper, we will make a similar discussion in Minkowski space. In general, visual angle is realized on an equidistance surface (<b>view</b> <b>screen)</b> from the <b>view</b> point. For example, in the Euclidean space the <b>view</b> <b>screen</b> is a sphere centered at the observer. On the other hand, the <b>view</b> <b>screen</b> in Minkowski space is a (Euclidean) hyperboloid of two sheets centered at the observer. We will make clear the difference of visual angles of three dimensional orthogonal axes between Euclidean and Minkowski spaces. 1...|$|R
