40|$|Background Female stress urinary {{incontinence}} (SUI) greatly affects quality of life. The midurethal sling (MUS) procedure has been widely accepted as the standard of care treatment for SUI, although there is little information regarding patients 2 ̆ 7 subjective reports of symptom improvement. Objectives The objective {{of this study was}} to identify clinical and demographic characteristics that predict subjective symptom improvement following MUS procedures in women with SUI. Materials and Methods The study design was retrospective cohort. Subjects included women who underwent MUS between 2006 and 2008, returned mailed surveys and met our predefined inclusion criteria. Pre-operative data included demographics, prior surgery, co-morbid diseases, urodynamics and concomitant reconstructive surgery. Subjective improvement was measured by score improvement on the UIQ- 7, UDI- 6, the UDI stress subscale and Question 3 of the UDI, 2 ̆ 2 Do you experience urine leakage related to physical activity, coughing, or sneezing? 2 ̆ 2 Results The mean age of the study sample was 57 years, parity was 2. 5 and BMI was 28. Subjects with lower MUCP demonstrated more improvement on the UIQ- 7. ΔUDI- 6 stress subscale scores were more sensitive to symptom change than either the ΔUDI- 6 or ΔUIQ- 7. Older, menopausal subjects with urethral hypermobility and concomitant <b>vaginal</b> <b>suspension</b> showed less improvement than subjects without these characteristics. After controlling for urethral straining angle, PVR, menopause and time out from surgery, older age and concomitant <b>vaginal</b> <b>suspension</b> were associated with persistent post-op symptoms on the UDI- 6 Question 3 and age remained the only variable associated with persistent symptoms on the UDI- 6 stress subscale. Conclusion Concurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>suspension</b> and advancing age were risk factors for persistent symptoms following MUS procedures in patients with SUI. Symptoms may recur after 24 post-operative months. Clinicians are encouraged to provide additional preoperative counseling to those women who are at greatest risk for persistent symptoms...|$|E
30|$|The overall {{conversion}} rate was 3.0 % or 17 {{patients with a}} median age of 68 (range 44 - 81; IQR 12). There were 13 strategic conversions. In 11 cases, conversion was because of adhesions (1.9 %; median age[*]=[*] 67; range 56 – 76; IQR 11); 9 were completed as open sacropexies (median age 67; range 56 – 73, IQR 11), and 2 had a <b>vaginal</b> <b>suspension</b> (age 67 and 76) instead.

40|$|This sequential, prospective, {{observational}} {{clinical trial}} evaluated a systematic arrangement of laparoscopic total abdominal hysterectomy and prophylactic, retroperitoneal posterior culdoplasty with <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> surgical techniques by suturing method. The uterus was extirpated laparoscopically in 25 consecutive patients using an extra- and intra-corporeal two-turn flat square knot method. Upon completion of uterine excision, a new prophylactic laparoscopic technique of retroperitoneal posterior culdoplasty and <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> were initiated to prevent pelvic relaxation. Retroperitoneal culdoplasty was performed using the anterior rectal fascia, the posterior uterovaginal fascia, {{and the deep}} layer retroperitoneal of the uterosacral ligaments. <b>Vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> was performed using posteriorly the deep layer of the uterosacral ligaments; from a lateroposterior aspect, the vaginal vault was suspended to the cardinal ligaments bilaterally, and anteriorly, the vesicouterine fascia provided support for the vaginal apex. A systematic arrangement of surgical steps was evaluated. All predetermined samples of laparoscopic total abdominal hysterectomy with posterior retroperitoneal culdoplasty and <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> were accomplished in a prearranged systematic order. Neither technical failure nor conversion to laparotomy or transvaginal approach was encountered. This technique expedites uterine extirpation and prophylactic pelvic reconstruction with a low complication rate, can be executed with no transvaginal approach, and eliminates the morbidity and mortality associated with laparotomy itself...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether uterus preserving vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy is non-inferior to <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments in the surgical treatment of uterine prolapse. DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled non-blinded non-inferiority trial. SETTING: 4 non-university teaching hospitals, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 208 healthy women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or higher requiring surgery and {{no history of}} pelvic floor surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with sacrospinous hysteropexy or <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments. The predefined non-inferiority margin {{was an increase in}} surgical failure rate of 7 %. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was recurrent prolapse stage 2 or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by the pelvic organ prolapse quantification system in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at 12 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical recurrences, including recurrent anterior compartment (bladder) and/or posterior compartment (bowel) prolapse, functional outcome, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning. RESULTS: Sacrospinous hysteropexy was non-inferior for anatomical recurrence of the apical compartment with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery (n= 0, 0 %) compared with <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments (n= 4, 4. 0 %, difference - 3. 9 %, 95 % confidence interval for difference - 8. 6 % to 0. 7 %).

40|$|Objective—To use a biomechanical {{model to}} explore how {{impairment}} of the pubovisceral portion of the levator ani muscle and/or the apical <b>vaginal</b> <b>suspension</b> might interact to affect anterior vaginal wall prolapse severity. Method—A biomechanical model of the anterior vaginal wall and its support system was developed and implemented. The anterior vaginal wall and main muscular and connective tissue support elements, namely the levator plate, pubovisceral muscle, cardinal and uterosacral ligaments, were included and their geometry based on mid-sagittal plane magnetic resonance scans. Material properties were based on published data. The change in the sagittal profile of the anterior vaginal wall during a maximum Valsalva was then simulated when different combinations of muscle and connective tissue impairment were present. Results—Under raised intra-abdominal pressure, the magnitude of anterior vaginal wall prolapse was {{shown to be a}} combined function of both pubovisceral muscle and uterosacral and/or cardinal ligament (“apical supports”) impairment. Once a certain degree of pubovisceral impairment was reached, the genital hiatus opened and a prolapse developed. The larger the pubovisceral impairment, the larger the anterior wall prolapse became. A 90 % impairment of apical support led to an increase in anterior wall prolapse from 0. 3 cm to 1. 9 cm (a 530 % increase) at 60 % pubovisceral muscle impairment, and from 0. 7 cm to 2. 4 cm (a 240 % increase) at 80 % pubovisceral muscle impairment.

40|$|Introduction: Studies on pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (POP) surgery show {{conflicting evidence}} regarding {{the impact of}} uterus preservation and hysterectomy on sexual function and no large randomized trials with long-term follow-up have been published on this topic. Aims: The aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate and compare sexual function after sacrospinous hysteropexy and <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments in women with uterine prolapse. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of the SAVE U trial data, a multicenter trial in 4 nonuniversity hospitals in the Netherlands comparing sacrospinous hysteropexy and <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments in primary surgery of uterine prolapse stage II or higher. Primary outcome of the original study was recurrent prolapse stage II or higher of the uterus or vaginal vault (apical compartment) evaluated by POP-Q examination in combination with bothersome bulge symptoms or repeat surgery for recurrent apical prolapse at 12 months follow-up. Secondary outcomes were overall anatomical recurrences, functional outcome, complications, hospital stay, postoperative recovery, and sexual functioning. Data from patients who had completed the POP/urinary incontinence sexual questionnaire (PISQ- 12) at baseline and 24 months after surgery {{were used in the}} present trial. Total, subscale, and individual question analyses were performed. The SAVE U trial is registered in the Dutch trial registry, number NTR 1866. Main Outcome Measures: Differences and changes in sexual function 24 months after surgery, measured by the PISQ- 12 questionnaire. Results: Between November 2009 and March 2012, 208 women were randomized between sacrospinous hysteropexy (n = 103) and <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments (n = 105). Of these, 99 women completed questionnaires at baseline and after 24 months follow-up and were included in the present study. During a follow-up period of 24 months, no significant differences in total PISQ- 12 scores were observed between the groups. After both interventions the item "avoidance of intercourse due to prolapse" significantly improved, as did the physical subscale of the PISQ- 12 questionnaire. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in overall sexual functioning (total PISQ- 12 scores) between uterus-preserving sacrospinous hysteropexy and <b>vaginal</b> hysterectomy with <b>suspension</b> of the uterosacral ligaments after a follow-up period of 24 months.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the results of the sacrospinous {{ligament}} fixation for the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse after hysterectomy. Design: Between 1979 and 1996, 63 women underwent a reconstructive operation because of vaginal prolapse after abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. Sacrospinous ligament fixation was performed in all women in combination with operative correction of either cystocele or rectocele, or both. Results: Recurrent vaginal prolapse occurred in only one woman 3 years after the operation. Temporary nerve damage was observed in two patients. Six women reported urine loss because of stress incontinence after sacrospinous ligament fixation. Conclusion: <b>Vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> to the sacrospinous ligament avoids major abdominal surgery and allows the surgeon to correct coexistent cystocele and rectocele. Sacrospinous ligament fixation of the prolapsed vaginal vault should be performed with colposuspension if masked urinary stress incontinence is preoperatively detected...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to estimate the incidence and identify the risk factors for vaginal vault prolapse repair after hysterectomy. We conducted a case control study among 6, 214 women who underwent hysterectomy from 1982 to 2002. Cases (n = 32) were women who required <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> following the hysterectomy through December 2005. Controls (n = 236) were women, randomly selected from the same cohort, who did not require pelvic organ prolapse surgery. The incidence of vaginal vault prolapse repair was 0. 36 per 1, 000 women-years. The cumulative incidence was 0. 5 %. Risk factors included preoperative prolapse (odds ratio (OR) 6. 6; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 5 - 28. 4) and sexual activity (OR 1. 3; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 5). Vaginal hysterectomy was not a risk factor when preoperative prolapse was taken into account (OR 0. 9; 95 % CI 0. 5 - 1. 8). Vaginal vault prolapse repair after hysterectomy is an infrequent event and is due to preexisting weakness of pelvic tissues...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{report a}} case of {{symptomatic}} actinomycosis associated with vaginal suture erosion and granulation tissue refractory to conservative management, in an outpatient setting. Case: Three months after total vaginal hysterectomy and uterosacral ligament <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension,</b> a woman complained of painless, intermittent vaginal discharge and spotting. Despite cauterization of granulation tissue, vaginal spotting persisted for another month. On re-examination, braided polyester suture that was found underlying the granulation tissue was removed. Recurrent symptoms, together with a biopsy revealing actinomycetes, prompted a trial of oral penicillin VK. With persistent symptoms and discomfort during attempts in the outpatient clinic, the woman eventually required suture removal in the operating room. Her symptoms subsequently resolved without recurrence, and no further antibiotic treatment was required. Conclusions: Actinomyces {{may be associated with}} persistent granulation tissue and vault suspension suture material. In rare circumstances, when tissue debridement and suture removal in the clinic is unsatisfactory, surgical intervention in the operating room may be necessary. Ten days of antibiotic therapy alone did not eradicate the granulation tissue, and symptoms resolved only after complete removal of the underlying permanent suture...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} risk factors for the development and progression of the pelvic organ prolapse. However, data regarding whether obesity is a risk factor for recurrence after pelvic organ prolapse surgery are controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of recurrent prolapse in any vaginal compartment after total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent uterosacral ligament <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> among normal-weight women compared with either overweight or obese women. STUDY DESIGN: This is a 5 -year retrospective cohort study of women who underwent total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent <b>vaginal</b> uterosacral ligament <b>suspension</b> at one referral center for pelvic organ prolapse in Italy from January 2010 to January 2015. All women who underwent total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent uterosacral ligament suspension were included in the analysis. Laparoscopic approach was excluded. Women were classified according to the body mass index of 2 groups: (1) normal weight (body mass index, 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m 2) and (2) either overweight (body mass index, 25. 0 - 29. 9 kg/m 2) or obese (body mass index, ≥ 30. 0 kg/m 2). The primary outcome was the incidence of recurrent prolapse in any vaginal compartment (anterior, posterior, or apical). Recurrent prolapse was defined as prolapse extending beyond the hymen with straining (pelvic organ prolapse quantification points Ba, C, Bp ≥ 0) or repeat treatment for prolapse with either pessary or surgery. Uterosacral ligament suspensions were performed with a vaginal approach with the use of sutures placed in the intermediate uterosacral ligament, at or above the ischial spine, and affixed to the vaginal apex. Delayed absorbable sutures were used, with 2 sutures per side. RESULTS: Three hundred sixty women who underwent total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent uterosacral ligament suspension with at least 6 months of follow up after surgery were included in the study.

40|$|Vaginal probiotics have an {{important}} role in preventing the colonization of the vagina by pathogens. This study aimed to investigate different formulations with Pediococcus pentosaceus SB 83 (lyophilized powder and tablets with and without retarding polymer) in order to verify its stability and antilisterial activity after manufacture and during storage. The bacteriocinogenic activity of P. pentosaceus SB 83 against Listeria monocytogenes was evaluated in simulated <b>vaginal</b> fluid. <b>Suspension</b> of Pediococcus pentosaceus SB 83 reduced the pathogen only after 2 [*]h and the lyophilized bacteria after 24 [*]h of contact, and, in the tablets, P. pentosaceus SB 83 lost the antimicrobial activity. The pH of simulated vaginal fluid decreased for all the tested conditions. As lyophilized powder demonstrated better results concerning antimicrobial activity, this formulation was selected to evaluate the antilisterial activity during the 12 months of storage. During storage at room temperature, lyophilized bacteria totally inhibited the pathogen only until one month of storage. At 4 °C, P. pentosaceus SB 83 showed antimicrobial activity during all the time of storage investigated.

MethodsAfter gaining Institutional Review Board approval, the operative records of women receiving TH and AVWS concurrently with a minimum follow-up period of 6 months were reviewed. Two groups were identified: Group 1 (G 1) underwent TH + AVWS and intraoperative apical and/or posterior repairs, and Group 2 (G 2) had TH + AVWS alone. The definition of prolapse recurrence was Pelvic Organ Prolapse—Quantification ≥ Stage 2 and/or any reoperation for prolapse. ResultsFrom 1998 to 2009, a total of 94 women were evaluated. At the mean 3 years follow-up, the rates of overall prolapse recurrence following initial surgeries between G 1 and G 2 were 30 % and 24 %, respectively. Additional operative repair for G 1 and G 2 was 18. 5 % and 16 %, respectively. The progression rate for both groups was < 8 %. The overall success for G 1 and G 2 was 70 % and 76 %, respectively.

30|$|In {{pursuit of}} the success of the midurethral {{polypropylene}} sling, and analogous to the inguinal hernia mesh repairs, urogynaecologists eagerly introduced synthetic meshes during surgical correction of POP. Overall a failure rate for traditional surgery of 30 % is quoted. Most success rates in mesh surgery are estimated to be around 90 %. Very few patients, thus far, have been randomised to compare mesh versus no mesh; however, those few studies confirm the improved outcome with the use of mesh when treating the anterior compartment. There seems to be no statistical or clinically significant improvement when a mesh is used to treat posterior compartment prolapse. Prolapse of the middle compartiment can be treated with equal effectivity via the vaginal route by means of the sacrospinous ligament fixation or abdominally by sacrocolpopexy. The vaginal route however has a poor long term cure rate for the anterior compartiment. Recently, needle suspension techniques have been introduced that fix the mesh, posteriorly, through the levatorplate or through the sacrospinous ligament near the ischial spine, and fix an anterior mesh through the foramen obturatorius, with the top of the anterior mesh also approaching the ischial spine. These meshes truly reconstruct the lateral “level 2 ” suspension, the attachment of the vagina to the arcus tendineus (‘white line’) as described by deLancey. Randomised controlled trials comparing these new <b>vaginal</b> needle <b>suspension</b> techniques and the abdominal sacrocolpopexy are under way. A lot is to be expected from progress that is made in mesh technology. As a higher anatomical and functional success rate is overshadowed by erosion-related morbidity due to the use of foreign material into the vagina, research is focusing on minimizing the foreign body (fibrotic) reaction without compromising the graft’s strength.|$|R
40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} The primary {{objective}} of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the anatomical efficacy {{and the safety of}} two different transvaginal techniques for suspension of the superior vaginal segment in patients with Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) > stage 2 : High Levator Myorraphy (HLM) (1) and Uterosacral <b>Vaginal</b> Vault <b>Suspension</b> (UVVS) (2). The secondary objective is to define the impact of these procedures on anorectal function, sexuality and Quality of Life (QoL) Study design, materials and methods Between September 2005 and December 2006, 116 female patients were enrolled. The pre-operative work-up included: history, POP-Q score, Q-Tip test, conventional urodynamic studies and questionnaires (King’s Health Questionnaire, Wexner score for constipation, and a Sexuality score). The patients were randomized into two groups (computer generated randomization list) : in the first group we used the HLM procedure for vaginal vault suspension; in the second group the UVVS was performed. All the patients underwent correction of cystocele with a Polypropylene mesh applied “tension-free” and vaginal hysterectomy.

In the UVVS procedure, angulation of the left ureter with hydronephrosis was observed in 5 patients (8. 6 %) which was diagnosed in the immediate post-operative period and resolved after removal of the suture. No intra-operative complications occured in the HLM group. Vaginal mesh erosions were present in 12 % of HLM group and 17 % in UVVS group (p 0. 34) Interpretation of results Both procedures provide significant anatomical correction of all vaginal segments. However the correction of the anterior segment was less effective. A possible explanation for this finding could be that the vaginal axis is displaced caudally by vault suspension. An additional aggravating factor could be the tension free application of the mesh anteriorly without anchoring sutures which does not provide adequate contrast to the tension resulting from the central segment suspension. The mean Total Vaginal Length is 7. 2 cm in HLM and 8. 9 cm in UVVS group (p 0. 04), but this does not coincide with an improvement in sexuality, as demonstrated by incidence of post-operative dyspareunia. There is a statistically significative improvement of the voiding symptoms, prolapse-related symptoms, with a good impact on the quality of life. Concluding message This study demonstates that the two <b>vaginal</b> vault <b>suspension</b> techniques are equivalent regarding anatomy, function and QoL. UVVS has a higher incidence of major complications involving the higher urinary tract, which, in our opinion, is an important factor to consider when selecting the appropriate surgical procedure. The recent introduction of trans-perineal techniques for the correction of central vaginal prolapse seems promising, and results of ongoing trials are eagerly awaited. References 1.

30|$|Uterine myomas, ovarian processes, retroperitoneal {{vascular}} abnormalities (vascular entrapment), retroperitoneal fibrosis, and neurogenic {{tumors are}} frequent pelvic conditions that may induce pelvic neuropathies. However, {{the most common}} causes of sacral radiculopathy are surgical damage, deeply infiltrating endometriosis of the pelvic side wall, and nerve compression/entrapment by pelvic varicose veins [7]. Surgical nerve injuries occur due to coagulation, suturing, ischemia or cutting and induce disorders of sensation, pain, and dysfunction starting immediately after the procedure or within a few days. In contrast, nerve lesions caused by fibrotic tissue or vascular compression/entrapment usually require several months or years to develop. When diagnosing surgically induced sacral radiculopathies, correlation of clinical information with the surgical steps of the procedure permits precise anatomical localization of the neural lesion. This is necessary to adapt the treatment strategy accordingly. Perineal procedures may induce pathologies of the pudendal nerve and abdominal/laparoscopic procedures may affect the sacral nerve roots, while vaginal surgeries can induce both [5]. In a series of 92 consecutive patients with pelvic nerve damage secondary to surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (confirmed by laparoscopic exploration), the most frequent types of nerve damage were injuries to the right S 2 nerve root incurred during laparoscopic rectopexy and laparoscopic colpopromontofixation, and injuries to the left S 2 nerve root after <b>vaginal</b> uterosacral ligament <b>suspension</b> (McCall procedure). <b>Vaginal</b> mesh implantation for pelvic organ prolapse exposes patients to a risk of secondary nerve entrapment due to scar tissue development, especially when it involves new devices and techniques for blind needle-driving and minimal dissection. The reason is that, when any bleeding occurs, hematomas cannot drain and tend to dissect in retroperitoneal spaces, even in supralevator compartments, resulting {{in the formation of}} retroperitoneal fibrotic tissue.|$|R

Worse long-term results,comparing to other methods,and new surgical procedures with better cure rate,beats his primacy few year ago. Suspending sutures are important part of every vaginal suspending operation and tension forces applyed to tyed them were mostly described by authors. The aims of this study were measuring the tying forces of suspending sutures,bladder neck replacement and increase in urethral lenght. Measuring are accomplish during two surgical procedures. One of them mobilise bladder neck (Raz) during operation,and another (Stamey) does not. Measuring were done od the end of the operation,in 60 patients, 50 of them were operated by Raz modification and 10 by Stamey modification. Preoperative evaluation were perfomed through SEAPI incontinence classification system. Suspension sutures tying force measuring were made with specialy developed dynamometar constructed from Procron stainless steel. Later we calculated tying forces from dynamometar extesion. Bladder neck replacement and increase in urethral length were calculated from catether marks measuring after suspension sutures were tyed. Average suspending sutures tying forces at Raz operation was 20, 91 N (14, 84 - 29, 06) with average blader neck suspension of 18, 4 mm(14 - 23) and urethral lenghtening of 8, 7 mm(6 - 12). Stamey operation have average tying forces 33, 08 N (27, 81 - 39, 44),bladder neck suspension 8, 3 mm(6 - 12) and urethral lenghthening 3, 2 mm(2 - 4) In early postoperative period,after catheter removal,urinary retention and urgencies are estimated. During follow-up period continence status,bladder empting ability and urgencies are clinicaly evaluated. Follow-up period was 10 years and 5 patients were lost from the study. After 10 years 14 (29, 7 %) patients with Raz operation were completely dry in every occasion and 10 (20, 3 %) patients have mild stress incontinence with severe stress maneuvers,but not with normal activities and no pads required. 19 (40, 6 %) patients were incontinent as before surgery or worse and 4 (8, 5 %) patients were incontinent but better than before surgery. Results with Stamey operations were significantly worse. None of 10 patiens were continent afther 10 years,two were continent afther 5 years but had failed during sixth year. Significant correlation between tying forces,bladder neck suspension and increase in urethral lenght with the result of treatment was not established. Inspite of such results several indicators connecting higher tying forces and treatment failure. Average tying forces was slightly higher in patients with recurrent stress incontinence compared with continent patients and percentage of continent patients was convinsigly higher among group with tying forces below mean value. Positive correlation between tying forces and degree of postoperative urgencies and negative correlation between postoperative urgencies and successful treatment support connection of tretment failure and higher tying forces. Three preoperative aspects have significant correlation with postoperative results. Subjective stress-related leak assessment and protection use have negative correlation with successful tretment,while ALPP confirm positive correlation. Urinary retentions and urgencies in early postoperative period have significant positive connection with tying forces of suspending sutures. The poorer long-term results of needle bladder neck suspensions were consequence of fascial damageing with suspending sutures tension and his loosing with stress incontinence recurrence. Suspending sutures tying forces would not exeed 20 N because higher forces can result with tissue damageing...|$|R
