5|$|Anniversary of the 1967 {{referendum}}, 27 May – The {{anniversary of}} the 1967 referendum to amend the federal constitution has also been suggested.

The public <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> was 90.77%.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas {{was given}} {{charge of the}} Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an {{advisory}} capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the Sacred Band, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there was evidently much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed to swing the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of battle.* Sage, Warfare in Ancient Greece, 138; Seager, The King's Peace, 183 During {{the course of the}} battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.|$|E
25|$|On 29 August 2012, {{the bill}} passed its first reading on a {{conscience}} vote with 80 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour,</b> 40 <b>votes</b> against, and one abstention. The vote was originally recorded as 78 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> and three abstentions, due to the National Party whips forgetting to cast proxy <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> for John Banks and Peter Dunne (both National Party whips voted against the bill and therefore were in the wrong lobby to cast <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour).</b>|$|R
500|$|... 28 June 2017: The {{proposal}} entered {{third and}} final reading in the Chamber of Deputies. After nearly 3 hours of debate, the proposal passed with 139 votes. Only 9 deputies voted against it. The proposal was supported by Social democrats (40 <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour,</b> 3 abstained or didn't log <b>in),</b> ANO (39 <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour,</b> 1 against, 3 abstained or didn't log in), Communist party (24 <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour,</b> 1 against, 7 abstained or didn't log in), Civic Democrats (All 15 present deputies voted for) and the original Dawn of Direct Democracy deputies (9 <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> and 3 abstained or didn't log in).The support was much lower in TOP 09 (9 <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour,</b> 2 against and 11 [...] abstained or didn't log in) and especially KDU-ČSL (3 <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour,</b> 5 against and 4 abstained).|$|R

5|$|The {{power of}} Alfano reached {{as far as}} politics. Together with his {{right-hand}} men, the priest Ciro Vitozzi and his associate Giovanni Rapi, Alfano {{was said to be}} the man behind the election in 1904 of the Count Vincenzo Ravaschieri Foschi to parliament {{to the detriment of the}} incumbent socialist deputy Ettore Ciccotti. The night before the election dissident voters were intimidated, assaulted, beaten, and sustained knife injuries by ruffians hired and encouraged by both the Camorra and the police, since the authorities equally disapproved of a socialist candidate. Alfano, Rapi and Vitozzi were seen and photographed while actively directing the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of Count Ravaschieri in the Camorra controlled district of Vicaria in which Ciccotti surprisingly had won in 1900. Ravaschieri won the 1904 election.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 {{referendum}} {{had seen}} a 55 per cent <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom. However, opinion polls in the weeks following the referendum suggested an increased support for the SNP at Labour's expense, while SNP membership quadrupled. After his election as its leader, Murphy led Labour into the 2015 UK general election, which saw the party's worst-ever election result in Scotland and a landslide victory for the SNP. Labour lost {{all but one of}} its 41 Scottish Westminster seats, including Murphy's own East Renfrewshire constituency, while the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland. Although Murphy subsequently said that he wished to remain as Scottish Labour leader, the poor result prompted senior party figures and trade unionists to question the viability of his future in the post. After narrowly surviving a vote of no confidence on 16 May, Murphy announced his intention to relinquish the role, triggering a fresh leadership contest. Dugdale was elected to succeed Murphy on 15 August.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{campaign}} was criticized as having poor promotional videos, especially lacking in informational value. The {{final days of}} the campaign were marked by events in support of and opposition to joining the EU, as the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs set up an EU information event in Zagreb, while a protest against EU accession at the main city square drew 200 (some arrests occurred). The Croatian Bishops' Conference called on citizens to vote in the referendum, reminding Croatians that Croatia is a part of European culture while refraining from directly advocating either position. The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts also supported joining the EU with 93 academicians in favour, 2 against and 1 abstention; they said that the event represents a great opportunity for Croatia. In contrast to EU accession opponents' request to postpone the referendum until Generals Gotovina and Markač were released by the ICTY, Gotovina himself urged citizens of Croatia to vote in the referendum and said that he would <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of joining the EU.|$|E

The only Member of the Flemish Parliament that voted against was Christian Van Eyken of the Union des Francophones, an electoral list of French-speaking inhabitants of Flanders. 106 of the 124 Members of the Flemish Parliament were present during the vote, {{the members of}} the Vlaams Blok (presently Vlaams Belang) fraction left the plenary session prior to the vote.|$|R
50|$|Cunliffe is {{generally}} liberal {{when it comes}} to conscience issues. He <b>voted</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of the decriminalisation of prostitution, the establishment of civil unions, and the criminalisation of parental corporal punishment.

5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in voting against a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E

25|$|As per the {{principle}} of cabinet solidarity, all cabinet ministers were expected to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of government-introduced legislation. While backbench MPs in 2003, six future cabinet ministers voted in favour of a Canadian Alliance motion defining marriage in exclusively traditional terms. Joe Comuzzi decided to leave cabinet in order to vote against SSM. John Efford, a cabinet minister who recently opposed SSM decided to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>favour</b> of C-38. Former Liberal MP Pat O'Brien said he was personally told by six ministers that they may leave the cabinet rather than support SSM legislation, but this did not happen.
