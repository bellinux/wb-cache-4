The thin-film solar cells were fabricated by removing sapphire using a laser lift-off technique and, then, transferring the remaining p-i-n structure onto a Ti/Ag mirror-coated Si substrate <b>via</b> <b>wafer</b> bonding. The mirror structure is helpful to enhance light absorption for a solar cell with a thin absorption layer. After the thin-film process for a conventional sapphire-based p-i-n solar cell, the device exhibits an enhancement factor of 57. 6 % in current density and an increment in conversion efficiency from 0. 55 % to 0. 80 %. The physical origin for the photocurrent enhancement in the thin-film solar cell is related to multireflection of light by the mirror structure...|$|E

30|$|The {{reduction}} of efficiency {{is a direct}} loss of output power and thus leads to the increase of cost. How to solve this droop issue and improve external quantum efficiency (EQE) become important for both industrial companies and academic labs, and many previous efforts have been demonstrated [6 – 10]. Other than the fundamental droop issue, recently, laser lift-off (LLO) LEDs were demonstrated to eliminate the bad thermal dissipation of sapphire. Some scholars are using very high thermal conductivity material to solve this problem, such as electroplated copper (400  W/k-m) or metal base substrate [11, 12]. Because of difficulties in metal cutting, silicon substrate becomes an alternative to replace sapphire substrate as well [13 – 15]. Great enhancements at high current efficiency and output power <b>via</b> <b>wafer</b> bonding technology and LLO have been shown [16 – 18]. Other non-epitaxial improvements, such as dielectric current blocking layer (CBL) and surface textures, can also provide significant results in the past [19 – 30].|$|E
40|$|Physical size {{limitations}} in miniaturizing two-dimensional (2 D) transistors {{are becoming more}} difficult to overcome.

For this project, we worked to expand the Cell Matrix models and tools from 3 D cubes to a 3 D truncated octahedron geometry. The main goal of our explorative study is to quantify the trade-off between complexity and simplicity of various 3 D geometries that would lead to economical and efficiency improvements in true 3 D integrated circuits.

40|$|Adhesive {{wafer bonding}} {{is a good}} {{substitute}} in wafer-towafer bonding applications requiring low processing temperatures and electrical potentials, though {{at the expense of}} difficulty with chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability over time. In the case of wafer bonding for Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) applications, the problem is compounded not just by consideration of bond strength, but also by limitations in the way adhesives are delivered to the interface, since traditional spin-coating methods cannot be directly employed. A typical approach is the formation of microfluidic channels <b>via</b> <b>wafer</b> bonding, where the adhesive layer should only be present on the mesa structures. The introduction of BCB (benzocyclobutene), dry-etchable polymers, makes it possible to pattern the adhesive layer in a similar fashion {{with the rest of the}} bulk material. In this paper we present a BCB-based wafer bonding process, which is compatible with bulk micro machining. Depending on applications, BCB can replace the silicon oxide or silicon nitride as a hard mask in bulk micro machining. A process using BCB as both bonding adhesive and bulk-etch mask is a good option for stacking microstructures such as building micro-fluidic circuitry...|$|E

40|$|A {{microscale}} beam resonator {{has been}} designed and fabricated {{for use as a}} modular pressure sensor for vacuum applications. The device dimensions have been optimized to provide measurable signals with low noise. Electrostatic actuation and sensing are both performed using only one pair of electrodes. The motion of the cantilever changes the capacitance of the actuation electrodes at a frequency three times that of the actuation signal. This method allows the desired motion to be picked out using a lock-in amplifier with minimal interference from other unwanted signals such as parasitic leakage and noise. Unlike previous work, packaging and electrical contacts have been integrated into the fabrication to create a hermetically sealed device that can easily be incorporated into other MEMS designs. Most resonators operate in vacuum because air damping at higher pressures greatly decreases both resonant frequency and quality factor. This loss {{is directly related to the}} pressure of the surrounding air, and therefore has been used in this design to measure the pressure. While the relationship is not linear, it is one-to-one. This means that once the device has been characterized, pressure can be determined uniquely over a range from atmospheric pressure down to ~ 10 - Torr. The device was fabricated from two SOI wafers using standard wafer processing techniques. This means that unlike previous work, it can be readily integrated into other designs <b>via</b> <b>wafer</b> bonding. A single access port on the base provides a connection between the otherwise hermetically sealed sensor and other devices. To prevent squeeze film damping from limiting the motion of the beam, the cantilever tip has been perforated with an array of holes and a cavity was etched above where the cantilever will oscillate. Electrical contact can easily be made with the device as fabricated, so no additional packaging is necessary. While the fabricated devices are hermetically sealed, resonance was never detected due to a combination of factors including: poor wafer bonding, parasitic leakage, a Schottky barrier at one terminal and a design error that led to an unexpectedly high frequency and quality factor. Modifications to the current design are proposed that should eliminate these problems in the next iteration. by Eric B. Newton. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDA Publishing Association ([URL] audienceA new ISM (image sensor module) WLP (wafer level package) for reflow process is designed, {{fabricated}} and tested. The ISM WLP is composed of polymer bonding layer, glass cap wafer for particle free process and CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) chip wafer which has micro via hole interconnection. During the last decades, WLP is highlighted as the next generation ISM Package method for many advantages like high yield (particle free process), small form factor (3 D interconnection), low assembly cost and so on. Nevertheless these benefits, there are some problems like micro via hole fabrication, low temperature insulation process (inside hole), bottom side oxide etching, warpage control according to wafer level bonding using different material, and whole process temperature limitation for micro lens damage. Among various fabrication methods for ISM package, COB (Chip on board), COF (Chip on film), and L, T contact WLP from ShellCase are generally used. In case of COB and COF package, it has difficulty in particle control during assembly process. In case of ShellCase type WLP has very complicated fabrication process. Additionally, most of above package has disadvantage in size point of view. Through suggested ISM WLP using through interconnection <b>via,</b> <b>wafer</b> level fabrication & packaging technology is realized. It can not only solve problems of conventional packaging structures but also tremendously reduce the manufacturing & assembly cost (include time) of ISM package and realize real chip scale package. Based on sensor size, 3. 67 X 3. 42 X 0. 39 (H) mm 3 WLP is designed. During the parametric study using commercial 3 -D simulation programs, silicon thickness, polymer bonding layer thickness, and glass thickness were chose the effective factor. And considering the optical and electrical analysis, we decide the parameter : silicon thickness is 0. 1 mm, polymer bonding layer thickness is 0. 04 mm, and glass thickness is 0. 25 mm. The fabrication process is composed bonding layer patterning, wafer bonding, thinning, via etching, passivation layer deposition, bottom oxide opening, metal plating, bottom electrode patterning, solder ball formation, and dicing. A new concept of ISM WLP has been founded to be suitable structure for low cost, small form factor application. We took good quality photo image using realized ISM WLP and obtained high electrical characteristics. Resist from GND to GND pad is measured 2. 5 ohms. This package is realized with simple wafer level package technology. The proposed wafer level package can find applications, such as a next image sensor module...|$|E
