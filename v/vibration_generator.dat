The SFD&VG {{can be used as}} an active {{squeeze film damper}} (ASFD) or as a <b>vibration</b> <b>generator</b> (vibrator), for unidimensional vibration damping or generation. The SFD&VG concept is connected with current research to improve a common industrial process—drilling of deep holes.

The analysis is initiated for an elementary configuration of the SFD&VG—the infinite width Rayleigh step case—and then it is developed for an advanced elliptical SFD&VG. The Reynolds equation is solved for both pure squeeze film effect which provides vibration damping, and pure hydrodynamic wedge effect which provides vibration generation.

40|$|This study proposes an {{optimized}} {{frequency adjustment}} method {{that uses a}} micro-cantilever beam-based piezoelectric <b>vibration</b> <b>generator</b> based {{on a combination of}} added mass and capacitance. The most important concept of the proposed method is that the frequency adjustment process is divided into two steps: the first is a rough adjustment step that changes the size of the mass added at the end of cantilever to adjust the frequency in a large-scale and discontinuous manner; the second step is a continuous but short-range frequency adjustment via the adjustable added capacitance. Experimental results show that when the initial natural frequency of a micro piezoelectric <b>vibration</b> <b>generator</b> is 69. 8 Hz, then this natural frequency can be adjusted to any value in the range from 54. 2 Hz to 42. 1 Hz using the combination of the added mass and the capacitance.

40|$|The {{main reason}} for {{accidents}} involving trucks or truck combinations {{is the lack of}} situation awareness. Drivers of particularly articulated truck combinations need a high level of awareness {{about the state of the}} vehicle combination and its surroundings. The current steering interface sets limits on the signals that the driver can perceive and the way the driver can act. I see an opportunity to break these limits on the interaction by introducing a new steering interface. The new interface is intuitive and designed specially for articulated truck combinations. The interface consists of two physical walls on the left and right side of the driver, an active touch panel in front of the driver, and air <b>vibration</b> <b>generators</b> on the left and right side. The driver controls the lateral position of the truck by controlling the position of the walls. The idea is that the driver can easily associate the lateral position of the truck between the lane boundaries with the position of his or her own body between the walls. Further, the driver perceives a map of the surroundings by feeling and following surfaces on the active touch panel. Moving surfaces on the active touch panel represent the truck, trailers, road boundaries, and other traffic users. Important information about upcoming traffic is given through air vibrations that are sent by the air <b>vibration</b> <b>generators</b> towards the driver’s hand. The new interface is designed for highly automated driving, where automation allows the truck to follow a lane at a certain speed. The driver still actively participates in the control of the vehicle, and is always in direct control of the walls. Physical prototypes of the walls and the touch panel have also helped to imagine what the new driving experience would be like. In particular, simple tests have been performed with the prototype of the walls in a real truck on a test track. BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

This phenomenon is attributed to the participation of all mode shapes and is a consequence of excitation by a concentrated force near the top of a building and at a frequency differing by only a few per cent from a natural frequency of vibrations.
