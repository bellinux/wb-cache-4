Commercial hunting is a major element of tourism in the region but illegal hunting presents the main threat to wildlife. Protected areas within the region include Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana, Khaudom National Park in Namibia, and Nxai Pan National Park, but there is little protection in the hardveld area to the south of the ecoregion.The diamond mine at Orapa is in the centre of the region but does not present a threat to wildlife.|$|E
50|$|The {{mortality}} {{of the disease}} in 1909, as recorded in the British Army and Navy stationed in Malta, was 2%. The most frequent {{cause of death was}} endocarditis. Recent advances in antibiotics and surgery have been successful in preventing death due to endocarditis. Prevention of human brucellosis can be achieved by eradication of the disease in animals by vaccination and other <b>veterinary</b> <b>control</b> methods such as testing herds/flocks and slaughtering animals when infection is present. Currently, no effective vaccine is available for humans. Boiling milk before consumption, or before using it to produce other dairy products, is protective against transmission via ingestion. Changing traditional food habits of eating raw meat, liver, or bone marrow is necessary, but difficult to implement. Patients who have had brucellosis should probably be excluded indefinitely from donating blood or organs. Exposure of diagnostic laboratory personnel to Brucella organisms remains a problem in both endemic settings and when brucellosis is unknowingly imported by a patient. After appropriate risk assessment, staff with significant exposure should be offered postexposure prophylaxis and followed up serologically for six months. Recently published experience confirms that prolonged and frequent serological follow-up consumes significant resources without yielding much information, and is burdensome for the affected staff, who often fail to comply. The side effects of the usual recommended regimen of rifampicin and doxycycline for three weeks also reduce treatment adherence. As no evidence shows treatment with two drugs is superior to monotherapy, British guidelines now recommend doxycycline alone for three weeks and a less onerous follow-up protocol.|$|E

40|$|A liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass {{spectrometry}} (LC/TOFMS) method was developed using the latest high-resolution LC column technology, the ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC (TM)), and electrospray ionization (ESI) in the positive ion mode. Gradient UPLC separation conditions were optimized {{for a group}} of 22 analytes comprising 17 glucocorticosteroids, specific designer steroids such as tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) and specific beta(2) -agonists such as formoterol. The UPLC/TOFMS separation obtained required 5. 5 min only for all the substances tested. Even the critical pair of dexamethasone and betamethasone isomers was almost completely resolved. Thanks to the over 10, 000 full-width at half maximum (FWHM) mass resolution and high mass accuracy features of TOFMS 50 mDa window accurate mass chromatograms could be reconstructed for the individual analytes. Sensitive screening in human and calf urine samples fortified at the glucocorticosteroids minimum required performance limit (MRPL) of 30 mu g L- 1 (human urine, sports doping) and 2 mu g L- 1 (calf urine, <b>veterinary</b> <b>control)</b> could be obtained. The potential of UPLC/TOFMS for confirmatory analysis was shown by determining the accurate mass of all compounds and fragment ions upon in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) at different energies. The exact mass measurement errors for all glucocorticosteroids were found to be within 6 ppm. Considering <b>veterinary</b> <b>control,</b> limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) were determined for most of the analytes in calf urine and found to range from 0. 1 to 3. 3 and from 0. 4 to 4. 4 mu g L- 1, respectively. The method can be easily extended with other banned substances of interest, as demonstrated by the addition of 21 beta(2) -agonists to the original analyte mixture in urine, without causing any interferences.

40|$|New {{anabolic}} steroids show up occasionally in sports doping and in <b>veterinary</b> <b>control.</b> The discovery of these designer steroids is facilitated by findings of illicit preparations, thus allowing bioactivity testing, structure elucidation using NMR and mass spectrometry, and final incorporation in urine testing. However, {{as long as}} these preparations remain undiscovered, new designer steroids are not screened for in routine sports doping or <b>veterinary</b> <b>control</b> urine tests since the established GC/MS and LC/MS/MS methods are {{set up for the}} monitoring of a few selected ions or MS/MS transitions of known substances only. In this study, the feasibility of androgen bioactivity testing and mass spectrometric identification is being investigated for trace analysis of designer steroids in urine. Following enzymatic deconjugation and a generic solid-phase extraction, the samples are analyzed by gradient LC with effluent splitting toward two identical 96 -well fraction collectors. One well plate is used for androgen bioactivity detection using a novel robust yeast reporter gene bioassay yielding a biogram featuring a 20 -s time resolution. The bioactive wells direct the identification efforts to the corresponding well numbers in the duplicate plate. These are subjected to high-resolution LC using a short column packed with 1. 7 -m C 18 material and coupled with electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/QTOFMS) with accurate mass measurement. Element compositions are calculated and used to interrogate electronic substance databases. The feasibility of this approach for doping control is demonstrated via the screening of human urine samples spiked with the designer anabolic steroid tetrahydrogestrinone. Application of the proposed methodology, complementary to the established targeted urine screening for known anabolics, will increase the chance of finding unknown emerging designer steroids, rather then being solely dependent on findings of the illicit preparations themselves...|$|E
