25|$|A {{varistor}} is {{an electronic}} component with an electrical resistance that {{varies with the}} applied voltage. Also known as a <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> (VDR), it has a nonlinear, non-ohmic current–voltage characteristic {{that is similar to}} that of a diode. In contrast to a diode however, it has the same characteristic for both directions of traversing current. At low voltage it has a high electrical resistance which decreases as the voltage is raised.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2000 In {{this thesis}} {{steady-state}} (i. e. steady-state {{with respect to}} the applied voltage waveform) transient current-transient voltage [i(t) -v(t) ], transient brightness-transient current [b(t) -i(t) ], transient brightness-transient voltage [b(t) -v(t) ], transient current [i(t) ], transient brightness [b(t) ], and detrapped charge analysis are introduced as novel organic light emitting device (OLED) characterization methods. These analysis methods involve measurement of the instantaneous voltage [v(t) ] across, the instantaneous current [i(t) ] through, and the instantaneous brightness [b(t) ] from an OLED when it is subjected to a bipolar, piecewise-linear applied voltage waveform. The utility of these characterization methods is demonstrated via comparison of different types of OLEDs and polymer light emitting devices (PLEDs) and from a preliminary study of OLED aging. Some of the device parameters obtained from these characterization methods include: OLED capacitance, accumulated charge, electron transport layer (ETL) thickness, hole transport layer (HTL) thickness, OLED thickness, parallel resistance, and series resistance. A current bump observed in i(t) -v(t) curves is attributed to the removal of accumulated hole charge from the ETL/HTL interface and is only observed in heterojunctions (i. e. OLEDs), not in single-layer devices (i. e. PLEDs). Using the characterization methods developed in this thesis, two important OLED device physics conclusions are obtained: (1) Hole accumulation at the ETL/HTL interface {{plays an important role in}} establishing balanced charge injection of electrons and holes into the OLED. (2) The ETL behaves as a leaky insulator while the HTL more efficiently conducts charge and acts as a <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>resistor.</b> A preliminary investigation of the aging properties of OLEDs is presented as further evidence of the utility of the novel characterization methods developed in this thesis. In general, aging is characterized by a softer turn on of the forward bias portions of i(t) -v(t) and b(t) -v(t) curves. Also, some aging recovery is possible if the OLEDs are subjected to a zero or reverse bias...|$|E
40|$|Spin based {{magnetic}} tunnel junctions (MTJs) {{consist of}} two ferromagnetic thin films {{separated by a}} nonmagnetic insulating barrier. The MTJ exhibits two switchable resistive states, making them ideal candidates for non-volatile memory. The discovery of high Tunneling Magnetoresistance (TMR) in MgO based MTJs has brought spintronics into the forefronts of modern technology. A device structure CoFeB|MgO|CoFeB achieved by physical vapor deposition (PVD) has revolutionized the hard-drive industry to go beyond densities of gigabyte per square inch. There is increasing interest {{in the application of}} these devices toward other technical areas, such as sensors, logic and reconfigurable computing. In these structures, the thicknesses of the layers are in the order of a few nanometers. For integration of these devices in other platforms, particularly on silicon, to augment the well-developed CMOS technology, it is imperative to (1) investigate processing constraints, (2) develop appropriate physical models, and (3) build circuit models for effective circuit implementation. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on these three important aspects for the realization of CoFeB|MgO|CoFeB MTJs on silicon. A systematic annealing study has been carried out to investigate the role of boron in the device structure. It has been shown using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and 2 D x-ray diffraction (2 D XRD) that boron diffuses into MgO with an activation energy of 1. 30. 4 eV and facilitates the crystallization of CoFe with (200) out-of-plane oriented crystals, with MgO as a template. The grain size of CoFe has been definitively shown to be smaller than the grain size of MgO, which were otherwise believed to be the same. A process temperature of 385 °C has been determined to be the optimum limit of processing. A low temperature (3 ̆c 385 °C) process employing standard integrated circuit fabrication techniques has been developed. The partial crystallization of CoFe necessitates the modification of the tunneling model. A new model that combines the Julliëre 2 ̆ 7 s, free electron and tight-binding model with the probabilistic distribution of grains {{on either side of the}} tunneling barrier has been proposed. This model explains the variation of TMR as a function of temperature in devices made by PVD. A generalized circuit macromodel has been developed representing field-switchable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) characterized by two distinct voltage-dependent resistance values in parallel and antiparallel states. General-purpose subcircuit implementations are designed for a switchable <b>voltage-dependent</b> <b>resistor</b> capable of implementation using any version of SPICE. Transient simulation of a flash-comparator circuit using multiple MTJs in series is successfully demonstrated showing the robustness of the model...|$|E

Alternatively, a conventional junction field effect transistor (JFET) model can be used to represent voltage dependence of the diffused resistor...|$|R
