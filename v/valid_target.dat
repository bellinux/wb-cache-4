2500|$|Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra {{have been}} trying to take {{advantage}} of ISIL's rise, by attempting to present themselves as [...] "moderate" [...] compared to [...] "extremist" [...] ISIL, although it has the same aim of establishing sharia and a caliphate but doing so in a more gradual manner. Al-Nusra has criticised the way in which ISIL fully and immediately institutes sharia in the areas that fall under its control, since it alienates people too much. [...] It supports the gradual, slower approach favoured by al-Qaeda, preparing society to accept sharia and indoctrinating people through education before implementing the hudud aspects of sharia, such as throwing gays from the top of buildings, chopping limbs off, and public stoning. Al-Nusra and ISIL are both hostile towards the Druze. [...] However, while al-Nusra has typically destroyed Druze shrines and pressured them to convert to Sunni Islam, ISIL regards the entire Druze community as a <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> for violence, as it does the Yazidis.|$|E

40|$|The New York Consortium on Membrane Protein Structure (NYCOMPS), {{a part of}} the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) in the USA, has as {{its mission}} to {{establish}} a high-throughput pipeline for determination of novel integral membrane protein structures. Here we describe our current target selection protocol, which applies structural genomics approaches informed by the collective experience of our team of investigators. We first extract all annotated proteins from our reagent genomes, i. e. the 96 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes from which we clone DNA. We filter this initial pool of sequences and obtain a list of <b>valid</b> <b>targets.</b> NYCOMPS defines <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> as those that, among other features, have at least two predicted transmembrane helices, no predicted long disordered regions and, except for community nominated targets, no significant sequence similarity in the predicted transmembrane region to any known protein structure. Proteins that feed our experimental pipeline are selected by defining a protein seed and searching the set of all <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> for proteins that are likely to have a transmembrane region structurally {{similar to that of the}} seed. We require sequence similarity aligning at least half of the predicted transmembrane region of seed and target. Seeds are selected according to their feasibility and/or biological interest, and they include both centrally selected targets and community nominated targets. As of December 2008, over 6, 000 targets have been selected and are currently being processed by the experimental pipeline. We discuss how our target list may impact structural coverage of the membrane protein space...|$|R

The circuit is a [...] "normally closed" [...] one, meaning that at rest {{there is always a}} complete power circuit; depressing the tip breaks this circuit, and the scoring apparatus illuminates an appropriate light. Color-coding is used: white or yellow indicates hits not on the <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> area, and either red or green indicate hits on the <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> area (red for one fencer, green for the other).|$|E

5000|$|Raytheon called SilentEyes a [...] "parasite" [...] UAV, as {{it would}} be {{dispensed}} from a larger UAV such as a Predator; a gliding submunitions dispenser; or a cruise missile. The baseline version of the SilentEyes would be strictly a glider, but its glide ratio of 11:1 would allow it to stay in the air for a half-hour if released from typical Predator operational altitudes. It would be used for close-up examination of targets spotted by SAR to ensure that they are <b>valid</b> <b>targets,</b> or for post-strike target damage assessment.|$|R

50|$|Like {{other weapons}} used in fencing, the modern sabre uses an {{electrical}} connection to register touches. The sabreuse wears a lamé, a conductive vest, {{to complete the}} circuit and register a touch to a <b>valid</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1956 Olympics, scoring in foil has been {{accomplished}} by means of registering the touch with an electric circuit. A switch {{at the tip of}} the foil registers the touch, and a metallic foil vest, or lamé, verifies that the touch is on <b>valid</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E
40|$|Voluntary {{orienting}} {{of visual}} attention is conventionally measured in tasks with predictive central cues followed by frequent <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> at the cued location and by infrequent invalid targets at the uncued location. This implies that invalid targets entail both spatial reorienting {{of attention and}} breaching of the expected spatial congruency between cues and targets. Here, we used event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to separate the neural correlates of the spatial and expectancy components of both endogenous orienting and stimulus-driven reorienting of attention. We found that during endogenous orienting with predictive cues, there was a significant deactivation of the right Temporal-Parietal Junction (TPJ). We also discovered that the lack of an equivalent deactivation with nonpredictive cues was matched to drop in attentional costs and preservation of attentional benefits. The right TPJ showed equivalent responses to invalid targets following predictive and nonpredictive cues. On the contrary, infrequent-unexpected invalid targets following predictive cues specifically activated the right Middle and Inferior Frontal Gyrus (MFG-IFG). Additional comparisons with spatially neutral trials demonstrated that, independently of cue predictiveness, <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> activate the left TPJ, whereas invalid targets activate both the left and right TPJs. These findings show that the selective right TPJ activation that is found in the comparison between invalid and valid trials results from the reciprocal cancelling of the different activations that in the left TPJ are related to the processing of <b>valid</b> and invalid <b>targets.</b> We propose that left and right TPJs provide "matching and mismatching to attentional template" signals. These signals enable reorienting of attention and {{play a crucial role in}} the updating of the statistical contingency between cues and targets...|$|R
50|$|Human Rights Watch {{stated that}} police are presumptively civilians but are {{considered}} <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> if formally {{incorporated into the}} armed forces of a party to a conflict or directly participate in the hostilities. The IDF stated that it regards police under the control of Hamas in Gaza to be inherently equivalent to armed fighters, including them in the militant's count. The PCHR representative argued however that Israel wrongly classified 255 police officers killed {{at the outset of the}} war as militants, explaining that International Law regards policemen who are not engaged in fighting as non-combatants or civilians.|$|R
5000|$|In 16th century England, hits {{below the}} girdle were {{considered}} unfair. [...] In the 18th century, {{all parts of}} the person became <b>valid</b> <b>targets.</b> By the turn of the 19th century, the target area had been restricted to the upper body (with the exception {{of the back of the}} head) and the upper part of the forward leg. These rules are in use today by the Association for Historical Fencing. Historically, the target area has varied, with bouts sometimes only being decided by the drawing of blood from the head of one of the contestants, in the manner of the Mensur.|$|R
50|$|The main {{component}} of the dō is the gently curving stomach and chest protector. The modern form has a pronounced bulge to help direct the force of strikes away from the soft areas {{in the middle of}} the torso. Lacquered bamboo is traditionally used although lacquered paper 'fibre' (frequently misidentified as fiberglass) or moulded plastic are used for less expensive dō. The dō is supported from the shoulders by two diagonal ties and is restrained at the small of the back with another set of ties. The target areas of the dō are the two lower sides for a slashing cut to the stomach. The top half of the dō is a <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> for a thrust in naginata. In the past, this was also a <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> for a thrust in Kendo.|$|E
50|$|In foil the <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> area {{includes}} the torso (including {{the lower part}} of the bib of the mask) and the groin. The head (except {{the lower part of}} the bib of the mask), arms, and legs are considered off target. Touches made off target do not count for points, but do stop play.|$|E
50|$|In sabre forward cross-steps were {{prohibited}} in the 1990s, one {{of numerous}} {{efforts to increase}} the sport's popular appeal. This also removed distortions caused {{by the introduction of}} electronic scoring where sabre bouts degenerated to both parties charging to get the hit in first before passing their opponent and therefore ceasing to be a <b>valid</b> <b>target.</b>|$|E

50|$|While {{the other}} options are valid methods, they all tap into {{different}} aspects of attention bias. Because of this, some methods are less used when looking into specific aspects of attentional bias. For example, in a posner cueing task, the cues were either a neutral, angry or happy, facial expression. There were both <b>valid</b> (<b>targets</b> appearing in the same location as the cue/face) and invalid trials (The target appearing in a different location to the cue/face). Surprisingly enough, in the invalid tests, individuals' response times increased {{to the same degree}} of attentional bias for both negative stimuli and positive stimuli, contrary to hundreds of other studies.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{attention}} {{is one of}} the infant's primary tools for gathering relevant information from the environment for further processing and learning. The space-based component of visual attention in infants has been widely investigated; however, the object-based component of visual attention has received scarce interest. This scarcity is surprising, given the importance of objects in driving infants' attention and predispositions to attend to object information. Here, we investigated the object-based component of attention in 8 -month-old infants. An eye tracker measured the saccade latencies to find a target that could appear in a previously cued end of 2 bars (<b>valid</b> <b>targets),</b> in {{the other end of the}} cued bar (invalid same-object targets), or in the other bar but at the same distance from the cue (invalid different-object targets). Bars were unoccluded or partly occluded; if {{attention is}} object based, it should also operate on objects that require perceptual completion. After verifying in a sample of adults (Experiment 1) that a measure of saccade latency suitably assessed space-based and object-based attention, we tested 8 -month-old infants (Experiment 2) using the same procedure. The results showed that in both adults and infants, target detection was faster for <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> than for invalid ones (space-based effect). Moreover, for both the unoccluded and partly occluded conditions, detection was faster on invalid within-object trials than on invalid between-objects trials (object-based effect). These findings demonstrate that visual objects can operate as units of attention for infants by the age of 8 months, offering implications for cognitive development...|$|R
5000|$|The épée is a {{thrusting}} weapon {{like the}} foil, but heavier, {{with a maximum}} total weight of 775 grams. In épée, the entire body is <b>valid</b> <b>target.</b> The hand guard on the épée is a large circle that extends towards the pommel, effectively covering the hand, which is a <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> in épée. Like foil, all hits must be with the tip and not {{the sides of the}} blade. Hits with the side of the blade do not register on the electronic scoring apparatus (and do not halt the action). As the entire body is legal target, there is no concept of an off-target touch, except if the fencer accidentally strikes the floor, setting off the light and tone on the scoring apparatus. Unlike foil and sabre, épée does not use [...] "right of way", and awards simultaneous touches to both fencers. However, if the score is tied in a match at the last point and a double touch is scored, the point is null and void.|$|E
50|$|As a {{thrusting}} weapon the épée {{is similar}} to a foil (compared to a sabre), but has a stiffer blade which is triangular in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller, has a larger bell guard, and is heavier. The technique however, is somewhat different, as there are no rules regarding priority and right of way. In addition, the entire body is a <b>valid</b> <b>target</b> area.|$|E
5000|$|He and Golubitsky (as Sergei stated on his [...] "Golden Bouts" [...] tape, [...] "and now the {{nightmare}} begins....the comeback of Kim") traded touches until Kim finally lost 15-14. At la belle (tied {{for the last}} touch, 14-14), Kim almost pulled the win out, but his attack failed to register (although he had struck <b>valid</b> <b>target)</b> and Golubitsky dodged a bullet, allowing him the {{chance to win the}} bout.|$|E
50|$|Human Rights Watch {{stated that}} police are presumptively civilians {{but on a}} {{specific}} case by case basis can be considered <b>valid</b> <b>targets</b> if formally incorporated into {{the armed forces of}} a party to a conflict or directly participate in the hostilities. They stressed that blanket decisions must not be made about police being legitimate targets and that a decision that police and police stations are legitimate military targets depends on whether those police play a role in fighting against Israel, or whether a particular police station is used to store weapons or for some other military purpose. B'Tselem also states that police officers are presumed to be civilians and likely not legitimate objects of attack under international humanitarian law.|$|R
