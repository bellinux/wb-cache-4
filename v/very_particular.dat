5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is <b>very</b> <b>particular.</b> I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} {{introduces}} the six main characters: Shelly, J.T., Rita, Janie, Nick, and Donovan. Shelly runs the fashion boutique DivaStyle {{with her friends}} Janie and Rita. She pursues a relationship with J.T., only to discover he is afraid of commitment and exhibits some chauvinistic behavior. Their relationship is often tested by frequent misunderstandings. Nick wants to find his ideal partner, but his attempts are typically thwarted as he is <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> about women. Even though his relationship with a woman named Dani appears to be successful, they soon break up. Donovan finds himself romantically attracted to Rita, but he resists the temptation {{out of fear of}} ruining their friendship.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} control {{strategies have}} been devised in the past years. These vary from extremely general ones (PID controller), to others devoted to <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> classes of systems (especially robotics or aircraft cruise control).|$|E

25|$|Each {{designer}} selected {{an oversized}} Swarovski chandelier and {{was asked to}} create a room around its unique and <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> style. Simon Doonan, Creative Director of Barneys and Jonathan Adler's life partner, served as a guest judge.|$|E
25|$|Tenerife is {{characterized}} by an architecture whose best representatives are the local manor houses and also the most humble and common dwellings. This style, while influenced by those of Andalusia and Portugal, nevertheless had a <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> and native character.|$|E
25|$|Heifetz was <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> {{about his}} choice of strings. He used a silver wound Tricolore gut G string, plain gut {{unvarnished}} D and A strings, and a Goldbrokat steel E string medium including clear Hill brand rosin sparingly. Heifetz believed that playing on gut strings was important in rendering an individual sound.|$|E

25|$|Zeshin remains, in fact, {{the only}} artist to be {{successful}} in the medium of urushi-e, as it requires specially treated paper, and a <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> consistency of lacquer to be used as paint. Zeshin also revived a complex lacquer technique called seikai-ha to produce wave forms; this technique is so difficult it had not been used for over a century.|$|E
25|$|The DNA {{methylation}} {{landscape of}} vertebrates is <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> {{compared to other}} organisms. In vertebrates, around 60–80% of CpG are methylated in somatic cells and DNA methylation appears as a default state {{that has to be}} specifically excluded from defined locations. By contrast, the genome of most plants, invertebrates, fungi or protists show “mosaic” methylation patterns, where only specific genomic elements are targeted, and they are characterized by the alternation of methylated and unmethylated domains.|$|E
25|$|Only when <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> {{conditions}} obtain can legitimate inferences {{be drawn}} from silence in contemporary sources. The doubtful relevance of silence as to the Gudalupe event in certain documents {{from the time of}} Zumárraga has already been noted under section 6.2.2 above, and Miguel Sánchez himself preached a sermon in 1653 on the Immaculate Conception in which he cites chapter 12 of the Book of Revelation but makes no mention of Guadalupe.|$|E
40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, no one denied {{the value of}} {{education}} as a means: “to develop the mind, to give discipline and to impart the power to think," but for many years the education given to girls was somewhat lacking in these <b>very</b> <b>particulars.</b> It was then considered the duty of every young girl to marry. A working-class girl through economic necessity had her living to earn, and therefore, followed a trade, or entered a factory until she married. A middle-class girl had, however, no “work" as such to do, and spent her early years learning {{to appear in the}} drawing room as an accomplished and well-bred lady. Mrs. De Wahl in her book “Hints on Training of Girls at School” published in England in 1847, lists the main subjects learnt by girls...|$|R

40|$|Some votives altars -small {{portable}} religious altars- {{from the}} North Plateau of the Iberian Peninsula show <b>very</b> <b>particulars</b> elements, {{not only in}} their typology, {{as well in the}} dimensions, the decoratives elements and others aspects. The arae are dedicated to the offers to the divinities in a holy land. They should be considered Iike a manifestation to join, mystically, the divinity with the offerer, to tighten knot of friendship with a god. Determinadas aras votivas -pequeños altares religiosos portátiles- del área de la Meseta Septentrional presentan elementos muy particulares, no sólo en la tipología, sino también en las dimensiones, los elementos decorativos y otros aspectos. Las aras están dedicadas a las ofrendas a las divinidades dentro de un área sagrada. Pueden ser consideradas como una manifestación de unirse místicamente a la divinidad, de estrechar los lazos de amistad con un dios...|$|R
25|$|What tribunals {{all have}} in common is that they are created by statute, their adjudicators are usually {{appointed}} by government, and they focus on <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> and specialized areas of law. Because some subject matters (e.g., immigration) fall within federal jurisdiction while others (e.g., liquor licensing and workers' compensation) in provincial jurisdiction, some tribunals are created by federal law while others are created by provincial law. There are both federal and provincial tribunals for some subject matters such as unionized labour and human rights.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} {{given by}} a correlation coefficient {{is not enough to}} define the dependence structure between random variables. The correlation coefficient completely defines the dependence structure only in <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> cases, for example when the distribution is a multivariate normal distribution. (See diagram above.) In the case of elliptical distributions it characterizes the (hyper-)ellipses of equal density; however, it does not completely characterize the dependence structure (for example, a multivariate t-distribution's degrees of freedom determine the level of tail dependence).|$|E
25|$|The Ganjo Takker ridge {{lay on a}} low {{limestone}} {{range and}} {{was used as a}} place of worship by the most adherent religious priests that blessed the city believing their meditation may result in excellent trade networks the city was developing at the time. But these <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> popularity traits in the areas of trade led the city vulnerable to outside sieges. Equipped mostly with farming equipment, the locals were attacked by the conquest of Islamic armies circa 711 CE and surrendered. Neroon was dethroned.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{illustrate}} that Sb occupies two different sites on Ge(113), one adsorption site saturating three dangling bonds per primitive unit cell and an interstitial site which releases the strain in the [332 ̄] direction. The bonding of Sb to Ge {{was found to be}} stronger than on Ge(100) and (111) surfaces and corresponding Si surfaces. The c(2 x 2) structure was <b>very</b> stable.

25|$|The {{work on the}} Sala degli Otto di Pratica, in the Palazzo Vecchio, {{started on}} February 20, 1486. It {{is now in the}} Uffizi Gallery. In the same years Piero di Francesco del Pugliese asked him to paint the altarpiece with the Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard, now in the Badia Fiorentina, Florence. This is Lippi's most popular picture: a {{composition}} of unreal items, with its <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> elongated figures, backed by a phantasmagorical scenario of rocks and almost anthropomorphic trunks. The work is dated to 1480–86.|$|E
25|$|Although it was {{originally}} developed in this <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> and physically unrealistic context in string theory, the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa {{has led to a}} qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, in 1998, Strominger argued that the original result could be generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry. In collaboration with several other authors in 2010, he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to non-extremal astrophysical black holes.|$|E
25|$|The Birmingham Back to Backs (also {{known as}} Court 15) are the city's last {{surviving}} court of back-to-back houses. They are preserved {{as examples of}} the thousands of similar houses that were built around shared courtyards, for the rapidly increasing population of Britain's expanding industrial towns. They are a <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> sort of British terraced housing. This sort of housing was deemed unsatisfactory, and the passage of the Public Health Act 1875 meant that no more were built; instead byelaw terraced houses took their place. This court, at 50–54 Inge Street and 55–63 Hurst Street, is now operated as a museum by the National Trust.|$|E

50|$|The {{mortality}} rate of British soldiers in Jamaica was <b>very</b> high, <b>particular</b> {{as a result}} of yellow fever. A 156 acre estate known as Up Park Pen was purchased by the War Department in 1784, to set up barracks. However, the {{mortality rate}} fell only when many were posted away to a new camp at Newcastle, Jamaica, high in the Blue Mountains (Jamaica).|$|R

25|$|During the opposition, oral {{proceedings}} may {{take place at}} the request of the EPO or at the request of any party to the proceedings, i.e. the patentee or an opponent. The {{oral proceedings}} are held before the Opposition Division itself. They are held in Munich, the Hague or Berlin, and are public unless <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> circumstances apply. This contrasts with oral proceedings held before an Examining Division, which are not public. The list of public oral proceedings in opposition before the EPO is available on its web site. The right to oral proceedings is a specific and codified part of the procedural right to be heard. A decision is often taken at the end of the oral proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} 2011 greatly {{affected}} {{the writing process}} for the song, including the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in March, the death of electronic musician Rei Harakami in July and turmoil in Yamaguchi's personal life. Yamaguchi wanted both the song and Documentaly {{to act as a}} record {{of what it was like}} to live in the post-earthquake period of 2011 in Japan, so expressed all of these events while writing the song. While questioning what were distinct things about living in 2011, Yamaguchi was inspired to write lyrics about online opinions. He noted that in YouTube-style commentary, people posted their opinions primarily as reactions to other peoples' opinions, while the majority of people had a third-person view of the entire process. He felt that this series of comments upon comments was a <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> aspect of living in 2011.|$|E
25|$|When {{consciousness}} {{reaches the}} fourth plane, it {{finds itself in}} a <b>very</b> <b>particular</b> state. It is fully conscious of the infinite potential of energy and can make full use of it and it also becomes aware of the mental world. This new contact creates very strong desires {{to make use of}} this huge potential. At this point consciousness finds itself in the biggest danger of its long development. Not being able to control its feelings or thoughts, the soul is strongly tempted to handle infinite energy. If the infinite potential of this plane is misused, consciousness gets completely disintegrated and the soul finds itself back to the stone-form consciousness and has to start again the long course of evolution from there. If it abstains from using this energy it enters the lower mental plane and if it makes a completely selfless use of it, {{for the benefit of the}} spiritual development of others in illusion, it even moves directly to the higher mental plane.|$|E
