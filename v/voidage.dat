40|$|Interphase {{momentum}} transport in heterogeneous gas-solid {{systems with}} multi-scale structure {{is of great}} importance in process engineering. In this article, lattice Boltzmann simulations are performed on graphics processing units (GPUs), the computational power of which exceeds that of CPUs {{by more than one}} order of magnitude, to investigate incompressible Newtonian flow in idealized multi-scale particle-fluid systems. The structure consists of a periodic array of clusters, each constructed by a bundle of cylinders. Fixed pressure boundary condition is implemented by applying a constant body force to the flow through the medium. The bounce-back scheme is adopted on the fluid-solid interfaces, which ensures the no-slip boundary condition. The structure is studied under a wide range of particle diameters and packing fractions, and the drag coefficient of the structure is found to be a function of <b>voidages</b> and fractions of the clusters, besides the traditional Reynolds number and the solid volume fractions. Parameters reflecting multi-scale characters are, therefore, demonstrated to be necessary in quantifying the drag force of heterogeneous gas-solid system. The numerical results in the range 0. 1 <= Re <= 10 and 0 < phi < 0. 25 are compared with Wen and Yu's correlation, Gibilaro equation, EMMS-based drag model, the Beetstra correlation and the Benyahia correlation, and good agreement is found between the simulations and the EMMS-based drag model for heterogeneous systems.

40|$|The {{handling}} {{and disposal of}} industrial waste slurries containing colloidal particulate matter, with particular reference to coal and mineral processing plant tailings with {{a high proportion of}} clay materials present significant challenge. To develop effective disposal methods requires an improved understanding of floc structure that promote better water recovery and higher sediment density during settling and consolidation of flocculated tailings. In this paper, the effect of floc structure on coal tailings dewatering and the impact of shear-induced modification of floc network structure on additional sediment consolidation and densification have been examined. Four real tailings and a high molecular weight anionic polymeric flocculant were used. Flocculation tests were conducted under reproducible hydrodynamic conditions in batch mode. Flocculated aggregates have complex structures with different sizes, shapes and <b>voidages.</b> The structures of the flocs were characterised by fractal analysis using light scattering technique and the dewatering characteristics of the flocs were investigated in terms of settling rates and sediment consolidation. The fractal analysis by laser scattering identified optimum mixing speed and flocculant dosage required for the production of flocs with compact structure of fractal dimensions greater than 2. It was determined that hydrodynamic conditions during flocculation have a profound impact on floc settling rates {{and to a lesser extent}} sediment consolidation. Low mixing speeds produced large flocs with high settling rates, while very high mixing speed during flocculation resulted in irreversible floc degradation leading to much reduced settling rates with some additional sediment consolidation. Application of shear to pre-sedimented flocs resulted in significant additional sediment consolidation for the tailings samples and flocculants studied. This approach would allow flocculation to be optimised for fast settling with subsequent application of shear to the settled sediment to promote the removal of inter and intra-floc liquor to improve consolidation and sediment density...|$|R

There are some factors which {{should be taken into}} consideration when proceeding with the scaling-up. One would be the energy consumption of an industrial scale vibrating fluidized bed.

Therefore, individual energy consumption for each part of the vibrating fluidized bed should be taken into account. The same can be said about the vibrating fluidized bed when we look at it from an economical perspective. Most buyers of the vibrating fluidized bed would most likely use it for a process to achieve an income profit. Hence, a detail cost analysis should be done,. From an environmental point of view, there is not much to be worried off except for possible safety issues, because the vibrating fluidized bed itself is generally considered to be environmentally friendly due the fact that the waste produced are already treated in the process.

40|$|The Fuels and Energy Research Group at the {{university}} of Surrey (FERGUS) have been investigating the heat transfer and energy utilisation within rotary cement kilns since the early 1970 's. One such project has been the study of chain systems in cement kilns. The work presented in this thesis is an investigation of a chain system for dry process cement kilns. A review of the literature has highlighted that there is a general paucity of experimental work on cement kilns, and in particular, very little on the role of chain systems. This lack of applicable results {{is due to the fact}} that experimentation on this type of full-sized plant is exceedingly difficult. In modelling the convective heat transfer in a chained dry process cement kiln the analysis of Gardeik and Jeschar (1979) has been applied. These authors have developed an expression which enables the regenerative nature of a chained rotary kiln wall to be quantified. The similarity criteria utilised to scale down a chain system is that of equal <b>voidages</b> between the model chainbank and its industrial counterpart. This modelling criteria was developed by Patterson (1980) through air and water modelling experiments on different chain systems. In order to generate the basic heat transfer data a 1 / 8 th scale, indirect fired, model of the chained section of Chinnor No. 1 Kiln of the Rugby Portland cement p. l. c. has been constructed. Clean low momentum flue gas from a vortex combustor has been used to heat, countercurrently, raw meal cement nodules for a range of gas and solid flowrates at different kiln rotational speeds. As with most experimental rotary kilns working at elevated temperatures (400 ºC) many difficulties have had to be overcome, with a consequent alterations to the original design. The problem of continuous monitoring of temperature within the model kiln has been solved by the use of a programmable data recorder and a gold slip ring assembly external to the kiln. This system has simplified the acquisition, storage and retrieval of temperature data from a rotating kiln. Experiments have been performed with the model kiln operating without and with a chain system to quantify the swirl produced by the combustor and the regenerative action of the chainbank, respectively. The direct heat transfer coefficients between gas and wall have been determined as well as the overall heat transfer coefficient. Correlations of the data have been presented and where possible the results have been compared with the literature and to commonly used equations. For the model kiln operating with a chain system the gas to wall heat transfer has been correlated to yield: NU = 0. 00661 Re 1. 15 Pr. 33 and the overall heat transfer coefficient by: Keff = 0. 002188 Re 1. 28 Significant enhancement in heat transfer to, a moving bed of solids has been achieved by using swirling flows in tandem with a chain system...|$|R
40|$|Gas-solid risers {{have been}} {{extensively}} used as multiphase reactors in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) system such as {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC). In FCC, a riser facilitates cracking reactions which take place between fluidized catalyst and vaporised vacuum gas oil. Similarly in CFBC, combustion of coal particle occurs in the riser. The gas-solid flow hydrodynamics in riser plays a dominant role in governing {{the conversion of the}} chemical process, and in turn the performance of the CFB system. Therefore, several experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the hydrodynamics of riser. Since experimental studies have been costlier and time consuming, detailed hydrodynamic modelling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has emerged as a promising alternative to investigate flows in riser. Two types of CFD models can be identified i. e. (i) Eulerian-Langrangian (EL) and (ii) Eulerian-Eulerian (EE) models. The Eulerian-Eulerian model considers both phases as interpenetrating continua. As a result, it allows a use of grid size larger than length scales of the flow structures. Therefore, this approach requires less computational power, and can handle large-scale geometry. Due to its computational edge, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach has been widely used to conduct the CFD simulations of gas-solid flows in riser. A literature review on the previous simulation studies revealed several shortcomings, and therefore, investigations on the impact of different modelling parameters were found to be necessary before applying the EE model to industrial-scale simulations. In this study, the EE gas-solid flow model has been used to carry out CFD simulations of risers. The effect of modelling parameters such as boundary conditions, drag models and solid phase closure models have been investigated. Finally, the EE model has been used to carry out industrial scale simulation of the lift engager to study the parametric effect of the lift gas velocity on the catalyst lift rate. The effect of inlet boundary conditions was investigated by using three different types of inlets for both gas and solid phases. The inlet arrangements {{had a profound effect on}} mixing patterns of two phases and energy balances in 2 D riser. Furthermore, the effect of wall boundary conditions was also studied by considering the wall as a partial-slip or no-slip wall for the solid phase. A 3 D full-scale riser was also simulated by implementing the boundary conditions similar to the experimental set-up. Although both 2 D and 3 D simulations could qualitatively predict the radial profiles of solid velocity and volume fraction, they could not predict even qualitative trend of the axial profile of solid volume fractions. Previous studies (Yang et al., 2004, Andrews Iv et al., 2005) showed that the conventional drag model such as that of Gidaspow’s could not capture the axial heterogeneity; however a use of the multiscale drag could remove this draw back. Thus, the drag derived using the energy minimization multi-scale approach was evaluated in another part of the study. The structure-based drag models could capture both axial and radial profiles of <b>voidages,</b> but only qualitatively. Furthermore, the use of different cluster diameter correlations with the EMMS framework gave more accurate predictions with reasonable qualitative agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the EE model was applied to study hydrodynamics of a complex industrial-scale lift engager. In this part, the effect of lift gas velocity on the catalyst lift rate and fluctuations therein were investigated to optimise operating gas velocity. Before conducting the parametric study, the effects of modeling parameters such as drag models and frictional pressure models on the hydrodynamics of the lift engager were also investigated. In summary, the study has been conducted by performing rigorous CFD simulations of both 2 D and 3 D risers. The effects of modelling aspects such as boundary conditions and drag models on the hydrodynamics predictions were investigated. The EE model with a structured-based drag from the EMMS model was found to be more effective in capturing an inherent heterogeneity of riser flows. However, the quantitative disagreements between the flow predictions and experimental data still persist...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} <b>voidage</b> of a packed bed of wet deformable granules is described. Rather than attempt to measure <b>voidage</b> in situ, the <b>voidage</b> is calculated from accurate measurements of bed bulk density and separate measurement of granule apparent density by kerosene displacement. The technique is reproducible to ± 0. 005 void fraction. This technique is used to study in detail the factors which determine the <b>voidage</b> of packed beds of granulated ferrous sinter feed. 10 sinter feed blends are used varying the type of ore (7 ores), feed size distribution and moisture content (3. 5 % to 8 %). As moisture content increases, bed <b>voidage</b> passes through a maximum.

Bed expansion and dense bed <b>voidage</b> increased with an increase of gas velocity as usual. From experimental results, a generalized model relationship based on inverse fluidization number for dense bed <b>voidage</b> from bubbling to fast fluidization regimes was presented...|$|E

The technique {{is based on}} illuminating a transparent-wall 2 -dimensional bed with diffuse light from the rear and recording the distribution of light that penetrates the bed. The recording is made with a high speed video-camera, which gives frames with grey level corresponding to the light penetration and from which the <b>voidage</b> distribution around the bubbles can be determined. In this way, <b>voidage</b> distribution in the region {{very close to the}} bubble contour (r/Rb≲ 1. 2) is obtained, which was not possible in previous studies due to limitations in spatial resolution. A correlation is proposed for the <b>voidage</b> at the contour of the bubble, with the <b>voidage</b> depending on the radial position and the polar angle ε(r, θ). In addition, the effect of the <b>voidage</b> distribution on the throughflow crossing the bubbles was studied and an increase of 20 % was determined for the average bubble geometry of the more than 100 bubbles analysedPublicad...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{fluidization}} of {{fine particles}} leads to formation of particle clusters, which significantly affects the drag force between the phases. Existing gas–solid drag models, both empirical and theoretical, do {{not account for}} the effect of the clusters on the drag force, and as a result, the computational studies using them are unable to capture the inherent heterogeneity of fast fluidization beds. The limitation of the current drag models is generally attributed to poor understanding of the effect of the clusters. In this study, the effect of a single cluster on the drag force has been investigated by conducting lattice Boltzmann simulations of gas–particle flow under a wide range of the overall <b>voidage</b> and particle Reynolds numbers. It was observed that simulations with the particles in a cluster configuration gave considerably lower drag than those with particles in a random arrangement. Furthermore, for the cluster <b>voidage</b> between maximum to 0. 7, a significant drag reduction was observed when the inter-particle distances within a cluster was decreased. The simulations with a constant cluster <b>voidage</b> of 0. 7 showed that the drag force decreased on decreasing the overall <b>voidage</b> from the maximum <b>voidage</b> to approximately 0. 96; however any further decrease in the overall <b>voidage</b> caused a steep increase in the drag force. The results of this study are important in quantifying the drag reduction due to the formation of clusters...|$|E

The mechanism of the hydrodynamic clusters is discussed...|$|E
