Florida used midazolam to execute William Happ in October 2013. The usage of midazolam in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100mg of midazolam. Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead {{of a heart attack}} 40 minutes after the execution began.

On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{choice of}} anesthesia for patients (pts) undergoing renal transplantation (Ktx) requires minimal toxicity and accurate monitoring for pts {{at high risk}} for metabolic, cardiovascular, and respiratory perioperative complications. We evaluated the anesthetic management and postoperative follow-up in pediatric Ktx performed in the last 12 years in our institution. From 1988 to 1999, 75 ASA class II-III pts (45 males, 22 females) younger than 18 years scheduled for Ktx were studied: 39 received a graft from a cadaveric donor (CD) and 26 from a living donor (LD). All pts were treated with dialysis within 24 h before the procedure. Standard monitoring consisted of an electrocardiogram, central venous pressure, non-invasive arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, and inspiratory and expiratory gas analysis. If necessary, an arterial cannula and pediatric pulmonary catheter were introduced. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, propofol, halothane, or sevoflurane and maintained with isoflurane and/or fentanyl and droperidol in O- 2 :N 2 O (FiO(2) 0. 4 %). As muscle relaxants atracurium or cisatracurium besilate were used, except in allergic pts, in whom <b>vecuronium</b> or rocuronium <b>bromide</b> was administered. Dopamine, 20 % mannitol, and furosemide were used to increase diuresis. Continuous morphine and ketoralac infusions were used for postoperative pain relief. The surgical technique was the same in all cases. Complications and renal-function (RF) recovery were evaluated relating to CD and LD using the chi-square test; differences in mean anesthesia and surgical time were evaluated by Student's t-test; survival curves were calculated from the day of Ktx to death or last follow-up and estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Values of P below 0. 05 were considered significant. Postoperative immunosuppressive therapy was based on cyclosporine together with other conventional drugs. Mean anesthesia time was 228 +/- 65 min. Mean kidney ischemia time for CD was 16. 5 +/- 4 h. Four pts (3 CD, 1 LD) died within 72 h postoperatively: 3 due to cardiac failure and 1 to metabolic coma. Six pts showed cardiovascular and 3 had infective complications, all successfully treated. Three pts (2 CD, 1 LD) died within 2 to 12 months after, surgery; 10 (6 CD, 4 LD) had graft failure and are still alive on dialysis; 58 (38 CD, 20 LD) are alive in good health after a mean follow-up of 57. 6 +/- 36. 6 months (range 12 - 120 months). Fifteen of 26 pts younger than 12 years (21 CD and 5 LD) recovered RF intraoperatively (10 CD, 5 LD); 1 with CD and 1 with LD showed postoperative graft failure and 2 with CD died within 72 h postoperatively, 22 (18 CD and 4 LD) are alive in good health. This group showed no statistical difference compared to pts older than 12 years. Of 16 pts (15 CD and 1 LD) with body weight (BW) less than 25 kg, 6 showed intraoperative (5 CD, I LD) recovery of RF. The 3 deaths were all in CD pts, 3 within 72 h and one 2 months after surgery; only 1 LD had postoperative graft failure. Twelve pts (75 %) (12 CD, 80 %) are alive in good health. Compared to pts with BW of 25 kg or more, this group showed lower intraoperative recovery of RF (P I 0. 05). No peri- and postoperative complications occurred in all 26 LD pts (100 %). Recent advances in surgery, anesthesia, immunosuppression, and antimicrobial prophylaxis have made Ktx a more predictable procedure even in pediatric pts. For high-risk pts, mortality and morbidity can be controlled by accurate surgical, anesthetic, and postoperative management. Pts younger than 12 years and with BW less than 25 kg are more likely to develop peri- and postoperative complications...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aggressive {{surgical}} {{removal of}} the primary tumour is the preferred treatment, but with tumour progression, some tumours cannot be completely removed surgically. Anaesthetics are administered to facilitate surgery. However, anaesthetics act as a potential factor in tumour recurrence or metastasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Normal breast cells and cancer breast cells were treated with different doses of muscle-relaxant anaesthetics. The effects on breast cancer cell invasion, adhesion and migration of these anaesthetics were then investigated using in vitro models. RESULTS: With increasing dose of rocuronium bromide and suxamethonium chloride CRS, the number of MCF- 10 A and MCF- 7 cells, but not that of MDA-MB- 231 cells, decreased. There was almost {{no difference in the}} number of cells when the three cell lines were treated with different doses of <b>vecuronium</b> <b>bromide.</b> The study also demonstrated that rocuronium bromide promoted the invasion, adhesion and growth of MDA- 231 cells, while suxamethonium chloride CRS had no effect. Interestingly, <b>vecuronium</b> <b>bromide</b> did not affect the motility and invasion of breast cancer cells significantly. CONCLUSION: An understanding of the effect of anaesthetics and their impact on tumour metastasis is important, thus using an appropriate aesthetic strategy could improve long-term survival in some patients...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of muscle relaxants in clinical paediatric anaesthesia (Chapter I) controversies concerning their potency and pharmacodynamic behaviour have remained. Over the years it has been demonstrated that various factors influence the neuromuscular transmission. During growth from newborn to adulthood many of these factors change due {{to the process of}} maturation. Apart from changes in organ functions such as liver and kidneys, body composition is also undergoing constant change. All these changes will influence on pharmacoki netic parameters and thus the pharmacodynamic behaviour of the neuromuscular blocking agents. Until recently information about the potency and pharmacodynamics of muscle relaxants in neonates and infants has been scarce due to the problems in quatitation of neuromuscular blockade in these age groups (Chapter II). With the development of electromyographic quantitation of neuromuscular blockade more information has become available but, due to remaining inconsistency in anaesthetic technique and many other factors, comparison between the various studies is almost impossible. This has led to different recommendations concerning the use of muscle relaxants in paediatric anaesthesia. For example, some authors consider neonates resistent to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, others more sensitive and yet others consider them to be equa 11 y senti ti ve to these drugs as adults. In our study we determined and compared the potency and pharmacodynamic behaviour of <b>vecuronium</b> <b>bromide,</b> an intermediately long-acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, in the various paediatric age groups under similar anaesthetic conditions and using the same el ectromyographi c method (EMG) for quantitation of neuromuscular blockade.
