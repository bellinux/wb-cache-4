40|$|Background and Objectives: <b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> {{refer to}} {{anomalies}} {{of the great}} arteries that cause respiratory or feeding problems. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze a series of patients with <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> and evaluate associated risk factors for mortality. Subjects and Methods: A retrospective review of all patients identified with <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> between 1997 and 2010 in the Seoul National University Children’s Hospital. Results: Thirty-five patients were diagnosed with <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> (median age at diagnosis, 7 months). The <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> of 32 patients were confirmed by cardiac computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The types of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> were: a double aortic arch in ten patients, a right aortic arch with persistent left ligamentum arteriosum in seven, an aberrant subclavian artery in seven, a pulmonary sling in eight, and others types in three patients. Eleven patients were asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms were seen in ten and sixteen patients, respectively. Associated cardiovascular anomalies were present in fifteen patients. Twenty patients with definite symptoms underwent surgical treatment. The median interval between diagnosis and operation was 6 days. Four patients eventually died; three deaths were associated with complex heart diseases, and one had pulmonary artery sling with severe tracheal stenosis. Only the presence of a complex heart disease significantly influenced mortality (p= 0. 002). Conclusion: <b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> include several types of anomalies, each with a different prognosis and symptoms.

40|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO), {{breathing}} 100 percent oxygen at greater than one atmosphere, has been prescribed for many different medical reasons. The mechanism for HBO, however, {{is not entirely}} understood. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the main energy carrier molecule {{in the body and}} its production requires oxygen. By increasing the amount of oxygen carried by the blood, the amount of ATP could also increase. This possible mechanism for HBO was tested using the addition of exogenous ATP on approximately five millimeter wide rings of fresh porcine gut arteries. The <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> were attached to a force transducer which measured the change in force exerted by the <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> when exposed to ATP.

40|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of vasodilatory actions of nitroso-compounds is not clear. It {{has been suggested}} that these drugs might modulate release of the vasodilator, prostacyclin, from cultured endothelial cells and bovine arteries or potentiate actions of prostacyclin. This study was designed {{to examine the effects of}} nitroglycerin and nitroprusside on prostacyclin release from adult human vasculature. Saphenous vein ring preparations were incubated with nitroglycerin or nitroprusside and arachidonic acid, the substrate for prostacyclin. <b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> incubated with nitroglycerin released significantly more prostacylin (measured as 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1 α. a stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin by radioimmunoassay) compared with the control <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> (p < 0. 02). This increase was observed at the therapeutic concentrations of nitroglycerin (5 to 10 ng/ml). However, incubation of saphenous vein rings with nitroprusside in concentrations as high as 1 jug/ml was not associated with any increase in prostacyclin release. Prior incubation of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> with the cyclooxygenase blocker, indomethacin, inhibited nitroglycerin-induced prostacyclin release. Incubation of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> with the selective thromboxane A 2 blocker, OKY 1581, resulted in additional prostacyclin release with nitroglycerin treatment, presumably by inhibiting vessel wall-generated thromboxane A,. Nitroprusside had no significant effect on prostacyclin release from indomethacin-treated or OKY 1581 -treated <b>vascular</b> <b>rings.</b> This study suggests significant stimulatory effects of nitroglycerin, but not of nitroprusside, on prostacyclin release from human saphenous vein.

30|$|<b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> are {{congenital}} abnormalities of the aortic arch-derived vascular and ligamentous structures, which encircle the trachea and oesophagus to varying degrees, resulting in respiratory or feeding difficulties in children. A sling is an abnormality of the pulmonary arterial system resulting in airway compression. Although several imaging examinations {{are available for}} the evaluation of these anomalies, computed tomography (CT) has become the preferred test because of rapid acquisitions, making it feasible to perform the study without sedation or general anaesthesia. Furthermore, CT provides excellent spatial and temporal resolution, a wide field of view, multiplanar reconstruction capabilities and simultaneous evaluation of the airway. In this review, the current role and technique of CT in the evaluation of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> are discussed.

5000|$|A <b>vascular</b> <b>ring</b> is a {{congenital}} defect {{in which there}} is an abnormal formation of the aorta and/or its surrounding blood vessels.

30|$|<b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> {{are rare}} (< 1  %) {{congenital}} abnormalities of the aortic arch-derived vascular or ligamentous structures that encircle the trachea and oesophagus {{to varying degrees}} [1]. A sling is an abnormality of pulmonary arterial system resulting in airway compression. <b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> and slings may be challenging to diagnose since the clinical presentation is variable and often nonspecific. They can be asymptomatic or present with respiratory symptoms and signs such as respiratory distress, stridor, seal-bark cough, apnoea, cyanosis or recurrent infections, typically {{in the first year}} of life. Feeding difficulties such as dysphagia, slow feeding and hyperextension of head while eating may present later in life since liquid diets are tolerated earlier and symptoms typically manifest when solid foods are initiated. Weight loss and failure to thrive may be seen. Some anomalies present later in life with feeding difficulties, during periods of haemodynamic stresses such as pregnancy or when there is ectasia of the vessels. On examination, cough, wheezing, stridor, tachypnoea, noisy breathing and subcostal retractions may be apparent [1]. <b>Vascular</b> <b>rings</b> may be associated with congenital abnormalities, particularly conotruncal anomalies (tetralogy, transposition, truncus) and syndromes including 22 q 11 deletion [2]. There are no gender, ethnic or geographic predilections [3]. Symptomatic <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> are surgically repaired {{in the first year of}} life to avoid complications such as hypoxic spells, sudden death, aneurysm, dissection and erosion of the aorta into the trachea or oesophagus.|$|R

50|$|Bronchomalacia is a {{term for}} weak {{cartilage}} in {{the walls of the}} bronchial tubes, often occurring in children under six months. Bronchomalacia means ‘floppiness’ of some part of the bronchi. Patients present with noisy breathing and/or wheezing. There is collapse of a main stem bronchus on exhalation. If the trachea is also involved the term tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is used. If only the upper airway the trachea is involved it is called tracheomalacia (TM). There are two types of bronchomalacia. Primary bronchomalacia is due to a deficiency in the cartilaginous rings. Secondary bronchomalacia may occur by extrinsic compression from an enlarged vessel, a <b>vascular</b> <b>ring</b> or a bronchogenic cyst. Though uncommon, idiopathic (of unknown cause) tracheobronchomalacia has been described in older adults.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} {{are related to}} the compression of the trachea, esophagus or both by the complete <b>vascular</b> <b>ring.</b> Diagnosis can often be suspected or made by chest x-ray, barium esophagram, or echocardiography. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show the relationship of the aortic arches to the trachea and esophagus and also the degree of tracheal narrowing. Bronchoscopy can be useful in internally assessing the degree of tracheomalacia. Treatment is surgical and is indicated in all symptomatic patients. In the current era the risk of mortality or significant morbidity after surgical division of the lesser arch is low. However, the preoperative degree of tracheomalacia has an important impact on postoperative recovery. In certain patients it may take several months (up to 1-2 years) for the obstructive respiratory symptoms (wheezing) to disappear.|$|E

Material and Methods: Patients who underwent thoracoscopic division of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from December 2004 to January 2006 are included. Their data were carefully analyzed looking at demographics, clinical presentation, diagnostic modality, type of the anomaly, operative details, complications, and outcome. Results: A total of 9 patients underwent thoracoscopic division of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings.</b> Age at surgery ranged between 2 and 108 months (mean, 24 months). Weight varied between 5. 3 and 32 kg (mean, 10. 3 kg). All patients were symptomatic. Computed tomographic scan was diagnostic and accurately defined the type of anomaly in all the patients. Four patients had a right aortic arch with an aberrant left subclavian artery and left ductus/ligamentum arteriosum, 2 had double aortic arches, and 3 had a right aberrant subclavian artery. One patient developed right-sided pneumothorax on the contralateral site, and another one developed apnea 12 hours after surgery, requiring mechanical ventilation. There was no mortality. Operative time ranged between 50 and 145 minutes, the mean being 107 minutes. The average hospital stay was 4 days. Five patients had their preoperative symptoms completely resolved, and the rest are showing steady improvement. The average follow-up period is 6 months...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{development}} of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings</b> {{can be explained by}} Edwards’ double ring hypothetical model [12], {{the development}} of the arch and branch vessels is more complex, and a thorough understanding of this process is imperative for recognising and accurately characterising the variations of <b>vascular</b> <b>rings,</b> which is critical for surgical planning [13]. Development of the great vessels begins at 20 – 22  days by vasculogenesis, in which networks of endothelial channels are formed by aggregation of angioblasts. These networks fuse to form the dorsal aortae and aortic arches. The lumen is established within these vessels when the small endothelial channels merge into larger channels [14]. Smooth muscle cells of the media are formed from neural crest cells in the arch and mesenchymal cells in the dorsal aorta [15 – 17].|$|R

5000|$|Double {{aortic arch}} (DAA) is a {{relatively}} rare congenital cardiovascular malformation. DAA is an anomaly of the aortic arch in which two aortic arches form a complete <b>vascular</b> <b>ring</b> that can compress the trachea and/or esophagus. [...] Most commonly there is a larger (dominant) right arch behind and a smaller (hypoplastic) left aortic arch {{in front of the}} trachea/esophagus. The two arches join to form the descending aorta which is usually on the left side (but may be right-sided or in the midline). In some cases the end of the smaller left aortic arch closes (left atretic arch) and the vascular tissue becomes a fibrous cord. Although in these cases a complete ring of two patent aortic arches is not present, the term ‘vascular ring’ is the accepted generic term even in these anomalies.|$|E
