50|$|Some {{plants at}} the {{distribution}} limits especially of var. hillii {{do not fit}} a strict <b>varietal</b> <b>description</b> and are best designated by geographical location. Furthermore, all varieties are susceptible to cross pollination, giving rise to intervarietal seeds.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{constancy}} of expression and the actual discriminating capacity of descriptive characters included in the UPOV apricot descriptor list, a two-year study was conducted, {{in the context of}} the European research project “Abrimed”, on 12 international apricot cultivars, grafted on two different rootstocks and distributed in 4 replications in a collection field located on the Tuscan coastal plain. The influence of the genetic characteristics, of the rootstock and of the annual climatic conditions on the expression of analysed descriptors was pointed out and, through a discriminating analysis carried out using a stepwise method, the importance of each character in the <b>varietal</b> <b>description</b> was identified. Among the 57 descriptors examined, there is a considerable number (20) that, according to this analysis, would not have in our case an effective discriminating capacity...|$|E
40|$|How to grow {{eggplants}} from transplants and seeds. Includes <b>varietal</b> <b>descriptions,</b> cultural practices, harvesting tips, {{and possible}} disease and insect problems. The eggplant {{belongs to the}} Solanaceae or nightshade family, which includes the sweet pepper, tomato and potato. The ornamentals petunia and Jerusalem cherry, and other plants such as tobacco and horse nettle, are also members of this family. Eggplant was so named because the first varieties introduced to English-speaking people had egg-shaped fruits. Its scientific name is Solanum melongena var. esculentum...|$|R
40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) being a cross pollinated crop, genetic {{adulteration}} is {{a vested}} problem and <b>varietal</b> <b>descriptions</b> are cumbersome. In {{order to identify}} genotypes and to establish phylogenetic relationships an investigation was carried on sunflower hybrids/parental lines/varieties using isoenzyme variation. The data on six isoenzymes were analyzed using Popgene software (Yeh, 1997). Genotypes which were morphologically closely related {{were found to be}} unrelated at the biochemical level. Hybrid KBSH- 42 could be distinguished {{from the rest of the}} hybrids for the absence of pgi- 2 and pgi- 3. Alleles g 6 pdh-l, me- 1 and skdh- 3 served as markers in distinguishing the geno-types. Thus the results obtained could be used in fingerprinting the genotypes. Key words: sunflower, isozymes, starchgel electrophoresi...|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formally}} described in 1879 by Bavarian botanist Ludwig Radlkofer. Although Radlkofer's name {{may have been}} based on an earlier description by Ferdinand von Mueller of an acute-leaved variety of Cupania semiglauca, this did not include a <b>varietal</b> name. Mueller's <b>description</b> was based on plant material collected from Port Denison, Rockingham Bay and Mossman River.|$|R
40|$|The article {{reflects}} economical {{value of}} a valuable food crop, field pea used chiefly as a vegetable (Pisum sativum L partim), its origin and distribution both in the worldwide scale and in our country, establishment of its <b>varietal</b> resources. Exhausting <b>description</b> is provided to new varieties of pea used chiefly as a vegetable, which have been listed in the State Register of Varieties Suitable for Dissemination in Ukraine in 20010 - 2011 for the harvest in 2012, and for which official description is available...|$|R
