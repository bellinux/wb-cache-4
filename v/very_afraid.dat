25|$|With {{the death}} of Tutankhamun and the two {{stillborn}} children buried with him, the Thutmoside family line came to an end. The Amarna letters indicate that Tutankhamun's wife, recently widowed, wrote to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, asking if she could marry one of his sons. The letters do not say how Tutankhamun died. In the message, Ankhesenamun says that she was <b>very</b> <b>afraid,</b> but would not take {{one of her own}} people as husband. However, the son was killed before reaching his new wife. Shortly afterward, Ay married Tutankhamun's widow and became Pharaoh as a war was fought between the two countries, and Egypt was left defeated. The fate of Ankhesenamun is not known, but she disappears from record and Ay's second wife Tey became Great Royal Wife. After Ay's death, Horemheb usurped the throne and instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him. Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, stepmother Nefertiti, his wife Ankhesenamun, half sisters and other family members were also included. Not even Tutankhamun was spared. His images and cartouches were also erased. Horemheb himself was left childless and willed the throne to Paramessu, who founded the Ramesside family line of pharaohs.|$|E

500|$|Wilders {{generally}} {{considers himself}} to be a right-wing liberal, with a specific mix of positions independent of the European political spectrum and peculiar to iconoclastic Dutch society. [...] He has stated, [...] "My allies are not Le Pen or Haider ... We'll never join up with the fascists and Mussolinis of Italy. [...] I'm <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> of being linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups", adding that his drive instead is such issues as freedom of expression and Dutch iconoclasm. Wilders views British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as his greatest political role model. People's Party for Freedom and Democracy figure Frits Bolkestein also heavily influenced his beliefs.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tharros I Alitheia" [...] is a dance {{song with}} heavy {{influences}} from varying electronic genres, including house and ambient. The song begins with Tamta faintly singing the chorus, proceeding into the traditional verse-chorus format, with Rouvas performing the verse. Tamta and Rouvas' vocal parts never overlap during the song; Rouvas {{is limited to}} the verses and Tamta to the chorus. Rouvas does not actually sing in the song, instead performing a spoken rap. The song's music and lyrics possess a sensual theme. Lyrically the verses have Rouvas telling Tamta different things that he wants from her, ending with a challenge: [...] "Choose/Truth or dare". In the chorus Tamta responds by professing her love to him. In relation to the song's theme, Tamta said that she always prefers truth, mostly because she is <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> of lies.|$|E

2500|$|Children {{differ from}} {{adolescents}} and adults in their interpretation {{and ability to}} express their experience. [...] Like adults, children experience physical symptoms including accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, nausea or stomach pain, dizziness or light-headedness. [...] In addition, children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but {{they are unable to}} vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear. [...] They simply know that something is going wrong and that they are <b>very</b> <b>afraid.</b> Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs to put these symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer. [...] They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing ...|$|E

When his forces arrived in Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), the provincial governor Liu Cong surrendered without putting up any resistance. When Sun Quan's men heard that Cao Cao had obtained {{tens of thousands}} of Jing Province's land and naval troops, they were all <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> because they knew Cao Cao's next target was Sun Quan's domain in Jiangdong. Cao Cao wrote a letter to Sun Quan, which read: [...] "Of late, I have been following an imperial decree to launch a punitive campaign. Liu Cong has surrendered when I led the imperial army to the south. Now, I am in command of 800,000 naval troops, and I wish to engage in a hunting expedition in Wu with you, General." [...] Sun Quan summoned all his subjects for a meeting to discuss how to deal with Cao Cao, and many of them turned pale when he showed them the letter.|$|E

About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film is that I think I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director.

2500|$|Ping, Pong, and Pang {{appear and}} offer the Prince women and riches {{if he will}} only give up Turandot (Tu che guardi le stelle), but he refuses. A group of {{soldiers}} then drag in Timur and Liù. They have been seen speaking to the Prince, so they must know his name. Turandot enters and orders Timur and Liù to speak. The Prince feigns ignorance, saying they know nothing. But when the guards begin to treat Timur harshly, Liù declares that she alone knows the Prince's name, but she will not reveal it. Ping demands the Prince's name, and when Liù refuses to say it, she is tortured. Turandot is clearly taken aback by Liù's resolve and asks Liù who or what gave her such a strong resolve. Liù answers, [...] "Princess, love!" [...] (Principessa, amore!). Turandot demands that Ping tear the Prince's name from Liù, and Ping orders Liù to be tortured even more. Liù counters Turandot (Tu che di gel sei cinta – [...] "You who are begirdled by ice"), saying that Turandot too will learn the exquisite joy of being guided by caring and compassionate love. Having spoken, Liù seizes a dagger from a soldier's belt and stabs herself. As she staggers towards the Prince and falls dead, the crowd screams for her to speak the Prince's name. Since Timur is blind, he must be told about Liù's death, and he cries out in anguish. When Timur warns that the gods will be offended by Liù's death, the crowd becomes subdued, <b>very</b> <b>afraid</b> and ashamed. The grieving Timur and the crowd follow Liù's body as it is carried away. Everybody departs, leaving the Prince and Turandot alone. He reproaches Turandot for her cruelty (Duet – The Prince, Turandot: Principessa di morte – [...] "Princess of death"), then takes {{her in his arms}} and kisses her in spite of her resistance.|$|E

When he was satisfied with the ploughing, he had the axes and grub-hoes ground, and set the men to work cutting out the smaller growth of willows of underbrush in the strip of birches that stretched close up to the homestead from the bluff.
