5|$|Structure 5D-87 is {{also known}} as the Temple of the Skulls (Templo de las Calaveras in Spanish). It is the third largest temple in the Mundo Perdido complex. A new version of this temple was {{superimposed}} upon a preceding version during the 7th century AD. This new version faced away from the Mundo Perdido and possessed a single room with five doorways that faced onto the adjacent Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. Around AD 700, this version was sealed and a new version was built on top, at which time it became one of the highest structures in the Mundo Perdido. This version of the structure had a four-level platform with an access stairway interrupted by a <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche,</b> as was the architectural style prevalent at Tikal during this time. The base of the niche was adorned with three sculpted skulls, one facing forwards and the two flanking skulls in profile.|$|E

50|$|Raised {{three steps}} from the nave, the choir has a large round-arched, <b>vaulted</b> altar <b>niche</b> in its rear wall with a fresco by Johannes Kragh. The altarpiece {{depicting}} the birth of Christ was painted by Axel Helsted in 1903. The bronze font basin was designed by Lorenz Frølich.|$|R
5000|$|The {{complicated}} {{iconography of}} the garden is embodied in the brooding statue of [...] "Appennino" [...] (1579-1580), a colossal sculpture by Giambologna, which originally seemed {{to emerge from the}} <b>vaulted</b> rockwork <b>niche</b> that once surrounded him. Multiple grottoes with water-driven automata, a water organ, surprise jets that drenched visitors' finery when the fontanieri opened secret spigots, offered striking juxtapositions of Art with imitations of rugged Nature.|$|R
50|$|The {{balustrade}} {{itself is}} of limestone ashlar masonry and concrete construction. The central bay houses a <b>vaulted</b> hemicycle <b>niche</b> containing a drinking fountain. The upper {{portion of the}} balustrade leads to the Promenade. A bandstand was located {{along the top of}} the balustrade on the Promenade, but it was removed because of its deteriorated condition in 1958. By the early 1970s curbs and paving at the old main entrance constructed in the 1890s had been changed and Holly trees were planted to border the entryway. The areas around the bases of the stone pillars, originally paved, were grass-covered by that time.|$|R
50|$|The central <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> of {{the second}} body, which rests on a {{pedestal}} base, is occupied by {{an image of the}} Virgin Mary, accompanied by the Apostles Peter and Paul and the local Saints Eulalia and Julia.|$|E
50|$|The Parish of Saint Francis of Asisi used to {{have two}} very large naves {{constructed}} by the Franciscans, one nave for the Spanish {{and one for the}} indigenous people. All that is preserved from the 17th century are the baptismal font, the holy water font and a carving of Saint Francis which is located in a <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> in the present-day main nave. Other, more recent features of the church include murals and Italian oil paintings. The main bell was cast during the Mexican Revolution. The third and main nave was constructed in the 1950s in which all residents of the town participated; however, this project was not terminated until 1994.|$|E

50|$|The {{spandrels}} of {{the niche}} consist of elaborate cuerda sec tiles that {{are decorated with}} yellow, apple green, turquoise, mauve and cobalt blue glazes. In contrast, the stalactite <b>vault</b> of the <b>niche</b> is formed by white moulded tiles with an underglaze floral decoration in cobalt blue. Some of the floral chinoiserie designs on these tiles repeat those used on the hexagonal blue-and-white tiles of the frieze.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{consists}} of two vaulted halves which stop in {{the apex of the}} <b>vault</b> where a <b>niche</b> containing the lighting effects is located, which runs the length of the ceiling. The white vaulted halves gently transform into the station walls which are reveted with dark marble in the lower half. Just above the exit portals are two medalions showing the coat of arms of the Lyublino district.|$|R
5000|$|Numerous tumbled-down houses, {{of average}} size, that had mostly {{been built in}} earlier times from {{regularly}} cut stones, nearly all of which enclosed a cave drilled out of the rockface; cisterns lay around on all sides, {{and there was a}} pool (birket) dug partially from the rock, and partially built from stone, measuring 20 by 17 paces. There were also traces of an ancient mosque, constructed, particularly in its corners, with magnificent masonry that had no doubt been harvested from a Christian basilica ... Not to be overlooked also were the remains of a small freestone structure, with all the appearance of a sanctuary, perhaps a mausoleum dating back to the Roman period. All that survives of it is a section of wall rising from the bedrock and embellished with two pilasters between which one can see a <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> touched off with elegant mouldings and probably designed to house a small statue.|$|E
5000|$|The Camarín de la Virgen (also Dressing Room of the Virgin) is {{a chapel}} room located behind {{the second level}} of the retablo where the image of Our Lady of the Abandoned is placed. It was built around the same period as the Santa Ana church (c. 1720-1725) and has {{retained}} much of its features. One can actually view the nave of the church from the octagonal <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> (hornacina) where the Marian image stands. Its high arched opening is crested with a large silver corona imperial (imperial crown). Below the hornacina is a semicircular gilded platform, which {{is said to be}} a part of the galleon that brought the image of Our Lady of the Abandoned from Valencia, Spain all the way to Manila—the Santo Cristo de Burgos. Wooden steps flanked the platform, where devotees used to climb to kiss the image. At present, only the Virgin's long cape was allowed to be touched or kissed. Very notable in this structure are the paintings on the ceiling and on the entrance, which are believed to be as old as the Camarín and the church itself. The art tradition of these paintings belonged to the short-lived Estampita Age of Filipino-Spanish art. The entrance paintings depict the life-size images of the archangels Saint Michael and Saint Gabriel guarding the door, also painted with a heavenly scene. The ceiling paintings contained an image of Heaven at the center surrounded by eleven segments of painting depicting scenes from the lives of Mary and Jesus, from Mary's betrothal to Joseph to the Baptism of Jesus. The central painting of Heaven portrays the Holy Trinity and the kneeling Virgin Mary, with cherubs and angels on both sides.File:Camarin Entrance2.jpgFile:Camarin hornacina.jpgFile:Camarin2.jpg|File:Camarin painting6.jpg| ...|$|E
50|$|The Barrio de Santa Cru {{contains}} {{some of the}} oldest structures of the entire borough. One {{of these is the}} Capilla de Santa Cruz is located on a small street called Anador Aztlán. It has a Salomonic main portal with vegetative designs. It is only one level topped with a <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche.</b> Inside, there is a silver leaf main altar with a notable wood cross covered in silver and decorated with the image of the Passion of Christ and the date of 1748. The chapel was declared a historic monument in 1972. The Ermita de la Cruz is on Calle Agricultures. It was constructed by the Franciscans in the early 16th century and listed as a historic monument in 1955. The interior contains a crucified Christ done in pea cane paste. It also has an oil painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This barrio also contains a number of houses and other structures from the 18th and 19th centuries. However, the Barrio de la Asunción next door is home to the most important plaza and church of the borough. The plaza is called either Plaza Miguel Hidalgo or Plaza San Matias, located between the parish of San Matías and Calzada de la Viga. It is of two levels with a number of trees and has a traditional kiosk in the center. It also has two important monuments, one of the Aztec glyph still used to designate the area and one of a bust of Miguel Hidalgo from 1870. The parish and former monastery of San Matías was begun in the 16th century. The main portal contains the main entrance, which consist of a richly decorated arch and two columns. Above it is an eight-sided choir window, and above that is a pediment {{in the form of a}} truncated triangle. Above this is a crest. There is one bell tower is Baroque. To the left of the facade, there is a dome over a chapel area, which is decorated with human figures and other elements. The interior contains chandeliers, arches and a main altar that features a marine shell. Saint Matthew continues to be the patron saint of the Iztacalco.|$|E
50|$|These {{paintings}} {{pertain to}} the military genre of historical painting or profane works in commemoration of heroic feats and gestures. A similar example of the same era is a painting found on a <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> conserved in MNAC, belonging to Saint Vincent of Cardona, where the siege of Girona (1285)/ The defense of Girona (1285) is depicted. This event was also described in the chronicles of Bernat Desclot. It is one the works that {{could be attributed to}} the master of the Conquest of Majorca. A little later, during the beginning of the 14th century, there are other works in a similar style of linear gothic which are found in the tower of the castle of Alcanyís, which portray the Conquest of Valencia by James I.The stylistic affinity is clear when these paintings are compared with the murals of the Palau Reial Major; both date from between 1285 and 1290, and both of which, in addition to the same subject, were realised using the majority of colours of red, blue, black and ochre, with a linear stroke deeply marked in black.This narrative of the painting is depicted in reverse to that of its written version, that is, from right to left, with great affinity in its narrative.There has been no conclusion as to which of the two series of paintings was realised first; that of the Palau Reail Major or, that of the Palau Aguilar.That of the Palau Reial Major may have been the first to be painted as the style of the work is found to be more epic and monumental in its representation of the military parades; the figures being depicted as more compact than those found in the work of Palau Aguilar.The work of Palau Aguilar more creative freedom can be observed, a creative freedom that perhaps would not have been apt for the destiny as a mural for a royal reception hall.The coincidence that these murals were executed in the same style and subject matter in both palaces was resolved with the discovery that Dolçe de Caldes, daughter of Bernat de Caldes (owner of Palau Aguiler), {{at the time of the}} death of King Alfonso the Candid, was pregnant with Alfonso's child. The King, before his death in 1291, asked his brother James (future king James the Just) to look after Dolçe and the son she was expecting by King Alfonso.|$|E

W 2; on {{west side}} of Geyre village, on north bank of Dere, {{oriented}} due SouthLatitude: 37. 42. 43. 14 Longitude: 28. 42. 30. 96 Elevation: 508 mAxis: SDimensions: Chamber: W: 4. 82 m, D: 5. 05 m, pres. H: 3. 20 mDescription: Well preserved underground chamber tomb; nothing visible on surface; now used for storage of sacks of pine cones and corn cobs; located in north bank of Geyre Deresi. The tomb is a large rectangular vaulted room with a large <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> (n-s 2. 55 m, e-w 2. 06 m) in the back wall, slightly off-center to the west. The main chamber is cleared to within 3. 20 m of the vault, and the niche is cleared to a height of 1. 90 m. The walls and vault are built of well-mortared split stones, {{some of which are}} evened-out river stones. Some of the stones used in the vault are very large (up to L: 1. 00 m, W: 0. 25 m). The few petit appareil blocks are limited to the jambs of the entrance door and the voussoirs of the <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche,</b> which extend as much as 0. 25 m out into the room from the plane of the wall. Part of the back wall of the niche (Th: 0. 30 m) is broken away revealing the orange-red local conglomerate bedrock. The vault and the end walls are not bonded; the end walls rise to meet the intrados of the vault, and the triangular gaps at the ends of the masonry courses are chinked with river stones. The dromos walls (Th: 0. 40 m) abut on the southern end wall of the chamber, and the dromos (W: 1. 19 m) is only slightly wider than the entrance door (W: 1. 10 m). Four rock-cut burial niches (H: approx. 1. 20 m, W: 1. 55 m, D: 2. 30 - 2. 70 m) extend the space of the main chamber, two each to the east and west near the north and south ends of the side walls. The openings through the masonry are informal, without support from an arch or lintel, and the rock cut walls are irregular. Though spur walls line the entrances of the two northern niches, in general they appear to have been cut and constructed after the tomb was built...|$|E

Square chamber surmounted by dome (Diam: approx 2. 75 m); the center had collapsed {{by the time of}} excavation. A <b>vaulted</b> <b>niche</b> (0. 70 - 0. 80 m deep, and 1. 95 - 2. 10 m wide) opens into each wall, and entrance was through the south wall. The threshold block is preserved, and the pivot (diam: 0. 09 m) is in the southeast corner, so the door opened inward and to the right. The arches are built of worked marble petit appareil blocks, and the walls are a regularly coursed mix of split and worked stones; much of the surface is plastered. The outer perimeter of the walls and dome was also exposed, revealing a rectangular mass of mortared rubble n-s 6. 50 by e-w 5. 40 m. The back walls of the niches are about 0. 60 m thick, and the dome was supported on massive corner piers about 1. 70 m square, buried within the surrounding earth. Six cists were built into the floor, one in each niche and two across the center; they average 1. 80 m long, 0. 80 m wide, and 0. 50 m deep. The floor, about 0. 60 cm below the level of the threshold, was paved in brick, and the cists were covered with thin slabs of limestone ("kayrak taşı"). A narrow shelf projects {{from the back of the}} niches to help support the slabs. ** Finds: All cists contained human bones and some small finds from different periods including belt buckles, coins, lamps, and glass unguentaria, but all had been previously disturbed. The excavators suggest that the tomb was built in the Late Roman period and used into the Byzantine period...|$|E
