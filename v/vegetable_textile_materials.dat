Simple categorization is referred to which <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> are clustered into fibre, yarn and fabric regardless whether it is made synthetically or naturally. For every basic <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> form, few selected recent works have been discussed to show the utilization of <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> in research and industry.

Utilization of textile fabric in composite as reinforcement is well recognized for high performance fabric so it is with natural fabric. Nonetheless, there is a limit of work considering fabric properties or parameters when characterize its composite to understand the fabric contribution in composite material. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the fire safety of <b>textile</b> and clothing <b>materials.</b> It also assesses the flammability for textiles in general. With the increase in big fires, accidental or non-accidental, people are worrying about the fire behaviour of combustibles. The flammability of <b>textile</b> and clothing <b>materials</b> is a great concern. Appropriate tests should be developed to assess <b>textile</b> and clothing <b>materials</b> to ensure they are safe in a fire. In fact, textile products should satisfy some fire safety criteria depending on their uses. There are specified flammability requirements on selected products, though whether these are good enough for assessing modern <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> should be watched.

In order to sustain our fashion and textile industry together with the environment, this study aimed at incorporating the newly introduced concept of 'textile material diversity' based on the theory of 'biodiversity' to the present industrial situation to provide solution. <b>Textile</b> <b>material</b> diversity accentuates not only the usage and manufacturing of a diverse range of sustainable textiles, but also the diverse sources of textile crops to prevent monoculture. The results of this study are first a theoretical concept of <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> diversity to develop feasible solutions and suggestions for the fashion fields, and secondly an introduction of a new sustainable <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> (i. e. bacterial cellulose) to broaden the <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> diversity. To begin with, the sustainability issues influenced by <b>textile</b> <b>materials,</b> figures of fiber consumption and the current status of <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> diversity in the fashion industry are investigated. An extensive literature review is done to identify the gamut of environmental impacts with further implication on the negative impacts of monoculture on biodiversity. This study also presents the general characteristics and case studies of bacterial cellulose exploration for textile development in the literature review. Introduction of bacterial cellulose is then to fulfill the concept of <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> diversity and enrich the spectrum of <b>textile</b> <b>materials.</b> The study further introduces different methods of tailor-shaped cultivation of bacterial cellulose. It is to develop different cultivation methods for the production of bacterial cellulose in order to cater different usage and shape of bacterial cellulose textiles. It improves the environmental values of bacterial cellulose textile production and further promotes it as a sustainable practice. These techniques allow bacterial cellulose to be cultivated into a desirable garment panel shape without cutting or producing extra textile wastes. Different methods of tailor-shaped cultivation can be applied in different shape requirements. With these self-synthesizing and tailor-shaped properties, the biodegradable and natural bacterial cellulose has great potential to be a new sustainable <b>textile</b> <b>material</b> for the fashion and textile industry. All in all, this study provides practical solutions including suggestions of alternative sustainable <b>textile</b> <b>materials</b> to lower the risk of monoculture and more options to the manufacturing and design sectors to tackle the industrial challenges.

In the article, first, we analyzed the actual requirements of the textile factory, researched the weaknesses in the used monitoring systems, and proposed a production monitoring and manage-ment system model based on multi-agent. Then, we made the system collect the data in a central point, divided data into two parts (noise and use-full information), and analyzed the correlation of material data. Third, we compared the results of several data fitting, and finally decided to use B-spline function to optimize the material data. Finally, using agent technique, expert system and fuzzy control theory, we evaluated data results of the <b>textile</b> <b>material.</b> As verified by application, on being compared with the used monitoring systems, multi-agent monitoring and manage-ment system can objectively reflect production process of <b>textile</b> <b>materials,</b> achieve comprehensive management and information integration, and realize data sharing and scientific management for all of the workshops.
