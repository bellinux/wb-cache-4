They hosted parties and shuttled between Paris and New York; Gore Vidal, who met the Windsors socially, reported on the <b>vacuity</b> of the Duke's conversation. The couple doted on the pug dogs they kept.|$|E
25|$|For {{each of the}} {{functional}} entities (qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians etc.), typical disharmony patterns are recognized; for example: qi <b>vacuity</b> and qi stagnation {{in the case of}} qi; blood <b>vacuity,</b> blood stasis, and blood heat in the case of xuĕ; Spleen qi <b>vacuity,</b> Spleen yang <b>vacuity,</b> Spleen qi <b>vacuity</b> with down-bearing qi, Spleen qi <b>vacuity</b> with lack of blood containment, cold-damp invasion of the Spleen, damp-heat invasion of Spleen and Stomach in case of the Spleen zàng; wind/cold/damp invasion {{in the case of the}} meridians.|$|E

50|$|Among Oryzomyini, a mainly South American group, a 2006 study {{distinguished}} three character states—large, wide <b>vacuities,</b> {{as among}} others in Oligoryzomys and Holochilus; small, narrow <b>vacuities,</b> as among others in Lundomys and Nephelomys; and no or vestigial <b>vacuities,</b> as among others in Mindomys and Oryzomys. Phyllotini all have very large sphenopalatine <b>vacuities,</b> as does Sigmodon. The <b>vacuities</b> in Reithrodon, formerly considered a phyllotine, are especially large. Nyctomys is special in having sphenopalatine <b>vacuities</b> {{restricted to the}} basisphenoid bone. Character polarity {{for the development of}} the <b>vacuities</b> in Cricetidae is difficult to determine, but their absence may be primitive in the Neotominae.|$|R

50|$|In rodents, sphenopalatine <b>vacuities</b> are {{perforations}} of {{the roof}} of the mesopterygoid fossa, the open space behind the palate, in between the parapterygoid fossae. They may perforate the presphenoid or basisphenoid bone. Their development and form are variable between and within species, and features of the sphenopalatine <b>vacuities</b> have been used as characters in cladistic analyses.|$|R
25|$|<b>Vacuity</b> of qi will be {{characterized}} especially by pale complexion, lassitude of spirit, lack of strength, spontaneous sweating, laziness to speak, non-digestion of food, {{shortness of breath}} (especially on exertion), and a pale and enlarged tongue.|$|E
25|$|Burgess's {{repatriate}} years (c. 1960–69) produced Enderby and The Right to an Answer, which {{touches on}} the theme of death and dying, and One Hand Clapping, a satire on the <b>vacuity</b> of popular culture. The Worm and the Ring (1961) had to be withdrawn from circulation under the threat of libel action from one of Burgess's former colleagues, a school secretary.|$|E
25|$|From 1898 to 1904, House {{worked on}} horseless {{vehicles}} and patented many devices {{used on the}} early motor cars. In 1904, he went to Worcester, Massachusetts to develop a chain for the Baldwin Chain Company, and while there he also patented a Liquid Indicator and Air Pressure and <b>vacuity</b> indicator. In Bridgeport (1906–07), he developed and patented an all-steel barrel and keg. In 1908, he was again associated with his son Harry House Jr., who had returned from England, in developing a metal belt.|$|E

500|$|Berneray {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times and Historic Scotland have identified eighty-three archaeological {{sites on the}} island, the majority being of a pre-medieval date. There are four chambered tombs, five cists and five other sites assumed to be burial cairns, suggesting a significant settlement in the Neolithic and Bronze Age. The fort of Dùn Briste (the broken fort) lies to the north west and a second site nearby dating to the Iron Age was largely destroyed during {{the construction of the}} lighthouse. Visiting in the late 17th century the writer Martin Martin described the latter as [...] "having a <b>vacuity</b> round the walls, divided in little apartments". A century later Edward MacQueen wrote that he believed it had served [...] "as a pharos or watch tower".|$|E
500|$|These {{collaborators}} soon left {{to pursue}} other projects, {{and the band}} briefly {{changed its name to}} The Scene Creamers, with Svenonius on vocals, Michelle Mae on bass, Alex Minoff on guitar, and Blake Brunner on drums. [...] In this incarnation, the band released I Suck on that Emotion, through Drag City. [...] After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French graffiti artist collective of the same name, the band reverted to the name Weird War. Since then, as its membership has become static, with the addition of Argentine Sebastian Thomson on drums, its intent has become more cosmic. [...] Weird War claims that they are [...] "the sole answer to the hype-based careerism, empty formalism and <b>vacuity</b> which has infected what was once a genuinely creative underground rock 'n' roll scene".|$|E
500|$|The {{cinematic}} experience {{itself is}} {{the main focus of}} the film, {{but there is also a}} central theme of emptiness. Noé describes the film's subject as [...] "the sentimentality of mammals and the shimmering <b>vacuity</b> of the human experience." [...] The dramaturgy after Oscar has been shot is loosely based on The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and ends with the spirit's search for a way to reincarnate. The director, who opposes all religious beliefs, says that [...] "the whole movie is a dream of someone who read The Tibetan Book of the Dead, and heard about it before being [...] It's not the story of someone who dies, flies and is reincarnated, it's the story of someone who is stoned when he gets shot and who has an intonation of his own dream." [...] Noé describes the ending of the film as Oscar's recollection of [...] "the most traumatic moment of his life – his own birth". The director also leaves open the possibility that Oscar's life starts over again in an endless loop, due to the human brain's perception of time.|$|E
5000|$|Titanotylopus is {{distinguished}} from other early large camelids by its large upper canines and other distinguishing dental characteristics, and absence of lacrimal <b>vacuities</b> in the skull. Unlike the smaller, contemporaneous Camelops, Titanotylopus had relatively broad second phalanges, {{suggesting that it}} had true padded [...] "cameltoes," [...] like modern camels.|$|R
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine <b>vacuities.</b> The <b>vacuities</b> are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{characteristic}} {{that make a}} tetrapod's skull different from a fish's are the relative frontal and rear portion lengths. The fish had a long rear portion while the front was short; the orbital <b>vacuities</b> were thus located towards the anterior end. In the tetrapod, {{the front of the}} skull lengthened, positioning the orbits farther back on the skull.|$|R
500|$|Kaif's {{career as}} a model led to {{anticipation}} surrounding her Bollywood debut. Boom (2003) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival, and was heavily promoted at the event. Boom was a commercial and critical failure. Kaif's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly received, with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film's leading ladies to [...] "the <b>vacuity</b> of their expressions". Hindustan Times reported that after Booms release, Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent. She later dismissed the film: [...] "I don't count Boom among important happenings in my life. When I signed this film, I didn't know much about India and its film audience". Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her because of her poor command of Hindi. In one instance, Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in Saaya (2003) as he found her an [...] "inconsistent performer". Subsequently, Kaif began working on her diction through Hindi classes.|$|E

50|$|Eryopidae were a {{group of}} medium to large amphibious temnospondyli, known from North America and Europe. They are defined as all eryopoids with interpterygoid <b>vacuities</b> (spaces in the interpterygoid bone) that are rounded at the front; and large {{external}} nares (Laurin and Steyer 2000). Not all of the genera previously included in the Eryopidae (Carroll 1988) are retained under the cladistic revisions.|$|R
5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid <b>vacuities,</b> two large holes in the back of the palate. Another pair of holes, choanae, are present in front of these <b>vacuities,</b> and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|R
500|$|The incisive foramina, {{perforations}} of {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, are short, not extending between the molars. The {{condition of the}} posterolateral palatal pits is variable, with some individuals having small pits and others having larger pits that may be recessed into a [...] (depression). The palate is moderately long, extending beyond the molars but not beyond the posterior margins of the maxillary bone. In most specimens, {{the roof of the}} mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the back of the palate, is not perforated by sphenopalatine <b>vacuities</b> and thus it is fully ossified; if present, these <b>vacuities</b> are small. Mindomys lacks an alisphenoid strut; in some other oryzomyines, this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two openings (foramina) in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. There are no openings in the mastoid bone. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|R
2500|$|Heat (热, [...] ) is {{characterized}} by absence of aversion to cold, a red and painful throat, a dry tongue fur and a rapid and floating pulse, if it falls together with an exterior pattern. In all other cases, symptoms depend on whether heat is coupled with <b>vacuity</b> or repletion.|$|E
2500|$|Philosophical <b>vacuity</b> is {{a common}} theme among Asian {{philosophical}} traditions including Taoism (especially Wu wei [...] "effortless action"), Buddhism, and some aspects of Confucianism.

2500|$|According to Metz, {{many of the}} {{prominent}} themes in Dickens's earlier works of fiction are intricately woven into Dickens's last novel. She states, [...] "Like David Copperfield, Our Mutual Friend is {{about the relationship between}} work and the realization of self, about the necessity to be 'useful' before one can be 'happy.' Like Great Expectations, it is about the power of money to corrupt those who place their faith in its absolute value. Like Bleak House, it is about the legal, bureaucratic, and social barriers that intervene between individuals and their nearest neighbours. Like all of Dickens's novels, and especially the later ones, it is about pervasive social problems—poverty, disease, class bitterness, the sheer ugliness and <b>vacuity</b> of contemporary life." ...|$|E
