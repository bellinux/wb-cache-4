Along the rod are several polymer <b>vacuum</b> <b>rings</b> to allow for the formation of a vacuum seal of sufficient quality, when inserted into the stage. The stage is thus designed to accommodate the rod, placing the sample either in between or near the objective lens, dependent upon the objective design. When inserted into the stage, the side entry holder has its tip contained within the TEM vacuum, and the base is presented to atmosphere, the airlock formed by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|E

More than 4000 beam screens, cooled at 7 20 K, are inserted inside the 1. 9 K beam vacuum tubes to intercept beam induced heat loads and to provide dynamic vacuum stability. As extremely high helium leak tightness is required, all beam screens have been leak tested under cold conditions in a dedicated test stand prior to their installation. After describing the beam screen design and its functions, this report focuses on the cold leak test sequence and discusses the results...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} of vacuum switching elements after production is checked normally by Penning or magnetron methods (combined electrical and magnetic field). Vacuum {{in the range}} of 10 - 1 to 10 - 4 Pa can be measured in this way. After assembly into circuit breakers however, these methods are not applicable. HF interruption performance during the make operation was proposed earlier as a possible alternative.

40|$|Typical beam {{lines are}} {{comprised}} of an assembly of vacuum valves and shutters {{referred to as}} a ''front end'', optical elements to monochromatize, focus and split the photon beam, and an experimental area where a target sample is placed into the photon beam and data from the interaction is detected and recorded. Windows are used to separate sections of beam lines that are not compatible with storage <b>ring</b> ultra high <b>vacuum.</b> Some experimental beam lines share a common <b>vacuum</b> with storage <b>rings.</b> Sections of beam lines are only allowed to vent up to atmospheric pressure using pure nitrogen gas after a vacuum barrier is established to protect <b>ring</b> <b>vacuum.</b> The front end may only be bled up when there is no current in the machine. This is especially true on the VUV storage ring where for most experiments, windows are not used. For the shorter wavelength, more energetic photons of the x-ray ring, beryllium windows are used at various beam line locations so that the monochromator, mirror box or sample chamber may be used in a helium atmosphere or rough vacuum. The window separates <b>ring</b> <b>vacuum</b> from the environment of the downstream beam line components. The stored beam lifetime in the storage rings and the maintenance of desirable reflection properties of optical surfaces depend upon hydrocarbon-free, ultra-high <b>vacuum</b> systems. Storage <b>ring</b> <b>vacuum</b> systems will operate at pressures of {approximately} 1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } Torr without beam and {approximately} 1 x 10 {sup {minus} 9 } Torr with beam. Systems are free of hydrocarbons in the sense that no pumps, valves, etc. containing organics are used. Components are all-metal, chemically cleaned and bakeable. To the extent that beam lines share a common vacuum with the storage ring, the same criteria will hold for beam line components. The design philosophy for NSLS beam lines is to use all-metal, hydrocarbon-free front end components and recommend that experimenters use this approach for common vacuum hardware downstream of front ends. O-ring-sealed valves, if used, are not permitted upstream of the monochromator exit aperture. It will be the responsibility of users to demonstrate that their experiment will not degrade the pressure or quality of the storage <b>ring</b> <b>vacuum.</b> As a matter of operating policy, all beam lines will be monitored for prescribed pressure and the contribution of high mass gases to this pressure each time a beam line has been opened to <b>ring</b> <b>vacuum...</b>|$|R

Super-atmospheric operation is profitable for small-scale applications by eliminating infiltration of non-condensable gases. The two main devices that are used to eliminate the non-condensable gases with a cycle operating with sub-atmospheric fluids are steam jet air ejectors (SJAE) and liquid <b>ring</b> <b>vacuum</b> pumps. SJAE use high pressure motive steam to evacuate the non-condensables from the condenser (jet pump).

The EN-STI group {{is in charge of}} the design and installation of the new dumps, foreseen for the next CERN's Long Shutdown in 2019 - 2020. As internal dumps, the PS dumps have been installed in 1975 directly in the PS <b>vacuum</b> <b>ring</b> between the main bending magnets and they are operating since then. The dumps enter the beam line when requested by beam operation, with a 6 kg Cu block moved quickly with a spring-based mechanism. This Cu block is not expected to survive the impact of the future beams. A new design is presented for the dump core based on FLUKA-ANSYS coupled simulations. The dumps should work with any PS beam foreseen within LIU, be water cooled in ultra-high vacuum medium, and enter the beam chamber in less than 250 ms. The dump should be used 200000 times per year, with a lifetime of 20 years, with almost zero maintenance.

The prototype VPHP decontamination system, retrofitted into a Beckman L 8 -M ultracentrifuge, {{was designed to}} vaporize a 30 % (wt/wt) solution of aqueous hydrogen peroxide continuously injecting and withdrawing VPHP in a deep-vacuum flow-through system. VPHP cycles of 4, 8, 16, and 32 min were examined for cidal activity against spores of Bacillus subtilis subsp. globigii and Bacillus stearothermophilus. Spore inocula (approximately 10 (6) /coupon) were dried onto 0. 5 -in.

At a chamber temperature of 4 degrees C, B. subtilis subsp. globigii spores were inactivated within 8 min, while inactivation of spores located in the outer gap at 27 degrees C required 32 min. The elevated temperature and high surface area/volume ratios in the outer gap may serve to decompose the gas more rapidly, thus reducing cidal efficacy. Of the two test spores, B. stearothermophilus was more resistant to VPHP. Nonetheless, VPHP was shown to possess significant sporicidal capability.

40|$|We {{consider}} extremal {{black hole}} {{solutions to the}} vacuum Einstein equations in dimensions greater than five. We prove that the near-horizon geometry of any such black hole must possess an SO(2, 1) symmetry in a special case where one has an enhanced rotational symmetry group. We construct examples of vacuum near-horizon geometries using the extremal Myers-Perry black holes and boosted Myers-Perry strings. The latter lead to near-horizon geometries of black ring topology, which in odd spacetime dimensions have the correct number rotational symmetries to describe an asymptotically flat black object. We argue that a subset of these correspond to the near-horizon limit of asymptotically flat extremal black rings.
