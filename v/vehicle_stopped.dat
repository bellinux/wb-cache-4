5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the inside for fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's <b>vehicle</b> <b>stopped</b> at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a full course yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. By then, he had dropped {{to the back of}} the field, and later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been backed into Buemi, and moved in front of him at the start of the 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He braked late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E

500|$|Two {{practice}} sessions—both on Sunday morning—were held {{before the}} Sunday late afternoon race. The first session ran for 45 minutes {{and the second}} lasted 30 minutes. A 30-minute shakedown was held on Saturday afternoon before the practice sessions and saw Ma record the fastest time of one minute and 8.633 seconds, four-tenths of a second faster than Nelson Piquet Jr. in second. The session was temporarily halted when Prost's car stopped on track. Both practice sessions took place in warm weather conditions. Di Grassi used the full [...] available to him and recorded the fastest {{time of the first}} practice session at one minute and 2.381 seconds, 0.145 seconds faster than Buemi in second. Daniel Abt was third-fastest, ahead of Engel and Vergne. Bird, Stéphane Sarrazin, Prost, Félix da Costa and Rosenqvist rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. The session was first disrupted when Oliver Turvey's <b>vehicle</b> <b>stopped</b> on track with an electrical issue after four minutes, necessiating the brief deployment of red flags, to allow course workers to remove his car from the circuit. A second stoppage occurred when Robin Frijns (who previously spun twice) lost control of his car at turn nine and blocked the track, and Rosenqvist impacted the first turn barrier and was stranded at the corner's run-off area.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{possible}} existence of the repeat phenomenon in police motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The study involved a mid-western police department. Data were collected from contact cards completed by police officers making motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops</b> between July 1, 2001 and December 31, 2001. Contact cards included information concerning the stop itself, driver, passengers, motor vehicle, and the officer making the stop. Individual identifiers of police officers allowed for an analysis of individual officer performance concerning motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops.</b> A Poisson process and logistic regression {{were used in the}} analysis. Findings – Analyses revealed that motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops</b> are not randomly distributed across police officers and, in fact, a significant concentration of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops</b> among few officers existed. Situational variables such as reason for the stop and time of the stop were significant predictors of high-performing officers. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of the results include an immeasurable bias due to officers 2 ̆ 7 discretion in completing contact cards for every motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop,</b> lack of external validity due to the specific circumstances surrounding the data collection, and the ‘time window effect’. Future research should focus on neighborhood level data collection, ‘hot spots’ for motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops,</b> the existence of high-performing (repeat) officers in field (pedestrian) stops, potential differences in racial disparity of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops</b> across high- and low-performing officers. Practical implications – The results of this study may offer insights into personnel and deployment practices based on officer performance. Originality/value – This study is one of few on officer performance that included individual identifiers of police officers. This unique aspect of the data allowed for the analysis of a little-researched area: officer productivity in motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops...</b>|$|R

30|$|This study {{provides}} evidence that both police academy trainees and experienced officers can miss an unexpected gun in a simulated <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop.</b> Although {{we expect that}} officers conducting a real <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop</b> would also experience inattentional blindness, {{it is possible that}} differences between a real stop and our simulated one could increase or decrease the rate of noticing. Given that our study was conducted at a police academy with the academy’s director observing the interaction, participants might have been more focused on their <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop</b> procedures than they would be when actually patrolling. They also knew that they were not in danger from the simulation, despite its realism. None of the participants expressed suspicion that there would be an unexpected object, but some might have treated the scenario as a test rather than a <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop,</b> and that could have affected how they focused attention during the interaction.|$|R

60|$|When Thady {{had first}} {{come out of}} the house, it had merely been for the purpose of going into the stable, as was his practice, to see the two farm horses fed; as he returned, he caught the sound of Ussher's gig; but it was more for the purpose of smoking his pipe in the open air than from any curiosity that he lingered out of doors. When, however, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>stopped</b> at Ballycloran gate, and he heard the whistle twice repeated, his {{interest}} was excited, and he thought that something was not right.

Then the steps were let down with a crash--she would not go to the window, or she might have seen him; she longed to do so, but it appeared so undignified. She sat quite still in her chair; but she heard his quick step at the hail door; she was sure--she could have sworn to his step--and then she heard the untying of cords, and pulling down of luggage. Lord Ballindine was again in the house, and the dearest wish of her heart was accomplished.|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} there drove up to an {{exceedingly}} snug and well-appointed house in Park Lane, a travelling chariot with a lozenge on the panels, a discontented female in a green veil and crimped curls on the rumble, and a large and confidential man on the box. It was the equipage of our friend Miss Crawley, returning from Hants. The carriage windows were shut; the fat spaniel, whose head and tongue ordinarily lolled {{out of one of}} them, reposed on the lap of the discontented female. When the <b>vehicle</b> <b>stopped,</b> a large round bundle of shawls was taken out of the carriage by the aid of various domestics and a young lady who accompanied the heap of cloaks. That bundle contained Miss Crawley, who was conveyed upstairs forthwith, and put into a bed and chamber warmed properly as for the reception of an invalid. Messengers went off for her physician and medical man. They came, consulted, prescribed, vanished. The young companion of Miss Crawley, at the conclusion of their interview, came in to receive their instructions, and administered those antiphlogistic medicines which the eminent men ordered.|$|E

30|$|This study {{examined}} whether experienced {{police officers and}} trainees at a police academy would notice a gun positioned in plain sight during a simulated <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop.</b> During a real <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop,</b> {{the presence of a}} gun would have direct and immediate consequences for the officer—it is relevant to their task. Moreover, police are trained to look for dangers in their environment. In our study, many trainees and officers failed to notice the gun. The driver’s interaction style during the <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop</b> (cooperative or agitated) had little effect on noticing rates. This approach allowed for a systematic study of noticing rates using a controlled simulation that mimics common reports of real-world inattentional blindness for relevant and potentially important objects.|$|R

They were to dine and dress for the play at a friend’s house. First, driving thither with their band-boxes, they departed on their first errand to make some purchases at Messrs. Jones, Spruggins, and Smith’s, of Tottenham-court-road; after which, they were to go to Redmayne’s in Bond-street; thence, to innumerable places that no one ever heard of.

40|$|Macroscopic {{emission}} models use {{average speed}} as a sole traffic-related explanatory variable. Research, however, {{has demonstrated that}} the use of average speed as a single traffic-related explanatory variable is insufficient in estimating vehicle emissions. The objective {{of this paper is to}} attempt to quantify, using simple examples, the impact of <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops</b> on fuel consumption and emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. This study indicates that the vehicle fuel consumption rate is more sensitive to cruise speed levels than to <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops.</b> The aggressiveness of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>stop,</b> as represented by the vehicle's acceleration and deceleration level, does have a significant impact on vehicle emission rates. Specifically, HC and CO emission rates are highly sensitive to the level of acceleration when compared to cruise speeds in the range of 10 to 120 km/h. Alternatively, the impact of deceleration levels on all measures of effectiveness is relatively small. Noteworthy is the fact that at high speeds the introduction of <b>vehicle</b> <b>stops</b> involving extremely mild deceleration and acceleration levels can actually reduce vehicle emission rates...|$|R
