We simulate {{the process by which}} a <b>volumetric</b> <b>solid</b> transforms into a viscous liquid as the amount of heat it accumulates on its surface reaches a certain temperature.

40|$|Modern {{systems for}} {{computer-aided}} design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) {{have a history}} dating back to drafting boards, early computers, and machine shops with specialized technicians for each stage in a manufacturing workflow. In recent years, personal-scale digital fabrication has challenged many of these workflows' build-in assumptions. A single individual may control the entire workflow, from design to manufacture; they will be using computers that are exponentially more powerful {{than those in the}} 1970 s; and they may be using a wide variety of tools, machines, and processes. The variety of tools and machines leads to a combinatorial explosion of possible workflows. In addition, tools are based on boundary representations, which are fragile and can easily describe nonsensical objects. This thesis addresses these issues with a set of tools for end-to-end digital fabrication based on <b>volumetric</b> <b>solid</b> <b>models.</b> Workflows are modular, making it easy to add new machines, and a shared core of path-planning operations reduces system complexity. Replacing boundary representations with volumetric representations guarantees that models represent reasonable real-world solids. Adaptively sampled distance fields are used as a generic interchange format. Functional representations are used as a design representation, and we examine scaling behavior and efficient rendering. We present interactive design tools that use these representations as their geometry engine. Data from CT scans is also used to populate these distance fields, showing significant benefits in file size and resolution compared to meshes. Finally, these representations are used as inputs to a modular multimachine CAM workflow. Toolpath generation is implemented, characterized, and tested on a complex <b>solid</b> <b>model.</b> We conclude with a summary of results and recommendations for future research directions. by Matthew Keeter.

However, performing modeling operations such as Boolean operations or computing point membership classification with B-rep is computationally intensive, since B-reps do not have volumetric information. Voxelized representations, on the other hand, can be extended to include <b>volumetric</b> information of <b>solid</b> <b>models.</b> However, {{in order to use}} voxelized representations for <b>solid</b> <b>modeling,</b> efficient methods for voxelizing a B-rep <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> needs to be developed. In this thesis, GPU-accelerated methods are presented for creating and rendering a multi-level voxelization of a <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> that can be used along with the existing B-rep for modeling operations.

The GPU-accelerated multi-level voxelization method can generate models with an effective voxel count of up to 8 billion voxels. In addition, the GPU voxelization algorithm is more than 40 x faster than the CPU implementation in generating the voxelization.

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{developed a new}} drying-free casting method for shape forming of ceramics, in which a polymerizable solvent such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) is used to disperse the ceramic powders, and then polymerized into a poly (furfuryl alcohol) (PFA) binder during the casting process. Compared with conventional casting processes, this method offers more flexibility in controlling the microstructure of ceramics and eliminates defects {{that are likely to}} arise from the drying step. Controlling the rheological behaviour of ceramic slurries is an important step in the casting process to achieve improved microstructural properties. In this study, the viscosity of slurries comprising NiO/YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) powders and FA as solvent was investigated over a wide range of shear rates (1 s− 1 – 1000 s− 1) and at different <b>volumetric</b> <b>solid</b> concentrations (from 20 % to 70 %), while the effects of dispersant were quantified by adding different amounts of PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone) between 1 wt. % and 4 wt. %.

The experimental data relating the changes in viscosity to the <b>volumetric</b> <b>solid</b> concentration were <b>modeled</b> using different viscosity models, with Liu's equation showing the best fit for NiO/YSZ/FA slurries with and without dispersant.

A <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> is a digital {{representation}} of the geometry of an existing or envisioned physical object. <b>Solid</b> <b>models</b> are used in many industries, from entertainment to health care. They {{play a major role}} in the discrete-part manufacturing industries, where precise models of parts and assemblies are created using <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> software or more general computer-aided design (CAD) systems. <b>Solid</b> <b>modeling</b> is an interdisciplinary field that involves a growing number of areas. Its objectives evolved from a deep understanding of the practices and requirements of the targeted application domains. Its formulation and rigor are based on mathematical foundations derived from general and algebraic topology, and from Euclidean, differential, and algebraic geometry. The computational aspects of <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> deal with efficient data structures and algorithms, and benefit from recent developments in the field of computational geometry. Efficient processing is essential, because the complexity of industrial models is growing faster than the performance of commercial workstations. Techniques for modeling and analyzing surfaces and for computing their intersections are important in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling.</b> This area of research, sometimes called computer aided geometric design, has strong ties with numerical analysis and differential geometry. Graphic user-interface (GUI) techniques also play a crucial role in <b>solid</b> <b>modeling,</b> since they determine the overall usability of the modeler and impace the user's productivity. There have always been strong symbiotic links and overlaps between the <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> community and the computer graphics community. <b>Solid</b> <b>modeling</b> interfaces are based on efficient three-dimensional (3 D) graphics techniques, whereas research in 3 D graphics focuses on fast or photo-realistic rendering of complex scenes, often composed of <b>solid</b> <b>models,</b> and on realistic or artistic animations of non-rigid objects. A similar symbiotic relation with computer vision is regaining popularity, as many research efforts in vision are model-based and attempt to extract 3 D models from images or video sequences of existing parts or scenes.

Finite elements analysis (FEA), the most versatile and commonly used tool for the numerical simulation of the static and dynamic response of large structures, requires 3 D solids which accurately represent the outside {{as well as the}} inside geometry and topology of the domain to be analyzed. However, the structural changes introduced during the lifetime of the monument and the damage caused by anthropogenic and natural factors contribute to producing complex geometrical configurations that may not be generated with the desired accuracy in standard CAD <b>solid</b> <b>modeling</b> software. On the other hand, the development of digital techniques for surveying historical buildings and cultural monuments, such as laser scanning and photogrammetric reconstruction, has made possible the creation of accurate 3 D mesh models describing the geometry of those structures for multiple applications in heritage documentation, preservation, and archaeological interpretations. The proposed methodology consists of a series of procedures which utilize image processing, computer vision, and computational geometry algorithms operating on entities defined in the <b>Solid</b> <b>Modeling</b> space and the Mesh space. The operand <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> is defined as the existing <b>solid</b> <b>model</b> to be updated.
