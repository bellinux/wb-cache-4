25|$|Factories {{were needed}} to produce {{affordable}} wooden household furniture for the southern market. The first furniture company, the High Point Furniture Manufacturing Company, was formed in 1889. Subsequently, from 1890-1900, 38 new furniture factories opened in the state, with 13 of those in High Point. The Southern Railway line was formed in 1894, and High Point was shipping eight fully loaded freight cars of furniture each day by 1898. By {{the turn of the}} century, High Point had become the leading furniture center in the South, with over 40 furniture companies located within the city and the surrounding area. Meanwhile, other manufacturers set up local factories to provide related products like <b>veneers,</b> <b>plate</b> glass, mirrors, paint, and locks to furniture companies.|$|R

40|$|Opposing dental surfaces, {{both natural}} teeth and {{restoration}} materials, are submitted to wear. The {{effect of the}} presence of feldspar porcelain coating upon the wear properties of dental zirconia opposing human teeth was evaluated using pin-on-plate test geometry. Human molar cusps performed as pins, coated and uncoated commercial zirconia performed as plates. Tests were carried out at room temperature in citric acid solution during 21, 600 cycles, using 1 Hz, 1. 96 N and 5 mm amplitude. Wear loss was measured by weighing the cusps before and after testing. The material loss of the plates was assessed by profilometry. Surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the plates' surfaces were evaluated by roughness and contact angle measurements. Results show higher mass loss for teeth tested against feldspar <b>veneered</b> <b>plates,</b> together with higher friction coefficient. No wear was detected on unveneered zirconia surfaces. Contact angle results show distinct affinity of veneered (25 degrees) and unveneered zirconia (70 degrees) surfaces towards distilled water. Porcelain coating of zirconia dental crowns affects tooth/crown wear behavior, resulting in increased wear of both the artificial crown and the opposing natural teeth. Coating should therefore be avoided in occlusal crown surfaces. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

However, a processing technology for controlling the asperity shape of the wood surface has not been reported.|$|R
50|$|The James H. and Anne B. Willis House is a {{historic}} house at 707 Blair Street in Greensboro, North Carolina. It is a single story Modernist structure, {{laid out in a}} T shape with a gabled roof. The north facade, facing Blair Street, has a large plate glass window, while the main entrance is on the shorter west side, sheltered by a shed-roof porch. The exterior has a variety of finishes, including vertical cypress board and brick <b>veneer,</b> and <b>plate</b> glass windows and smaller sash windows are used in variety around the exterior. The house was built in 1965, and is an important Modernist work of the local architectural firm of Loewenstein-Atkinson.|$|R
40|$|Non-metallic timber {{connections}} {{have the}} advantage of improved fire safety and corrosion resistance over mechanically fastened metallic connections. Currently mainstream, contemporary non-metallic connections are typically constrained to the form of glued connections. However, glued connections require strict quality control, which adds expense and requires off site prefabrication. This has restricted the exploitation of the benefits of non-metallic connections. This paper presents findings from a programme of research investigating the structural performance and analysis of non-metallic dowel and plate materials to provide mechanically fastened connections for contemporary timber structures. Particular focus is given to the use of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) dowels and densified <b>veneer</b> wood (DVW) <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use {{of glass}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymer dowels and densified <b>veneer</b> wood <b>plate</b> is proposed as a contemporary means {{of providing a}} non-metallic mechanically fastened timber connection. From fabrication to end of life, the use of mechanically fastened non-metallic connections {{has the potential to}} offer many benefits to the field of timber engineering. Currently metal free glued joints provide corrosion resistance and, when made with thermosetting resins, are safer in fire than using metallic mechanically fastened connections. However, glued joints are restricted by a requirement for strict quality control in fabrication, which adds expense. In response to this, the use of non-metallic components to provide a mechanically fastened metal free connection has been investigated. This paper presents results from a series of parallel to grain tensile connection tests in glued laminated timber. Nonmetallic dowels can be more closely spaced than metallic dowels and in terms of connection capacity per unit connected area, it is demonstrated that the proposed connection type has the potential to exceed the efficiency of metallic counterparts. Based upon the test results presented, recommendations are given for fastener spacing design parallel to grain and design analysis of this new connection system is discussed...|$|R
60|$|It {{began to}} dawn on {{me what it}} all meant. The acting, I saw, {{was too much for}} my delicately-strung nervous system. I have always, I know, been too {{amenable}} to the suggestions of my circumstances. Night after night of concentrated attention to the conventional attitudes and intonation of the English stage was gradually affecting my speech and carriage. I was giving way to the infection of sympathetic imitation. Night after night my plastic nervous system took the print of some new amazing gesture, some new emotional exaggeration--and retained it. A kind of theatrical <b>veneer</b> threatened to <b>plate</b> over and obliterate my private individuality altogether. I saw myself in a kind of vision. Sitting by myself one night, my new self seemed to me to glide, posing and gesticulating, across the room. He clutched his throat, he opened his fingers, he opened his legs in walking like a high-class marionette. He went from attitude to attitude. He might have been clockwork. Directly after this I made an ineffectual attempt to resign my theatrical work. But Barnaby persisted in talking about the Polywhiddle Divorce all the time I was with him, and I could get no opportunity of saying what I wished.|$|R
40|$|Copper coating was {{deposited}} on Fraxinus mandshurica veneers for preparing EMI shielding composite by electroless plating using glyoxylic acid as reducing {{agent in the}} solution. XPS and SEM were {{used to analyze the}} activation process. It was found that a continuous chitosan membrane was loaded on the wood surface. XPS results showed that Pd(II) ions were chemically adsorbed on a chitosan membrane on the wood surface through an N-Pd σ coordination bond. After reduction, part of Pd(II) absorbed formed very little Pd(0) particles on the chitosan-treated wood surface. The activated wood veneers were immersed into a plating bath in which copper film was successfully initiated. The coatings were characterized by SEM-EDS, XPS, and XRD. The metal deposition, surface resistivity, and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness were measured. The morphology of the coating was uniform, compact, and continuous. The wood grains were preserved on the <b>plated</b> wood <b>veneer,</b> which had a copper-like color and sheen. EDS, XPS, and XRD results indicated that the coating consisted of Cu 0 with crystalline structure. The surface resistivity and copper deposition reached 175. 14 mΩ•cm- 2 and 21. 66 g/m 2 when the veneer was pretreated with 0. 8 % chitosan for 8 min and plated for 30 min at 55 oC. The <b>plated</b> <b>veneers</b> exhibited good electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of over 60 dB in frequency ranging from 10 MHz to 1. 5 GHz...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} {{the need for}} timber {{connections}} with high fire performance. Connections of members in timber structures commonly comprise steel connectors, such as dowels, screws, nails and toothed plates. However, multiple {{studies have shown that}} the presence of exposed metal in timber connections leads to a poor performance under fire conditions. Replacing metallic fasteners with non-metallic fasteners potentially enhances the fire performance of timber connections. Previous studies showed that Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) dowels can be a viable replacement for steel dowels and that Densified Veneer Wood functions well as a flitch plate material. However, as the resin matrix of GFRP dowels is viscoelastic, connection creep, which is not studied before, can be of concern. Also no research has been carried out on the fire performance of these connections. Therefore, a study of the creep behaviour and the fire performance of non-metallic timber connections comprising GFRP dowels and a Densified <b>Veneer</b> Wood flitch <b>plate</b> was performed, as is discussed in this thesis. Predictive models were proposed to determine the connection slip and load bearing capacity at ambient and elevated temperatures and in a fire. The material properties and heat transfer properties required for these models were determined experimentally and predictions of these models were experimentally validated. Furthermore, an adjustment of the predictive model of connection slip at ambient temperature allowed approximating the creep of the connection. The material properties, required for the creep model, were determined experimentally and predictions of the model were compared to results of longterm connection tests. The study confirmed that timber members jointed with non-metallic connectors have a significantly improved fire performance to timber joints using metallic connections. Models developed and proposed to predict fire performance gave accurate predictions of time to failure. It was concluded that non-metallic connections showed more creep per load per connector, than metallic connections. However, the ratio between initial deflection and creep (relative creep) and the ratio between load level and creep were shown to be similar for metallic and non-metallic connections...|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{the amount}} of metal used within a timber {{structure}} has many advantages, particularly when dealing with connections. Fire resistance and durability are commonly cited benefits. In addition the use of alternative connector materials minimises thermal bridging and can also provide a lighter weight structural solution. Existing contemporary forms of non-metallic timber connections are commonly provided {{through the use of}} adhesives. However, these connections are reliant on a need for careful offsite, prefabricated construction. Traditional green oak carpentry connections provide a mechanically fastened non-metallic solution. However, carpentry connections are not widely compatible with contemporary architectural design or with the use of modern engineered timber products such as glulam. Building upon research completed at the University of Bath, the aim of this thesis was to develop a mechanical, non-metallic connection system suitable for contemporary applications. Specific objectives were to investigate the structural performance of a defined connection system and to develop analysis methods to facilitate design. A review of the literature demonstrated a lack of uptake and use of mechanical non-metallic connections. Guidance for the design of mechanical fasteners reflects the lack of innovation and research into the use of non-metallic materials. Following an initial experimental investigation of non-metallic materials, an experimental testing programme was completed to investigate the use of glass fibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) dowels in conjunction with densified <b>veneer</b> wood (DVW) <b>plates.</b> The findings of the experimental study demonstrate that the use of these materials can provide a robust connection system for contemporary applications. The results of the experimental work provide guidance on dowel spacing requirements, connection response to load and connection failure modes. The failure modes of the proposed connection system were shown to be unique to the materials used and specific strength analysis methods have been developed to predict connection yield and ultimate strength. A method for predicting initial connection stiffness was also developed {{through the use of a}} beam on elastic foundation model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
