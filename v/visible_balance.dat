The nPVF and CV of the nPVF were used to evaluate the kinetics and between the age of 4 and 6 weeks radiographs were made of the hock. We expected that over time the foals will become more stable, which is reflected by a decrease in the variation of nPVF between different trials and thus a lower CV. The results show that the foals develop no dynamic stable <b>balance</b> <b>visible</b> in the kinetics and the results show a higher mean nPVF in walk for OCD- compared with OCD+.

40|$|Organisations {{have spent}} {{billions of dollars}} (USD) on {{investments}} in data warehouses. Many have succeeded, but many have also failed. These failures are considered mostly to be of an organisational nature and not of a technological, as one might have expected. Due to the failures, organisations have problems to derive business value from their data warehouse investments. Obtaining business value from data warehouses is necessary, since the investment is of such a magnitude that it is clearly <b>visible</b> in the <b>balance</b> sheet. In order to investigate how the business value may be increased, we have conducted an extensive literature study, aimed at identifying opportunities and future directions, which may alleviate the problem of low return on investment. To balance the work, we have also identified pitfalls, which may hinder organisations to derive business value from their data warehouses. Based on the literature survey, we have identified and motivated possible research areas, which we consider relevant if organisations are to derive real business value from their data warehouses. These areas are: * Integrating data warehouses in knowledge management. * Data warehouses {{as a foundation for}} information data super stores. * Using data warehouses to predict the need for business change. * Aligning data warehouses and business processes.

40|$|Friends of Fresno State. An {{open letter}} to the {{university}} and San Joaquin Valley communities, November 3, 2008. To Dr. John Welty, President, all members of California State University, Fresno and the communities of the San Joaquin Valley. A small group of individuals ("Friends of Fresno State") has been and {{are involved in a}} variety of activities and programs associated with the University. Each of us wants the highest possible level of success for the University, generally, and in its relationship with Fresno and surrounding communities and the greater San Joaquin Valley. Included in this letter are brief biographical summaries of the individuals in our group. Friends of Fresno State began meeting late in 2007. We came together with a shared belief that some of the serious and reasonably well-known issues involving the University and its broad communities of interest both within and outside of the University had reached a level that was becoming harmful. It was our view that it would be worthwhile to find a set of university ???best practices??? that, if implemented, would make significant progress in resolving some of the concerns that have been raised with respect to the university. Through the Fresno Regional Foundation, we contracted with Noll & Associates to conduct a research study on how successful Universities, with Division 1 A Athletic Programs, balance academics, community engagement, and athletics. Our project was welcomed by Dr. Welty and partly supported by the University and administered through the Fresno Regional Foundation. No findings or conclusions or recommendations were discussed outside of Friends of Fresno State and its consultants prior to the issuance of this report. Information is included regarding the process that was followed. Many people were interviewed and their views sought. Leaders of academic institutions, some of which are viewed as similar to Fresno State in 1 nany important respects, were interviewed to enable us {{to get a sense of}} best practices utilized elsewhere. The Friends of Fresno State are pleased to state that we recognize that some of the best practices that are identified in this report are already being utilized at Fresno State. There was no attempt in this research and report to directly analyze any practices, departments or personnel at Fresno State. The inclusion of any specific best practice is, in no way, intended to refer or relate to any deficiency at the University. We believe that the implementation of "best practices" can significantly enhance our University and the University's relationships with the communities it serves as we approach the proud time of Fresno State's lOOth anniversary. Finally, we support the "best practices" included in this report and take full responsibility for commissioning this research. We believe that this research can be significantly helpful to any University with a Division lA athletic program that seeks to <b>balance</b> and make <b>visible</b> its fundamental academic mission with the reality of having a big time athletic program. Friends of Fresno State is extremely appreciative of the excellent work performed by Noll & Associates in the performance of their research contract. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the past fifteen years, Fresno State athletics has emerged as one of the most highly visible facets of the University???s regional and national image. Recent events, including the 2007 - 2008 verdicts and settlements of employment claims and the national championship won by the men???s baseball team, have highlighted the division between those who see the University as moving in a direction they cannot support and those who continue to back the University. Dr. Bud Richter called together a small group of volunteers to discuss how the University might make its major achievements ??? academic, athletic, and community engagement ??? more highly <b>visible,</b> <b>balanced,</b> and understandable to the greater community. How might the University balance the reality of big time athletics with its fundamental academic mission: to create and disseminate knowledge? Three models of college athletics have emerged in the last hundred years: an academic model, with athletics being a completely secondary element in the university???s offering and image (e. g. Dartmouth, U. C. Davis, and University of the Pacific), a commercial model which features an independent athletic program that makes little or no demands on the university budget or personnel (e. g. University of Oregon, Michigan, and University of Southern California), and finally a hybrid model which utilizes significant resources from both the community and the university (e. g. Oregon State, Boise State, Kansas State University). Historically, universities like Fresno State have moved from its early history as an academic model to a hybrid model featuring a fully developed Division 1 A athletic program. While each model has its strengths and weaknesses, the hybrid model requires a very specific focus to ensure a balanced model, specifically one that does not find the athletic elements of the university masking its achievements in academic performance and community engagement. The hybrid model evolves slowly from the academic model and is highly influenced by the fans??? and supporters??? expectations of a commercial model. This evolutionary nature may render it difficult to see as having unique demands. The hybrid model is also challenging to operate for long periods of time in this ???middle ground??? without seeing it as a temporary transition between the academic and commercial models. Even if a university makes this transition it is always a slow and complex evolution with very predictable challenges. Clearly, this is no easy task for any growing university with high expectations. Noll Associates was selected by the Friends of Fresno State, employed through the Fresno Regional Foundation, with some support from the University to seek out the best practices for balancing all elements of the University???s offerings and provide a solid base for its Division 1 A athletics, academics, and community engagement. These best practices for any hybrid model university were derived from broad resources and are offered in the hopes that the University will carefully consider utilizing the ones that fit well with the continuing growth and development of its mission. It is clear, from a careful look at the history of the development of athletics within universities, that creating this balance has been a demanding issue for many universities for more than a hundred years. It is also clear that a careful focus on the best practices offered in this report can enable a university to manage a hybrid model that will positively integrate academics, community engagement, and Division 1 A athletics for the unified strength of all and the detriment of none. Introduction: A. History of the Project In its early years, Fresno State was seen as a regional state college serving the educational needs of the predominantly agricultural San Joaquin Valley. As time has passed, Fresno State athletics has come to dominate the image of the university. Over the past fifteen years, Fresno State athletics has emerged as one of the most visible aspects of the university???s regional and national image. The current public impression of the university has become polarized. Some factions of the community have voiced strong opinions supporting the university, its administration, faculty, and students while others are highly critical. Recent events, including the verdicts and settlements of employment claims by female coaches, have highlighted deeper divisions between those that continue to support the university and those who see the university as moving in a direction they cannot support. Unfortunately, these few but highly publicized events have masked the university???s regional and national influence. Further, these events have some people questioning the fundamental roles of the university. Others are concerned that these events may have a negative effect on the comprehensive capital campaign as it moves to a more public phase. Finally, adverse publicity is distracting those in the academic, administrative, and development centers of the university. A number of people felt that it was time to take a careful look at how to balance the university focus on academic performance and athletics. How might the university make its major achievements ??? athletic, scholastic, community engagement, and academic ??? more highly visible and understandable so that mistakes, when they happen, will be viewed in broader, more balanced context? How might the university balance the reality of big-time athletics with its fundamental academic mission: to create and disseminate knowledge? B. Objective The objective of this project is to discover and develop the best practices to balance academic performance, community engagement, and athletics at Fresno State. The recommendation is that university leadership utilize these best practices so that academic performance will become the primary driver for every decision within the university environment. C. Limits and Disclaimer What follows is a consultant???s report on best practices. The information provided in the history and context sections of this report have been compiled and copied from books, articles, and websites. Furthermore, the material has been edited and combined to provide a single readable document. There was no intention that the history section be presented as original research. The history section has only been included to provide a background and context for the rest of the report. The objective was to develop a list of best practices to be evaluated and considered by CSU Fresno to help balance academic performance, scholarship, community engagement, and athletics within the university.
