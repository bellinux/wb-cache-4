25|$|In the Tiwi Islands, {{the most}} {{significant}} impact was disruption to communications and power supplies. The telephone service throughout the Tiwi Islands was shut down for over 24 hours. The radio and television reception was interrupted by heavy rain and lightning, and the power supply in Pirlangimpi (Garden Point) was cut by fallen trees. Around Bathurst Island and northwest Melville Island, there was extensive damage to <b>vegetation</b> in <b>exposed</b> <b>areas.</b> Minor coastal erosion occurred in Milikapiti, where waves rose up to 4metres (13ft) above water level. In Pirlangimpi, many large trees were uprooted and several houses were slightly damaged. In Nguiu, Bathurst Island Township, some trees were blown down {{but there was no}} significant damage.|$|R

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010 to 2011, {{enhanced}} levels of vegetation occurred across Queensland due {{to a number of}} major rainfall events. New mining operations, as well as significant coal seam gas gathering developments, were considered to be under threat from bushfire hazards during the impending dry season due to abnormal natural fuel loads. This paper outlines a risk based fire management strategy using high level multi-discipline systematic risk analysis tools, including fault tree analysis, to develop controls that were viable in terms of implementation and cost. A quantitative approach to the designation of fire risk zones was applied through the calculation of thermal radiation caused by potential fire in <b>vegetation</b> surrounding <b>exposed</b> <b>areas.</b> The methods used to perform these calculations were derived from the Australian Standard AS 3959 : 2009 - construction of buildings in bushfire prone areas. Bushfires are a significant risk in Australian conditions. Putting in place measures to protect local worker communities, process assets, cultural heritage values and the environment, was seen as essential under current and impending climatic and ecological conditions. The use of a risk based approach offered an effective, quantifiable and reproducible system to meet this challenge...|$|R

40|$|A new region-based {{methodology}} for the automated extraction and hierarchical segmentation of <b>vegetation</b> <b>areas</b> into high spatial resolution images is proposed.

The result is a hierarchy of partitions with most relevant information at different levels of resolution of the <b>vegetation</b> <b>areas.</b> In addition, the high flexibility of the scheme allows different configurations depending on the final purpose. For instance, considering the size of the <b>vegetation</b> <b>areas</b> into the hierarchy, or prioritizing the information into the high resolution panchromatic band to improve the accuracy of both vegetation extraction and segmentation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{technique}} that generalizes 3 D building groups of virtual 3 D city models according to a cell structure that is derived from infrastructure networks. In addition, the technique handles <b>vegetation</b> <b>areas</b> and outliers such as landmark buildings. Generalized 3 D representations abstract from complex, detailed 3 D city models and enable storage, analysis, exploration, and interaction at varying levels of scales. Our technique implements the cartographic generalization operators clustering, aggregation, and accentuation; it performs the generalization in four steps: 1) City model components are clustered based on the cell structure. 2) For each cell, the weighted average height is calculated, which {{is also used to}} automatically identify outliers. 3) Free space is subtracted from the cells such {{as in the case of}} outliers or <b>vegetation</b> <b>areas.</b> 4) The modified cells are extruded to building blocks; <b>vegetation</b> <b>areas</b> and outliers are modeled or, respectively, integrated separately.

40|$|AbstractThe NDVI of the {{downstream}} of Heihe {{was calculated}} {{based on the}} data derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ images in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2009, and 2010. The six images all are same season's data, the span of time fall short of one month, so we can ignore error due to seasonal aspect. After the NDVI was calculated, the land cover was divided into five types based on the light of NDVI's value: the water area, the bare land, the sparse <b>vegetation</b> <b>area,</b> the moderate <b>vegetation</b> <b>area</b> and the thick <b>vegetation</b> <b>area.</b> Counting the areas of each grade vegetation zone, and meanwhile combining the information of hydrological observation with through the comparison of the different grade <b>vegetation</b> <b>area</b> and lake area change before and after water division, the restoring effect of the vegetation in the downstream of Heihe can be found out, and this can supply the scientific foundation for the Heihe water-division plan of the next step. The monitoring results show that lake area shrink rapidly and the ecological environment of the downstream of Heihe kept deteriorating before 2002, but after eleven year water division from upper and middle reaches of Heihe river, lake area extension compare quickly, the increment of the sluice is also very obvious, the environment deteriorating was alleviated and vegetation was restoring stage by stage...|$|R

Annual avian mortality rate, surrounding landscaping, and building characteristics that can potentially predict mortality rate were evaluated on mid-rises on the York University Keele Campus. I predicted that frequency of collisions increases with (1) higher proportional vegetation and proximity of vegetation to buildings, and (2) increased window area. After accounting for surveyor bias and predator removal, the rate of collision was 7. 7 4 SD birds/building/year. A negative binomial GLM determined collision frequency to be significantly predicted by proportional <b>vegetation</b> <b>area,</b> distance to <b>vegetation,</b> window <b>area</b> and wall <b>vegetation.</b> Significant interactions occurred between proportional <b>vegetation</b> <b>area</b> and season, distance to vegetation and window type, and wall <b>vegetation</b> and window <b>area.</b> It is strongly recommended that mitigation measures be implemented on high mortality buildings through visual markers...|$|R

30|$|In fact, we {{determined}} {{a significant positive}} relation between perceived distance to <b>areas</b> <b>exposed</b> to coastal flooding and the under-assessment indicator across the study sites. We also show significant negative relationship between perceived distance and the indicator of similarity. When {{a significant relationship between}} the perceived distance to <b>areas</b> <b>exposed</b> to coastal flooding and sketch mapping indicators was found, sketch mapping indicators were best explained by the perceived distance. Our results are supported by the study of O’Neill et al. (2016). To our knowledge, their study was the first to show the negative relationship between perceived distance to hazard zone and flood risk perception. Thus, as the perceived distance to hazard zone increased, flood risk perception decreased. In our study, {{we determined}} that the perceived distance to <b>areas</b> <b>exposed</b> to coastal flooding {{is an important factor in}} assessing respondents’ sketch maps of the spatial extent of coastal flooding. In fact, as the perceived distance to <b>areas</b> <b>exposed</b> to coastal flooding increased, respondents’ under-assessment of the spatial extent of coastal flooding increased. Moreover, as the perceived distance to <b>areas</b> <b>exposed</b> to coastal flooding increased, the similarity between individuals’ perceptions of coastal flooding extent and expert estimations decreased.|$|R
