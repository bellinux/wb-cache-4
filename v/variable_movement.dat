Although physical activity can be beneficial for reducing depressive symptoms, there is preliminary evidence that high-intensity exercise can exacerbate (hypo) mania-related symptoms. Risks associated with other forms of exercise remain unknown. Method: To investigate the potential {{risks and benefits of}} low-intensity exercise, non-clinical participants were asked to either copy repetitive movements (n = 20), copy <b>variable</b> <b>movements</b> (n = 20) or watch <b>variable</b> <b>movements</b> (n = 21), following approach motivation induction. Hypomania-like symptoms, positive affect and approach motivation were measured pre-, during and post-task. Trait behavioural activation system (BAS) sensitivity was measured as a moderating factor.

Limitations: A predominantly student population with low average trait BAS sensitivity was studied. The reliability and validity of the approach motivation induction, mania measure and physical activity task are uncertain.

40|$|International audienceMechanisms driving {{selection}} of body size and growth rate in wild marinevertebrates are poorly understood, thus limiting {{knowledge of their}} fitnesscosts at ecological, physiological and genetic scales. Here, we indirectlytested whether selection for size-related traits of juvenile sharks that inhabita nursery hosting two dichotomous habitats, protected mangroves (lowpredation risk) and exposed seagrass beds (high predation risk), is influencedby their foraging behaviour. Juvenile sharks displayed a continuumof foraging strategies between mangrove and seagrass areas, with someindividuals preferentially feeding in one habitat over another. Foraginghabitat was correlated with growth rate, whereby slower growing, smallerindividuals fed predominantly in sheltered mangroves, whereas larger,faster growing animals fed over exposed seagrass. Concomitantly, trackedjuveniles undertook <b>variable</b> <b>movement</b> behaviours across both the lowand high predation risk habitat.

Three sharks remained within the Shark Bay region and another made a 500 km round-trip excursion to oceanic waters northwest of the bay.

Although no reliable position Wxes were obtained for the Wfth shark, we were able to use the timing of satellite uplinks and the position of the satellite to determine that it had moved at least 8, 000 km to the coastal waters of southeast Africa in 99 days—the longest recorded movement by a tiger shark.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Claude Debussy (1862 - 1918) and Maurice Ravel (1875 - 1937) {{were leading}} {{figures of the}} {{innovative}} musical language {{in the late nineteenth}} century that is known as French Impressionism. They developed revolutionary compositional style that departed from classical Romanticism and was greatly influenced by Symbolist poets and Asian arts. The piano works on the motive of water, Reflets dans l'eau from Images I by Debussy and Jeux d'eau by Ravel, are selected to analyze their impressionistic components. This dissertation discusses the similarities and differences between the two works and the composers' compositional techniques. In both works, many of technical applications such as arpeggio, pedal-point, staccato, tremolo and glissando are widely used to describe the <b>variable</b> <b>movements</b> of water from small ripples to raising surges or giant cascade. Dissonances (sevenths, ninths and elevenths), pentatonic scale and whole-tone scale are also freely used, as well as parallel movements of perfect intervals (fourths, fifths and octaves) and polytonality. All of these new compositional techniques, which were not commonly used in the previous periods, effectively evoke impressionistic images through various sonorities. Nevertheless, the two works are different from each other in several aspects. Debussy's idea on form, structure, melodies and rhythms are more peculiar and vague. Also, abrupt changes of rhythms occur in many places. On the other hand, Ravel's melodies and rhythms in general are traditional and clearly shaped. His idea on form, although not following the classic tonal scheme, is still more classically oriented compared to Debussy's. As used in both works of Ravel and Debussy, water is often chosen as a descriptive theme among the many natural phenomena. Water has optimal possibilities to carry out various imageries due to its fluidity and amorphousness. Debussy and Ravel accomplished the picturesque expressions of <b>variable</b> <b>movements</b> of water in Reflets dans l'eau and Jeux d'eau through many impressionistic elements and compositional skills...|$|R

Previous work in dystonia studied the speed-accuracy trade-off during point-to-point tasks.

The speed-accuracy trade-off is examined by changing the spoon size to create different accuracy demands. Results demonstrate that the trajectory-constrained speed-accuracy relation is present in both groups, but it is altered in dystonia in terms of increased slope and offset toward longer movement times. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis of increased signal-dependent noise in dystonia, which may partially explain the slow and <b>variable</b> <b>movements</b> observed in dystonia...|$|R

It is proposed that posture and impairment are not directly related, but linked by movement dysfunction. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the relationships among posture, pectoralis minor muscle length, and movement alterations at the shoulder. Subjects. Subjects who were asymptomatic for shoulder pathology were divided into 2 groups of 25 subjects each based on normalized pectoralis minor muscle resting length. Methods. Scapula orientation, thoracic kypho-sis, and pectoralis minor muscle lengths were measured, and ratios and indexes of postural variables were calculated. All variables were ana-lyzed for correlations and group differences. Results. Significant group differences were demonstrated for several posture variables, including thoracic spine kyphosis and scapular internal rotation. The distance from the sternal notch to the coracoid process demonstrated the highest correlation with pectoralis minor muscle length. Discussion and Conclusion.

Here, long-term telemetry data of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) from 1999 to 2002 were used to define movement patterns of neonate individuals. Movement was described by measures of central tendency and dispersion in distance moved, linearity of movement, bearing of movement and activity space size.
