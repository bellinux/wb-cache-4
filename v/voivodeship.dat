5|$|Prussia {{received}} {{the cities of}} Gdańsk (Danzig) and Toruń (Thorn), and Gniezno <b>Voivodeship,</b> Poznań <b>Voivodeship,</b> Sieradz <b>Voivodeship,</b> Kalisz <b>Voivodeship,</b> Płock <b>Voivodeship,</b> Brześć Kujawski <b>Voivodeship,</b> Inowrocław <b>Voivodeship,</b> Dobrzyń Land, {{and parts of the}} Kraków <b>Voivodeship,</b> Rawa <b>Voivodeship</b> and Masovian <b>Voivodeship.</b> This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 23 September or 25 September (sources vary). Prussia organized its newly acquired territories into South Prussia.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{received}} the Kiev <b>Voivodeship,</b> Bracław <b>Voivodeship,</b> Podole <b>Voivodeship</b> and Minsk <b>Voivodeship,</b> {{and parts of}} the Vilnius <b>Voivodeship,</b> Nowogródek <b>Voivodeship,</b> Brest Litovsk <b>Voivodeship</b> and the Volhynian <b>Voivodeship.</b> This was accepted by the Grodno Sejm on 22 July. Russia reorganized its newly acquired territories into Minsk Viceroyalty and Izyaslav Viceroyalty (which in 1795 was split into Podolian and Volhynian Viceroyalties).|$|E
5|$|Provincial, Territorial, <b>Voivodeship</b> or County (Polish: ziemski, Latin conventiones particulares, conventiones terrestrae). The {{names of}} these sejmiks varied {{depending}} on their administrative level and local traditions; Płaza lists powiat sejmiks (county sejmiks; sejmiki powiatowe), ziemia sejmiks (territorial sejmiks; sejmiki ziemskie), <b>voivodeship</b> sejmiks (sejmiki wojewódzkie) and provincial sejmiks (sejmiki prowincjonalne). A theoretical hierarchy that almost never existed in practice could be drawn starting from the powiat sejmiks, and moving upwards to ziemia, <b>voivodeship,</b> general (of several voivodeships) and provincial sejmiks ending with the final, national sejm. Almost all ziemias had their own sejmiks, but {{the importance of the}} sejmik varied based on whether the given ziemia was autonomous (that is, whether {{it was part of a}} <b>voivodeship).</b> Powiat sejms were common in Lithuania, but were rare in the Crown of Poland, where instead <b>voivodeship</b> sejms were much more common. Some voivodeships could hold a single <b>voivodeship</b> sejmik, and others might be covered by more than one sejmik. The importance of the local sejmiks began to diminish with the formation of the national sejm. Thereafter the local sejmiks were relegated to dealing with local matters and electing deputies to the General Sejms. They rose in importance again in the second half of the 17th century, as the central Sejm grew weaker.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} liberated by the Red Army on 27 July 1944 and on 20 September 1944 {{transferred}} to Poland. After the war, the city became {{capital of the}} initial Białystok <b>Voivodeship</b> (1945–1975) of the People's Republic of Poland. After the 1975 administrative reorganization, the city was {{the capital of the}} smaller Białystok <b>Voivodeship</b> (1975–1998). Since 1999 it has been the capital of the Podlaskie <b>Voivodeship,</b> Republic of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Administrative or Economic (Polish: gospodarcze) sejmiks oversaw <b>voivodeship</b> self-government. Often, {{they were}} held on the day {{following}} the deputational sejmik. Their decrees were known as laudas. Some of the specific issues that these sejmiks addressed included: dealing with taxation (distribution of national taxes) and tax collectors, managing the local (<b>voivodeship)</b> taxes and treasury, recruiting local military and (from mid-1700s) election of deputies to the Treasury Tribunals. These sejmiks arose in the early 16th century.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} {{administrative}} regions (ziemia) in turn were transformed into <b>voivodeships</b> (województwo) around the 14th and 15th centuries (see <b>voivodeships</b> of Poland).|$|R
50|$|On April 1, 1938, {{borders of}} several western <b>Voivodeships</b> changed considerably. For more information, see Territorial changes of Polish <b>Voivodeships</b> on April 1, 1938.|$|R
50|$|The Polish local {{government}} reforms adopted in 1998, which {{went into effect}} on 1 January 1999, created sixteen new <b>voivodeships.</b> These replaced the 49 former <b>voivodeships</b> that had existed from 1 July 1975, and bear greater resemblance (in territory but not in name) to the <b>voivodeships</b> that existed between 1950 and 1975.|$|R
5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> – a horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the <b>voivodeship</b> – or the flag of the Lesser Poland <b>Voivodeship</b> – a horizontal tricolor of white, yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two.|$|E
25|$|After the War during 1945 - 1950 {{there existed}} a Silesian <b>Voivodeship,</b> {{commonly}} known as Śląsko-Dąbrowskie <b>Voivodeship,</b> which included {{a major part of}} today's Silesian <b>Voivodeship.</b> In 1950 Śląsko-Dąbrowskie <b>Voivodeship</b> was divided into Opole and Katowice Voivodeships. The latter one had borders similar to the borders of modern Silesian <b>Voivodeship.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lower Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> is {{bordered by}} Lubusz <b>Voivodeship</b> to the north-west, Greater Poland <b>Voivodeship</b> to the north-east, Opole <b>Voivodeship</b> to the south-east, the Czech Republic to the south, and Germany (the State of Saxony) to the west.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1999, Poland {{has been}} divided into the {{following}} 16 <b>voivodeships</b> or provinces (for more information see Administrative divisions of Poland and <b>Voivodeships</b> of Poland): ...|$|R
50|$|In 1950, new <b>voivodeships</b> were created: Koszalin (previously part of Szczecin), Opole (previously part of Katowice), and Zielona Góra (previously part of Poznań, Wrocław and Szczecin <b>voivodeships).</b>|$|R
50|$|Powiats were {{abolished}} in 1975 {{in favor}} of a larger number of <b>voivodeships,</b> but were reintroduced on 1 January 1999. This reform also created 16 larger <b>voivodeships.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fictional or fictitious {{offices were}} a {{specific}} kind of offices, as {{they referred to}} the territories which Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lost {{in the second half}} of the 17th century either to the Swedish Empire or the Tsardom of Russia. Following the Treaty of Oliva (1660), the Commonwealth officially lost Wenden <b>Voivodeship,</b> Parnawa <b>Voivodeship,</b> and Dorpat <b>Voivodeship.</b> Furthermore, as a result of the Truce of Andrusovo (1667), Poland-Lithuania lost Smolensk <b>Voivodeship</b> and Czernihow <b>Voivodeship.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{administrative}} {{division of}} Silesia within Poland has changed several times since 1945. Since 1999, {{it has been}} divided between Lubusz <b>Voivodeship,</b> Lower Silesian <b>Voivodeship,</b> Opole <b>Voivodeship,</b> and Silesian <b>Voivodeship.</b> Czech Silesia {{is now part of}} the Czech Republic, forming the Moravian-Silesian Region and {{the northern part of the}} Olomouc Region. Germany retains the Silesia-Lusatia region (Niederschlesien-Oberlausitz or Schlesische Oberlausitz) west of the Neisse, which is part of the federal state of Saxony.|$|E
25|$|Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> {{is divided}} into 36 {{counties}} (powiats). These include 19 city counties (far {{more than any other}} <b>voivodeship)</b> and 17 land counties. The counties are further divided into 167 gminas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>voivodeships</b> that {{remained}} in Poland after World War II {{as a result}} of Polish-Soviet border agreement of August 1945 were very similar to the current <b>voivodeships.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Silesian <b>voivodeship's</b> {{government}} {{is headed by}} the province's [...] (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The [...] is then assisted in performing his duties by the <b>voivodeship's</b> marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the <b>voivodeship's</b> executive and is elected by the [...] (provincial assembly). The current [...] of Silesia is Jarosław Wieczorek, whilst the present marshal is Wojciech Saługa.|$|R
50|$|The Greater Poland <b>voivodeship's</b> {{government}} {{is headed by}} the province's voivode (governor) who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the <b>voivodeship's</b> marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the <b>voivodeship's</b> executive and is elected by the sejmik (provincial assembly). The current voivode of Greater Poland is Piotr Florek, whilst the present marshal is Marek Woźniak.|$|R
25|$|Despite the Silesian Voivodeship's name, {{most of the}} {{historic}} Silesia region lies outside the present Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> — divided among Lubusz, Lower Silesian, and Opole Voivodeships — while {{the eastern half of}} Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> (and, notably, Częstochowa in the north) was historically part of Lesser Poland.|$|E
25|$|The current {{administrative}} unit of Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> {{is just a}} fraction of the historical Silesia which is within the borders of today's Poland (there are also fragments of Silesia in the Czech Republic and Germany). Other parts of today's Polish Silesia are administered as the Opole, the Lower Silesian Voivodeships and the Lubusz <b>Voivodeship.</b> On the other hand, {{a large part of the}} current {{administrative unit}} of the Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> is not part of historical Silesia (e.g., Częstochowa, Zawiercie, Myszków, Jaworzno, Sosnowiec, Żywiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Będzin and east part of Bielsko-Biała, which are historically parts of Lesser Poland).|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 300,000 people {{currently}} studying in the <b>Voivodeship.</b>|$|E

50|$|On October 2, 1413, Vilnius and Trakai <b>Voivodeships</b> {{were created}} by the Union of Horodło from the Duchy of Trakai. The <b>voivodeships</b> were ruled by an {{appointed}} official and not by the dukes.|$|R
25|$|Voivodes (Palatines) (singular: Palatinus) – {{an ancient}} dignity, merged {{with that of}} Palatines: Governors of <b>Voivodeships.</b> The number of Voivodes slowly {{increased}} when new <b>Voivodeships</b> were created; at its greatest extent, the Commonwealth had 37. See Voivodes of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for details.|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time Silesian <b>Voivodeship</b> was {{appointed}} in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which {{ended up in the}} Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko Śląskie (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This <b>Voivodeship</b> did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków <b>Voivodeship</b> Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce <b>Voivodeship.</b>|$|E
