50|$|If the {{cylinders}} are small, the <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> may be located between {{the cylinders}}. For larger cylinders the <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> are usually {{on top of}} the cylinders but, in early locomotives, they were sometimes underneath the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> {{are usually}} {{on top of}} the {{cylinders}} but, in older locomotives, the <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> were sometimes located alongside the cylinders and inserted through slots in the frames. This meant that, while the cylinders were outside, the valves were inside and could be driven by inside valve gear.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Kirchweger condensers to pre-heat the feedwater. An external {{feature of}} that is the second chimney on the tender. Exhaust steam was led from the <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> to the tender through a low-down, 100 mm, connecting pipe.|$|E
50|$|A timing or <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> is a {{compartment}} on {{an internal}} or external combustion engine (e.g. gasoline or steam engine) which provides access to the tappets and valves. The chest is fitted with an inspection cover sealed with a gasket.|$|E

50|$|They {{were not}} {{particularly}} successful locomotives. Although nicknamed Swifts, they were sluggish locomotives, {{due to the}} placement of the <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> underneath the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|A {{locomotive}} bed is a one-piece {{steel casting}} for a steam locomotive {{that consists of}} the locomotive frame, the cylinders and <b>valve</b> <b>chests,</b> steam pipes, and smokebox saddle, all as a single component. It was a development of {{the final years of}} steam locomotive design in the United States. Most large cast-steel locomotive beds were made by General Steel Castings. The advantages included greater strength and more accurate alignment.|$|R
50|$|In 1850 the {{locomotives}} {{were given}} Kirchweger condensers to pre-heat the feedwater. An external feature {{of that is}} the second chimney on the tender. Exhaust steam was led from the <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> to the tender through a 100 mm connecting pipe.|$|E
50|$|Steam feed {{is taken}} {{from the bottom of}} the boiler, through the burner flame for superheating, and out to a {{compression}} fitting on the <b>valve</b> <b>chest.</b> The slide valve is controlled by a fixed crank on the crankshaft. The engine is not reversible.|$|E
50|$|The {{passages}} of the steam jacket were large {{enough that the}} safety valve could also be mounted on the cylinder block. The regulator could also conveniently be built into the casting, immediately between the dome passage and the <b>valve</b> <b>chest,</b> without requiring long steam pipes.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-pressure}} cylinder is 24-inch bore by 6-foot stroke, and the low-pressure cylinder is 38-inch bore by 8-foot stroke. Steam is distributed {{by means of}} double beat 'Cornish' valves, mounted in upper and lower <b>valve</b> <b>chests.</b> The cylinders act {{on one end of}} the beam, via Watt's parallel motion. The beam itself is 26 feet 4 inches between end centres, 4 feet deep at the centre, weighs 13 tons and is carried on 12 in bearings.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} when the PRR was {{building}} the H-6 class, the railroad had effective stock control of the B&O, and installed a cooperative president Leonor Loree. The B&O acquired from American Locomotive Co. {{a large group of}} identical locomotives, originally classed I-4, but later classified as B&O class E-24. The E-24 class had many variations, some being converted to switchers, superheated, and new <b>valve</b> <b>chests.</b> The E-24a was equivalent to the PRR H-6sb. None the B&O the E-24 class survived to the Diesel era.|$|R
5000|$|Corliss valves open {{directly}} into the cylinder. The valves connect the cylinder to separate steam and exhaust plenums. Initially, Corliss used slide valves with linear actuators, but by 1851, Corliss had shifted to semi-rotary valve actuators, as documented in U.S. Patent 8253. [...] In this engine, the wrist plate {{was moved to the}} center of the cylinder side, as on later Corliss engines. This was still a beam engine, however, and the semi-rotary valve actuators operated linear slide valves inside the four <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were directly}} below the smokebox and moderately inclined, with all four cylinders {{driving on the}} third axle. The crosshead was, unusually, a single bar type. Walschaerts valve gear was used. The piston rods are particularly long, allowing space for a rocker arm on the valve rods, between the <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> and the combination lever, to drive the inner valves.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Trofimoff valve of {{locomotive}} no. 41 1144 in open position. The {{piston valve}} heads are {{loose on the}} valve spindle, in the middle dead centre position. Left is a supporting element. When fitted, the valve bodies are exactly centred by the <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> and the spindle through the housing (Tragbuchsen), so that the rod can move freely through the valve heads.|$|E
50|$|So {{that the}} entire {{locomotive}} cylinder block {{does not have to}} be changed when the valves are damaged, they are housed in special chests. The <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> consists of two elements which are forced into the cylinder block from the front and rear. Using special boring tools this chest can be bored out several times during maintenance. In the last illustration the junction of the two halves of the chest and the right-angled ports can be seen towards the rear. These are steam admission ports. Steam is admitted to the pistons of the steam engine through the front diagonal slits. The front area, outside the <b>valve</b> <b>chest,</b> is called the exhaust chest and discharges, via the exhaust pipe, the riser (Standrohr) and the blast pipe cap (Blasrohrkopf) centrally, underneath the chimney of the locomotive. The motion of the valve heads alternately opens and closes the diagonal slits or steam ports, thus controlling the admission and exhausting of steam in the steam engine.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of large tank engines was somewhat delayed by {{problems on the}} Southern Railway following the Sevenoaks derailment {{thought to have been}} caused by the instability of the large K class 2-6-4 tanks. Gresley carried out stability tests on one of these locomotives and finding no trouble and without further delay produced his sophisticated V1 class suburban tank in 1930. This incorporated his 3-cylinder system and was the first example of all three cylinders and <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> being incorporated into a single steel casting; this arrangement was used for the P2 Cock o' the North and the subsequent V2, K4 and V4 types.|$|R
50|$|John Tregoning, of Brooklyn, N. Y., has {{patented}} {{an improved}} Steam Valve for pumping engines, which consists in a circumferentially grooved piston rod, which {{acts as a}} valve, and in passages that lead from {{the ends of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> to and across the cylinder heads, and to the exhaust receiver of the cylinder, the said passages being crossed between the <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> and cylinder heads.John Tregoning and Michael Hastings, of Brooklyn, N. Y., have jointly patented an improved Pump Valve, which consists in a semi-cylindrical valve fitted to a suitable valve seat, and provided with recesses in each end for receiving a head formed on the rod of a small piston. A piston is connected with each end of the valve, and works in a chamber or cylinder formed {{at the end of the}} water way in the valve seat. Communications relating to either of these two inventions should be addressed to Mr. John Farrell, No. 30 Water street, Brooklyn, or to Mr. John Tregoning, 38 Gold street, New York city.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{compounding}} machinery {{was contained}} in the <b>valve</b> <b>chest,</b> which in American locomotives (in the days before one piece cast frames) was integral with the smokebox saddle. The whole unit therefore could be unbolted and replaced with conventional single expansion cylinders. That was the typical fate of Vauclain compounds: {{when the time came}} for a major overhaul, the compound machinery and Stephenson valve gear were removed, and the engine was rebuilt with superheating, Walschaerts valve gear, and conventional cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{patented}} type of {{tandem compound}} cylinders were arranged outside the bar frame. The high-pressure cylinders, in front, were 13 in in diameter, while the low-pressure cylinders, arranged behind, were 23 in in diameter, {{with a common}} stroke of 26 in. Each cylinder, with its <b>valve</b> <b>chest,</b> was cast separately and separate from the saddle casting. The high-pressure cylinders were bolted onto {{the front of the}} low-pressure cylinders which, in turn, were bolted onto the saddle casting which was fitted to the main bar frame.|$|E
50|$|When the FS {{were created}} in 1905, Chief Mechanical Engineer Giuseppe Zara {{undertook}} a process to design of a standard range of locomotives; one of these was the Class 630, a light express engine which, together with the other designs, shared the features of being compound locomotives. However, with the diffusion in Germany (then in close ties with Italy because of the Triple Alliance) of the Schmidt superheater, a decision to build there a batch of 24 non-compound and superheated version of the Class 630 (keeping all the other features, including the Italian bogie and the peculiar inside-cylinders/outside <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> and <b>valve</b> gear) was taken. Results were highly successful, and subsequently almost all steam locomotives in Italy would be built with simple expansion and superheating.|$|R
50|$|Johannes Klais studied organ {{building}} in Alsace, Switzerland and Southern Germany. He founded his own {{organ building}} workshop in Bonn in 1882. His way of building organs was closely {{bound up with}} traditional construction methods using slider windchests. But as early as {{before the turn of}} the century he built high pressure stops with two mouths on pneumatic cone <b>valve</b> <b>chests.</b> In 1906, together with his son Hans, he introduced electric action. Hans Klais took over in 1925. In his time facade design began to come under the influence of the modern age, ergonomic console designs were also being developed. Hans Gerd Klais, the founder's grandson, took charge in 1965. Philipp Klais, the great-grandson of the founder, studied organ building in Alsace, France; in Germany; and overseas. He now runs the company.|$|R
50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop valves and governor valves are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the H.P. casing.|$|R
50|$|Steam feed {{is taken}} {{from the bottom of}} the boiler and {{directly}} to the <b>valve</b> <b>chest</b> housing the semi-rotative valve. This consists of a brass rod, cross drilled with two holes at right angles to each other, a small distance apart. The outside end of the rod has a crank, linked to a crank on the engine crankshaft, so that it rocks back and forth by about 90 degrees. This causes the two holes to alternately line up with the steam and exhaust passages.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{installation}} of a house-built beam engine spanned four floors. The cylinder and the engine driver's usual working position were located in the 'bottom chamber', approximately at ground level. Above this were the 'middle chamber', with the cylinder top cover and 'top nozzle' (the upper <b>valve</b> <b>chest),</b> and above that the 'top chamber' or beam chamber. The cataracts were located in the lowest part of the engine house, in a chamber below the bottom chamber, along with the exhaust pipe. This space was awkward to access and not visited in normal operation.|$|E
50|$|The smokebox {{incorporates}} the main steam pipes from the regulator (or superheater header), one leading to each <b>valve</b> <b>chest,</b> {{a part of}} the cylinder casting. These may pass through the smokebox wall to join with the cylinder (outside steam pipes) or may stay within the profile of the smokebox (inside steam pipes). Inside steam pipes do not require lagging as the smokebox keeps them warm, but outside steam pipes are more common for locomotives with cylinders outside the frames. Some locomotive classes used both types depending on the date the batch was constructed (e.g. LNER Class V2).|$|E
50|$|Digital organs {{may also}} {{incorporate}} simulated models of Swell boxes which mimic the environmental effects on pipes, pipe <b>chest</b> <b>valve</b> release, and other pipe organ characteristics. These effects are often {{added to the}} computer sound generation in modern digital organs to create more-realistic pipe organ tone.|$|R
50|$|Pipe organ {{manufacturing}} in Hardheim has existed since 1855, when organ-builder Ignaz Dörr startet his own workshop. In 1958 Orgelbaumeister Hans Theodor Vleugels (born 1931) took over Maximilian Bader's workshop {{and two years}} later his brother's Wilhelm Bader. From 1960 to 1966 Paul Mund and Hans Theodor Vleugels led the company together. In 1967 Hans Theodor Vleugels founded the Orgelbau-Vleugels GmbH. While following traditional south German models, the company initially built instruments incorporationg modern technologies such as electric stop action. Cases had very contemporary designs, such as the organ in Cologne-Gremberg, set on a mushroom-shaped concrete pedestal, or in another organ that has free hanging steel frame with plexiglass used for the swell box and rollerboards, thus enabling a free view into the workings of the instrument. During the 1970s the firm abandoned the use of tropical woods and laminates in favour of solid woods, and electric action likewise was discarded in favor of mechanical action. While continuing to build new organs in the 1980s the firm began to devote attention to the restoration of older instruments, including organs of the South German Baroque, and Romantic instruments with <b>valve</b> <b>chests</b> and pneumatic actions. in 1988 the company moved into a large, open, and modern shop; that same year, Hans-Georg Vleugels (born in Stuttgart in 1958) became director of the firm. In 1991 Hans-Georg Vleugels took over the company chair and currently runs the company together with his son Johannes D.C. Vleugels (born 1983) {{in the second and third}} generation. Today there are three generations of master pipe organ builders in the Vleugels family working together.|$|R
