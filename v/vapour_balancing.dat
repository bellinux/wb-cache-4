40|$|In {{this study}} {{ventilation}} rates for a naturally ventilated Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe {{were determined by}} both a tracer aerosol technique using atomized NaCl particles as the tracer and an integrating nephelometer to monitor the decay of the aerosol particles’ concentration in the greenhouse and the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> method. Comparison of the results showed that, although the tracer aerosol method suffers {{from some of the}} typical problems of tracer techniques in general (like the need for uniform concentration of the tracer), it gave comparable results with the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> method, while overcoming the difficulty of the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> of scaling up from single (or few) plant(s) to whole canopy transpiration. The M 903 Radiance Research portable nephelometer is a lightweight, low-power instrument, and costs about US, 000, while the nebulizer costs less than US, 000. In comparison with the high cost of gas analyzers (up to US, 000 for most CO 2 and N 2 O analyzers) and the additional high costs and unavailability of the tracers, the method offers a cost-effective way of measuring ventilation rates in a greenhouse. For measuring leakage ventilation rates, however, the tracer aerosol technique failed to provide useful results...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the data of}} 10 days of Jan. 1957 were {{analysed}} to examine the validity of water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> in the atmosphere. It is demonstrated that precipitation over the North Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the continents with the sufficient number of observation stations along their coastal line, can be estimated from the consideration of the energy balance among evaporation from the sea surface, transport of the atmospheric water vapour, and the precipitation. The estimated precipitation distribution was compared with the low cloud distribution which may {{be considered to be}} a fairly good indicator of precipitation. And also the relationship between precipitation and the mean vertical velocity on the 850 mb, 700 mb and 500 mb was examined. It is concluded that the precipitation has a close relationship with the low cloud amount, but a meaningful relation between precipitation and the mean vertical velocity was not detected...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{greenhouse}} ventilation model, {{based on}} the stack and wind effects (the main driving forces for natural ventilation) was adapted, calibrated and validated using measured air renewal rates in a three span naturally ventilated Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Crop transpiration rates were monitored using stem heat balance sap flow gauges installed on the main stems of rose plants to continuously monitor whole-plant transpiration (WPT). This allowed continuous and automatic determination of full scale air renewal and leakage rates using the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> method. The model was fitted to experimental data of ventilation rates, and discharge and wind effect coefficients were determined. The results show a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 80 and 0. 82 for winter and summer, respectively), {{although there is a}} general over-estimation of the greenhouse air renewal rates, particularly during the night. The model, nevertheless, adequately describes the natural ventilation process in the greenhouse all year round. The model {{can be used as a}} design tool to evaluate and optimise the effects of different ventilation configurations and strategies on greenhouse air renewal rates, and as a component in a greenhouse climate model in order to further evaluate the effects of ventilation strategies on the inside greenhouse and crop microclimate, and thus lead to better greenhouse climate control...|$|R
40|$|While thermal {{structures}} such as greenhouses {{are complex}} to model under transient conditions because of coupled heat and mass (H 2 O and CO 2) exchanges between their different parts, systems theory allows a simple analysis of the input/output behaviour of the model. In particular, parameters of the reduced dynamic models {{can be derived from}} in-situ measurements on these systems. This paper describes an application of the systems approach to a greenhouse climate model which incorporates CO 2 balance, crop transpiration and photosynthesis and the effects of heating, CO 2 enrichment, natural ventilation and evaporative cooling. In a first stage, system parameters such as the equivalent thermal mass, the wind dependent coefficient of natural ventilation and the various heat exchange coefficients were identified in situ from sequences of input-output data concerning the heat and water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance,</b> recorded over the crop production period from December to July. Good agreement between measured and computed values of air temperature, air humidity was observed. In a second stage, we have considered simultaneously the sensible heat, water vapour and CO 2 exchanges and tested the model against experimental data measured using a commercial greenhouse climate control computer. The identified values of the physical and physiological parameters are close the theoretical values and the accuracy of temperature, humidity and CO 2 content is rather good...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{solar drying}} {{requires}} that the drying rate, {{as a function of}} the environment and the control, is quantitatively known. A solar drying installation for waste-water sludge in Füssen, Germany, designed by Thermo-System ® and the University of Hohenheim, has been used to collect data for the establishment of a drying-rate function. In this solar dryer, wet sludge is uniformly spread over a concrete floor under a greenhouse-like transparent cover. The sludge is intermittently mixed by means of a autonomous robot (electric mole®), while the air under the cover is ventilated (horizontally) and mixed (vertically) by electric fans. Data of evaporation rate, environmental conditions and control operations were collected over three drying cycles. Evaporation rate via sludge sampling and via <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> across the structure compared favourably, justifying the use of the hourly vapour-balance data to develop linear regression and non-linear neural network (NN) models to predict the evaporation rate. The most important predictors of evaporation turn out to be (1) outdoor solar radiation (2) outdoor air temperature, and (3) the ventilation flux. The dry solids content of the sludge is next in importance, but could not be quantified with confidence over the domain, for lack of sufficient data. Air-mixing is an order of magnitude less effective than ventilation. The experimental design did not include different rates of sludge mixing...|$|R
40|$|In a {{reaction}} to the demand of horticulturists and manufacturers for an assesment of the impact of innovative measures that intend to save energy, we quantified the heat and vapour fluxes of a typical Dutch greenhouse to test the impact of these measures on the inside temperature, humidity and the insulation value of the building. We did so by developing a steady state model based on the relevant heat- and <b>vapour</b> <b>balances.</b> Effects that are notably included are condensation and the interdependence of the plant temperature, plant transpiration, radiation and humidity. The model seems to compare well to measurements, although error limits have to be established before definite claims can be made. To showcase the functionality of the model, we tested the impact of changing the coverage fraction of a mobile insulation thermal screen, installed just below the glass roof. The results show that, at night, with a screen coverage of up to 84 %, the insulation value will increase 19 % without increasing the relative humidity. Full screen coverage leads to an additional 32 % increase in the insulation value of the greenhouse, but this comes at the cost of a 6 % increase in relative humidity, increasing the risk of condensation on the plant. The model in its current form presents numerous opportunities for testing the impact of perturbations in the existing Dutch greenhouse design, material properties and heating regimes and it can easily be adapted to test the impact of new ones...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the water}} <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the ventilation rate to calibrate and validate the ventilation sub-model of the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) in a naturally ventilated three span Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Two ventilation strategies were considered to investigate their effects on the microclimate and transpiration of the rose crop: the configuration with roof vents only (while the side vents were closed) and the configuration with both roof vents and side vents. Crop transpiration was evaluated using the Penman-Monteith method. This allowed continuous and automatic determination of the ventilation rate and leakage rate using the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> method. The model was fitted to experimental data for ventilation rates, and the parameters for the model, the discharge and wind effect coefficient were determined using statistical analysis. The results showed that there was a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 702 and 0. 729 for the model of ventilation for the greenhouse operating respectively with both roof and side vents and with roof vents only for the summer period considered), although there was a general overestimation of the air renewal rates, particularly during the night. The air renewal rate was found to be influenced by the ventilation regime in practice. The greenhouse was found to have higher air renewal rates for the configuration with both roof and side vents. On a typical hot day, the maximum simulated air renewal rate was 15. 6 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof and side vents at 1600 hrs, while it was only 6. 5 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof vents at the same time. The difference between the air renewal rates for the different regimes resulted in different microclimates, since the ventilation affects both the energy balance and mass balance of a greenhouse. The greenhouse inside air temperature was reduced significantly for the configuration with both roof and side vents as it had lower simulated air temperatures than the configuration with roof vents only. On a typical hot day the maximum simulated air temperature for the configuration with roof and side vents was 29. 7 ÂºC, while it was 31. 5 ÂºC for roof vents configuration at 1400 hrs. On typical selected days the maximum differences between the inside air temperature and the external air temperature were 3. 7 ÂºC and 4. 6 ÂºC for the configuration with both roof and side vents and the configuration with roof vents only, respectively. Thus during summer periods it is necessary to have a greenhouse with both roof and side vents so that plants will have a better physiological and morphological development, as the air renewal rates influence crop behaviour largely through their effects on gas exchanges, particularly transpiration and photosynthesis. The transpiration of the rose crop was found to be influenced by the ventilation strategy. The simulated maximum canopy transpiration flux density was 166. 5 W m- 2 for the configuration with both roof and side vents, while it was 152. 9 Wm- 2 for the roof vents only on a selected hot day. The simulated night-time relative humidities were higher for the configuration with roof vents only. The simulated relative humidity was above 90 % for the configuration with roof vents only, while it was 84 % for the configuration with both roof and side vents. To prevent excessive humidity build up, the ventilation strategy with both roof and side vents needs to be employed in order to prevent condensation in the greenhouse...|$|R

The predominant process for CO 2 capture currently employed by industry is chemical absorption in amine solutions. A dynamic model for the de-absorption process was developed with monoethanolamine (MEA) solution. Henry's law was used for modelling the vapour phase equilibrium of the CO 2, and fugacity ratios calculated by the Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) were used for H 2 O, MEA, N- 2 and O- 2.

40|$|The main {{sources of}} water vapour in a {{greenhouse}} are plant transpiration and the evaporation of water from soil (evapotranspiration). These processes are influ- enced by environmental factors such as solar radiation and water vapour pressure deficit, {{as shown by the}} Penman-Monteith equation. Most previous studies have been conducted in Northern countries and with soiless crops, which means that they only refer to transpiration. In Mediterranean greenhouses many crops are still grown on soil, so evaporation adds another component to the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance.</b> The purpose of this study was: 1 – to measure the evapotranspiration (soil and crop) and transpiration (crop), of a tomato crop grown on a heavy soil using a lysi- meter; 2 – to develop models {{as a function of the}} inside solar radiation and water vapour pressure deficit; 3 – to validate the models using data from different days and 4 - to compare the models. Experiments were conducted in a Mediterranean unheated greenhouse covered with co-extruded PE-EVA-PE film, with a soil grown tomato crop, located in Lisbon. The orientation was east-west and ventilation was achieved by continuous apertures located on the side walls over its entire length. Trickle ferti-irrigation tubes were located between each two rows of plants. Climatic parameters, such as dry and wet bulb air temperatures, crop and leaf temperatures and solar radiation were measured and recorded using a data logger. Information on the evolution of the crop was also recorded. To compute evapotranspiration and transpiration a lysimeter was used and data of irrigation, drainage and soil moisture content were recorded. For the evalua- tion of the transpiration, the lysimeter was covered with a plastic film to prevent evaporation from the soil. To develop the models, data were recorded over periods of several days at different stages of plant development and another set of data from different periods was used for model validation. Comparison between measured and estimated data shows good agreement for both models. Differences between transpiration and evapo- transpiration were very small, which reveals that, under the conditions experienced, evaporation from the soil can be neglected when trickle ferti-irrigation is used...|$|R
40|$|In {{building}} physics applications, mainly {{related to}} the building energy performance simulations, the master equation is the inner air energy balance equation. Historically the followed approach in writing down such master equation was to adopt the simplifying hypothesis of incompressible fluid for the air assumed dry. This hypothesis, among others, reduces the general integral energy balance equation to the usual formulation which is reported in textbooks and manuals and {{has been used in}} available energy simulation programs, such as Energy Plus, Esp-r, TRNSYS, etc. Later the moist air problem, the indoor air humidity control, has been faced just by adding a new integral balance equation: the water <b>vapour</b> mass <b>balance</b> equation. In this work it is pointed out how this "layered" historical approach leads to a paradox: an incompressible fluid is used to describe an ideal gas in an ideal gas mixture. Herewith the general integral energy balance equation is directly written in terms of moist air under ideal gas hypothesis and it is shown how, under acceptable specific hypothesis, it is possible to obtain a similar but conceptually different final formulation, which mainly differs in the transient storage term...|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with the 'Chemikaliengesetz' ('Chemicals Act'), parameters have to be developed {{for the evaluation of}} the environmental behaviour {{as well as for the}} risk assessment of substances. One of these parameters is the vapour pressure, which is measured by two different standard methods according to EC and OECD regulations. For the determination of small vapour pressures of substances, the gravimetric method is frequently applied using a <b>vapour</b> pressure <b>balance.</b> For that purpose, the substance investigated is evaporated from an effusion-cell under high vacuum conditions and a certain part of the evaporating material is condensed on the surface of a cooled scale. Knowing the rate of condensation, the equilibrium vapour pressure can be calculated. In this work, a new computerized system has been developed, using a quartz crystal microbalance instead of a conventional mechanical balance. The main advantage of this new instrument is the significantly increased mass sensitivity of 10 ng per Hertz and the lack of interferences caused by vibrations. Hence it is possible, to measure a vapour pressure as low as 10 "-" 5 Pascal accurately, which means an improvement in sensitivity over a factor of 100 compared to mechanical balances in use. (orig.)

40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis {{was part of}} a larger project aiming at the design of a greenhouse and an associated climate control that achieves optimal crop production with sustainable instead of fossil energy. This so called solar greenhouse design extends a conventional greenhouse with an improved roof cover, ventilation with heat recovery, a heat pump, a heat exchanger and an aquifer. This thesis describes the design of an optimal control strategy for the solar greenhouse, to ensure that the benefits of this innovative greenhouse are exploited in the best possible way. The ingredients of an optimal control design are a dynamic model for greenhouse and crop, an explicitly formulated cost function, and a solution method. The advantages of this systematic approach are that scientific knowledge concerning the greenhouse and the crop is fully exploited, and with a goal that is stated in clear and transparent quantitative terms, it computes the best possible control. Furthermore it gives flexibility because the control is automatically adjusted when economic or other factors determining the cost function are changed. The control objectives used here are: minimize gas use and maximize crop yield, development and quality. Since the optimal control fully relies on the cost function and the dynamic model, this model must give a good description of the system response for a wide range of temperature and humidity conditions. The first major contribution of this thesis is the development of a comprehensive, science-based, dynamic model of the greenhouse-with-crop system in a form that is suitable for optimal control purposes. The model describes the temperature, the carbondioxide balance and the water <b>vapour</b> <b>balance</b> in the greenhouse, as a function of the external inputs (i. e. the outdoor weather conditions) and the control inputs (e. g. valve positions and window apertures). This model has been validated with data, and was found to give a good description of reality. The second major contribution of this thesis is the design of the optimal controller, including an efficient solution technique. A conjugate gradient search is used as the ultimate fine-tuning method, but it has the risk of achieving local minima, and it is time consuming. Therefore, a grid search method has been designed to provide a good initial guess for the gradient search method. This method uses only a small number of discrete constant control trajectories, which are then modified with rule based state dependent control input bounds to obtain initial control trajectories. Receding horizon optimal control has been used for year-round computations of the solar greenhouse with crop. Extensive analyses have been made of the effect of various components of the solar greenhouse system and of the uncertainty in weather. Growers should be aware that setting tighter humidity bounds increases energy use. It was found that in the optimally controlled solar greenhouse, gas use can be seriously reduced (by 52 %), while the crop production is significantly increased (by 39 %), as compared to an optimally controlled conventional greenhouse without the solar greenhouse elements...|$|R
40|$|Building in {{cold climate}} zones {{requires}} a high insulation thickness {{and a good}} protection against interstitional condensation. Applying vapour tight membranes {{on both sides of}} a roof construction offers no drying potential in case of leakages or initial moisture. Therefore the use of slightly permeable membranes at the interior side is often preferred because they allow condensed or existent moisture to dry out. However, drying to the interior space will only happen if the solar heat gains of the roof are high enough to inverse the vapour flow for a sufficient time period. This paper looks to the climate limits of building flat roofs with moderately permeable <b>vapour</b> retarders. The <b>balance</b> of interstitial condensation and subsequent drying is investigated using an adapted hygrothermal simulation tool for heat and moisture transport in building components. For the simulations a black surfaced flat roof construction with mineral fibre insulation and moderate vapour retarder is considered. Special interest is set on the drying potential in relation to the building's location in Northern climate zones. The results can be shown by two limit lines around the North Pole, one for vapour retarders with a constant permeability and the other for those with humidity controlled permeability. These lines are not parallel to the Arctic Circle. They reflect the regional climate conditions which are influenced by the Gulf Stream and other meteorological phenomena...|$|R
40|$|In steady, fully {{developed}} and unventilated cavity flows occurring in practice, air (originally dissolved in the water) and heat are diffused through the fluid towards the interface providing a continuous supply {{of air and}} vapour to the cavity. This must be balanced by the rate of entrainment of volume of air and vapour away from the cavity in the wake. These equilibria which determine respectively the partial pressure of air within the cavity and the temperature differences involved in the flow are studied in this paper. The particular case of the cavitating flow past a spherical headform has been investigated in detail. Measurements indicate a near-linear relation between the partial pressure of air in the cavity and the total air content of the water. From {{a second set of}} experiments, designed to estimate the volume rates of entrainment under various conditions by employing artificial ventilation, it appears that this is a function only of tunnel speed and cavity size within the range of the experiments. A simplified theoretical approach involving the turbulent boundary layer {{on the surface of the}} cavity is then used to estimate the rates of diffusion into the cavity. The resulting air balance yields a partial pressure of air/air content relation compatible with experiment. The water <b>vapour</b> or heat <b>balance</b> suggests that the temperature differences involved are likely to be virtually undetectable experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Nest {{humidity}} is {{a function}} of how water vapour is retained within the nest. Previous analysis suggested that in general, nest humidity was largely unaffected by ambient humidity but there was no consideration of the type of nest involved. This study examined data collected from the literature to test the hypothesis that the relationship between nest and ambient humidity {{is a function}} of the type of nest. Data for water vapour pressure for the egg (PE), nest (PN) and ambient air (PA) were collected for 48 examples of nests from 44 species of bird from a range of Orders. Initial egg mass and water vapour conductance of the eggshell was also recorded for each species. Analysis showed that birds on scrape nests are able to raise PN above PA by on average 5 Torr irrespective of PA. By contrast, PN in cup nests was unaffected by PA, such that at low values nests are well insulated against water <b>vapour</b> loss. The <b>balance</b> between the proportion of water vapour lost from the egg to the ambient air that is controlled by the nest varied with the type of nest and PA. For eggs in scrape nests mass specific water vapour conductance showed a positive relationship with PA. By contrast, for eggs in cup nests the relationship was negative and under conditions of low PA the high PN means that mass specific shell conductance values have to be high so as to ensure the appropriate rate of weight loss from the egg. Whilst birds do not control nest humidity directly the inter-relationship between weight loss from an egg, its initial mass, its shell conductance, and the incubation period can now be extended to include the water vapour conductance of the nest wall...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} monitoring and modelling transport of gaseous pollutants in soils. The {{knowledge of the}} gas transport processes is important in soil remediation projects such as (bio) venting, and soil vapour extraction. An important aspect of these soil venting remediation techniques is the risk for VOC emissions to the atmosphere. Most of the models describe the gas flow for these remediation projects based on the convection-dispersion model. In this dissertation two rapid measurement devices were described to measure some of {{the parameters of the}} convection-dispersion equation. With the proposed devices, the effective air-filled porosity, the soil gas diffusion coefficient and soil gas dispersion coefficient can be measured automatically preventing the need to use approximate pedotransfer functions. In a next phase, a sensor device for in-situ, passive concentration measurements in the soil gas phase was developed. The prototype measured the O 2 and CO 2 concentration and an equivalent concentration of a broad range of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the soil <b>vapour</b> phase. Mass <b>balances</b> of the volatile organic compound in a column test measured with the prototype have illustrated successfully the performance of the sensor in soil systems with a recovery that ranged from 90 to 101 % of the injected decane mass. The data generated by the devices was used to develop a predictive modelling system for the determination of the VOC emission towards the surface. The method assimilated sensor readouts in gas transport models to predict soil gas concentration profiles and emissions to the atmosphere during operation. During a column test, an increasing set of sensor gas concentration data became available for the continuous adaptive improvement of the model parameter estimates. The VOC concentrations near the soil surface and the associated VOC emission rates to the atmosphere were predicted with an accuracy ranging from 60 to 86 % depending on the number of sensors and their placing. The positioning of sensors near the contaminant source and near the soil surface was found to be optimal for fast and accurate prediction of VOC concentrations at the soil surface and in emissions. It was, therefore, concluded the predictive model could be used to control soil venting remediation techniques for optimisation with strict VOC emission control...|$|R
40|$|Pool boiling {{experiments}} in microgravity {{on the small}} copper plate of 1 cm² have been performed in the SOURCE 2 experiment aboard the sounding Rocket Maser 12 launched on February 13 th, 2012. The SOURCE 2 experiment is a small-scale tank devoted {{to the study of}} heat and mass transfers with a liquid refrigerant HFE 7000 pressurised with its vapour. SOURCE 2 (SOUnding Rocket Compere Experiment) was developed in the frame of a French German space programme COMPERE (on the behaviour of propellant in launcher tanks) managed by CNES and DLR and a MAP ESA Project "Multiscale Analysis of boiling". During the 6 minutes of the flight different physical phenomena were studied by our partners: ZARM, University of Bremen, Air Liquide and Astrium. The boiling experiment was performed in a 6 cm diameter and 28 cm long cylindrical tank partly filled with a refrigerant Novec HFE 7000 with a low boiling point (34 °C at 1 bar) and pressurized by its own vapour. The heating element used for the boiling investigation consisted of an electrical resistance heated by Joule effect in contact with a flux-meter and a copper plate with a thickness of 40 micrometres. The flux-meter was equipped with two thermocouples. It was then possible to measure {{at the same time the}} heat flux transmitted to the liquid and the wall temperature. The liquid temperature above the heater was measured by 5 micro thermocouples located in the vicinity of the wall. Images of the boiling phenomenon were recorded by a video camera through the transparent cylindrical wall of the tank. SOURCE 2 is in the continuity of the SOURCE 1 experiment, which flew successfully on Maser 11 on 15 May 2008 (Kannengieser et al. 2010). The experiment scenario was similar to the present case. However, in SOURCE 1, liquid HFE- 7000 was pressurized by gaseous nitrogen. The lateral glass wall was preheated and a strong evaporation took place at the free surface in the vicinity of the wall. Due to the presence of nitrogen a strong Marangoni convection occurred at the free surface enhancing nitrogen dissolution in the liquid phase. Then during the boiling experiment, the bubble growth was due to liquid vaporization and nitrogen desorption. Marangoni convection also occurred at the bubble interface leading to a capillary force pushing the bubble to the heated wall. In the SOURCE 2 experiment, a single specie configuration is studied (liquid/vapour HFE 7000). This changes the thermo-hydraulic behaviour of the system. Since no Marangoni convection kept the bubble in contact with the heated wall, a primary bubble detached and grew by feeding itself with the smaller bubbles formed over the heated surface. The change in the bubble size is only due to vaporization. Then the measurements of the heat flux transferred to the fluid by the heater could be directly correlated to the amount of <b>vapour</b> production (<b>balance</b> of evaporation and re-condensation) that could be evaluated from visualization and image processing. When the rocket was launched, the test cell was empty. The top part and the lateral glass wall of the test cell were preheated before launch. Just before the microgravity period, the tank filling began, liquid HFE 7000 at 25 °C was injected in the tank by the pump and pressurized by hot vapour HFE 7000. At the beginning of the boiling experiment, the tank pressure was reduced to 1. 5 bars and the heating of the heater element was switch on and boiling started. During this period, it was planed to study boiling with high sub-cooled liquid then to decrease the pressure to 1 bar to study saturated boiling. However while pressurization with hot vapour HFE 7000, strong condensation occurred that rapidly warmed up HFE 7000 up to 40 °C during boiling study. As a consequence, at 1. 5 bars, the sub-cooling was limited to 5 degrees. Then the tank pressured was reduced to 1. 3 bars to investigated boiling in saturated conditions. On the other hand, before launch, tests were performed on ground and boiling curves were plotted. In this paper we will attend to compare the results obtained in micro-gravity and in 1 G. ...|$|R
