5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, since the fall of Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one <b>vanishing</b> <b>point,</b> in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E
5|$|Mathematics can {{be discerned}} {{in many of}} the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly {{associated}} with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of descriptive geometry, now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the <b>vanishing</b> <b>point</b> were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} derivation of the geometric relation between <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> and camera parameters of central catadioptric camera systems. These <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> correspond to the three mutually orthogonal directions of 3 D real world coordinate system (i. e. X, Y and Z axes). Compared to <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> (VPs) in the perspective projection, the advantages of VPs under central catadioptric projection are that there are normally two <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> for each set of parallel lines, since lines are projected to conics in the catadioptric image plane. Also, their <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> are usually located inside the image frame. We show that knowledge of the VPs corresponding to XYZ axes from a single image can lead to simple derivation of both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the central catadioptric system. This derived novel theory is demonstrated and tested on both synthetic and real data with respect to noise sensitivity...|$|R

5000|$|Because <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> {{exist only}} when {{parallel}} lines {{are present in}} the scene, a perspective with no <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> ("zero-point" [...] perspective) occurs if the viewer is observing a non-linear scene containing no parallel lines. The most common example of such a nonlinear scene is a natural scene (e.g., a mountain range) which frequently does not contain any parallel lines.

40|$|Camera {{calibration}} is {{a fundamental}} task in photogrammetry and computer vision. This paper presents an approach for the automatic estimation of interior orientation from images with three <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> of orthogonal directions. Extraction of image line segments and their clustering into groups corresponding to three dominant <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> are performed without any human interaction. Camera parameters (camera constant, location of principal point, and two coefficients of radial lens distortion) and the <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> are estimated in a one-step adjustment of all participating image points. The approach may function in a single image mode, but is also capable of handling input from independent images (i. e. images not necessarily of the same object) with three and/or two <b>vanishing</b> <b>points</b> in a common solution. The reported experimental tests indicate that, within certain limits, results from single images compare satisfactorily with those from multi-image bundle adjustment.
