In order to develop a GI norovirus vaccine, Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> <b>vectors,</b> rLaSota and modified rBC, were used to express VP 1 protein of Norwalk virus. Co-expression of VP 1 and VP 2 proteins by Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> resulted in enhanced expression of Norwalk virus VP 1 protein and self-assembly of VP 1 protein into virus-like particles. Furthermore, the Norwalk virus-specific IgG response induced in mice by Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> was similar to that induced by baculovirus-expressed virus-like particles in mice. However, the modified rBC vector in the presence of VP 2 protein induced significantly higher levels of cellular and mucosal immune responses than those induced by baculovirus-expressed VLPs. These results indicate that Newcastle disease virus has great potential for developing a live Norwalk virus vaccine by inducing humoral, cellular and mucosal immune responses in humans...|$|R

40|$|Recombinant canarypox <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> {{containing}} {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) sequences are promising vaccine candidates, as they replicate poorly in human cells. However, when delivered intramuscularly the vaccines have induced inconsistent {{and in some cases}} transient antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses in seronegative volunteers. An attractive way to enhance these responses would be to target canarypox virus to professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs). We studied (i) the interaction between canarypox virus and DCs and (ii) the T-cell responses induced by DCs infected with canarypox <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> containing HIV- 1 genes. Mature and not immature DCs resisted the cytopathic effects of canarypox virus and elicited strong effector CD 8 + T-cell responses from chronically infected HIV+ individuals, e. g., cytolysis, and secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and β-chemokines. Furthermore, canarypox virus-infected DCs were > 30 -fold more efficient than monocytes and induced responses that were comparable to those induced by vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> or peptides. Addition of exogenous cytokines was not necessary to elicit CD 8 + effector cells, although the presence of CD 4 + T cells was required for their expansion and maintenance. Most strikingly, canarypox virus-infected DCs were directly able to stimulate HIV-specific, IFN-γ-secreting CD 4 helper responses from bulk as well as purified CD 4 + T cells. Therefore, these results suggest that targeting canarypox <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> to mature DCs could potentially elicit both anti-HIV CD 8 + and CD 4 + helper responses in vivo...|$|R

Single-stranded vector genomes survive in stationary cultures and can be recruited for transduction by stimulating these cultures to divide. Stable transductants contain randomly integrated vector sequences. These findings {{have important implications for}} the use of adeno-associated <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> in gene therapy...|$|R

50|$|A subunit vaccine {{presents}} an antigen to {{the immune system}} without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins can be denatured and will then become associated with antibodies different from the desired antibodies. A second method of making a subunit vaccine involves putting an antigen's gene from the targeted virus or bacterium into another virus (<b>virus</b> <b>vector),</b> yeast (yeast vector) {{in the case of}} the hepatitis B vaccine or attenuated bacterium (bacterial vector) to make a recombinant virus or bacteria to serve as the important component of a recombinant vaccine (called a recombinant subunit vaccine). The recombinant vector that is genomically modified will express the antigen. The antigen (one or more subunits of protein) is extracted from the vector. Just like the highly successful subunit vaccines, the recombinant-vector-produced antigen will be of little to no risk to the patient. This is the type of vaccine currently in use for hepatitis B, and it is experimentally popular, being used to try to develop new vaccines for difficult-to-vaccinate-against viruses such as ebolavirus and HIV.|$|E
5000|$|X.diversicaudatum, {{like many}} other species of dagger nematode, has a wide host range, {{with some of the}} more {{extensively}} studied ones including: strawberries, hops and roses. Other documented hosts include: grapevine, raspberry, apple, asparagus, cabbage, carrot, cherry, red clover, peach. [...] The nematode itself inflicts direct damage to plants roots as it penetrates at its preferred feeding site just behind the root tip. [...] Its long stylet enables it to reach into the vascular system of the plant causing local necrosis and hypertrophy. [...] This feeding action prompts the formation of galls on lateral roots, in turn leading to a stunted root system. [...] Above ground symptoms may not always be present in low-level infections but could include: reduced vigor, and chlorosis of leaves. [...] It is often not just the presence of nematodes that is a concern but it is their ability to serve as a <b>virus</b> <b>vector,</b> in this case for the arabis mosaic virus. The odontophore and esophagus are lined with cuticle, which has been shown to retain virus particles as a monolayer. These particles can then be shed with the cuticular lining as the nematode progresses through its normal life cycle. [...] The vectoring capability of X.diversicaudatum {{has been shown to be}} specific to arabis mosaic virus as no particles were absorbed by the cuticular lining when feeding on plants infected with grapevine fanleaf virus or raspberry ringspot virus.

40|$|Hemophilia A and B are {{coagulation}} disorders {{resulting from}} the loss of functional coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX proteins, respectively. Gene therapy for hemophilia with adeno-associated <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> has shown efficacy in hemophilia B patients. Although hemophilia A patients are more prevalent, the development of therapeutic adeno-associated <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> has been impeded {{by the size of the}} F 8 cDNA and impaired secretion of FVIII protein. Further, it has been reported that over-expression of the FVIII protein induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and activates the unfolded protein response pathway both in vitro and in hepatocytes in vivo, presumably due to retention of misfolded FVIII protein within the endoplasmic reticulum. Engineering of the F 8 transgene, including removal of the B domain (BDD-FVIII) and codon optimization, now allows for the generation of adeno-associated <b>virus</b> <b>vectors</b> capable of expressing therapeutic levels of FVIII. Here we sought to determine if the risks of inducing the unfolded protein response in murine hepatocytes extend to adeno-associated virus gene transfer.
