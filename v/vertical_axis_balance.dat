40|$|Compared with a drag-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} advantages for a lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines is its higher power coefficient (Cp). However, the lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines is not a self-starting turbine as its starting torque is very low. In order to combine the advantage of both the drag-type and the lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines, a lift drag hybrid <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines was designed in this article and its aerodynamics and starting performance was studied in detail with the aid of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Numerical results indicate that the power coefficient of this lift drag hybrid <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines declines when the distance between its drag-type blades and the center of rotation of the turbine rotor increases, whereas its starting torque can be significantly improved. Studies also show that unlike the lift-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines, this lift drag hybrid-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines could be able {{to solve the problem of}} low start-up torque. However, the installation position of the drag blade is very important. If the drag blade is mounted very close to the spindle, the starting torque of the lift drag hybrid-type <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines may not be improved at all. In addition, it has been found that the power coefficient of the studied <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> wind turbines is not as good as expected and possible reasons have been provided in this article after the pressure distribution along the surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades of the hybrid turbine was analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Adolescent {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{girls are}} known to display standing imbalance. In addition to a motor deficit problem, the axial torsion of the spine and trunk torsion could reflect an imbalance around the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis.</b> Unlike the excursion {{of the center of}} pressure (COP), the forces and moments were rarely addressed to characterize the quiet standing balance. Nonetheless, one dynamical parameter, called free moment (TV), representing the vertical torque on the feet can reflect the oscillation around the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> associated to the standing imbalance. The objectives of this study were to test if the free moment variability can be utilized to characterize standing balance in a group of able-bodied and non-treated scoliotic girls and to determine if it was associated with that of the COP among each group of subjects tested. Forty-six adolescent girls with half of them presenting an adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were tested during quiet standing balance. Standing balance was assessed with the subjects standing upright and bare feet on a force plate. RMS and range of COP excursions and free moment were calculated. The scoliotic group displayed higher variability in COP excursion by about 24 % than the able-bodied girls. Similarly, the TV RMS (P =  0. 00136) and range (P =  0. 00197) were statistically higher by about 42 % in the scoliotic group. The variability of TV was associated with that of the COP in both groups. In the medio-lateral direction, the significant correlations between the RMS and range of the free moment and those of the COP were about 0. 7 for the able-bodied group and 0. 5 for the medio-lateral COP range for the scoliotic group girls. Along the antero-posterior axis, the only statistically significant correlations were observed for the scoliotic group. The free moment variability about the COP measured during quiet standing can be suggestive of an asymmetry control of the trunk around the <b>vertical</b> <b>axis</b> during standing <b>balance.</b> Its variability was more pronounced in scoliotic girls and was associated with the antero-posterior COP variability reflecting both biomechanical and motor control deficits. Free moment calculation could be a supplement insight into the standing balance of scoliotic subjects...|$|R

The paintings and objects within the room, seemingly suspended in the sea of red, establish a sense of spatial depth by creating angles and perspective in an otherwise flat picture.

Most of the objects are painted with whites, blues, and greens, colors that contrast and balance the thinly-applied red paint. There is also a tabletop that dominates the bottom left corner of the canvas, jutting out from the edge as if the viewer were next to it and looking down from a corner of the room. The spatial discontinuities of the table, the objects in the room, the chairs on the right side of the canvas, and the window on the left wall give the sense that this is the artist’s environment, dominated by creativity and color more than laws of natural order.|$|R
