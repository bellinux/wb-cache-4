40|$|The {{compression}} behaviour of soils {{has always}} been a topic of investigation in geotechnical engineering. A study of the compression behaviour of soils with natural structures and with artificially treated structures is made in this paper. The <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> of any structured soil is the summation of the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> of the same soil in a reconstituted state and the additional <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> sustained by the soil structure. This finding provides a useful framework for development of a compression model quantifying the influence of soil structures. Based on this model, a comparative study is performed on the influence of different types of soil structures on the compression behaviour. Therefore, the compressibility is investigated and quantified of soils in different states, such as reconstituted state, natural state, and chemical treated states and cemented state...|$|E
40|$|Field {{compaction}} of sands {{usually involves}} different equipments with the compaction energy varying significantly. The relative density {{is the better}} indicator for specifying the compaction of granular soil. If the relative density can be correlated simply by any index property of the granular soil, it can be more useful in the field. The relative density is {{defined in terms of}} <b>voids</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is well known that the minimum and maximum <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> depend on the mean grain size. However, there is no direct relation available for the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> in terms of grain size. Therefore, in this dissertation, the effect of mean grain size on the relative density of sand has been studied at different compaction energies. In order to arrive at the above, fifty five number of clean sands having D 50 ranges from 0. 34 to 2. 6 mm collected from different river bed of Orissa have been tested in the laboratory. The various index properties like grain specific gravity, grain size distribution of all the samples have been determined. The minimum and maximum <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> have been determined. For determining minimum voids ratio; both wet and dry method have been adopted. The <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> corresponding to energy level of standard, modified, reduced standard, and reduced modified Proctor tests have been correlated with mean grain size and thus the simple nonlinear empirical relations have been developed. Similarly, the relative densities corresponding to the energy level of above mentioned Proctor tests also have been correlated with mean grain size to arrive at simple empirical equations. The percentage deviation of the relative density estimated by the proposed method is in the range of ± 5 % of the measured value. The above correlations of relative densities will be helpful for the design specifications in the field...|$|E

The soil-water retention curve (SWRC) of samples {{with the same}} initial compaction states is obtained in drying and wetting process. At high suctions, the hysteresis behaviour is not obvious in relationship between water content and suction, while the opposite holds between degree of saturation and suction. The suction variation can change its water retention behaviour and <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> Moreover, changes of <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> can bring about changes in degree of saturation. Therefore, the total change in degree of saturation includes changes caused by suction and that by <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> In the space of degree of saturation and suction, the SWRC at constant <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> shifts to the direction of higher suctions with decreasing <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, the relationship between water content and suction is less affected by changes of <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> The degree of saturation decreases approximately linearly with increasing <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> at a constant suction. Moreover, {{the slope of the}} line decreases with increasing suction and they show an approximately linear relationship in semi-logarithmical scale. From this linear relationship, the variation of degree of saturation caused by the change in <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> can be obtained. Correspondingly, SWRC at a constant <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> can be determined from SWRC at different <b>void</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

The general theory of Dewar for particle mixtures and {{the implementation of the}} <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> diagrams of Powers in this theory are explained. The basic water demand of the concrete mixture is derived from the theory of particle mixtures and a consistency prediction model is used to calculate the water demand of the concrete mixture. By using the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> diagrams of Powers, the theory of Dewar for particle mixtures, and a systematic follow up of the parameters of the raw materials, a reliable water prediction model can be obtained. Consequently this model enables to make accurate consistency and strength predictions, which can be used in mix design and mix proportioning in order to steer the concrete production. In this contribution a case study is provided, based on data from Belgian ready mixed concrete plants. The influence of the variation of the mean size and the <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> of the cements, fine and coarse aggregates as well as the variation in grain size distributions on the water demand of the concrete is analyzed. Based on the variation in the constituting materials, the variability of the water demand is estimated based on Monte Carlo simulation techniques.

Multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW) test and standard penetration test was carried out along with soil property measured at 25 locations. The general soil profile varied from silty sand to clay of low compressibility, ground water level fluctuated between 1 - 27 m, depth of borehole varied from 20 - 40 m.

40|$|Samples of two clays and two marls {{consolidated}} or reconstituted {{to various}} initial <b>void</b> <b>ratios</b> {{were left to}} dry to constant volume and the limiting lower value of the <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> at that state, er, was measured. Drying of the initially fully saturated samples of each soil was achieved by leaving the samples under atmospheric conditions. The data presented suggest, at first glance, that limiting lower <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> after drying, er, for each soil increases as the initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> of the soil increases. Normalizing er by the initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> results in the ratio e r/eo increasing as the initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases. Plotting the ratio er/eo for all soils against initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> normalized by the <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> at the liquid limit eL (= wLGs) shows that the results from all soils lie very close to a unique line, which passes through point [eo/eL= 0, er/eo= 1] and has a very high correlation coefficient. This linear relation appears valid for values of eo/eL between 0. 6 and 1. 7. Using the relation between er/eo and e o/eL the limiting lower <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> after drying can be predicted when the initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> of the soil eo (expressing the initial state of the soil) and its liquid limit wL and specific gravity Gs (expressing {{the nature of the}} soil) are known. Also, according to this relation, er exhibits a maximum value as e o increases and then starts to decrease again as eo increases further. The empirical relation derived may be used for the prediction of a mechanical parameter of use to modern constitutive modeling of unsaturated soils such as the limiting lower <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> after drying. It may also be used as a means to study unsaturated soil behavior as far as the evolution of e r with initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> and physical properties of soils is concerned.

For this purpose, two groups of fillers were selected. The first group was pozzolanic fillers (silica fume and metakaolin) while the second group was non-pozzolanic fillers (limestone powder, granite dust and marble dust). Cement contents of 400 kg/m 3 and 500 kg/m 3 were considered while the used filler material was 7. 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. Slump and slump flow, T 50, sieve stability and bleeding tests were performed on fresh concrete. The studied hardened properties included unit weight, <b>voids</b> <b>ratio,</b> porosity, and water absorption and cube compressive strength. In addition, thermo-gravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electronic microscope were performed. The test results showed that filler type and content have significant effect on fresh concrete properties where non-pozzolanic fillers improve segregation and bleeding resistance. Generally, filler type and content have significant effect on unit weight, water absorption and <b>voids</b> <b>ratio.</b> In addition, non-pozzolanic fillers have insignificant negative effect on concrete compressive strength. Finally, there was a good correlation between fresh concrete properties and hardened concrete properties for SCC and Flow-able concrete...|$|E

A functional form that considers all these parameters are too complex and several simplifications were done to assess the shear strength of soil. The most widely used functional form of shear strength is the Mohr–Coulomb equation, which simplify the soil shear strength to depend only on cohesion, internal friction angle, and confining stress [2].|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhile {{the global}} <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> {{has long been}} used as a density index to {{characterize}} sand behavior, concern has been increasing about its applicability to silty sands (sand–fines mixtures), based on the proposition that the fines may fill in the void spaces formed by sand grains and make no contribution to the force transfer. The skeleton <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> was proposed in the literature as an alternative index for mixed soils, {{based on the assumption that}} all fines act as voids. It was further modified into an equivalent skeleton <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> by taking into consideration the fraction of fines that participates in the force transfer. This paper presents a study aimed at evaluating the three state variables as applied to sand–fines mixtures and especially to explore the rationale behind the concept of the skeleton <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> Based on a specifically designed experimental program, it is shown that contrasting conclusions can be drawn as to the role of fines in altering the shear behavior of clean sand when different density indices are used as the comparison basis. When comparisons are made at a constant (global) <b>void</b> <b>ratio,</b> the fines increase the degree of contractiveness, but when comparisons are made at a constant skeleton <b>void</b> <b>ratio,</b> an increase in dilativeness is seen. The equivalent skeleton <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> does not fulfill the intent of providing a universal means for characterizing the stress–strain behavior of silty sands. This is due to the lack of mechanisms to account for the inter-granular contacts which are highly complex. The study suggests that compared with the skeleton <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> and its modified form, the usual (global) <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> remains a simple and useful state variable suitable for the framework of critical state soil mechanics and for geotechnical applications...|$|R

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes {{result in the}} production of silt sized waste materials which may be disposed of by being pumped as a slurry to settling lagoons where the solids settle to form fills which often have a high <b>voids</b> <b>ratio.</b> These are described as hydraulic fills. These processes are commonly found in the coal based power generation and mining and mineral processing industries, amongst others. The geotechnical behaviour of such deposits is of interest with respect to the integrity and safety of the impoundment systems and possible future use and redevelopment of the sites. Such deposits are very difficult to sample and in many cases {{it is almost impossible to}} obtain notionally undisturbed samples, and so it is necessary to prepare samples in the laboratory using techniques which simulate field conditions. The paper describes the results of a series of one dimensional compression tests, up to very high stress levels, on pulverised fuel ash (PFA) and fluorspar mine tailings. Sample preparation methods attempting to recreate the in-situ structure and density are described. The results presented consider the initial 1 -dimensional loading of the initially loose specimens, their unloading response and their creep behaviour. An attempt is made to define the normal consolidation line for these materials and the importance of the initial <b>voids</b> <b>ratio</b> is discussed. A general conceptual model of one dimensional compression behaviour is presented.

40|$|Compressibility {{characteristics}} of a lightweight cemented clay are important issues for deformation analysis. This paper attempts to analyze and assess the compressibility {{characteristics of}} lightweight cemented clays. Three types of clay, kaolin, Bangkok clay and bentonite, representative of non- to high swelling clays are used for this study. It is found that a lightweight cemented clay is stable in the meta-stable state. The <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> of a lightweight cemented clay {{is the sum of}} the <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> sustained by the intrinsic soil fabric (destructured <b>void</b> <b>ratio)</b> and the additional <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> due to cementation. At post yield state, the additional <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> is made of two parts, the part that is inversely proportional to effective vertical stress and the residual additional <b>void</b> <b>ratio,</b> esr, which cannot be eliminated by the increase in effective vertical stress. The esr is mainly dependent upon the mineralogy or soil type (swelling potential). The suggested esr values are approximately 0. 49 for kaolin, 0. 18 for Bangkok clay and 0. 10 for bentonite. The rate of destructuring, b is mainly dependent upon the soil structure (degree of cementation and fabric reflected by the initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> and swelling potential). The relationships between esr versus liquid limit <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> eL and between b versus yield stress, initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> and eL are proposed. Based on the two proposed relationships, a practical (simple and rational) method for assessing the compressibility of lightweight cemented clay with various soil structures is suggested. The prediction method is useful not only for the quick determination of a compression curve with acceptable error, but also for the examination of the test results. •Conduct compression tests on lightweight cemented non- to high swelling clays. •Predict the compression curves using the destructuring framework. •Explain role of water, cement, air and swelling potential on model parameters. •Proposed rational empirical equation to determine the model parameters. •Suggest a practical method to predict the compression curves. © 2013...|$|R

An experimental method is introduced to determine the SWRS and applied to a clayey silty sand. The determination of this surface is based on the measurement of <b>void</b> <b>ratio,</b> suction, and water content along the main drying paths. These paths are established for five different initial states. The experimental results allow us to define the parametric equations of the main drying paths, expressing both water content and <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> as functions of suction and initial <b>void</b> <b>ratio.</b> A model of the SWRS for clayey silty sand is established in the space (<b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> - suction - water content). This surface covers all possible states of the soil inside the investigated range for the three variables. Finally, the SWRS is used to study the relations between water content and suction at a constant <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> and between <b>void</b> <b>ratio</b> and suction at a constant water content...|$|R
