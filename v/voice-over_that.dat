500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna <b>voice-over</b> <b>that</b> warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{explores the}} idea of bare-chested-ness. Should {{everyone}} in a Western society {{be able to walk}} around bare-chested, or just the boys? Is this fair?

5000|$|The film {{does not}} tell a story so much as present an essay-like study of Godard's view of {{contemporary}} life; Godard wrote that [...] "I wanted to include everything: sports, politics, even groceries. Everything should {{be put in a}} film".
