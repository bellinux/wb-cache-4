50|$|The great {{advantage}} of this abstract construction is that, besides being much more relevant to the dynamic analysis, it can be easily converted by algebraic operations into an Input-Output scheme. The coefficients of production of a <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> model are basically a linear combination of the coefficients of production of an Input-Output model. This means {{that it is possible}} to obtain empirical values of the <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> coefficients for an economy. We need only to obtain the values of the production coefficients on each industry (as it is commonly done by the different national account agencies) as well as the capital data at current prices; then we take the transposed inverse matrix of the estimated coefficients and we multiplied it by the vector of capital stocks. This allows us to obtain the vector of <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> capital stock of an industry, a vector that can be seen as a kind of composite good involved in the production of the final commodity considered, which Pasinetti calls unit of <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> productive capacity. A similar procedure is applied with respect to the coefficients of labour. Thus, each final good is summarized in a <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> labour coefficient and a unit of <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> productive capacity.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} if {{vertical separation}} reduces non-price discrimination and increases welfare. Consider an industry {{consisting of a}} <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firm and an independent retailer, which requires access to the <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firm's wholesaler services. The wholesaler can degrade the quality of input it supplies to either of the retailers. Discrimination occurs {{if one of the}} retailers is supplied an input of lower quality than its rival. We show that separation of the <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firm reduces discrimination against the independent retailer, although it does not guarantee no-discrimination. Furthermore, with separation, the wholesaler may discriminate against the <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firm's retailer. Vertical separation impacts social welfare through two e¤ects. First, through the double-marginalization effect, which is negative. Second, through the quality degradation effect, which can be positive or negative. Hence, the net welfare impact of vertical separation is negative or potentially ambiguous. Vertigal integration; Vertical separation; Non-price discrimination. ...|$|R

Increases in cash flow uncertainty encourage firms to <b>vertically</b> <b>integrate</b> and this {{contributes to the}} start of merger waves. These effects are incremental to previously identified causes of wave activity. Our risk management hypothesis is further supported by cross-sectional differences in the likelihood that a firm <b>vertically</b> <b>integrates,</b> and by the post-acquisition characteristics of <b>vertically</b> <b>integrating</b> firms. These results are consistent with the view (from the industrial organization literature) that vertical integration is an operational hedging mechanism that reduces the cost of increased uncertainty.

40|$|In a winner-take-all duopoly for {{systems in}} which firms invest {{to improve their}} products, a <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> {{monopoly}} supplier of an essential system component may {{have an incentive to}} advantage itself by technological tying. If the <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firm is prevented from technologically tying, there is an equilibrium in which the more efficient firm invests and serves the entire market.

40|$|We analyze {{collusion}} in two comparable market structures. In {{the first}} market structure only one firm is vertically integrated; {{there is one}} more independent firm in the upstream industry and another independent firm in the downstream industry. In the second market structure, there are only two <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firms that can trade among themselves in the intermediate good market. The second market structure mimics markets like the California gasoline market where firms <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> through refinery, and retail markets. We rank these two market structures in terms of ease of collusion and show that while under some circumstances collusion is not possible in the market with one <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firm, collusion is possible in the market structure with two <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> firms. We conclude that vertical (multimarket) contact facilitates collusion and vertical mergers suspected to lead to subsequent vertical mergers in an industry should receive higher antitrust scrutiny relative to single isolated vertical mergers.

40|$|Background: Recently, many medical {{curricula}} {{have been}} changed into <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> programmes. One of the aims of vertical integration is to facilitate the transition from theoretical to clinical education and from medical school to postgraduate training. Aims: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether a <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> curriculum affects the transition from medical school to postgraduate training. Method: We carried out a survey study among graduates of two cohorts of the Utrecht Medical School, who followed either the traditional or the innovative, <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated,</b> curriculum. Topics of the questionnaire were: (a) activities since medical school, (b) required amount of time and number of applications to get admitted to residency, (c) the process of making career choices. Results: Graduates from the <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> curriculum had made their definite career choice earlier compared to those who followed a traditional programme. Graduates of the new curriculum also needed less time and fewer applications to obtain a residency position. Conclusions: A <b>vertically</b> <b>integrated</b> curriculum at medical school positively affects the transition to postgraduate training. Additional research, among a larger population, is required to determine which components of the curriculum cause this effect and to specify under which conditions these effect occurs.
