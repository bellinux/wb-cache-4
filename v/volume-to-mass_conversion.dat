40|$|The {{geodetic}} {{method is}} widely used for assessing changes in the mass balance of mountain glaciers. However, comparison of repeated digital elevation models only provides a glacier volume change that must be converted {{to a change in}} mass using a density assumption or model. This study investigates the use of a constant factor for the <b>volume-to-mass</b> <b>conversion</b> based on a firn compaction model applied to simplified glacier geometries with idealized climate forcing, and two glaciers with long-term mass balance series. It is shown that the "density" of geodetic volume change is not a constant factor and is systematically smaller than ice density in most cases. This is explained by the accretion/removal of low-density firn layers, and changes in the firn density profile with positive/negative mass balance. Assuming a value of 850 ± 60 kg m − 3 to convert volume change to mass change is appropriate {{for a wide range of}} conditions. For short time intervals (≤ 3 yr), periods with limited volume change, and/or changing mass balance gradients, the conversion factor can however vary from 0 – 2000 kg m − 3 and beyond, which requires caution when interpreting glacier mass changes based on geodetic surveys...|$|E
30|$|Rats {{were exposed}} to {{phosgene}} (COCl 2) using a directed-flow nose-only inhalation principle [33, 37, 51]. Current testing guidelines give preference to this mode of inhalation exposure [52]. Certified gas standards with specified stability in synthetic air were used in all studies. The gas was contained in 10  L cylinders @ 150  bar. The <b>volume-to-mass</b> <b>conversion</b> factor for phosgene is 1  ppm =  4.1  mg/m 3. Throughout all studies, the exposure period was 30  min. Air flow, temperature, and humidity measurements in the inhalation chamber utilized a computerized data acquisition and control system. The exposure conditions were adjusted to maintain an airflow rate of 0.75  L/min per rat, which is threefold higher than the respiratory minute ventilation of the rat. Under the given conditions, inhalation chamber state–state was attained within the first minute of exposure. The analytical concentrations from the inhalation chamber were {{in agreement with the}} nominally calculated concentrations, which were targeted at 30 – 35  mg phosgene/m 3 (≈ 1000  mg/m 3  × min or ≈ 250  ppm × min). In studies aimed at toxicological endpoints, the characterization of test atmospheres utilized OSHA method no. 61 ([URL] using gas bubblers filled with a toluenic solution of the trapping agent 2 -hydroxymethyl-piperidine (2 -HMP). The resultant analyte was then analyzed by gas chromatography. For mechanistic and intervention studies, actual concentrations were determined in real time using a calibrated Gasmet Dx- 4000 FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) gas analysis system (for details see [URL] The spatial homogeneity and temporal stability of phosgene in exposure atmospheres were controlled in real time [37].|$|E
