50|$|In 2010, Gwynne {{introduced}} the Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Act {{to restrict the}} activities of <b>vulture</b> <b>funds.</b> <b>Vulture</b> <b>funds</b> buy the debts of poor countries, usually at a significant discount, and wait until the government has received relief from foreign creditors.

40|$|The rise of <b>vulture</b> <b>fund</b> {{investing}} in sovereign bonds has created additional hurdles to successful restructuring in an already fragile ad hoc process. Recent litigation in NML Capital, Ltd. v. Argentina has proven courts’ willingness to utilize powers of equity {{to enforce a}} ratable payment interpretation of the pari passu clause—the equal treatment provision commonly found in sovereign bond contracts—creating much uncertainty on how the ruling will affect future restructuring efforts. By looking to the tension in interpretations of the pari passu clause, discrepancies in remedial relief awarded, and international institutions’ proposed solutions, this Note analyzes {{the role of the}} pari passu clause as a tool for holdout creditors to disrupt restructurings. This Note argues for a contractual solution targeted at preventing <b>vulture</b> <b>fund</b> investors from access to pari passu injunctive relief coupled with creative restructuring strategies for outstanding bonds awaiting maturity. This resolution seeks to retain some protection for traditional holdout creditors while disincentivizing investments made with intent to derail restructurings from the start. Unlike debtors in the domestic bankruptcy system, sovereigns have no overarching mechanism to facilitate a successful restructuring when their debt burden becomes unsustainable. Using the pari passu clause as a means to enjoin payment to restructured bondholders leaves sovereign debtors with little recourse but to cede to the demands of holdout creditors and can have a devastating long-term impact on the sovereign’s capacity to rebuild debt sustainability. On the other hand, removing pari passu injunctive relief strips holdout creditors of a valuable enforcement mechanism and can leave sovereigns unrestrained. This Note balances these concerns by advocating for a solution that diminishes vulture creditor leverage that can obstruct a restructuring, while otherwise preserving creditor rights against unfair or coercive exchange terms...|$|E

As such, a country 2 ̆ 7 s ability to restructure its obligations {{in the face}} of severe financial turmoil is paramount to the smooth functioning of its domestic economy, as well as the overall global economy. Most sovereign creditors willingly work with sovereigns to restructure debt {{in the face of}} default. However, distressed-debt funds, often referred to as 2 ̆ 2 vulture funds, 2 ̆ 2 purchase sovereign debt at a discount on the secondary bond market and litigate against the sovereign country to compel a judgment or settlement for up to the full value of the bonds. Such distressed-debt funds have pestered Argentina since its 100 billion default in 2002. Although 93 percent of Argentina 2 ̆ 7 s bondholders restructured their debt, a small group of holdouts chose to litigate to recover the full value of their bonds. Argentina exhausted its appeals and the vulture funds have won a judgment in the United States entitling them to over a billion dollars.

Furthermore, the Comment attempts to demonstrate that the reasoning underpinning the Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision to uphold the district court 2 ̆ 7 s judgment, namely, that the judgment will not undermine future debt restructuring efforts, is based on the flawed premise that nowcommonly utilized Collective Action Clauses (CACs) will prevent vulture funds from holding out in the future.

40|$|Argentina {{is locked}} in battle with {{international}} investors, writes Alexis Sergio Esposto from Swinburne University of Technology.  . Tensions between the country and institutional bondholders reached new highs on October 2, when the Ghanaian government seized the Argentine tall ship ARA Libertad. The ship was prevented from leaving the port of Tema after a Ghanian court upheld a court order {{at the request of}} Argentina’s creditors, led by US hedge fund Elliot Associates, who are suing Buenos Aires over its 2002 bond default. NML Capital, a firm affiliated with Elliot Associates, is currently trying to recoup $ 1. 3 billion of debt from Argentina through the US legal system in New York. The fund was created by Paul Singer, a strong backer of the US Republican Party and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. According to The Guardian, Singer’s money-making strategy involves “buying distressed debt cheaply and selling it at a profit or suing for full payment”. Such speculative financial and profitable operations are performed by hedge or financial funds known as “vulture funds”, which obtain their name because they hover like vultures over the remains of moribund companies or debtor states like Liberia, Peru and Argentina. As such, these funds operate in a highly opportunistic and exploitative manner. According to investigative journalist Greg Palast, they “buy up the debt of the poorest nations on the planet, usually for pennies on the dollar, then sue or use other means to squeeze the nations to pay ten times, even a hundred times, what the <b>vulture</b> <b>fund</b> paid for the debt”. Palast also notes that Liberia was sued to pay $ 20 million to such a sovereign fund — the equivalent of building almost half a million homes in the former war ravaged nation. This practice has cost many African and Latin American nations millions of dollars and created immense social distress. The practice continues to persist unregulated around the world, netting millions of dollars without regard to the social consequences of the most destitute people in the world. Hector Timerman, Argentina’s Foreign Minister, explains at the Huffington Post that “vulture funds” originated in South America and then spread to Sub-Saharan Africa. “In the ‘ 90 s vulture funds took flight and, have since then, landed on the Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo Brazzaville, Liberia, Zambia, Cameroon, Ethiopia secretly acquiring debt at bargain prices. They then waited for debt relief policies from the World Bank, IMF and wealthy nation-states to launch their attack presenting their titles before American and European courts and suing for the full value of the debt”. In 2002, Argentina defaulted on its debt, which had been accumulated as a result of extremely poor economic management by successive governments. A large part of this debt was generated during the military’s dictatorship, which conducted a “dirty war’ between 1976 and 1983 on its political opponents. This was a murderous period which saw the disappearance of nearly 30, 000 political opponents. This was followed by a poorly executed and suicidal war against Britain over the Falklands/Malvinas islands. Between 1983 and 2001, a number of democratic governments managed Argentina following the now discredited neoliberal economic policies based on the Washington Consensus. These policies had catastrophic consequences, amassing billions of dollars in debt. By 2001, Argentina’s debt stood at over $ 100 billion which at the time amounted to 1. 5 times Argentina’s GDP. The debt was so large that Argentina was not even able to pay its interest dues, so it {{had no choice but to}} make the largest default in the world’s financial history. After its default, most of Argentina’s creditors accepted debt restructuring. In 2005 and 2010, as part of the debt restructuring plan, the great majority of bondholders agreed to exchange defaulted debt at very low prices. However, others holders of debt did not, so they sued. “U. S. District Judge Thomas Griesa … ordered Argentina to pay the holdouts, led by Elliott Management Corp’s NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, who rejected the swaps and are fighting for full repayment in the courts”. The order shocked investors and outraged the Argentine government. Argentina’s President, Cristina Kirchner stated that her government will not pay a single dollar to the vulture funds comprised of Elliott Management Corp, an affiliate of NML Capital Ltd and Aurelius Capital Management, which own $ 1. 3 billion of the debt. For its part, Argentina’s Economics Minister referred to Griesa’s order as “judicial colonialism”. “The judgement breaches Argentine sovereignty and threatens the whole of the world’s financial system and we … are seeing a clear case of judicial colonialism. All we need is the arrival of the fifth fleet”. Argentina’s restructured debt currently stands at nearly $ 25 billion. The result of this is that Argentina could default on its restructured debt payment of $ 3 billion to its exchange bondholders by not paying on December 15. The worst case scenario is that the possible Argentine default could spread to countries in Europe, particularly Greece, which is facing massive financial pressures and distress as a result of colossal debt accumulated over many years of excessive borrowing. Indeed, the thought of default may not be too far away, thus threatening the financial stability of the whole of the Eurozone and the world. This clearly is a worst case scenario and one that is highly unlikely to occur, but the possibility remains. In the meantime, Argentina has received some breathing space. The three judges which upheld Griesa’s decision have postponed any decisions to February 27, 2013, when arguments by lawyers representing Argentina and the “vulture funds” argue over payment details. In the words of Felix Salmon: “My hope is that somewhere up the chain, principles of national sovereignty and smoothly-functioning markets will prevail, and Griesa will be overruled”. The certainty is that in these times of global financial dysfunction, the biggest winners will be extremely wealthy New York lawyers who will be celebrating all the way to the bank with their obscene exorbitant fees, while millions of Argentines will continue to struggle on a daily basis.
