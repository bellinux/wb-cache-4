40|$|Background: The area of {{research}} aimed for a more efficient e-learning is slowly widening from purely technical to the areas of psychology, didactics and methodology. The {{question is whether the}} text or background color influence the efficiency of memory, i. e. learning.

Purpose: The basic idea of the study is to examine whether there is a difference in memorizing text in study subjects of the experimental and control group if the only <b>variable</b> <b>tested</b> is a different combination of font color and background color. The study is divided into several phases.

Despite many studies researching anatomical, neuromuscular, and hormonal causes, the predisposing risk factors behind this occurrence are currently unknown. This study compared 5 females who had injured their ACL to 15 healthy females concentrating on three dependent variables. The first variable measured was digit span ratio of the second and fourth digits because previous studies suggest that this ratio is related to prenatal sex hormones that affect visual-spatial abilities. The next variable was knee joint laxity using an arthrometer to measure the stiffness of the ACL. The last <b>variable</b> <b>tested</b> was the muscular strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings using the Biodex dynamometer. The strength of these muscle groups is suggested in the literature to be {{a risk factor for}} ACL injuries because they protect the knee joint.

40|$|Based on near-surface {{temperature}} measurements conducted at high temporal resolution in 16 Scottish lochs in 2001, a strong seasonal cycle {{was observed in}} {{the magnitude of the}} diel surface temperature range (DSTR). The influence of 5 site-specific potential predictor variables including altitude, latitude, longitude, lake surface area, and maximum lake depth on the timing of the start and end of a statistically significant DSTR was investigated. The DSTR is important because it is expected to have implications for many processes that affect biogeochemical cycling in lakes, including the rates of metabolic processes. The timing of the start of a statistically significant DSTR in spring showed a strong dependence on altitude, a much weaker dependence on latitude, but no dependence on any other predictor <b>variable</b> <b>tested.</b> The timing of the end of a statistically significant DSTR in autumn showed no dependence on any of the predictor variables tested. Because the start of a statistically significant DSTR is dependent on altitude but its end is not, its duration is also dependent on altitude.
