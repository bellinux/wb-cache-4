40|$|Overview The {{vocational}} {{education and training}} (<b>VET)</b> system in Australia plays {{a central role in}} the development of skills for the Australian workforce and through that role makes a critical contribution to workforce participation, productivity levels, individual’s life chances and economic and social development. The level of public and private investment in <b>VET</b> is therefore an important public policy issues. The Mitchell Institute has pointed to declining levels of public investment in <b>VET.</b> This paper has been specifically prepared to help inform consideration and debate about the future <b>VET</b> of funding in Australia. <b>VET</b> is currently funded under a shared funding model between the Commonwealth and the states, while higher education is funded by the Commonwealth. A draft paper prepared by the Commonwealth Government for the Council of Australian Governments proposes that the Commonwealth now also assume responsibility for funding <b>VET</b> – a proposal that has attracted both support and opposition. The significant increases in outlays to <b>VET</b> providers under the Commonwealth’s <b>VET</b> FEE-­‐HELP scheme and the settings for <b>VET</b> FEE-­‐HELP are another important consideration in <b>VET</b> funding policy. The paper summarises the evolution of the <b>VET</b> shared funding model and assesses its effectiveness over time in terms of funding, participation and enrolments and the changing shares of Commonwealth and state funding particularly through <b>VET</b> FEE-­‐HELP. It concludes by outlining, in broad terms, options for future funding responsibility for <b>VET.</b> More detailed design options will be included in the Institute’s forthcoming paper on tertiary education funding...|$|R
5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, <b>vetting</b> the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their boats and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for {{how to set up}} these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for <b>vetting</b> staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer and}} former MP Matthew Parris {{described}} Thorpe {{as one of}} the more dashing among the new MPs elected in 1959. Thorpe's chief political interest lay in the field of human rights, and his speeches criticising apartheid in South Africa attracted the attention of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS), who took note of this rising Liberal star. Thorpe was briefly considered as best man at the 1960 wedding of his Eton contemporary Antony Armstrong-Jones to Princess Margaret, but was rejected when <b>vetting</b> checks indicated that he might have homosexual tendencies. The security agency MI5, which routinely keeps records on all members of parliament, added this information to Thorpe's file.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong {{opposition}} to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Company (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the <b>vetting</b> process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).|$|E

40|$|What is {{the status}} and role of {{research}} in <b>VET</b> reform? How are the views of practitioners positioned in <b>VET</b> research and reform? What access do <b>VET</b> practitioners have to research that empowers them to critique current policy and practice? This paper explores the sequestions drawing on literature and also on my experience as a <b>VET</b> practitioner and researcher. The national <b>VET</b> research strategy supports a substantial research effort to inform policy and practice. However, in a complex and unstable <b>VET</b> environment, funded research focuses on implementation, rather than critique, of current directions. I argue that {{the complexity of the}} <b>VET</b> system gives rise to new research problems, and that <b>VET</b> practitioners have knowledge and insight to offer in exploring these problems. But I question the extent to which current <b>VET</b> consultation and research processes incorporate the views of practitioners. I illustrate these issues by providing a brief overview of my PhD research project, currently being conducted through the Faculty of Education, Deakin University. This project explores the proposition that the language form typically used in official national <b>VET</b> texts is representative of, and constructive in, unequal power relationships. <br /...|$|R
