The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, quick ratio steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch turbo-hydramatic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburators, and finned aluminum <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> on the 425 nail head engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer.|$|E
2500|$|For 1987, the 9C1 Caprice changed little.

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Tier 4 Emission control versus {{conventional}} engine {{design is}} what every design engineer???s challenge {{to be dealt}} with. To design an engine to current market standards and requirements has become very intricate. In order to make such an explicit design which meets the standards, every component of the engine plays as a vital role. Every component design and development to current engineering standards pushes the envelope of manufacturability to new limits, which constraints {{the cost of the}} product across the ease of manufacturability of it. In consideration of the complexity to be attained, every component design contributes to the existence of a complete standardized engine, such as integrated <b>valve</b> <b>cover.</b> With the new tier 4 final regulations for engine manufactures, every new engine produced needs to meet those regulations. Caterpillar Inc regulated to produce tier 4 final compatible engines for the market. The new drive for development of new engines identified the objective of this project to design a new integrated breather <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> for large power engines. <b>Valve</b> <b>Cover,</b> the noun by name explains it <b>covers</b> <b>valves.</b> In explanation to the definition of the <b>valve</b> <b>cover,</b> it covers the cylinder head mechanism;this is a high speed operating <b>valve.</b> <b>Valve</b> <b>Cover</b> not only covers the head mechanism and should also be persistent to pressure, stress and heat dissipated during the operation of the engine. <b>Valve</b> <b>cover</b> design initiates and explains the intricacy of a complete engine design. All the functional requirements of <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> would be designed, analyzed and validated in this project, that drive the process of execution of the project to several phases of product development. Process identified for execution initiates with correct manufacturing technique, design intent and analysis. Caterpillar Inc. Engineering standards have been taken as a reference for defining all form fit functions. Pro engineering, Abaqus, Gambit and Fluent are the computer aided design tools used in this project for the execution of design intent. Identification of a proper manufacturing technique, processed execution of design requirements and analysis of concepts of design are validated across the requirements in this project with a justification of value added solutions are notified in the project. Conclusion on complete product design of integrated breather <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> with optimal solution of all the available techniques in every aspect of design, development and real time production of <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> have been discussed in this project,Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

The 428 CJ was available {{with or without the}} Ram Air Induction package, however, those with Ram Air still carried the same advertised power rating. The 428 CJ without Ram Air, came with the following items: 80-ampere heavy-duty battery, 3.25:1 open differential, heavy-duty cooling package, 55-ampere alternator, chrome <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and dual exhaust.

2500|$|In 1981, {{there was}} only one {{powerplant}} available, a [...] engine that, like the L-48 base engine the previous year, produced the , but was now designated the L81. The motor was certified in all states and available with manual or automatic transmissions. Chrome air cleaner lids and cast magnesium <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> dressed up all engines. The stainless steel exhaust manifolds and computer control system introduced on the [...] California engines the previous year were now standard, as was an auxiliary electric engine cooling fan. This, the last C3 available with a manual transmission, so equipped, had a published 0-60mph in 8.1seconds. This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass rear leaf spring, now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an oil temperature gauge. The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428. New options included a power adjustable driver’s seat and power remote outside mirrors. In mid-1981 production shifted from St. Louis, Missouri to Bowling Green, Kentucky, and several two-tone paint options were offered.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2002 Nissan {{released}} a final production {{model of the}} R34 GT-R called the Skyline GT-R V·Spec II Nür and the Skyline GT-R M·Spec Nür.
