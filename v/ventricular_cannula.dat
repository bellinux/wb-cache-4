40|$|Total 200 {{patients}} with subdural haemorrhages were managed in 11 years in Department of Neurosurgery, Rajshahi Medical College. Out of these, 80 patients had acute SDH and 120 patients had chronic SDH. All of them presented with headache and variable degree {{of lack of}} alertness. About 120 patients presented with hemi-paresis, 75 patients presented with urinary retention. Male and female patients were 180 and 20 with a ratio 9 : 1. All the patients were after 6 th decades of life in CSDH. Bilateral acute and chronic SDH was seen in 40 (20 %) patients. All of them were evacuated by two burr holes and irrigations with normal saline. One patient developed re-accumulation and drained by <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula.</b> GCS varied from 7 - 13. ASDH was treated by wide craniotomy. Mortality rate was 25 (12. 5 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of positioning and geometry of ventricular cannulas for contemporary continuous flow Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) was evaluated in a non-beating isolated heart preparation with borescopic visualization. Preload and LVAD flow were varied to evaluate degrees of ventricular decompression {{up to the}} point of ventricular collapse. The performance of a flanged cannula was compared to a conventional bevel-tipped cannula: quantitatively by the maximal flow attainable, and qualitatively by visualization of fluid tracer particles within the ventricular chamber. Three forms of ventricular suck-down occurred: concentric collapse, gradual entrainment and instantaneous entrainment. In some circumstances, unstable oscillations of the ventricle were observed prior to complete collapse. Under conditions of low preload, the flanged cannula demonstrated less positional sensitivity, provided greater flow, and exhibited fewer areas of stagnation than the beveled cannula. These observations warrant further consideration of a flanged <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula</b> to mitigate complications encountered with conventional cannulae...|$|E
40|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} uterine contractions {{and milk}} ejection, functions related to parturition and nuturing. Studies {{were conducted to}} determine if this peptide, native to the brain and the posterior pituitary gland, {{plays a role in}} the induction of maternal behavior. Intact virgin female rats were given 0. 4 μg of oxytocin, 0. 4 μg of [Arg 8]vasopressin, or saline through lateral <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannulae.</b> Forty-two percent of intact rats receiving oxytocin displayed full maternal behavior towards foster pups. None of the saline- or vasopressin-treated animals displayed full maternal behavior. Criteria in five behavioral categories had to be fulfilled by an animal within 2 hr of injection for its behavior to be considered fully maternal. When partial maternal responses were considered, oxytocin was significantly more effective than saline and marginally more effective than vasopressin. Five animals responding fully maternally after oxytocin injection were allowed to stay with pups for 10 days. All five continued to display full maternal behavior during this time. Nearly all animals that responded fully maternally to oxytocin injection were in the last day of diestrus or in proestrus or estrus. This suggested that elevated or recently elevated levels of estrogen may be necessary for the induction of full maternal behavior by oxytocin. Twenty-seven virgin female rats were ovariectomized and given either 100 μg of estradiol benzoate per kg in oil subcutaneously or oil alone immediately after operation. Forty-eight hours later, all animals received 0. 4 μg of oxytocin intracerebroventricularly. Eleven of 13 estrogen-primed animals became fully maternal; none of 14 nonprimed animals became fully maternal...|$|R
40|$|Decreased {{growth hormone}} (GH) {{function}} in obese patients {{might contribute to}} associated metabolic abnormalities. This study aimed to investigate the effect of leptin, GH and periods of leptin sensitivity or/and insensitivity on {{the expression of the}} SOCS- 3 gene in the ovine pituitary and to examine the influence of centrally administered leptin on GH release in sheep. Our first experiment investigated the periods of leptin resistance and leptin sensitivity, which are known as the long day (LD) and the short day (SD) periods, respectively, using ewes that were surgically fitted with third <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannulae.</b> The ewes were assigned randomly to one of three treatments and were centrally infused at 0, 1 and 2 h, beginning at sunset. The treatments consisted of central infusions of either Ringer-Locke buffer or leptin (0. 5 or 1. 0 μg/kg body weight (BW), respectively). Our next experiment examined the pituitaries isolated from ewes decapitated in either May or November. The explants were treated with control or GH (100 or 300 ng/ml) or leptin (50 or 100 ng/ml) — containing media and incubated for one of four different time intervals. The in vivo experiments demonstrated variable effects of leptin on GH release depending on the period of leptin sensitivity/ insensitivity. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that leptin significantly influenced the expression of the SOCS- 3 gene during that SD compared to that during the LD. During the SD, we observed that significantly low or high doses of GH affected the expression of SOCS- 3. These results indicated a strong correlation between leptin or GH and SOCS- 3, which might explain leptin resistance and the associated perturbations in GH signaling. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{were given}} a diet {{containing}} 10 % (w/w) erucuc acid for 10 days while the control group received the standard diet. At {{the end of the}} treatment animals were anaesthetized and adrenaline was injected through the jugular vein until cardiac arrest. ECG was registered, pulmonary oedema was evidenced by haematic exudate flowing out of the tracheal <b>cannula.</b> <b>Ventricular</b> fibrillation, pulmonary oedema and cardiac arrest occurred significantly earlier in th erucic acid group than in the group on normal diet.

40|$|SummaryEpilepsy is an {{important}} problem in neurological disorders. The common features {{of all types of}} epilepsy are the synchronized and uncontrolled discharges of nerve cell assemblies. Recent studies claimed that gap junctions have a critical role in epileptic neuronal events. The aim of present study is to investigate the effects of connexin 36 (Cx 36) channel blocker quinine on penicillin-induced experimental epilepsy. For this purpose, 4 months old male Wistar rats were used in the present study. Permanent screw electrodes allowing EEG monitoring from conscious animals and permanent cannula providing the administration of the substances to the brain ventricle were placed into the cranium of rats under general anesthesia. At the end of the postoperative recovery period, epileptiform activity was generated by injecting 300 IU crystallized penicillin through the <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula.</b> When the epileptiform activity, monitored from a digital recording system, reached maximal frequency and amplitude, quinine (200, 400 or 1000 nmol) was administered similar to penicillin. Effects of quinine on epileptiform activity were assessed by both electrophysiological and behavioral analysis. Quinine suppressed epileptiform activity by decreasing the amplitude and frequency of epileptiform spikes and by attenuating the epileptiform behavior. The outcomes {{of this study suggest that}} the blockade of Cx 36 channels may contribute to the amelioration of epileptic activity...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveCardioscopy {{is a novel}} {{imaging method}} that allows closed-chest, {{real-time}} fiberoptic imaging of intracardiac structures. This study tested the feasibility and safety of cardioscopy as a platform for mitral and tricuspid valve surgery in the beating heart. MethodsThrough a median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was established in 10 calves. Lactated Ringer’s solution was administered through the pulmonary artery to eliminate residual blood volumes in the lung vasculature and was drained through a left <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula.</b> A fiberoptic cardioscope within its translucent outer sheath was inserted through the left ventricle. Irrigating solution was continuously administered through the cardioscope sheath for clearer visualization. An endoscopic clip was used for edge-to-edge repair of the mitral and tricuspid valves. After mitral valve clipping, the cardioscope was inserted into the right ventricle. The solution was administered from the right atrium and continuously drained from the pulmonary artery. After tricuspid valve repair, the animal was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass. ResultsSuccessful double-valve repair {{was carried out in}} all 10 cases. All calves were weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with dobutamine only. Hematocrit values were maintained during the procedure (pre 29. 0 % ± 3. 1 % vs post 28. 5 % ± 3. 6 %, P = . 70). ConclusionsThis study showed the technical feasibility of beating heart valve surgery using direct cardioscopic visualization. Cardioscopy represents a promising platform for future interventions and surgery under direct visualization in the beating heart...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) in modulating {{feed intake}} depression in parasite-infected lambs was investigated using CCK receptor antagonists (L 364 - 7 18 and loxiglumide). Four experiments {{were carried out}} using ewe lambs infected with 4000 Trichostrongylus colubrifonnis larvae/d or non-infected controls (n 8, live weight 25 kg). Animals were fed daily on a nutritionally complete pelleted diet and had free access to water. In the first experiment, infected and non-infected animals were injected subcutaneously with CCK antagonist (100 pg L 364 - 718) or carrier alone as a single dose. In the second experiment, CCK antagonist (loxiglumide: 0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg live weight) was injected into a jugular vein immediately before feeding. In the third experiment, animals were infused continuously with the CCK antagonist (loxiglumide; 10 mg/kg per h) for 10 min before feeding {{and for the first}} 2 h of feeding. In the final experiment, lambs were fitted with an indwelling cerebral <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula</b> and infused with a CCK antagonist (loxiglumide, 162 pg/min), CCK agonist (CCK- 8, 2. 5 pmol/min), loxiglumide plus CCK- 8 or sterile saline solution alone via the cannula for 30 min before feeding and for the first 60 min of feeding. In all the experiments short-term feed intake was recorded at 10 and 15 min intervals for the first and second hours of feedin...|$|E
40|$|The CentriMag left {{ventricular}} assist {{system can be}} used for perioperative or postcardiotomy circulatory support of the failing heart. The device resides at the patient's bedside, and the cannulae are usually inserted through a midline sternotomy, with the inflow cannula in the left ventricle or right superior pulmonary vein and the outflow cannula in the aorta. In a patient whose chest has been closed and who has a delayed need for temporary mechanical support, a less invasive method of left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>cannula</b> insertion is preferred. In these cases, the CentriMag cannulae can be inserted through a right minithoracotomy with the inflow cannula in the right superior pulmonary vein and the outflow cannula in the aorta, with no heparinization. Herein, we describe this approach in a patient who experienced postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock after aortocoronary bypass surgery. This technique may facilitate ambulation and recovery in selected patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cannulation of {{the left}} {{ventricle}} (LV) apex is a common surgical procedure for aortic valve bypass and ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. LV cannulation requires coring of the LV apex and attaching a sewing ring via suture. Although effective, suturing is time-consuming and apical coring can lead to bleeding complications or inflow occlusion. The scope of this project was to design a sutureless-anchoring device for an apical left <b>ventricular</b> (ALV) <b>cannula</b> system. Instrumentation, equipment, and procedures: The sutureless-anchoring device {{was designed as a}} conical spring. Five prototypes were fabricated with varying wire diameter (0. 045 ”- 0. 055 ”), maximum cone diameter (0. 85 ”- 0. 975 ”), and spring height (0. 75 ”- 1. 25 ”). The conical springs were attached to PVC cylinders to mimic ALV cannulae. The prototypes were tested through 1) leak test with pressurized porcine hearts, 2) tensile pull test using porcine hearts and an INSTRON, and 3) quantitative assessment of device implantation by cardiothoracic surgeons. Results and Discussion: Leak testing determined that the prototypes created a leak-proof tissue-cannula interface. The prototype with the largest cone and wire diameter combination was able to achieve a tensile failure force similar to that of a clinically-used VAD sewing ring. Other prototypes yielded failure forces below the VAD sewing rings. The quantitative assessment reported that the prototype easily penetrates the tissue and is quicker to implant than sewing rings. Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated promise for a sutureless-anchoring device as part of an ALV cannula system. A sutureless implantation method may lead to safer and faster LV cannulation surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical cost. Recommendations: It is recommended to test springs with larger wire diameter and large end outer diameter combinations than those tested in this study. It is also recommended to create and test multiple prototypes of each variation of spring dimensions...|$|R
40|$|A novel transaortic <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula,</b> {{known as}} the 2 ̆ 7 double barrel 2 ̆ 7 cannula (DBC), is {{designed}} to minimize the invasiveness of Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) implantation by combining the inlet and outlet cannulae into a single dual lumen cannula. Both the inlet and outlet lumen will pass through a single opening in {{the apex of the}} left ventricle with the outflow then continuing past the aortic valve, into the aortic arch. This design offers several potential advantages over the current state of-the-art. The benefits of the DBC include less invasive surgery and providing mechanical support to the septum. By routing the outflow through the aortic valve, the need to access the external structure of the ascending aorta at the time of implantation is eliminated thereby eliminating the need for open heart surgery. In designing the DBC, close {{attention has been paid to}} the outflow portion of the cannula since it was anticipated that this portion of the DBC could have the largest impact on the device 2 ̆ 7 s usability. The object of this study was to test the performance of the valve with the cannula passing through it. Three different geometries of similar cross-sectional area were compared. The geometries were circular, equilateral triangular, and occluded leaflet. Experiments measuring aortic insufficiency (AI), hemolysis, and differential pressure across the valve were conducted. Additionally, high speed cinematography was used to analyze the dynamics of the valve 2 ̆ 7 s sealing to the cannulae. All three geometries exhibited low and acceptable levels of AI (15...|$|E
40|$|Substance P (SP) and neurokinins {{have been}} implicated in {{modulating}} pain and mood but {{little is known about}} their effect on sleep-wake behavior. {{the purpose of the present}} study was to examine the possible involvement of SP in sleep-wake mechanisms without activation of painful responses. Electrophysiological recordings of the sleep-wake cycle were conducted in C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice that had intracerebral <b>ventricular</b> <b>cannula</b> inserted for drug administration. Initially, in order to determine the highest dose of SP that would not induce nociceptive response, 10 animals per group received administration of either SP doses or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-sham group) through the carmula and were assessed by the hot plate test. the sleep-wake cycle of two other groups of mice was recorded for 24 It before (baseline) and after receiving CSF (n= 10) or SP- 1 mM (n = 11), dose that had been determined in the previous hot plate test. SP interfered with sleep, when compared to baseline and to sham group, by reducing sleep efficiency, increasing latency of sleep and the number of awakening bouts. To examine the reversal of SP effects, eight mice were administered with an NK 1 receptor antagonist before SP administration. Prior administration of the NK 1 antagonist prevented the disturbances in sleep. Conclusions: the results suggest that SP produces disturbances in sleep, likely mediated by the NK 1 receptor.
