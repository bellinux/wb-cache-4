40|$|The {{continually}} growing demands {{over the}} quality of the environment, followed by the progressive legislation aimed at controlling pollutants, have created a need for a further development of the engine design and the exhaust gas after treatment systems as well. In order to achieve extensive reduction of the pollutants and appropriate engine performance, an optimization of an ethanol fueled version of the Volvo TD 73 diesel engine was performed based on a computerized analysis of measured engine parameters. A <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> (ATR) is mounted on the turbocharger outlet; therefore the engine was forced to work against a <b>back</b> <b>pressure,</b> particularly at light loads where the emission levels are expected to be undesirable. Hence, by reducing air intake, an increase of cylinder gas temperature was certainly expected and a continuous decline in emissions with increase of <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> was obtained. Furthermore, the effect of a by-pass valve, installed between intercooler and intake manifold, on emission levels were investigated and optimized. Oxidation catalysts effects on regulated emissions, especially unburned fuel, carbon monoxide and unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were investigated. In correlation with the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> a promoting faster catalyst Warm-up was achieved, and their conversion efficiencies were improved. In order to gain more extensive information to base specification of the engine emissions and catalyst selection, different test cycles such as European R 49 - 13 mode, steady state adoption of the Braunschweig cycle, 24 specific steps cycle, as well as conditioning, activating and transient cycles were used.

In larger systems a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> will be used, which maintains pressure upstream of the regulator {{by means of a}} spring, compressed air, or electronically driven valve.

40|$|Matrix {{acidizing}} {{is a well}} stimulation procedure where acid {{is injected}} down the wellbore or coil tubing and into the reservoir near the wellbore region. Wellbore damage is a common issue in the oil field. The primary goal of matrix acidizing in carbonate reservoirs is to bypass wellbore damage by creating highly conductive channels that go several feet into the formation, known as wormholes. The goal of laboratory experiments is to find an optimum injection rate to create dominant wormholes and provide this information to the field. To conduct various experiments, core flooding setups are created. The setup consists of a core holder, accumulator, overburden pump, injection pump, accumulator, pressure sensors, and a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> Results from matrix acidizing core flooding in laboratory conditions provide an understand for wormhole growth, acid diversion, injection rates, and adds a variety of liquid chemicals for testing at reservoir pressures and temperatures. The first objective was to design, assemble, and test a matrix acidizing parallel core flooding apparatus. The apparatus was rated for 5, 000 psi and 250 ?F. Combinations of the various mechanical components were chosen appropriately to meet the requirements. Electrical wiring and data acquisition hardware was assembled.

50|$|SFC with CO2 {{utilizes}} {{carbon dioxide}} pumps that {{require that the}} incoming CO2 and pump heads be kept cold {{in order to maintain}} the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate. The CO2 subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved. SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix, with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas. The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection, and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency. Typically, gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar co-solvent such as methanol, possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations ~1%. The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5 um material. The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate, co-solvent composition, system <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> and column oven temperature which must exceed 40 °C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO2. In addition, SFC provides an additional control parameter - pressure - by using an automated <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> From an operational standpoint, SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar co-solvent. If the outlet CO2 is captured, it can be recompressed and recycled, allowing for >90% reuse of CO2.|$|R

Antek Instruments reported {{success in the}} use of a quartz capillary tube having a diameter of about 0. 005 inches and a length of 6 inches to reduce the pressure of a 600 {degrees}C gas stream from 15 atm to 1 atm. This capillary tube will be incorporated into the Antek R- 6000 elemental sulfur analyzer; an order was placed for the modified instrument during the latter stages of the quarter. SO{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }S analysis will be accomplished by modifying an existing Shimadzu GC- 14 A gas chromatograph. Repairs to both the electrobalance and the furnace temperature controller were accomplished and a manifold system capable of feeding N{sub 2 }, O{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }, and H{sub 2 }O was constructed.

40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The objective of this research has been to develop {{the understanding of the}} detection of voids in packed chromatographic columns using one component added to another pure carrier gas. This has been successfully accomplished with an apparatus in which the transients displayed by adding the small gas perturbation flow produced mirror images of the transients displayed by removing the perturbation flow. Flow rates are measured in these experiments. The transients are displayed when a composition front passes a void in the column. The achievement of the objective is mainly due {{to the way in which}} the perturbation to flow is introduced into the system. Instead of the perturbation flow being switched from one column to the other, the flow is simply added and removed sharply from a single column. This has involved the development of a gas sample mixing device which greatly reduces the problem of dead volume. The dead volume causes different effects when the perturbation flow is added and when it is removed. Another aspect of the new system is that the perturbation flow rate can be measured exactly by switching the gas through a soap film bubble flowmeter. Further development and re-design of the <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> have successfully eliminated the effect of atmospheric pressure fluctuation on the noise' level on the flow rate measurement. Analysis of the deviation in the flowrate caused by desorption and resorption as a composition front passes through a column shows that this research provides, quick, accurate, and a simpler method of obtaining composition residence times from the flow rate records...|$|R
40|$|Core {{flooding}} is {{a commonly}} used experimental procedure in the petroleum industry. It involves pressurizing a reservoir rock and flowing fluid through {{it in the}} laboratory. The cylindrical rock, called a core, can be cut from the reservoir during a separate core drilling operation or a formation outcrop. A core flooding apparatus suitable for matrix acidizing was designed and assembled. Matrix acidizing is a stimulation technique in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) is injected down the wellbore below formation fracture pressure to dissolve carbonate (CaCO 3) rock creating high permeability streaks called wormholes. The main components of the apparatus include a continuous flow syringe pump, three core holders, a hydraulic hand pump, two accumulators, a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator,</b> and two <b>pressure</b> transducers connected {{through a series of}} tubing and valves. Due to the corrosive nature of the acid, the apparatus features Hastelloy which is a corrosion resistant metal alloy. Another substantial feature of the apparatus is the ability to apply 3000 psi <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> This is the pressure necessary to keep CO 2, a product of the CaCO 3 and HCl reaction, in solution at elevated temperatures. To perform experiments at temperature, the core holder is wrapped with heating tape and surrounded by insulation. Tubing is wrapped around a heating band with insulation to heat the fluid before it enters the core. A LabVIEW graphical programming code was written to control heaters as well as record temperature and pressure drop across the core. Other considerations for the design include minimizing footprint, operational ease by the user, vertical placement of the accumulators and core holders to minimize gravity effects, and air release valves. Core floods can be performed at varying injection rates, temperatures and pressures up to 5000 psi and 250 degF. The apparatus can handle small core plugs, 1 ?? diameter X 1 ?? length, up to 4 ?? X 20 ?? cores. The equipment description includes the purpose, relevant features, and connections to the system for each component.

40|$|Routine {{consumption}} of blueberries and cranberries {{has been shown}} to have great health benefits. Blueberries have high amounts of anthocyanin content per serving. Anthocyanins are known to be powerful antioxidants and are linked to the reduction of heart disease and cancer. New research suggests that the berries may also play a role in slowing down age related diseases such as memory loss and tissue damage caused by Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s. In addition the berries have a variety of essential vitamins and minerals that are important for overall health. Cranberries have long been used to treat urinary tract infections due to the high composition of benzoic and other acids. Both types of berries are rich in vitamin A and retinoids which have been linked to reducing certain cancers such as colon, lung and breast cancer in addition to the benefits they encompass for maintenance of eyesight. The health benefits associated with the components in the berries make them an attractive choice for extracting desirable active ingredients.

40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} two years results of the {{research}} on the development of advanced electrochemical techniques for use in supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) environments. The SCWO technology was found to be a promising approach to treat a variety of hazardous wastes. However, the corrosion processes in the SCWO reactors is still a problem for further development of this technology. The authors have developed a flow-through electrochemical cell (FTEC) which allows us to monitor the corrosion process in real time at temperatures up to 500 C and pressures up to 400 bar. The FTEC consists of a flow-through Ag/AgCl external pressure-balanced reference electrode, a flow-through platinum hydrogen electrode, an yttria-stabilized zirconia pH sensor and an electrochemical noise sensor. The new FTEC has been designed to serve as a measurement vessel for the high temperature and high pressure circulation once-through flow loop and titanium alloy was chosen as the construction material. The FTEC, shown schematically in Figure 1, is used for the experiments. Two HPLC pumps are employed in the system, one for pumping the reaction solution through the loop and the other for pumping the reference solution through the reference electrode. The system pressure is sustained as a constant via a <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator.</b> The temperature was measured using a thermocouple installed {{at the center of the}} FTEC. Because many physico-chemical processes, including corrosion, are sensitive to the pH, the measurement and control of pH is very important for the high temperature SCWO environment. The authors have measured the potentials of the FTEC for several HCl(aq) + NaCl(aq) solutions of different concentrations of HCl(aq) and derived the corresponding pH differences (DeltapH) over a wide range of temperatures at pressure around 350 bar. Comparison of the experimentally derived and theoretically calculated DpH values presented in Figure 2 clearly demonstrates the ability to measure pH with a high accuracy (better than 610. 05 pH units). This result also shows the viability of the developed FTEC as a versatile potentiometric system for use at supercritical temperatures. During the next year of the project they will address the problem of electrochemical noise measurements and monitoring corrosion processes that occur on metallic materials exposed to super critical water. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} target {{station at}} the ESR has been modified in 2008 to improve the reachable area density for low-Z targets by using pinhole orifice nozzles to produce beams of liquified gas that form a so called microdroplet target beam [1]. This setup was tested and improved during numerous beamtime campaigns {{in the last two}} years. However, the operation of the pinhole nozzle with heavier gases such as argon, krypton or xenon was ineffective. Target densities of nx ≈ 10 13 cm − 2 could easily be achieved at the former laval-type target setup without cooling at a nozzle diameter of d 0 = 50 µm, whereas no stable target beam could be produced with the tiny pinhole nozzle (d 0 = 5 − 10 µm). At room temperature a target beam could not be formed due to the large angular divergency of the emissive gas through the pinhole and at low temperatures a stable target operation could not be achieved due to fluctuations in density over several orders of magnitude. In order to improve the performance of the new target station for heavy target gases a different type of nozzle was installed. It has a trumped-shaped geometry and a nominal nozzle diameter of about d 0 = 13 µm. The group of A. Khoukaz from the University Münster provided the nozzle, which was originally manufactured at CERN, and performed several target tests with hydrogen gas in the past [2].

40|$|A {{technique}} is described which allowed {{the measurement of}} the oxygen consumption of the isolated heart of Octopus vulgaris. Contraction of the heart resulted in an aortic output and a flow through the heart muscle into coronary veins (the coronary output). The flow and oxygen content of the aortic output and the coronary output were measured with variable input pressures and constant output <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> (volume loaded), <b>variable</b> output <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> and constant aortic output (pressure loaded), and during hypoxia. Volume loading of the heart resulted {{in an increase in}} aortic output, power output and total oxygen consumption. Pressure loading increased power output and total oxygen consumption of the heart. Exposure to hypoxia decreased the aortic output, power output and total cardiac oxygen consumption. In the response of the heart to reduced work, brought about either by a reduced input pressure or by hypoxic perfusate, the power output was linearly related to the total oxygen consumption of the heart. The oxygen extracted from the coronary output accounted for 80 - 100 % of the total oxygen consumption of the heart. Coronary output amounted to 30 % of the total cardiac output at maximum power output. In volume-loaded hearts the volume of the coronary output increased as aortic output increased; in pressure-loaded hearts coronary output increased as power output increased, but aortic output remained constant. In hypoxia, the coronary output increased as the aortic output fell. At a perfusate Po 2 of around 50 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), the aortic output ceased although the heart continued to beat and the coronary output continued, accounting for all of the oxygen consumption of the heart. The coronary output flow in vitro therefore has the capacity to be varied independently of the aortic output flow to maintain the oxygen supply to the perfused cardiac muscle...|$|R

Since such processes are laborious, expensive, and time-consuming, {{there has been an}} increasing demand for rapid and reliable field-based analytical methods for the low-cost and efficient extraction and analysis of organic pollutants from contaminated sites. This thesis describes the development of a field-compatible supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) device and method for extraction of organic contaminants from soil. SFE was chosen due to its reported high extraction efficiency, selectivity and environmentally friendly nature due to the usage of supercritical fluids as opposed to liquid solvents. A compact 72 (W) xS 7 (D) xSO(H) cm, easily-transportable and user-friendly device was developed, based on the use of a reciprocating pump and <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> system. The optimised method yielded an average extraction recovery of 80 % for total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PABs) when compared to the well-validated laboratory-based Soxhlet extraction method. Tests were performed on a range of natural samples with varying water content (0 - 32 % w/w) without any sample pre-treatment. In comparison, the only commercially available competing field method, based on solvent shake extraction, yielded recovery values of 20 - 70 % coupled with poor precision. The thesis then describes the optimisation of a field applicable method for analysis of the SFE extracts, based on enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), a method offering speed, low cost and low solvent consumption. Available as a test kit, it was readily amenable to on-site usage requiring only simple equipment. Assay optimisation using an EPA sanctioned P AH immunoassay test kit demonstrated that the kit could function in methanolic SFE extracts diluted in buffer, hence allowing the direct analysis of total P ABs in SFE extracts with minimum sample preparation. Cross-reactivity from parent compounds was found to be an issue for the generation of quantitative data. Nevertheless, the method served as a reliable semi-quantitative technique for rapid screening of P AH levels in the SFE extracts of natural samples obtained from field-based tests. Poor performance of the solvent-shake extraction method linked to immunoassay further vindicated usage of the newly developed field-based SFEI immunoassay method. The thesis concludes by reporting on the successful field-based trials of the coupled SFE/immunoassay method. The SFE system shows promise as a valid tool for the rapid and efficient on-site monitoring of organic contaminants in soil matrices, providing an innovative and alternative approach to the commonly deployed solvent shake extraction method. The combined field-based SFElimmunoassay method is of benefit for the rapid low cost assessment of site contamination, allowing site owners and consultants alike to make rapid and informed decisions regarding site characterisation, monitoring and remediation without recourse to expensive and time consuming laboratory analyses...|$|R

This allows maintenance of normal intraocular pressure during glaucoma surgery. A <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> of the spring-biassed diaphragm type {{is provided with}} additional bias by a column of liquid. The hypodermic needle can be safely inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye.

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Presentation date: 1992 - 12 - 08 The {{use of the}} {{triaxial}} test to characterize the strength of soils for civil engineering applications is widespread. These tests are typically conducted with confining stresses in excess of 5 psi. To characterize {{the strength of a}} soil located in the upper layers of the subgrade of an aggregate surfaced road it is necessary to conduct {{triaxial test}}s with low confining stresses (5 psi or less). The development of a method for conducting multistage, consolidated undrained (CU) tests at low confining stresses (0. 5 to 5. 0 psi), with <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> saturation, is presented. Aspects of the test procedure that require special attention are described and recommendations are made including: 1. Compaction of the sample in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide reduces the time and pressure required to complete <b>back</b> <b>pressure</b> saturation. 2. Seepage force related pore pressures develop during sample flooding. Zeroing of the effective stress transducer should be completed prior to sample flooding so that it is certain that zero effective stress conditions are present. 3. <b>Back</b> <b>pressure</b> saturation is simplified by the use of a slave <b>regulator</b> (air loaded <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator)</b> that maintains a nearly constant pressure differential between the cell <b>pressure</b> and the <b>back</b> <b>pressure.</b> 4. The stress path method of interpretation {{is an essential part of}} multistage triaxial testing. This method simplifies the decision of when to stop each shear stage and the determination of shear strength parameters. 5. The use of a computer data acquisition system that processes data in real time and visually presents test progress simplifies the completion of multistage triaxial tests...|$|R
