The series inertia mass is proportional to not only square of a ratio between a diameter of a piston cylinder and a by-pass pipe, and also a density of the fluid. The resisting force characteristics in case of water or turbine oil were measured. To confirm the proposed theory and investigate effects of vibration control, vibration tests of frequency response and seismic response of one-degree-of-freedom system with the test device were carried out. The experimental results were compared with the calculated results, and the effects of vibration suppression are confirmed experimentally and theoretically. In this paper, in order to derive the effect of a <b>variable</b> <b>inertia</b> mass by using a magnet-rheological fluid, resisting force characteristics of the test device are measured in several cases of magnetic field.

The virtual inertia of the PV-VSG is shown in Fig.  14. When the angular speed difference between the SG and the PV-VSG is larger than zero, the virtual inertia of the PV-VSG increases to 35 pu. Compared {{with that of the}} constant inertia case, the power output of the ESS will decrease. Then less unbalance transient energy will be injected into the PV power system. When the angular speed difference between the SG and the PV-VSG is less than zero, the inertia of the PV-VSG decreases to 5 pu. Then the power output of the ESS will be increased to suppress the unbalance transient energy. Under such a {{control strategy}}, the transient energy of the PV power system will decay quickly.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we address}} a {{particular}} {{flavor of the}} motion planning problem, that is, the gait generation problem for underactuated <b>variable</b> <b>inertia</b> mechanical systems. Additionally, we analyze a rather general type of mechanical systems which we refer to as mixed systems. What is unique about this type of mechanical system is that both non-holonomic velocity constraints as well as instantaneous conservation of the generalized momentum variables defined along the allowable motion direction completely specify the systems velocity. By analyzing this general type of mechanical systems, we lay the grounds for a general and intuitive analysis of the gait generation problem. Through our approach, we provide a novel framework not only for classifying different types of mechanical systems, but also for identifying a partition on the space of allowable gaits. By applying our techniques to mixed systems which according to our classification are the most general type of mechanical systems, we verify the generality and applicability of our approach. Moreover, mixed systems yield the richest family of allowable gaits, hence, superseding the gait generation problem for other simpler types of mechanical systems. Finally, we apply our analysis to a novel mechanical system, the <b>variable</b> <b>inertia</b> snakeboard, which is a generalization of the original snakeboard that was previously studied in the literature. ...|$|E
