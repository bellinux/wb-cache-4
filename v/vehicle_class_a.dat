50|$|Campbell and {{his team}} {{returned}} to Lake Eyre in 1964, with sponsorship from Australian oil company Ampol, but the salt surface never returned to the promise it had held in 1962 and Campbell had to battle with CN7 to reach record speeds (over 400 mph). After more light rain in June, the lake finally began to dry enough for an attempt to be made. On 17 July 1964, Campbell set a record of 403.10 mph for a four-wheeled <b>vehicle</b> (<b>Class</b> <b>A).</b> Campbell was disappointed with the record speed as the vehicle had been designed for 500 mph. CN7 covered the final third of the measured mile {{at an average of}} 429 mph, peaking as it left the measured mile at over 440 mph. Had the salt surface been hard and dry, and the full 15 mile length originally envisaged, {{there can be no doubt}} that CN7 would have set a record well in excess of 450 mph and perhaps close to her design maximum of 500 mph, a speed that no other wheel driven car has approached. Campbell commissioned the author John Pearson to chronicle this attempt, with the resultant critically acclaimed book Bluebird and the Dead Lake, published by Collins in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{a report}} by the U.S. Government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, among 10 {{different}} classes of passenger vehicles, [...] "very small cars" [...] have the highest fatality rate per mile driven. For instance, a person driving 12,000 miles per year for 55 years would have a 1% chance of being involved in a fatal accident. This is twice the fatality rate of the safest <b>vehicle</b> <b>class,</b> <b>a</b> [...] "large car". According to the data in this report, the number of fatal crashes per mile is only weakly correlated with the vehicle weight, having a correlation coefficient of just (-0.45). A stronger correlation is seen with the vehicle size within its class; for example, [...] "large" [...] cars, pickups and SUVs, have lower fatality rates than [...] "small" [...] cars, pickups and SUVs. This is the case in 7 of the 10 classes, with the exception of mid-size vehicles, where minivans and mid-size cars are among the safest classes, while mid-size SUVs are the second most fatal after very small cars. Even though heavier vehicles sometimes are statistically safer, it is not necessarily the extra weight that causes them to be safer. The NHTSA report states: [...] "Heavier vehicles have historically done a better job cushioning their occupants in crashes. Their longer hoods and extra space in the occupant compartment provide an opportunity for a more gradual deceleration of the vehicle, and of the occupant within the vehicle... While it is conceivable that light vehicles could be built with similarly long hoods and mild deceleration pulses, it would probably require major changes in materials and design and/or taking weight out of their engines, accessories, etc." ...|$|E
40|$|Airbreathing launch {{vehicles}} {{continue to}} be a subject of great interest in the space access community. In particular, horizontal takeoff and horizontal landing vehicles are attractive with their airplane-like benefits and flexibility for future space launch requirements. The most promising of these concepts involve airframe integrated propulsion systems, in which the external undersurface of the vehicle forms part of the propulsion flowpath. Combining of airframe and engine functions in this manner involves all of the design disciplines interacting at once. Design and optimization of these configurations is a most difficult activity, requiring a multi-discipline process to analytically resolve the numerous interactions among the design variables. This paper describes the design and optimization of one configuration in this <b>vehicle</b> <b>class,</b> <b>a</b> lifting body with turbine-based low-speed propulsion.

40|$|Project {{conducted}} {{in cooperation with}} the Federal Highway Administration. Vehicular traffic loading is a crucial consideration for the design and maintenance of pavements. With the help of weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems, the information about date, time, speed, lane of travel, lateral lane position, axle spacing, and wheel load for each vehicle passing a WIM site can be recorded continuously on-site and transferred to a remote computer. This study focused on using the data from two WIM systems installed to support research on pavement performance. Data analysis involved processing the data from the two WIM systems, summarizing the data into respective TxDOT <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes,</b> analyzing the error records in the WIM data, and exploring trends and patterns in the observed traffic counts. The researchers also analyzed the axle-load frequency distribution for different axle groups within all truck classes, explored the trend of axle-load distribution among years, and compared the difference in axle-load distribution for the same axle type at different locations in different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes.</b> <b>A</b> time-series method was used to forecast traffic counts for each <b>vehicle</b> <b>class</b> based on the trend in the pattern of observed traffic and a growth rate for each <b>vehicle</b> <b>class.</b> Finally, cumulative traffic loading was forecasted by applying the estimates of future traffic coun...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a usage-related parking {{model for the}} demand-supply equilibrium of parking services that was developed as part of Hong Kong's Second Parking Demand Study (PDS 2), which culminated in 2003.

A set of admissible links is formed to connect a set of demand locations to a set of facility locations, in accordance with the admissibility of <b>a</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>class</b> to <b>a</b> particular type of facility. A parking choice model that takes into account the parking search time, walking distance, and parking charge is developed, in which each vehicle chooses a parking facility to minimize its generalized parking cost at equilibrium. A method of successive averages is used to determine the equilibrium solution of the parking model. The peak parking accumulation at different locations and times can then be deduced from the model.
