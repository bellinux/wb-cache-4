For active nondestructive measurements we use a sealed tube 14 MeV neutron generator with and without a moderating assembly between the interrogating neutron source and the object of interest. Because stolen or diverted <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> generally {{may not have a}} fixed geometry and will not be packaged in standard containers main emphasis is on neutron measurements.

In future it is suggested to perform in situ interrogation of suspected boxes with small neutron generator already available. Because the geometry and chemical form of the material inside the box is not known generally and additional shielding may be present data should be acquired for different arrangements of the material and shielding. In this way the identification of the material in a suspect object will be possible by comparison of the measurement results with previous data.

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990 ¿s, more than 600 cases of illicit trafficking involving radioactive or <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> {{have been reported in the}} IAEA database. The reported seizures obviously represent only the tip of an iceberg and we have to assume that the real number of cases of illicit trafficking of <b>nuclear</b> and radioactive <b>material</b> is significantly higher. Most of the reported seizures refer to radioactive sources (such as 137 Cs, 192 Ir, 60 Co or 90 Sr) originating from medical or industrial applications. These materials pose a radiological hazard due to their high activity. The seized samples of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> were generally of higher mass, yet of lower activity as compared to medical or industrial radioisotope sources. The threat associated with <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is going beyond the shear consideration of the number of Becquerel of seized sample. The radiotoxicity of the alpha emitting nuclides typically encountered in <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is significantly higher than that of beta or gamma emitters usually applied in medical sources. This represents a considerable hazard if the material is handled in inappropriate ways and particularly if considered in a terrorist context. The use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> in a radiological dispersal device (colloquially referred to as a ¿dirty bomb¿) is therefore a matter of serious concern. Furthermore, <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> ¿if available in sufficient quantity and quality- may be used in nuclear explosive devices. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>material</b> is generally under strict control of competent national or international authorities. This control may involve accountancy and safeguards measures and is generally combined with strict physical protection of the material. However, the reported seizures of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> prove that <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> can be diverted or stolen in some instances. This leads to the conclusion that the implementation of treaties, agreements or conventions on safeguards and physical protection has not been fully achieved or suffers from gaps.
