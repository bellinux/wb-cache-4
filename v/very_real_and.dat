5|$|Besides the {{theology}} espoused by their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work in nearly every calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> present for them. They believed {{in the presence of}} malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but {{there is little evidence that}} Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E

The fear of the Åland islands falling under the influence of Germany or Soviet Union was <b>very</b> <b>real,</b> <b>and</b> that is why Sandler proposed defending the status of the islands.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1500s a larger arquebus {{known as the}} musket appeared. The heavy musket, while being rather awkward to handle, {{requiring}} a fork rest to fire properly, {{had the advantage of}} being able to penetrate the best armor within a range of 180 meters, regular armor at 365 meters, and an unarmed man at 548 meters. However, both the musket and arquebus were effectively limited to a range of only 90 to 185 meters regardless of armor since they were incredibly inaccurate. According to some sources, a smoothbore musket was completely incapable of hitting a man sized target past the 73 meter mark. While rifled guns did exist at this time in the form of grooves cut into the interior of a barrel, these were considered specialist weapons and limited in number. In some aspects this made the smoothbore musket an inferior weapon compared to the bow. The average Mamluk archer for example was capable of hitting targets only 68 meters far away but could keep up a pace of six to eight shots per minute. In comparison, sixteenth century matchlocks fired off one shot every several minutes, and much less when taking into consideration misfires and malfunctions which occurred up to half the time. This {{is not to say that}} firearms of the 16th century were inferior to the bow and arrow, for it could better penetrate armor and required less training, but the disadvantages of the musket were <b>very</b> <b>real,</b> <b>and</b> it would not be until the 1590s that archers were for the most part phased out of European warfare. This was possibly a consequence of the increased effectiveness of musket warfare due to the rise of volley fire in Europe as first applied by the Dutch. At this time gunners in European armies reached as high as 40 percent of infantry forces.|$|E

What more reasonable, than that we should go on to think of our Lord's boyhood? To think of this aright, {{even if we do}} not altogether understand it, ought to help us to understand rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ; the right faith about which is, that he was very man, of the substance of his mother. Now, if he were <b>very</b> <b>and</b> <b>real</b> man, he must have been also <b>very</b> <b>and</b> <b>real</b> babe, <b>very</b> <b>and</b> <b>real</b> boy, <b>very</b> <b>and</b> <b>real</b> youth, <b>and</b> then <b>very</b> <b>and</b> <b>real</b> full-grown man.|$|R

500|$|... he lyric is {{very much}} about her. She talks about being {{surrounded}} by friends but she's alone: 'How can the silence seem so loud?' and then 'There's only us when the lights go down'. I think that's probably the most personal line on the whole album about her and Jay, because they are <b>very</b> <b>real,</b> <b>and</b> they're very much in love, {{and it must be}} pretty tough to have that love when you're incredibly famous.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s under Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential {{administration}} {{and in the}} early 1960s under John F. Kennedy's, the CIA had been brainstorming and implementing plots to assassinate Fidel Castro, going as far as enlisting the help of American Mafia leaders such as Johnny Roselli and Santo Trafficante, Jr. to assist in carrying out their plans. Many assassination ideas were floated by the CIA in the covert operation which was dubbed [...] "Operation Mongoose." [...] The most infamous was the CIA's alleged plot to capitalize on Castro's well known love of cigars by slipping into his supply a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> lethal [...] "exploding cigar." [...] A November 4, 1967 Saturday Evening Post article reported that during Castro's visit to the United Nations in 1966 a CIA agent approached New York City police chief inspector Michael J.

[...] Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair, however, stating, [...] "I think they're good for each other in a lot of ways, in a way that Chuck and Blair aren't." [...] Badgley claimed that he thought [...] "Blair [...] Dan’s soul mate" [...] and further stated that he thought the Blair and Dan storyline was [...] "the most exciting for Dan as a person".

500|$|The {{episode is}} {{presented}} in four acts, each beginning in total silence and with a close-up shot of Joyce's pale, staring face. Shooting the first act was difficult for Gellar (Buffy). Whedon shot the scene where she finds her mother as one long take, showing her move {{through the house and}} calling the paramedics, about seven times. The rest of the scenes in the act were shot in sequence. At the end, Giles arrives and also attempts to revive Joyce, but Buffy blurts, [...] "We're not supposed to move the body!" [...] Both Gellar and Trachtenberg (Dawn) were raised by single women, and Gellar later spoke about the experience of acting something that was <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> close to her, stating, [...] "you try to separate it as best you can {{and at the same time}} it adds that extra layer". As soon as the scene was finished with Gellar [...] "at a fever pitch", they restarted it where she comes in the door happily, which Whedon regretted for the emotional range Gellar was required to endure.|$|E
500|$|The {{cooperative}} puzzle solving aspect was highlighted as {{a valuable}} addition to the game. Welsh called the cooperative mode [...] "one of the most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend". Onyett wrote, [...] "Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but requires you to work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success". Several reviewers praised the non-verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners. Portal 2 was praised {{for the amount of}} detail in its design, sound, and music. Nelson credited the [...] "sheer amount of detail" [...] put into the game's world, and wrote, [...] "it all feels <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> natural with brief moments where you're simply sucked into this world". Onyett was impressed with the amount of visual details and capabilities Valve achieved from their Source game engine and that the added details and animations of the levels [...] "consistently serv not only to entertain the eye but to expand our understanding of the game's characters". Hoggins wrote that the game's world reacted to the player-character Chell's presence [...] "in a startlingly organic way", and praised Valve's design as [...] "an achievement of world-building that compares favourably with BioShock underwater city of Rapture".|$|E
500|$|Milian {{described}} So Amazin as a [...] "consistent, <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> personal album". A problem Milian {{had with}} her previous album, It's About Time, was {{that it did not}} flow. The various pop and urban influences in that album confused the audience, and Milian wanted So Amazin to paint a picture; [...] "you get led down the whole way, you kinda get to see my growth through one album". Wanting a more consistent approach for her new album, Milian collaborated with only one team of producers, which made for a greater representation of a [...] "more mature, settled" [...] Milian. The purpose of the album was to record an album that had more realness, so that female fans could relate to what she was singing about. Milian felt that Cool & Dre brought their own style of beats to the album, giving it a [...] "raw feel" [...] and [...] "street credibility". Marcello [...] "Cool" [...] Valenzano of Cool & Dre said that [...] "we come from an R background, and we bringing [...] something new to the table, a style we think is hot." [...] For So Amazin, Milian knew that she needed to record material that had a [...] "realness". She wanted to make dance tracks, but also wanted to express more of herself at the same time. Milian found the album to be [...] "so much more real and urban and street" [...] than her previous albums.|$|E

500|$|Recurring {{cast members}} who appear in [...] "Acafellas" [...] are Stephen Tobolowsky as former glee club {{director}} Sandy Ryerson, Patrick Gallagher as football coach Ken Tanaka, Iqbal Theba as Principal Figgins, Kent Avenido as Sheets and Things employee Howard Bamboo, and Naya Rivera and Heather Morris as glee club members Santana Lopez and Brittany Pierce. Whit Hertford guest-starred as choreographer Dakota Stanley. Cheyenne Jackson was originally {{supposed to play}} Dakota Stanley, but {{when he arrived in}} California he learned that he had the flu. John Lloyd Young played Henri, [...] "a retired wood shop teacher with an excellent singing voice", and Victor Garber and Debra Monk played Will's parents. Morrison was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Garber's casting, having been a longstanding fan of his. Josh Groban received special guest star billing, playing, in Colfer's words, [...] "himself as this ignorant asshole". Morrison's rapping in the episode was an already acquired skill, with Gilsig commenting: [...] "He can do it. It didn't look like a joke, it actually looked totally authentic, and he was fantastic. I think he has just an amazing musical range. People like that who have been singing their whole lives, they have such a command of that." [...] Riley deemed Kurt's coming out in the episode [...] "very emotional" [...] and [...] "one of [...] favorite scenes".

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was <b>very</b> <b>real,</b> <b>and</b> this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E

Initially, Reitman had conceived of Juno being a fan of glam rock, but rejected it as too inauthentic, and {{he said he wanted to}} construct Juno to be [...] "into music <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>and</b> authentic", making her a fan of punk rock, including The Runaways, Patti Smith and Iggy Pop and the Stooges. [...] He felt that the Sonic Youth cover of [...] "Superstar" [...] defined Juno and Mark's relationship—Juno preferring the classic 1971 version by The Carpenters while Mark preferred Sonic Youth's 1994 cover. [...] "A Well Respected Man" [...] by The Kinks was a song Reitman had associated with a character from another of his screenplays and says it was [...] "heart-breaking" [...] when he decided to include the song as an introduction for Paulie instead, despite feeling it suited the scene perfectly. He found children's songwriter Barry Louis Polisar's [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] after [...] "surfing iTunes for hours on end" [...] using different words and names as search terms and thought that the handmade quality was perfect for the opening titles, which were afterwards made to correspond to the song.
