The organ models have a parameterized representation that supports real-time interactive deformation. To accomplish real-time interaction with deformable organs, instead of computing the deformation on the 3 D organ models in 3 D space {{we use a}} novel yet simple and fast free-form deformation on the 2 D parameterized representation itself. We also show that our parameterized representation can be extended to efficiently perform collision detection of tool tip with organs. With the parameterized mesh, we also demonstrate that realistic visual and haptic rendering can be provided for interactive surgery simulation...|$|R

Although they can adapt to most of the differences with standard surgery (eye-hand coordination, 2 D vision, etc.), it seems that an efficient training on a simulator could greatly enhance the control of surgical procedures. Nevertheless, whatever the quality of the simulation, an apprenticeship on animals or humans will probably remain unavoidable for years. That is the reason why we only focus on a simulator for gesture training, where a surgical procedure is broken d [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|This kind {{of virtual}} reality is most often used in the {{training}} of surgeons in laparoscopic procedures, as in reality {{it is not possible}} to see the operation being performed. The simulator uses a computer screen displaying a three-dimensional graphic of the organs being operated on. Various surgical tools or gloves are connected to motion sensors and haptic or tactile feedback mechanisms where the user can physically feel the difference in simulated tissue and organs. The user can [...] "perform surgery" [...] upon the <b>virtual</b> <b>organs</b> by manipulating the tools, which are also displayed on the screen as the user moves them, and the tools also provide force-feedback and collision detection to indicate to the user when they are pushing on or moving some organs or tissue. By inputting data from computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans the patient can be replicated in the virtual environment. The simulations can also provide more intensive training activity with the introduction of rare pathological cases and complications.|$|R

40|$|The thymus has a {{pyramidal}} shape, {{which is}} best shown in coronal planes. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the potential of <b>virtual</b> <b>organ</b> computer-aided analysis to estimate fetal thymus volume in normal pregnancies. Three-dimensional volume data sets from the axial upper mediastinal section were acquired from 37 normal pregnancies between 12 and 35 weeks' gestation. Thymus volume was calculated by <b>virtual</b> <b>organ</b> computer-aided analysis by 2 separate examiners. In 12 cases, volumes were also acquired with 4 -dimensional sonography and spatiotemporal image correlation software to assess the variability in thymus size between the systolic and diastolic periods of fetal heart motion. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between the fetal thymus volume and gestational age. Paired Student t tests were used to evaluate both the level of agreement for interobserver and intraobserver variability and the difference between diastolic and systolic thymus volumes. Identification of the borders of the thymus and calculation of its volume were successful in 28 patients (77. 7 %). Statistically significant linear growth of the thymus during pregnancy, from 12 to 35 weeks, was found. The growth coefficient for each gestational age was 0. 43 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 355 to 0. 504; P <. 001). The difference in thymus size between systole and diastole was minor (0. 0798 cm(3); 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 044 to 0. 203 cm(3)). Interobserver and intraobserver variability was not statistically significant. Although the thymus has a complex shape, it was possible to determine its borders and to calculate its volume by <b>virtual</b> <b>organ</b> computer-aided analysis in 77. 7 % of cases. Linear growth during pregnancy was found, and the minor changes during systole and diastole could be explained by condensation of the soft tissue of the thymus secondary to cardiac activity...|$|E
