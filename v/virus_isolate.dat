40|$|A devastating {{outbreak}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), {{caused by a}} porcinophilic serotype O virus, occurred in Taiwan in March 1997. This outbreak was brought under control {{by means of a}} stamping-out policy and vaccination. Although mandatory vaccination was conducted in Taiwan between 1997 and 2007, sporadic outbreaks of FMD occurred between 1998 and 2009; however, the viruses that caused these outbreaks remain uncharacterized. This article reports the genetic and antigenic characterization of FMD <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in Taiwan during this period. Sequence analysis of the VP 1 coding region showed that the <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in Taiwan between 1998 and 2009 were most similar to <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in Taiwan in 1997 and to <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> from Hong Kong and Vietnam in 1991 - 1996. The results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that the <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in Taiwan in 1998 - 2009 were derived from the <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in Taiwan in 1997. However, substantial mutations were found in the <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in 2009, and some of these changes may have resulted from vaccine pressure in the field. Serum neutralization tests confirmed that <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> in 2009 showed a significant change in antigenicity. This is the first report of changes in the VP 1 sequence and antigenicity of porcinophilic FMD <b>viruses</b> <b>isolated</b> from an area in which long-term mandatory vaccination against FMD was practiced.

40|$|Viruses {{from the}} recent {{epidemic}} of swine vesicular disease (SVD) in Europe have been isolated and characterized by antigenic and genetic methods to examine the likely epidemiological origins of the disease. Antigenic analysis was performed on 77 SVD <b>viruses</b> (SVDV) <b>isolated</b> in Europe between 1966 and 1994 using two panels of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) in a trapping ELISA. Genetic analysis of 33 of the SVD viruses by reverse transcription-polymerase chain-reaction (RT-PCR) amplification and nucleotide sequencing of the ID (VP 1) coding region was also performed. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences {{with each other and}} with three other previously published SVDV sequences revealed four distinct groups which correlated exactly with the results of the pattern of reactivity with MAbs. The first group consisted solely of the earliest SVD <b>virus</b> <b>isolated</b> (ITL/ 1 / 66) while the second group comprised viruses present in Europe and Japan between 1972 and 1981.

Each specific known genetic variation is traceable to a <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> of a specific case of infection. Through antigenic drift, H5N1 has mutated into dozens of highly pathogenic varieties divided into genetic clades which are known from specific isolates, but all currently belonging to genotype Z of avian influenza virus H5N1, now the dominant genotype. H5N1 isolates found in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2001 were not consistently transmitted efficiently among birds and did not cause significant disease in these animals. In 2002, new isolates of H5N1 were appearing within the bird population of Hong Kong. These new isolates caused acute disease, including severe neurological dysfunction and death in ducks. This was the first reported case of lethal influenza virus infection in wild aquatic birds since 1961. Genotype Z emerged in 2002 through reassortment from earlier highly pathogenic genotypes of H5N1 that first infected birds in China in 1996, and first infected humans in Hong Kong in 1997. Genotype Z is endemic in birds in Southeast Asia, has created at least two clades that can infect humans, and is spreading across the globe in bird populations. Mutations occurring within this genotype are increasing their pathogenicity. Birds are also able to shed the virus {{for longer periods of time}} before their death, increasing the transmissibility of the virus.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, a <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> {{collected}} from pumpkin plants (Cucurbita pepo L.), showing severe symptoms of mosaic and leaf deformation, grown in Cuba, was analyzed using indicator plants, electron microscopy, and phylogenetic analysis. Plants of pumpkin, cv. Caserta, inoculated with this <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> showed mosaic, leaf distortion and blistering symptoms, whereas papaya plants were immune {{and did not}} show any symptoms. A transmission electron microscopic examination of leaf dip preparations made from infected pumpkin leaves revealed the presence of elongated and flexuous particles, approximately 780 - 800 x 12 nm in size. Genomic fragments containing the coat protein (CP) and HC-Pro genes, amplified by specific primers for Papaya ringspot virus, W strain (PRSV-W), showed amino acid identities of both genes higher than 94 % {{when compared to other}} PRSV-W isolates from America. In the phylogenetic tree, this <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> has grouped with other virus isolates from America, Australia, and India and was more distant from the Asian isolates. Taken together, the analyses allow the conclusion that this <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> is a W strain of PRSV, detected {{for the first time in}} Cuba...|$|E
40|$|Five murine {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) {{against the}} NADL strain of bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus were developed, identified, and characterized. Four of the MAbs were directed against a 53 -kilodalton (kDa) viral protein, {{and one was}} specific to a 47 -kDa polypeptide. Competitive radioimmunoassay showed that two MAbs were specific to related epitopes of the 53 -kDa protein, {{and the other three}} MAbs were each specific to a different epitope. The MAbs were used to study heterogeneity among BVD virus strains. Various degrees of reactivity of cytopathic and noncytopathic <b>virus</b> <b>isolates</b> were detected by virus neutralization and immunofluorescence assays. The <b>virus</b> <b>isolates</b> were divided into six groups based on the neutralization test.

None of the MAbs neutralized all the BVD <b>virus</b> <b>isolates</b> tested in this study, suggesting antigenic variations among BVD <b>virus</b> <b>isolates...</b>|$|R

Cross-resistance evaluation indicated that the two drug resistant virus isolates were phenotypically distinct from one another although each of the virus isolates was resistant to both of the HEPT derivatives The <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> resistant to NSC 648400 had a single amino acid change in the reverse transcriptase (Y 181 C) which resulted in cross-resistance {{to all of the}} nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors evaluated, with the exception of calanolide A. The NSC 648400 -resistant <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> exhibited 15 -fold enhanced sensitivity to calanolide A. The <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> selected in the presence of HEPT exhibited a single amino acid change (P 236 L) which was not cross- resistant to other nonnucleoside RT inhibitors tested {{with the exception of the}} two HEPT derivatives. This HEPT-resistant <b>virus</b> <b>isolate</b> exhibited enhanced sensitivity (5 - to 10 -fold) to thiazolobenzimidazole. We have used both virus isolates with defined single amino acid changes in the RT and bacterially expressed RTs with site-directed amino acid substitutions to test the effects of a wide variety of mutations on the activity of NSC 648400 Single mutations at amino acids 101, 103, 106, 181, or 236 yielded virus with high resistance (> 20 -fold) to NSC 648400, while lower levels of resistance were seen with mutations at amino acids 98, 100, or 108. These results suggest that several changes in the conformation of the nonnucleoside inhibitor binding site of the HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase can affect the inhibitory activity of the HEPT class of compounds...|$|E
