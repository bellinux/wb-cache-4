This procedure differentiates between the false negatives and the true negatives. The cylinder heads rejected in the second step are separated afterwards from the main stream of the transportation line.

This syndrome complex includes congenital bicuspid aortic valve, Seller’s grade II aortic regurgitation, juxta-subclavian coarctation, stenosis of ostium of left subclavian artery and ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm without any evidence of infective endocarditis. This type of constellation is extremely rare. Neither coarctation of aorta with left subclavian artery stenosis nor the rupture of sinus Valsalva had a favorable pathology for percutaneus intervention. Taking account into morbidity associated with repeated surgery and anesthesia patient underwent a single stage surgical repair of both the defects by two surgical incisions. The approaches include median sternotomy for rupture of sinus of Valsalva and lateral thoracotomy for coarctation with left subclavian artery stenosis. The surgery was uneventful.

In this paper, a novel {{sliding mode control}} based high-precision hydraulic pressure feedback modulation is proposed. Dynamical models of the hydraulic brake system including valve dynamics are established.

40|$|Short whole {{circumference}} and semi-circumference intussusception valves {{were created}} in interposition cholecysto-jejunal-duodenal conduits in pigs to determine which method best prevented gastrointestinal reflux into the biliary tract. Following intravenous injection of 99 mTc-HIDA the time interval for its excretion from the liver and appearance in the duodenum was not different in either whole or semicircumference valve animals or in controls without valves. After intragastric administration of 99 mTc-DTPA the relative radioactivity of gallbladder contents (reflux) in the cohort without valves {{was significantly higher than}} in both cohorts with valves. Animals with semi-circumferential valves in turn had significantly higher levels of nuclide than those with whole circumference valves. Reflux was observed grossly in 100 % of animals without valves, in 20 % of those with semi-circumference valves, and in no animals with whole circumference valves.

50|$|Although a {{clean and}} unoiled valve of a well {{maintained}} instrument should move without unusual force, {{the inside of a}} musical instrument is a very inhospitable environment for a delicate valve mechanism. The musician constantly blows warm moist air through the valve. To make matters worse, impurities may be blown from the musician's mouth into the instrument. Even if nothing grows in the valve, the condensation and changing temperature of the metal can cause an untreated valve to bind, possibly resulting in a stuck valve. Even a minor binding of a valve affects the playability of the instrument and is at least very annoying. Also, woodwind musicians use <b>valve</b> oil (called <b>key</b> oil for woodwinds since they do not have <b>valves,</b> they have <b>keys)</b> to lubricate the mechanism of the keys to improve the springback action.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveWe {{studied the}} {{pathologic}} features, cellular phenotypes, and matrix remodeling of clinical pulmonary-to-aortic valve transplants functioning up to 6 years. MethodsNine autografts and associated vascular walls early (2 - 10 weeks) and late (3 - 6 years) postoperatively were examined by using routine morphologic methods and immunohistochemistry. In 4 cases autograft and homograft cusps {{were obtained from}} the same patients. ResultsAutografts had near-normal trilaminar cuspal structure and collagen architecture and viable valvular interstitial and endothelial cells throughout the time course. In contrast, cusps of homografts used to replace the pulmonary valves in the same patients were devitalized. In early autograft explants, 19. 3 % ± 2. 4 % of cuspal interstitial cells were myofibroblasts expressing α-actin. In contrast, myofibroblasts comprised only 6. 0 % ± 1. 1 % of cells in late explants and 2. 5 % ± 0. 4 % and 4. 6 % ± 0. 8 % of cells in normal pulmonary and aortic valves, respectively (P <. 05). In early autografts only 12. 0 % ± 4. 6 % of endothelial cells expressed the systemic arterial endothelial cell marker EphrinB 2, whereas later explants had 85. 6 % ± 5. 4 % of endothelial cells expressing EphrinB 2 (P <. 05). In early autografts 43. 8 % ± 8. 8 % of interstitial cells expressed metalloproteinase 13, whereas late autografts had 11. 4 % ± 2. 7 % of interstitial cells expressing matrix metalloproteinase 13 (P <. 05). Collagen content in autografts was comparable with that of normal valves and was higher than that seen in homograft valves (P <. 005). However, autograft walls were damaged, with granulation tissue (early) and scarring, with focal loss of normal smooth muscle cells, elastin, and collagen (late). ConclusionsThe structure of pulmonary valves transplanted to the systemic circulation evolved toward that of normal aortic <b>valves.</b> <b>Key</b> processes in this remodeling included onset of a systemic endothelial cell phenotype and reversible plasticity of fibroblast-like valvular interstitial cells to myofibroblasts...|$|R
