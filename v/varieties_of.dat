5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> sheep landrace. Attempts {{have been made to}} {{classify}} the sheep based on factors such as tail shape and wool type, and H.

However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed that there are only four distinct <b>varieties</b> <b>of</b> Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E

40|$|Let K be an {{infinite}} field. We prove {{that if a}} <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> alternating K-algebras (not necessarily associative, where xx= 0 is a law) is locally algebraically cartesian closed, then {{it must be a}} <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> Lie algebras over K. In particular, Lie_K is the largest such. Thus, for a given <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> alternating K-algebras, the Jacobi identity becomes equivalent to a categorical condition: it is a law in V if and only if V is a subvariety of a locally algebraically cartesian closed <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> alternating K-algebras. This is based on a result saying that an algebraically coherent <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> alternating K-algebras is either a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> Lie algebras or a <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> antiassociative algebras over K...|$|R
