5|$|The sale {{of certain}} offices and titles was reintroduced in Eastern Han by Empress Dowager Deng Sui—who reigned as regent from 105–121 AD—to raise {{government}} revenues {{in times of}} severe natural disasters and the widespread rebellion of the Qiang people in western China. The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the eunuch-dominated government of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 AD), when many top official posts were sold at the highest bidder instead of being filled by <b>vetted</b> candidates who had taken Imperial examinations or attended the Imperial University.|$|E

The administration joined several countries in delivering non-lethal assistance to so-called rebels opposed to the Assad government and humanitarian groups working in Syria. During mid-2012, Clinton formed a plan with CIA Director David Petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training <b>vetted</b> groups of Syrian rebels, but the proposal {{was rejected by the}} White House officials who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park {{was created}} for hunting by Henry Vlll in 1536 after he {{acquired}} the manor of Hyde from the Abbey. It was enclosed as a deer park and remained a private hunting ground until James I permitted limited access to gentlefolk, appointing a ranger to take charge. Charles I created the Ring (north of the present Serpentine boathouses), and in 1637 he opened the park to the general public. It quickly became a popular gathering place, particularly for May Day celebrations. At {{the start of the}} English Civil War in 1642, a series of fortifications were built along {{the east side of the}} park, including forts at what is now Marble Arch, Mount Street and Hyde Park Corner.

His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes where single mothers could be accommodated during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.|$|E
5|$|Although MalcolmX {{retained}} {{final approval}} of their hybrid text, {{he was not}} privy to the actual editorial processes superimposed from Haley's side. The Library of Congress held the answers. This collection includes the papers of Doubleday's then-executive editor, Kenneth McCormick, who had worked closely with Haley for several years as the Autobiography had been constructed. As in the Romaine papers, I found more evidence of Haley's sometimes-weekly private commentary with McCormick about the laborious process of composing the book. They also revealed how several attorneys retained by Doubleday closely monitored and <b>vetted</b> entire sections of the controversial text in 1964, demanding numerous name changes, the reworking and deletion of blocks of paragraphs, and so forth. In late 1963, Haley was particularly worried about what he viewed as MalcolmX's anti-Semitism. He therefore rewrote material to eliminate a number of negative statements about Jews in the book manuscript, with the explicit covert goal of 'getting them past MalcolmX,' without his coauthor's knowledge or consent. Thus, the censorship of MalcolmX had begun well prior to his assassination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate. However, Warren repeatedly stated that she was not running for President in 2016. In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being <b>vetted.</b> On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E

40|$|Overview The {{vocational}} {{education and training}} (<b>VET)</b> system in Australia plays {{a central role in}} the development of skills for the Australian workforce and through that role makes a critical contribution to workforce participation, productivity levels, individual’s life chances and economic and social development. The level of public and private investment in <b>VET</b> is therefore an important public policy issues. The Mitchell Institute has pointed to declining levels of public investment in <b>VET.</b> This paper has been specifically prepared to help inform consideration and debate about the future <b>VET</b> of funding in Australia. <b>VET</b> is currently funded under a shared funding model between the Commonwealth and the states, while higher education is funded by the Commonwealth. A draft paper prepared by the Commonwealth Government for the Council of Australian Governments proposes that the Commonwealth now also assume responsibility for funding <b>VET</b> – a proposal that has attracted both support and opposition. The significant increases in outlays to <b>VET</b> providers under the Commonwealth’s <b>VET</b> FEE-­‐HELP scheme and the settings for <b>VET</b> FEE-­‐HELP are another important consideration in <b>VET</b> funding policy. The paper summarises the evolution of the <b>VET</b> shared funding model and assesses its effectiveness over time in terms of funding, participation and enrolments and the changing shares of Commonwealth and state funding particularly through <b>VET</b> FEE-­‐HELP. It concludes by outlining, in broad terms, options for future funding responsibility for <b>VET.</b> More detailed design options will be included in the Institute’s forthcoming paper on tertiary education funding...|$|R

5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are <b>vetted</b> by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its verdict is final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the status}} and role of {{research}} in <b>VET</b> reform? How are the views of practitioners positioned in <b>VET</b> research and reform?

This paper explores the sequestions drawing on literature and also on my experience as a <b>VET</b> practitioner and researcher. The national <b>VET</b> research strategy supports a substantial research effort to inform policy and practice. However, in a complex and unstable <b>VET</b> environment, funded research focuses on implementation, rather than critique, of current directions.

But I question the extent to which current <b>VET</b> consultation and research processes incorporate the views of practitioners. I illustrate these issues by providing a brief overview of my PhD research project, currently being conducted through the Faculty of Education, Deakin University. This project explores the proposition that the language form typically used in official national <b>VET</b> texts is representative of, and constructive in, unequal power relationships. <br /...|$|R
