25|$|Hiddink {{was born}} in Varsseveld and started {{his career as a}} player in the youth side of amateur club SC Varsseveld. He turned {{professional}} after signing on for Dutch club De Graafschap in 1967. Hiddink played at the Doetinchem club under manager Piet de <b>Visser.</b> In 1973, Hiddink and manager de <b>Visser</b> earned promotion to the Eredivisie, the top league in Dutch football. Ever since, the careers of the two Dutchmen have intersected: De <b>Visser</b> scouted numerous South American players, such as PSV players Ronaldo, Romário (who played under Hiddink at PSV from 1988 until 1990) and former Chelsea defender Alex, for Hiddink's PSV. Also, De <b>Visser,</b> in his role as personal advisor to Roman Abramovich, was influential in bringing Hiddink to the Russia national football team and more recently to Chelsea as caretaker manager following the dismissal of Brazilian Luiz Felipe Scolari. It was De <b>Visser</b> who introduced Hiddink to Abramovich during a meeting in Eindhoven in 2004. He spent most of his playing career at De Graafschap, including three years under de <b>Visser,</b> and remains a fan of the club. He joined PSV in 1970, but after failing to win a permanent position in the team, he rejoined De Graafschap after just one year and remained there until 1977. In 1981, he rejoined De Graafschap and retired a year later. He generally played as a midfielder during his playing days.|$|E

25|$|Derksen {{continued}} the playing style {{he had developed}} in the past years. Notorious is Veendam's away match against Derksen's former club Cambuur in 1973. The second half had only just started when Derksen received a yellow card from referee G. Jonker from Voorburg. Derksen later made an extremely harsh foul by charging Cambuur's centre-back Sietse <b>Visser</b> in a , leaving the unfortunate <b>Visser</b> severely injured. <b>Visser</b> left the pitch on a stretcher. Despite this, referee Jonker did not send Derksen off. The furious crowd chanted en masse insults at Derksen, which he returned with a well-known obscene hand gesture {{at the moment he}} was about to leave the playing field. Out of fear for a lynching (Note:Dysphemism) the police closed the gates to ensure the visiting team would be granted a safe passage home. Sulking, but without demur the fans watched from behind the gate how the Veendam players laughed, scornfully, from behind the safe windows of their coach.|$|E
