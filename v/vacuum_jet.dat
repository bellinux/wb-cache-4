40|$|I {{present an}} {{overview}} {{of some of the}} recent results on jets and jet-like correlation measurements from the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Jets are produced in the initial hard scatterings of an event and can therefore be exploited as probes of the hot and dense medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Previous RHIC results indicate that this medium, the Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP), is strongly coupled, with partonic degrees of freedom. High pT colored partons passing through the sQGP are therefore believed to suffer energy loss via induced gluon radiation and elastic collisions, before exiting the medium and fragmenting in <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Jet</b> reconstruction and high pT correlation studies allow us to investigate how the partons interact with the medium and how the medium responds to the partons moving through it. By comparing measurements from pp and d-Au to those in Au-Au collisions at sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV we aim to disentangle cold nuclear matter effects from those of the hot and dense sQGP.

40|$|Jets are a {{dominant}} feature of high energy particle interactions {{and can be}} interpreted {{in terms of the}} fragmentation of quarks and gluons produced in a hard scattering process. Jets provide important tools for studying hot and dense Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) matter that is created in high energy collisions of heavy nuclei. In heavy ion collisions, such as Cu+Au, large transverse momentum partons traverse the colored Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) medium and lose energy which modifies the jet structure relative to jets generated in the <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Jet</b> production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is investigated using the Cu+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. The measurements reported here utilize 200 GeV Cu+Au and p+p data recorded by the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in 2012 RHIC running period. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles and electromagnetic calorimeter clusters using the anti-kt algorithm with R = 0. 2. Inclusive, centrality-dependent jet yields within absolute pseudorapidity 3 ̆c 0. 35 and 12. 0 3 ̆c p_T 3 ̆c 42. 0 GeV/c are presented. The jet yield in Cu+Au collisions relative to the geometric expectation is found to be suppressed by approximately a factor of two in the most central events, nearly independent of the jet p_T.

40|$|Identified {{particle}} production ratios {{are important}} observables, used to constrain models of particle production in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements of the inclusive particle ratio in central heavy-ion collisions showed {{an increase of}} the baryon-to-meson ratio compared to proton-proton collisions at intermediate pT, the so-called baryon anomaly. One possible explanation of the baryon anomaly is that partons from the thermalized deconfined QCD matter hadronize {{in a different way}} compared to hadrons produced in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>jet.</b> In this work we extend on previous measurements by measuring particle ratios in the yield associated with a high-pT trigger particle. These measurements can potentially further constrain the models of particle production since they are sensitive to the difference between particles from a jet and particles that are produced in the bulk. We start by developing a particle identification method that uses both the specific energy loss of a particle and the time of flight. From there, we present a method to identify the particle yield associated with a high-pT trigger particle. We then measure the proton-to-pion and kaon-to-pion ratio in the jet peak and background of the associated yield in central Pb-Pb, central p-Pb and pp collisions. The observation that these particle ratios are higher in the background compared to the jet peak suggests that {{there is a difference between}} the mechanism of hadron production in the the underlying event and the jet. Furthermore, our results show that the particle ratios in the jet peak depend on the size of the system...|$|E
40|$|We {{address a}} recent puzzling {{result from the}} LHC: the jet {{fragmentation}} functions measured in PbPb and pp collisions appear very similar {{in spite of a}} large medium-induced energy loss (we will call this "jet fragmentation scaling", JFS). To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the propagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we adopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the (1 + 1) quasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of the coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of "mesons" with a finite mass and the screening of "quark" charge that are crucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that this approach describes quite well the <b>vacuum</b> <b>jet</b> fragmentation in e^+e^- annihilation at z≥ 0. 2 at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion measurements (z is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we find that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path λ of the jet is short, λ≤ 0. 3 fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity inferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at short mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low momenta p ∼ m, where m ≃ 0. 6 GeV is the typical meson mass. Meanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger than naively expected in string models. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

Measurements on tiles removed from the vessel indicate that all the vessel tiles contain less tritium than expected at #approx# 0. 1 g. Some uncertainty exists in the location of the remaining tritium. Further investigation has shown that a significant quantity of flakes (more than originally estimated) exists in the sub-divertor region.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{numerical}} study of plasma jets produced by intense laser matter interactions. Through this study we hope to better understand astrophysical jets and their recent experimental simulations in the laboratory. We paid special attention to radiation cooling and {{the interaction of the}} jet with ambient gas. Four cases are presented in this paper; two of them deal with the propagation of <b>jets</b> in <b>vacuum,</b> while in the other two the propagation takes place in the ambient gas. Available experimental results are reproduced to good accuracy in the <b>vacuum</b> case. For <b>jets</b> in ambient gas, we find that the existence of the surrounding gas confines the jet into a narrow cylindrical shape so that both the density and temperature of the jet remain high enough for effective radiation cooling. As a result, a collimated plasma jet is formed in these cases. The dimensionless parameters characterizing the laboratory jets and protostellar jets have overlapping domains. We also discuss the cooling lengths for our model and compare them with the corresponding values in the astrophysical jets. A plasma jet in the ambient gas experiment is proposed which is within the reach of present day technology, and can be relevant to astrophysical phenomena.

40|$|Tritium {{retention}} in TFTR [Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor] and JET [Joint European Torus] shows striking {{similarities and}} contrasts. In TFTR, 5 g of tritium were injected into circular plasmas over a 3. 5 year period, mostly by neutral-beam injection. In JET, 35 g were injected into divertor plasmas over a 6 month campaign, mostly by gas puffing. In TFTR, the bumper limiter provided a large source of eroded carbon {{and a major}} part of tritium was co-deposited on the limiter and vessel wall. Only a small area of the co-deposit flaked off. In JET, the wall is a net erosion area, and co-deposition occurs principally in shadowed parts of the inner divertor, with heavy flaking. In both machines, the initial tritium retention, after a change from deuterium [D] to tritium [T] gas puffing, is high and is due to isotope exchange with deuterium on plasma-facing surfaces (dynamic inventory). The contribution of co-deposition is lower but cumulative, and is revealed by including periods of D fueling that reversed the T/D isotope exchange. Ion beam analysis of flakes from TFTR showed an atomic D/C ratio of 0. 13 on the plasma facing surface, 0. 25 on the back surface and 0. 11 in the bulk.
