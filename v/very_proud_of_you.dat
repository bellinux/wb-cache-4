[...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 9, 1961, Cooper {{attended}} a dinner given {{in his honor}} at the Friars Club hosted by Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Attended by many of his industry friends, the dinner concluded with a brief speech by Cooper who said, [...] "The only achievement I'm proud of is the friends I've made in this community." [...] In mid-January, Cooper took his family to Sun Valley for their last vacation together. Cooper and Hemingway hiked through the snow together for the last time. On February 27, after returning to Los Angeles, Cooper learned that he was dying. He later told his family, [...] "We'll pray for a miracle; but if not, and that's God's will, that's all right too." [...] On April 17, Cooper watched the Academy Awards ceremony on television and saw his good friend James Stewart, who had presented Cooper with his first Oscar years earlier, accept on Cooper's behalf an honorary award for lifetime achievement—his third Oscar. Speaking to Cooper, an emotional Stewart said, [...] "Coop, I {{want you to know}} I'll get it to you right away. With it goes all the friendship and affection and the admiration and deep respect of all of us. We're very, <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Coop." [...] The following day, newspapers around the world announced the news that Cooper was dying. In the coming days he received numerous messages of appreciation and encouragement, including telegrams from Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, and a telephone call from President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Sewell {{appeared}} in the HBO miniseries John Adams as Alexander Hamilton.He received critical praise for his portrayal of [...] "merry monarch" [...] Charles II in the BBC's Charles II: The Power and The Passion. The series' cast included Ian McDiarmid, Helen McCrory, Rupert Graves and Shirley Henderson and spanned {{the life of the}} king from his last days in exile to his death. He co-starred in the controversial film Downloading Nancy, which was released on 5 June 2009. At the Sundance Film Festival in 2008, audiences walked out of the screening, and as of summer 2008, any theatrical release was still uncertain. Despite the controversy, Sewell continues to staunchly support the film. [...] "It's a film I'm <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of,</b> whether <b>you</b> consider that it fails or succeeds, {{whether you like it or}} don't like it. I'm proud to be in it".|$|R

It may have been a reckless thing to do, as Mr. Watson says, but you did it like a major, and saved our self-esteem as well as our money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Lestrade, [...] "I've {{seen you}} handle {{a good many}} cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that.

No, sir, we are <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> and if you come down to-morrow, there's not a man, from the oldest {{inspector}} to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand." ...|$|E

5000|$|At a {{press conference}} right after, Bailey {{continued}} the aggressive manner of his post-race interview: [...] "It's obvious that the gap {{was going to get}} bigger and my butt was going to get smaller and smaller as I pulled away from him. He {{knew he was going to}} get hammered after the first 30 meters, so he knew he had to pull up. This race was never going to prove who was the fastest in the world. All it was going to do was shut up Michael Johnson." [...] Asked to comment on Bailey's [...] "chicken" [...] remark, Johnson said: [...] "That's saying a lot about what kind of person he is. I'm going to show <b>you</b> what kind <b>of</b> person I am. I'm not going to address that". Another question alluded to Johnson [...] "packing it in" [...] when he fell behind and one more wondered if Johnson had been [...] "genuinely injured" [...] or if he had simply [...] "thrown the race", to which irritated Johnson responded by shooting back, [...] "I hope you're <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> yourself.

6000|$|... "All right, {{see that}} you don't. Interruptions always spoil a story," [...] said Jumper. [...] "You are quite right about old Mr. Lynx. He wasn't old then. No one was old, {{because it was in}} the {{beginning}} of things. At that time Mr. Lynx boasted a long tail, quite as fine a tail as his cousin, Mr. Panther. He was <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>You</b> know there is a saying that pride goes before a fall. It was so with Mr. Lynx. He boasted about his tail. He said that it was the finest tail in the world. He said so much that his neighbors got tired of hearing about it. He made a perfect nuisance of himself. He switched and waved his long tail about continually. It seemed as if that tail were never still. He made fun of those whose tails were shorter or of different shape or less handsome. He quite forgot that that tail had been given him by Old Mother Nature, but talked and acted as if he had grown that tail himself.|$|R
5000|$|Variety {{called the}} film a [...] "forbidding and morbid piece of psycho-sadomasochism" [...] with a [...] "swimming-in-the-deep-end {{performance}} by Maria Bello {{that is the}} definition of fearless". It also notes:Performances are cranked up to red-line neurotic levels, while production values intently contribute to creating an artificially bleak world where it's understandable scarcely anyone would want to spend time, even for the duration of this movie.Salon.com, in a report about the films at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, wrote:One film that will not be acquired by anybody at Sundance [...] - [...] I'll just crawl out on a limb with this one [...] - [...] is Downloading Nancy ... Bello's skin-peeling, ultra-depresso performance is wrenching and brave, calling for both emotional and physical nakedness. Can a film with those attributes also be insulting garbage? It's a difficult aesthetic-philosophical conundrum, but having sat through this damn thing I now have an answer."I just had the experience of being there at the screening at Sundance and watching the door flap open and closed," [...] says Rufus Sewell, who plays Nancy's husband Albert in the film. [...] "I didn't expect so many people to walk out at Sundance." [...] Despite the controversy, Sewell continues to staunchly support the film. [...] "I was delighted. ...It's a film I'm <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of,</b> whether <b>you</b> consider that it fails or succeeds, {{whether you like it or}} don't like it.

[...] He looked at the bony, trembling hands, with their huge, knotted knuckles, the stringy throat, and the heaving, rounded shoulders. Could this, indeed, be the last of that band of heroes? Then he glanced at the half-filled phials, the blue liniment bottles, the long-spouted kettle, and the sordid details of the sick room. [...] "Better, surely, had he died under the blazing rafters of the Belgian farmhouse," [...] thought the colonel.|$|E

You knew as well as I did that he never caught that trick of haughtiness, that grand air of command, in a lawyer's musty office, and that his speech had hardly the ring or his thoughts the complexion of the bourgeois that he pretended to be.

5000|$|On 1 July 2015, Mcelfresh {{performed}} {{his first}} show since the allegations were brought, at the Acoustic Basement at the Nashville, Tennessee stop of Warped Tour. Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman {{stated that he}} had spoken with Mcelfresh's personal counselor, {{who said that the}} performance would be a part of his therapy, he would not be paid for the show, and he would not appear at any other stops of the tour. Lyman stated that he allowed Mcelfresh to perform the show because he has not been charged with a misdemeanor, stating that [...] "If he was a legitimate danger to anyone, he simply wouldn't be here." [...] Many bands tweeted their opinions of the situation, practically all in distaste. Mcelfresh also dealt with a concertgoer in the crowd who publicly criticized him, saying [...] "The difference between you and me is that I know who I am, and I am <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> that.

At any rate, I am {{going to tell you what}} it was, and to leave to you to regard it as you please. Mr. Darwin took me up to his bedroom and pointed out certain things there-pitcher-plants, and so on, that he was measuring and watching from day to day--and he said: 'The chambermaid is permitted to do what she pleases in this room, but she must never touch those plants and never touch those books on that table by that candle. With those books I read myself to sleep every night.' Those were your own books." [...] I said: [...] "There is no question to my mind as to whether I should regard that as a compliment or not. I do regard it as a very great compliment and a very high honor that that great mind, laboring for the whole human race, should rest itself on my books. I am proud that he should read himself to sleep with them." ...|$|R

But you have seen how it is. The water of the stream never turns back to the spring, the old man never grows young, the tree that falls does not rise up again. So the old things come never again. We have always to look ahead. Perhaps, in the happy hunting-ground all will be different, but here now we must do our best to live upon the earth. It is the law that, now the game being gone, we must plough and sow and reap the fruit of the soil. That is the meaning of all we have done to-day. We have put away the rifle; we here take up the hoe.|$|E
6000|$|Major Pendennis was appeased instantly, {{and very}} much pleased. He tapped affectionately his nephew's arm on which he was leaning, and said,--"you, sir, you are my flesh and blood!

6000|$|But {{just then}} old Ku-Klip the Tinsmith arrived, {{and he seemed}} {{surprised}} to find so many visitors. Ku-Klip was a stout man and a short man.

And Ku-Klip had a gray beard that was {{almost as long as}} his apron, and his head was bald on top and his ears stuck out from his head like two fans. Over his eyes, which were bright and twinkling, he wore big spectacles. It was easy to see that the tinsmith was a kind hearted man, as well as a merry and agreeable one. [...] "Oh-ho!"
