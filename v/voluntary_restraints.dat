Dent said that Nixon would veto any bills with quotas except when the textile industry is involved. Democrats accused Republicans of weakening the textile industry because Nixon refused to use executive orders to curtail clothing imports. Republicans replied that presidential executive orders were unsuited in the matter of textile imports and that Congress alone had the legal authority to restrict such imports. [...] In 1974, after he had left the Nixon administration, Dent pleaded guilty to aiding an illegal fund-raising operation organized by the White House. He complained bitterly that he had pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor because he was certain that he would not receive a fair trial in the post-Watergate climate in Washington, D.C. A federal judge described Dent as “more of the victim than the perpetrator” and placed him on one month's unsupervised probation.|$|E

40|$|The {{realization}} of a multifaceted self {{is an ideal}} one strives to realize. One realizes such a self in large part through interaction with others in various social roles. Such realization requires a significant degree of informational privacy. Informational privacy {{is the ability to}} determine for yourself when others may collect and how they may use your information. The {{realization of}} multifaceted selves requires informational privacy in public. There is no contradiction here: informational privacy is a matter of control, and you can have such control in public. Current information processing practices greatly reduce privacy in public thereby threatening the realization of multifaceted selves. To understand way this is happening and {{to figure out how to}} respond, we analyze the foundations of privacy in public. Privacy in public consists in privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> Privacy by obscurity is essentially a matter of getting lost in the crowd. Privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> was perhaps first explicitly discussed by the great nineteen century sociologist, Georg Simmel. He was impressed by the fact that people voluntary limit their knowledge of each other as interact in various social roles. Merchants and customers, students and teachers, restaurant customers and waiters, for example, typically exchange only the information necessary to their interaction in those roles and voluntarily refrain from requesting, disclosing, or otherwise discovering more. Advances in information processing have greatly reduced both privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We focus on the latter. One reason is that, as privacy by obscurity declines, the need for privacy in public by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> increases. We confine our attention to the private sector; however, given the current corporate-government surveillance partnership, constraining private information processing is an essential part of constraining governmental processing. Unlike privacy by obscurity, you need the cooperation of others to realize privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We explain the cooperation by appeal to informational norms, norms that define contextually varying permissions and restrictions on the collection, use, and distribution of information. Norm-implemented coordination is essential to privacy in public (in the form of <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint),</b> and it is this coordination that advances in information processing and related business practices undermined. This happens in two ways. First, businesses exploit existing norms to create a debased form of “coordination” that serves their interests while eroding privacy in public. Second, technology-driven business innovation has created new forms of interaction not governed by relevant information norms. This lack of norms means the lack the coordination essential to privacy in public. As privacy in public disappears, multifaceted selves face the threat of disappearing—literally—from the scene. The solution is to establish norms that ensure sufficient privacy in public. We conclude by considering the prospects for doing so. Our results are highly relevant to the proper legal approach to privacy. A critical task for legal regulation, as well as public policy generally, is the creation of appropriate informational norms. One of our primary motives is to reorient privacy regulation toward that task...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present for the}} first time {{estimates}} of cost and efficiency differences between U.

We demonstrate that the cost difference estimates for 1979 which were influential in the debate that resulted in the <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Restraints</b> Agreements of 1981 - 85 were substantial over estimates of the Japanese advantage. While our estimate of the Japanese cost advantage for 1980 is similar to previous estimates, we attribute most of this advantage to short-run phenomena -underutilization of U. S. production capacity and an undervalued yen. In a previous paper we have shown that the Japanese TFP growth rate was much faster than the U. S. rate during the 1970 's. However we estimate the long-run underlying Japanese efficiency advantage as of 1980 to have been only 1 - 2 %, much less than previously estimated. This results from the fact that Japan began the 1970 's with a long-run efficiency disadvantage of over 20 %, and the decade of the 1970 's represented a catch-up period for Japanese producers. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses an {{experimental}} design {{to assess the}} effectiveness of calls on cooperation in managing the shortage of a vital commodity through non-price mechanisms. Using the large unexpected shortage of flu-vaccines in the Fall 2004, we observed {{the responses of the}} members of a campus population to two distinct randomized treatments: providing information about a sharply reduced number of vaccination clinics and their schedule, and providing the same information plus an appeal on <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraints</b> to favor priority groups. We find that information about the reduced number of clinics induced a 119 % increase in demand. Appeals to cooperation helped reduce this demand by only 19 %. Information about scarcity was effective in increasing the vaccination of priority individuals by 54 %, with virtually no exclusion errors among those who came to the clinic. However, a disconcerting result is that people not in priority groups responded even more to the information about scarcity than members of priority groups and, despite some screening done at the clinic itself, largely managed to be vaccinated. For every four legitimate additional vaccinations, three were given to non-priority persons. Furthermore, this number is certainly an underestimation, as it is based on self-declared membership in priority groups, and we have evidence that there was cheating on these declarations. The sobering conclusion is that broad-scale calls on cooperation, complemented by soft-screening, to manage the vaccine shortage were largely defeated by rising salience of vaccination and reduced procrastination among non-priority groups and by extensive cheating...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of special {{constraints on the}} freedom of essential service workers and their unions to take and organise industrial action {{has been on the}} Conservative government''s agenda for labour law reform for over a decade. So far, no proposals for legislation specifically directed to this issue have been forthcoming. Some of the general changes in the law of industrial conflict from 1980 - 1990 have, however, had a particular significance for some workgroups who most probably fall within the essential services area. Of equal if not greater significance have been fundamental, radical changes in the organisation of and practices within these services, some of which have been transferred out of the public sector. This paper outlines first the general law of industrial conflict and then the industrial relations framework in the areas which are generally agreed to be essential services and also those areas which arguably fall under this heading. The implications of the law for these groups of workers are then considered in the light of recent experience. By way of conclusion it is argued that although there has never been any consistent strategy for managing industrial conflict in essential services, the traditional methods of joint regulation and <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraints</b> were increasingly seen to be inadequate in major disputes over the last twenty years. Although no alternative way of regulating conflict in these areas has emerged, the likelihood of major disputes arising in the future has been significantly reduced by the government''s policies on compulsory contracting for the delivery of many services, and fragmentation of the nationalised industries, civil service and National Health Service into smaller units...|$|E

40|$|The author investigates {{market power}} and the {{distribution}} of rents in the market for Mexico's exports of apparel tothe United States under the Multi - Fibre Arrangement (MFA). Conventional wisdom holds that <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraints,</b> such as those under the MFA, are superior to other kinds of trade barriers because they allow developing countries to receive the scarcity rents from quantity restriction. Recently {{a number of studies have}} questioned this orthodoxy. Erzan, Krishna, and Tan (1991), in particular, have pointed out that if market power exists only on the side of the importers, they can acquire some of the fixed rents resulting from quotas, in a form of"rent-sharing". In Mexico's case, rents resulting from MFA restrictions are probably small, since few of the quotas imposed are binding. And other institutional arrangements - such as production sharing under HTS 9802 and a liberal quota regime for goods made with U. S. inputs - further mitigate the MFA's restrictiveness. Mexican exporters probably receive only a fraction of available rents, says the author. The welfare implications of MFA restrictions, and of market imperfections that might lead to rent-sharing, are thus not as significant in Mexico as they might be in countries for which conditions are more restrictive. But even for the few rents generated in Mexico's case, some rent-sharing is taking place. The author tests the existence of perfect markets and rent-sharing for six groups of Mexican apparel exports to the United States between 1981 and 1990; sweaters, trousers, men's coats, women's coats, woven shirts, and underwear. There are consistent differences between the unit value of U. S. production and the Mexico export f. o. b. price of apparel in the U. S. market adjusted for tariffs and transport costs. The adjusted price of Mexican exports is consistently below the price for U. S. production, which suggests that rent-sharing may be taking place. Using modifications of the methods of Erzan, Krishna, and Tan (1991), the author tests alternative explanations for the price difference - differences in composition of Mexican exports and U. S. production, and differences in the quality of Mexican exports and U. S. products. The existence of differences in composition between Mexican exports and U. S. production is rejected for three of the six groups. The author also controls for the existence of significant quality differences. The results indicate that rent- sharing may exist for woven shirts and underwear (two of the three groups in the sample that are consistently quota bound). U. S. importers may receive up to 49 percent of available rents.

40|$|CHAPTER 1. The Department of Entomology of the Research Institute for Agriculture at Maros is {{concerned}} with insect pests of food crops, and serves the needs of farmers, most of them living near subsistance level, and of extension workers. South Sulawesi, formerly known as South Celebes, is a major rice-growing province {{and one of the}} two provinces of Indonesia that produces a rice surplus. The area planted with rice is about 550, 000 hectares, which is {{more than half of the}} total arable land. A sketch of the agriculture of South Sulawesi is given. A justification of the activities is presented by the results that have been obtained while striving for a more up-to-date and varied research programme in order to achieve a better control of rice insects at farmers' level. CHAPTER 2. The major and minor insects pests of rice and the rice tungro virus are presented and the nature of damage described. The white stem borer, Tryporyza innotata is the most important pest. The rice seedbug, Leptocorisa oratorius, and the rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrosis medinalis, come next. Insects of minor significance include the whorl maggot Hydrellia phillippina, the caseworm Nymphula stagnalis, armyworms Spodoptera spp., the green leafhopper Nephotettix virescens, the white-backed planthopper Sogatella furcifera, the pink stem borer Sesamia inferens, the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis, the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, the green stinkbug Nezara viridula and grasshoppers. The brown planthopper is likely to become a major pest in South Sulawesi and it is quite possible that there will be other shifts in the future as well. CHAPTER 3. Evaluation systems for infestations in insecticide trials, in phenological studies and in varietal screening tests are described for the whorl maggot, caseworm, stem borers, brown planthopper, green leafhopper, leaf folder and seedbug. These systems include rating scales, assessments and direct and indirect counting methods. CHAPTER 4. Experiments to establish the crop losses inflicted by each individual insect species on its specific plant stages were conducted both in the field and in greenhouses. It was found that roughly 5 to 10 per cent of the crop is lost by the combined effects of normal, light infestations of Hydrellia, Cnaphalocrosis, Nymphula and grasshoppers up to four weeks after transplanting. Yield losses of 10 to 20 per cent caused by stem borers is the rule rather than the exception. There was a poor correlation between dead heart counts and yield loss, but every unit per cent white head consistently caused about one per cent loss in yield. Cnaphalocrosis medinalis infestations of the later vegetative and generative stages may often inflict losses of 5 to 10 per cent. Another 5 to 10 per cent is frequently caused by Leptocorisa oratorius, sucking on the ripening grains. Boiling mature grains in a KOH solution provides an easy and reliable method to assess the percentage of infested grains. This percentage of infested grains proved to be silimar to the yield loss inflicted. Defoliation experiments, designed to simulate the damage caused by leaffeeding insects, showed that rice does not fully recover after serious defoliations even in very early growing stages. The effect of defoliation is most severe between 7 and 9 weeks after transplanting. Towards maturity of the grains defoliation becomes progressively less damaging. Every one per cent increase in tungro infection reduces yield by a half or one per cent depending upon the rice variety and the time of infection. It is concluded that insects alone reduce the potential yield of rice varieties such as Pelita, C 4 - 63, IR 5, IR 20, IR 26, SPR and B 462 c by 1 to 3 tons per hectare or 30 to 40 per cent in South Sulawesi. CHAPTER 5. Population densities of most of the pest insects and the rice tungro virus incidence were monitored by rating scales and direct counts from the end of 1974 onwards. A light trap was used to monitor fluctuations of T. innotata, Ch. suppressalis, Noctuidae, Cn. medinalis, N. virescens and N. nigropictus. Of course, not many conclusions can be drawn from graphs that represent the data of less than two and a half years. They form, however, a basis for further work. CHAPTER 6. A great number of insecticide experiments were conducted with insecticides that became available in the late sixties and seventies. Up to about 1973 most of the attention was focussed on conventional applications, later other modes of applications were very successfully investigated. Insecticides proved to be effective in controlling the pest insects and tungro virus. Carbofuran is an excellent insecticide but chlordimeform, mephosfolan, cartap, diazinon, BPMC, monocrotophos and others are also good. Granular broadcast applications are superior to spraying. By far the best method is the root-zone application of systemic insecticides. The insecticide is applied between the roots and taken up by the plant. The Maros Research Institute developed and concentrated on the mud ball technique. If a lump, plucked from a big moist mud ball containing insecticide, is applied soon after transplanting, it often gives protection up to harvest time. The quantity of insecticide required is quite low, there is no equipment needed, it cannot be washed away, one application suffices and the secondary effects are probably negligible. The root-zone application almost invariably gives the highest yields and in many cases doubles even the best spray or granular application. It requires more labour, which is advantageous macro-economically, but is of course disliked by the farmer. It is envisaged that with the growing concern for the environment and ecosystems and the increasing prices of insecticides, there is a future for this rootzone application technique, in spite of its prophylactic nature. Several methods, such as mud balls and liquid applicator, and time and density of application are discussed. The total insecticide consumption in South Sulawesi is low, less than one litre per hectare per season. There is a discrepancy between what is available, what should be used and the actual demand. The situation is slowly changing for the better. CHAPTER 7. The incorporation of insect-resistant genes into high-yielding rice varieties has only recently been given much attention. Because of a coincidence, the search for varietal resistance has been most rewarding for Maros in the case of the leafhopper-transmitted tungro virus. Many thousand varieties and lines have been evaluated and the information has been incorporated into breeding material and varieties of the International Rice Research Institute and other institutions. From the screening for varietal resistance against the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, at least two local Sulawesi varieties were found promising for breeding activities. Biotype 1 is the predominant planthopper in South Sulawesi. The impact of the release of tungro-resistant varieties in South Sulawesi and brown planthopper resistant varieties elsewhere in Indonesia, has been enormous. In the latter case only temporary, due to the development of new biotypes. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>restraints</b> are suggested with the introduction of resistant material to places where that particular pest is not (yet) a problem, such as the brown planthopper in South Sulawesi. CHAPTER 8 A detailed account is given of the recent tungro outbreak transmitted by the green leafhopper, Nephotettix virescens, in South Sulawesi with special reference to some ecological and phenological aspects. Discouraging the growing of Pelita and increasing the growing of resistant varieties, especially C 4 - 63, IR 20 and some local varieties have been the main reason for the decrease in tungro incidence. Insecticide sprays and broadcast applications are fairly effective in controlling the virus. The root-zone application of carbofuran, BPMC, cartap and mephosfolan proved to be extremely effective. When these insecticides are applied to the root- zone, the green leafhopper is killed before it can transmit sufficient tungro inoculum. Rice plants are infected by tungro in the field after transplanting and not in the seedbed. Also, direct-seeded rice is less infected than transplanted rice...|$|E

40|$|The {{controlled}} {{laboratory experiment}} is spreading rapidly {{as a method}} for evaluating theories of economic behaviour and policy prescriptions. Environmental regulation {{is an area that}} is ripe for laboratory investigation. This paper presents insights drawn from the existing literature using laboratory methods in economics and related disciplines on the use of taxation and subsidy, standards and fines, transferable quota, and <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> as mechanisms for environmental regulation. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of import quotas and <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> (VER) on {{employment}} and welfare of an economy plagued by generalized unemployment due to wage rigidity. The welfare effects of quotas and VER {{in the presence of}} unemployment are compared with those derived in the traditional full employment model. We show that a tightening of quotas or VER may improve welfare. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1991 quotas, <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraint,</b> welfare,...|$|R
40|$|This paper reexamines why <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> are <b>voluntary.</b> It {{is shown}} that the results depend crucially on whether {{domestic}} goods and imports are regarded as strategic substitutes or strategic complements. This, in turn, depends on the following conditions: {{the form of the}} demand and the cost functions, and the nature of quantity competition. In particular, with linear demands and constant marginal costs, <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> are voluntary; they are not involuntary. ...|$|R

It believes that the necessary advance of the world toward a more highly organized political and economic order renders a free criticism of governments, administrations, and institutions imperative. And since freedom implies <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint,</b> members pledge themselves to oppose such evils of a free press as mendacious publication, deliberate falsehood, and distortion of facts for political and personal ends.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> in a dynamic game model of duopolistic competition. It is shown that {{the imposition of a}} <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraint</b> at the free-trade level of imports increases the market price and the profits of all firms in the industry if free trade is identified as the closed-loop (subgame-perfect) Cournot equilibrium of the game. Hence, the authors conclude that the predictions of static Cournot competition do not carry over to the dynamic case. ...|$|R

After building a model which incorporates the regional character of the North American lumber market, the authors simulate a variety of tariffs and quotas now advocated {{by a number of}} U. S. lawmakers. They find that the tariff losses incurred by Canadian producers could be substantial, depending on the elasticity of their export supply. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> agreements, however, might lead to Canadian gains as high as 40 percent of their preexisting profits. ...|$|R
40|$|In a three-country {{generalization}} of the Kreps-Scheinkman (1983) duopoly model with price competition and capacity constraints, the author analyzes {{the effects of}} discriminatory voluntary import expansions and <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> on equilibrium capacity and pricing decisions. <b>Voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> are shown to be bad for the exporting country, contradicting recent results in the literature by R. Harris (1985) and K. Krishna (1989). Voluntary import expansions are shown to decrease competition. Cases are analyzed where voluntary import expansions may actually lead to import contraction or to increases in efficiency in the home country. ...|$|R
