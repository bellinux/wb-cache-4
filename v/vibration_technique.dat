Kymographic images derived from high-speed videoendoscopy allow actual visualization of vocal folds vibration. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} is to identify the immediate effects of the voiced <b>vibration</b> <b>technique</b> in healthy vocal folds using high-speed digital laryngeal imaging. Methods: Samples were obtained from 15 healthy subjects with no history of voice disorders (6 men and 9 women aged 21 to 43 years). High-speed videoendoscopy recordings were performed before and after the voiced <b>vibration</b> <b>technique.</b> Kymographic images were obtained using high-speed videoendoscopy. The vocal folds were examined in their open and closed positions and the characteristics of the opening and closing phases were determined. A customize computational routine was used quantify these parameters. The closing, opening, and speed quotients were also calculated. Results: In this study, women displayed statistically significant differences in opened phase (P= 0. 05 *), closed phase (P= 0. 046 *), and closing phase (P= 0. 026 *) phase characteristics. Men displayed the highest difference rate in opening time characteristics (P= 0. 06). The closing and opening quotients for the female group showed significant differences (P= 0. 029 * and P= 0. 049 *, respectively). The speed quotient exhibited statistically significant differences in the male group (P= 0. 048 *). Conclusion: The kymographic images indicated that the immediate effect of the voiced <b>vibration</b> <b>technique</b> was smooth contact in healthy vocal fold vibration...|$|E
40|$|The grading of {{structural}} lumber besides contributing {{for increasing the}} structure's safety, due to {{the reduction of the}} material variability, also allows its rational use. Due to the good correlation between strength and bending stiffness, the latter has been used in estimating the mechanical strength of lumber pieces since the 60 ’s. For industrial application, there are equipment and techniques to evaluate the bending stiffness of lumber, through dynamic tests such as the longitudinal <b>vibration</b> <b>technique,</b> also known as stress wave, and the transverse <b>vibration</b> <b>technique.</b> This study investigated the application of these two techniques in the assessment of the modulus of elasticity in bending of Teca beams (Tectona grandis), from reforestation, and of the tropical species Guajará (Micropholis venulosa). The modulus of elasticity estimated by dynamic tests showed good correlation with the modulus measured in the static bending test.

Muscle weakness and proprioception deficit are the subsequent problems of this dysfunction. Thus, the aim of this study was the investigation and comparison of the effects of vibration training and resistive exercise on this disorder. Methods: In the present study, 35 men (mean ± standard deviation of: age = 22. 6 ± 2. 9 years, height = 175. 5 ± 8. 3 cm, and weight = 77. 6 ± 9. 3 kg) were selected via convenience sampling and randomly assigned to three groups, including the <b>vibration</b> <b>technique</b> (n= 12), resistive exercise (n= 12), and control (n= 11). The first two groups followed their own specific protocol 3 days per week for 8 weeks, and were forbidden from participating in any sport or physical activity. Pain intensity and active angle reproduction error (AARE) for 45 ? knee flexion were assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Biodex system. Results: The pain and AARE were decreased significantly in both experimental groups in comparison to the control group (P< 0. 001). However, in patients who performed vibration training, pain (P< 0. 001) and AARE (P? 0. 001) decreased more significantly than those treated with resistive exercise. Conclusion: It can be concluded that both therapeutic interventions can reduce pain and improve proprioception in patients with chondromalacia patella; however, the <b>vibration</b> <b>technique</b> has more suitable effects.

40|$|Introduction: Traditional {{methods of}} {{diagnosing}} aseptic loosening of total hip arthroplasties, such as radiography, scintigraphy and arthrography are unreliable. In 1989, Rosenstein et al at Oxford {{suggested that it}} was possible to detect loosening at an early stage using a <b>vibration</b> <b>technique.</b> However, the models they tested were probably very loose and would have been detectable by plain radiography, thus obviating the need for vibration testing. Aim: To find out if vibration technology is able to detect early loosening. Methods: Several models of loosening were created in-vitro. These included: 1. Late loosening hereby macromovement is present between bone and implant 2. Early mechanical loosening whereby the interlock between cement and trabecular bone is lost 3. The presence of soft tissue at the bone-cement interface 4. Early stem-cement debonding due to fatigue fracture of the cement mantle Each of those models was submitted to vibration testing and the output signal was analysed using the following methods: 1. Frequency (amplitude) response 2. Spectral analysis using the Fourier Transform Results: For late loosening, the <b>vibration</b> <b>technique</b> had an excellent diagnostic accuracy with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100 % (19 specimens). However only 3 out of 8 specimens showing early mechanical loosening were correctly diagnosed (sensitivity 37. 5 %). The presence of a layer of soft tissue at the bone-cement interface was vibrationally undetectable provided there was no associated mechanical instability. Finally, fatigue fracture of cement was also vibrationally undetectable in the absence of instability at the bone-cement interface. Conclusions: The <b>vibration</b> <b>technique</b> can diagnose late loosening with a high degree of accuracy. However, this is likely to be clinically and radiographically apparent without the need to resort to vibration testing. Results for early loosening have been less satisfactory and further work may be required to improve the sensitivity of the test...|$|E
