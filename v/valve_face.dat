40|$|The toxin-producing diatom Nitzschia pungens Grunow forma multiseries Hasle {{from three}} toxic blooms in two Prince Edward Island estuaries, {{spanning}} 1987 - 89, was studied using light and electron microscopy. Cell ultrastructure of N. pungens is, in general, {{similar to that}} of other species of Nitzschia and other diatoms. Important features include prominent peripheral, polarized nucleoli (numbering one or two) and imperforate poroids, present on inner valves and girdle bands.

Postdivisional elongation of the filament appears to involve a "slide-by" process whereby sibling cells slide by each other along their opposed <b>valve</b> <b>faces</b> and then stop, becoming fused by their overlapping tips.

5000|$|Maintaining UHV {{conditions}} {{requires the}} use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100 °C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon [...] "cycling" [...] the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an [...] "interlock" [...] is often used. The interlock volume has one door or <b>valve</b> <b>facing</b> the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which samples or workpieces are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a [...] "puff" [...] of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.|$|R

BackgroundIt has not been established which is the best aortic valve substitute in patients ages 55 to 70 years. We conducted a randomized study to compare long-term outcomes between BP and MP aortic valves. MethodsBetween January 1995 and June 2003, 310 patients were randomized to receive a BP or an MP aortic valve. Primary end points of the study were survival, valve failure, and reoperation. ResultsOne hundred fifty-five patients received a BP valve, and 155 patients received an MP valve. Four patients died, perioperatively, in the MP group (2. 6 %), and 6 patients died in the BP group (3. 9 %, p = 0. 4). At late follow-up (mean 106 ± 28 months) 41 patients died in the MP group and 45 patients died in the BP group (p = 0. 6). There was no difference in the survival rate at 13 years between the MP and BP groups. Valve failures and reoperations were more frequent in the BP group compared with the MP group (p = 0. 0001 and p = 0. 0003, respectively). There were no differences in the linearized rate of thromboembolism, bleeding, endocarditis, and major adverse prosthesis-related events (MAPE) between the MP and BP valve groups.

40|$|Abstract. Diaphragm {{gas meter}} is a {{specialized}} flow meter that measures {{the volume of}} fuel gas such as natural gas and coal gas. Valve bonnet and valve seat are the key parts of diaphragm gas meter, which compose the main factors of its metering error. The widely detecting ways are direct observational method and pneumatic pressure method. Direct observational method only realizes the qualitative detection with lacking science. Pneumatic pressure method can realize the quantitative detection, but with low accuracy and bad reliability. In order to evaluate the gas tightness of diaphragm gas meter valve accurately, surface texture method was adopted. Firstly, the surface roughness mathematical model of <b>valve</b> working <b>face</b> was established. A fast Gaussian filtering convolution algorithm was proposed based on the symmetry of Gaussian density function. Secondly, the working <b>face</b> of gas <b>valve</b> on the high-precision air floating stage was scanned by the chromatic confocal sensor. And the roughness profile of <b>valve</b> working <b>face</b> was got through the fast Gaussian filter when the cut-off wavelength was 0. 8 mm. Then the roughness parameters could be calculated with MATLAB by setting the sampling length and evaluation length. The results show that surface roughness has a difference of over 1 µm between the qualified and unqualified valve. Besides, {{there is a little}} deviation of below 9 % between the experimental value and the stylus profilometer measuring value, which has no influence on the judging result of qualified or unqualified about the measured workpiece. The gas tightness performance of gas valve can be judged by measuring surface roughness of its working face, which can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the quality of diaphragm gas meter valve in a quantitative way. 1...|$|R
