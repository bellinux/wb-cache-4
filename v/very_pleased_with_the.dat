The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service was <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> performance of Amundsen's Farman and wanted to produce aircraft of the same model.

The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was <b>very</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E
25|$|A Medical Civic Action Program (MEDCAP) station {{manned by}} medical {{personnel}} from an American unit, aided by Vietnamese interpreters, and a dentist was brought along {{to provide health}} check-ups and treatment for the villages. The medical treatment was mainly symptomatic and for minor problems, such as aspirin for pains, soap and medication for skin diseases, and extraction for toothaches. Where more serious medical issues were diagnosed, they were referred to other facilities outside the military channels for proper treatment or corrective surgery. The Youth Service Activity entertained the children so that their parents were free {{to talk to the}} government officials present about more serious matters such as government policy. Games were played, songs were sung, candy and toys were handed out to the children, and movies were shown. At one point Colonel Ba joined the children for ballgames. The Vietnamese Agricultural Service provided information to the elders about farming and government initiatives designed to assist farmers.

500|$|Swift desired for Caillat to sing {{background}} vocals {{but in a}} loud manner, {{enough for}} audiences to recognize who sang backup. Originally Swift and Caillat were only to harmonize in the chorus, but as Caillat recorded, Swift decided to include her voice more throughout the track because of how impressed she was. Swift first recorded the entire song, and Caillat then recorded background vocals separately.

[...] He called it [...] "one of the better episodes of this last season", but noted that [...] "the show's going to end with more of a whimper than a bang". Cindy White of IGN awarded the episode a 7.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. White complimented Dwight and Pam's situation, as well Angela and Oscar's development. However, she noted that it [...] "wasn't hard to imagine Michael in [...] situation". Furthermore, she compared the episode to the third season episode [...] "Women's Appreciation".|$|E
