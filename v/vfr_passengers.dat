50|$|The {{private pilot}} {{certificate}} is the certificate {{held by the}} majority of active pilots. It allows command of any aircraft (subject to appropriate ratings) for any non-commercial purpose, and gives almost unlimited authority to fly under visual flight rules (<b>VFR).</b> <b>Passengers</b> may be carried and flight in furtherance of a business is permitted; however, a private pilot may not be compensated in any way for services as a pilot, although passengers can pay a pro rata share of flight expenses, such as fuel or rental costs. Private pilots may also operate charity flights, subject to certain restrictions, and may participate in similar activities, such as Angel Flight, Civil Air Patrol and many others.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the decade, the airline's {{economic}} situation worsened due to poor management, lack of innovation or cost-cutting culture, and the heavy maintenance costs of its aging fleet. More importantly, on the revenue side, government employees also sought to fly non-revenue, given the typical patronage in the Dominican Republic with many flights full of them often displacing paying passengers. Subsequently, the fleet and network were scaled back, leaving only the original routes like New York, Miami, Caracas, and San Juan. In an effort to save on maintenance costs, Dominicana began to operate leased aircraft (mostly Boeing 727s, but also in Q1 and Q2 of 1993 an Airbus A300 from Conair). The financial situation further worsened into the 1990s, which coincided with a negative customer reputation (like lost or delayed luggage as well as unreliable schedules). In 1994, now also faced with Cat1 restrictions in the US, Dominicana wet-leased a Boeing 737-300 and a Boeing 757-200 from Mexican low-cost airline TAESA. Further aircraft were wet-leased from Express One International, Atlantic Aviation and Carnival Air Lines. During Christmas of 1994, many Dominicana <b>VFR</b> <b>passengers</b> were stranded at JFK, MIA, and SJU when the airline was unable to provide necessary funding to lessors for heavily-booked Christmas flights (and, overbooked for the B727 the lessors were providing, since an A300 had been expected to be wet-leased). As a consequence of the outrage, in early 1995 the government of the Dominican Republic decided to shut down the airline. While the shutdown was originally only planned as a temporary measure to get re-organized, the company never became operational again. The vice president at the time was quoted saying that [...] "Dominicans can fly APA Internacional" [...] which was another [...] "local" [...] airline that benefited handsomely from Dominicana's demise. While several {{attempts have been made to}} privatize the airline, no efforts came to fruition. American Airlines and later JetBlue dominated the market and the business case for a new Dominican flag carrier is relatively weak given the investment that would be required and the debts that would have to be honored in order to use the Dominicana name.|$|E

5000|$|In November 2014 the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) {{proposed}} restricting all Jabiru-powered {{aircraft to}} day-visual flight rules (<b>VFR)</b> only, without <b>passengers</b> or solo students and within gliding {{distance of a}} safe place to land due to the engine line's safety record. The final rule adopted somewhat softened the restrictions, allowing the carriage of passengers and students, but requiring them to sign an acknowledgement of risk before flying and restricting equipped aircraft to day VFR flight and within gliding distance of {{a safe place to}} land. Both the manufacturer and Recreational Aviation Australia (RA-Aus) opposed the restrictions as unnecessary and unwarranted. RA-Aus reported that it was supplied with only a fraction of CASA's source data [...] - [...] just a day before submissions closed [...] - [...] and that CASA seemed to have excluded all engine reliability data post-"early 2014".|$|R
