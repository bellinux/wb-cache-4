A physically separated transmitter and receiver are located in clothes on various parts of the human body. The individual parts that perform data communication between each other are referred to as Personal Area Network- PAN. This paper includes starting requirements on data communication through the human body and also actual parameters taken on the human body in the function of the transfer channel. The end of the paper describes construction of a <b>vibration</b> <b>alarm</b> device that was assembled and verified. Although this paper concentrates predominantly on military applications, the operation principle of data transfer over the human body that was used here can be directly implemented to purely civil usage.

However, {{there was a}} large demand for {{monitoring}} instruments that could be permanently connected to the sensors installed on the machine, providing a continuous display of the vibration amplitudes and providing <b>alarms</b> whenever the <b>vibration</b> levels exceeded a user-configured warning level. Bently Nevada began manufacturing monitoring systems as a result, and as user confidence grew in the reliability of such systems, customers began wiring the <b>vibration</b> <b>alarms</b> from these systems into the machine's controls to automatically shut down the machine in event of high vibration. Thus, Bently Nevada's instrumentation became machinery protection systems, not just monitoring systems.|$|R

40|$|Users of {{a mobile}} phone are often {{required}} to adapt its alarm type to context. While ringing tones may be obtrusive during meetings, a <b>vibration</b> <b>alarm</b> is barely noticeable on a bus. We propose setting the alarm type automatically, based on context-information {{obtained from a}} variety of lowcost sensors. Our multi-sensor board captures audio, acceleration, compass readings, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, and ambient light. Based on raw sensor data, we build five soft sensors representing context properties that are relevant for setting a suitable alarm type. In particular, we determine if the user keeps the phone close to the body, is involved in a conversation, is exposed to high background noise, is outdoors, or is physically active. Although a decision for the alarm type can be made based on the context detected, users generally have different preferences as to what alarm type to use in a given context. We therefore propose learning user preferences through reinforcement, by associating reactions like taking or hanging up an incoming call with rewards and punishments. Our experimenta...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 47 - 56 A 40, 000 hp steam turbine-generator in {{a utility}} service {{experienced}} {{a history of}} high <b>vibration</b> <b>alarms</b> and trips from an online vibration monitoring system. The excursions of high vibration restricted the operational load performance of the turbine. The cause of the vibration {{was determined to be}} a 'rotor instability,' identified as a subsynchronous vibration in the form of steam whirl of the rotor. This whirling excites a rotor critical speed resulting in a very unstable rotor system. The instability could lead to destructive levels of vibration. A rotordynamics model of the rotor-bearing-support system was developed. Then, using the computer model, a stability analysis was performed and the sensitivity of the instability was evaluated for various system parameters (such as seals, rotors, and bearings). Numerous possible solutions were investigated, of which two exhibited significant increases in the stability of the system. First, a? newly designed rotor and second, replacing the rotor interstage labyrinth seals with honeycomb seals. The latter had a high probability of success and a greatly reduced capital cost. The turbine underwent a major overhaul in August 1992 when the honeycomb seals were installed. The machine is steadily running at loads well above the expected project justification levels. Aspects of the project, including before and after vibration analysis, rotordynamics analysis, and seal technology will be discussed...|$|R

In this paper we introduce HapticTransit, a tactile feedback based alert/notification model of a system, which provides spatial {{information to the public}} transport user. The model uses real-time bus location with other spatial information to provide feedback about the user as their journey is in progress. The system allows users make better use of „in-bus ‟ time. It allows the user be involved with other activities and not be anxious about the arrival at their destination bus stop. Our survey shows a majority of users have missed a bus stop/station whilst undertaking a transit journey in an unfamiliar location. The information provided by our system can be of great advantage to certain user groups. The <b>vibration</b> <b>alarm</b> is used to provide tactile feedback. Visual feedback, in the form of colour coded buttons and textual description, is also provided.

The meal in the first month after surgery, which may extend for a longer period according to experts, is based only on a liquid diet. During this period of rehabilitation, the patient ingests 20 ml of fluid every 10 minutes, and should be followed strictly for proper hydration throughout the day. Liquids like soups, juices and waters, are part of diet and needing to be stored in a container such as a bottle, which generally can do not store them in the correct temperature to facilitate the intake for nutritional education caused by diet on postoperative of bariatric surgery throughout the day.

40|$|Haptics is a {{feedback}} {{technology that}} {{takes advantage of}} the human sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, and/or motions to a haptic-enabled device such as a mobile phone. Historically, human-computer interaction has been visual - text and images on the screen. Haptic feedback can be an important additional method especially in Mobile Location Based Services such as knowledge discovery, pedestrian navigation and notification systems. A knowledge discovery system called the Haptic GeoWand is a low interaction system that allows users to query geo-tagged data around them by using a point-and-scan technique with their mobile device. Haptic Pedestrian is a navigation system for walkers. Four prototypes have been developed classified according to the user’s guidance requirements, the user type (based on spatial skills), and overall system complexity. Haptic Transit is a notification system that provides spatial information to the users of public transport. In all these systems, haptic feedback is used to convey information about location, orientation, density and distance by use of the <b>vibration</b> <b>alarm</b> with varying frequencies and patterns to help understand the physical environment. Trials elicited positive responses from the users who see benefit in being provided with a “heads up” approach to mobile navigation. Results from a memory recall test show that the users of haptic feedback for navigation had better memory recall of the region traversed than the users of landmark images. Haptics integrated into a multi-modal navigation system provides more usable, less distracting but more effective interaction than conventional systems. Enhancements to the current work could include integration of contextual information, detailed large-scale user trials and the exploration of using haptics within confined indoor spaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the report was to from a {{scientific}} perspective develop and evaluate the risks for people with disabilities, primarily hearing and visually impaired, in public premises. More than one fifth of the Swedish population suffers from a hearing or visual impairment. Their disability complicates their everyday and social life. Public places and buildings create barriers {{and in some cases}} hazards to them. Today Sweden is classified as one of the world’s most equal countries where disability, gender, race or religion doesn’t matter because you should still have the same privileges. This is based among other things on the Instrument of Government which is one of four fundamental laws in Sweden. Another tool in the politic of disability is the UN Standard Rules and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Other legislation concerning the subject is the Planning and Building Act and Building Regulations. Fire protection consists of two types of barriers, soft and hard. The soft represents the organizational fire protection in the form of systematic fire prevention, training of staff, procedures in case of fire, and more. While the hard barriers account for the structural and technical fire protection such as sprinklers, evacuation points, fire compartmentation, and more. Both types require continuous maintenance and updating. All this is done by the human people who in its nature often make errors. This may lead to latent conditions and active failures. In an emergency you see a pattern of human behavior. This information can provide insight into how the fire protection should be constructed to make the evacuation time as short as possible. The evacuation time comprises three phases; perception time, decision and reaction time and transfer time. The work is based on an extensive literature study divided in two areas of focus together with object studies. Based on the object studies conclusions could be made that the level of risk for a hearing or visually impaired person is not acceptable. In some cases, the fire protection is inadequate even for a person without a disability. Based on the theory that has been studied and the site visits made, there are important steps in the fire protection that should be highlighted and reviewed from a disabled person's point of view. The organizational fire protection framework must ensure continuous training and exercise so that procedures should not be forgotten. There should be alarms so that people with disabilities also may be aware of a fire, such as an optical alarm or a <b>vibration</b> <b>alarm.</b> In an emergency, it should be easy to orientate with the the help of handrails, contrast markings and tactile aids. Even the way the building is constructed matter. A logical building is easier to understand and therefore an internal mental map is more easily formed. The planning and construction of public buildings should always take into account that people differ in terms of abilitity. Also existing facilities need continuous improvements. The individual must be in focus and to achieve full participation the entire premises should be considered, not only partly. Terms which are not equivalent can affect a person's social life and how they think of themselves. It can lead to alienation and other social problems. By taking this into consideration, Sweden can become the country which the country's laws prescribe and that other nations look up to. Validerat; 20131007 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
