During this period the Tylden (or Tilden) family, believed to have had links to the Crusades of Richard I, were also significant landholders in the area in the early 17th century; a memorial to William Tylden, who died in 1613, rests in the north chancel of St Giles church.

5|$|Meanwhile, on {{the evening}} of the 10th, around 22:00, French {{reconnaissance}} elements using Panhard 178 armoured cars had started to arrive at the Dutch border, forming a vanguard for the French 1st Mechanised Light Division. This division operated, with the 25e DIM on its left, on the northern flank of the French 7th Army; its mission was to ensure contact between the <b>Vesting</b> Holland and Antwerp. Attempts to coordinate the French advance with Colonel Leonard Johannes Schmidt, the military commander of the Dutch troops on Noord-Brabant, were largely unsuccessful as, apart from the fact he could not be reached that day, Dutch defences there were already collapsing. At Mill, 256. Infanteriedivision at first could not exploit the opportunity offered by having a battalion {{in the back of the}} defenders because it failed to locate it. When a first attack by forward elements had been repulsed, a full assault at the Main Defense Line was initially postponed to the next day because most artillery had not yet passed the single pontoon bridge over the Meuse, which had caused a traffic jam after having been damaged by an incident. In the early evening in a sudden change of plans it was decided to attack even though artillery support was absent apart from one 105mm battery. An unrequested Stuka attack that also happened to hit the Mill sector just prior to the advance routed some Dutch defenders, creating a weak section in the line from which the Dutch troops were dislodged. Though the Germans were slow to exploit the breakthrough, Colonel Schmidt at 20:30 ordered the Peel-Raam Position to be abandoned and his troops to fall back to the west improvising a new line at the Zuid-Willemsvaart canal.|$|E

50|$|One {{problem with}} some {{weighted}} <b>vests</b> is {{that due to}} tightness in the shoulder girdle, in movements like pull-ups or high range of motion pushups, the <b>vest</b> can be shearing, either damaging the person or in some cases, the <b>vest</b> itself being slowly torn away. This {{can also be seen}} as an advantage, however, in those who wish to limit their range of motion due to lack of strength or flexibility, to avoid injury. The limitations of front and back bending of the core is for example, contrasted by ergonomic construction to encourage good posture in modern weighted <b>vests</b> such as the x-vest, hyper <b>vest</b> or game-breakers pro suit. Another problem with some weighted <b>vests</b> is the constriction of breathing and overheating due to the use of heavy, non-breathing materials such as nylon and neoprene. The latest developments in weighted <b>vest</b> products offer comfortable weight <b>vests</b> with cool wicking fabric that allow full range and direction of movement, chest expansion for breathing, open sides connected with lacing, and low profile design allowing a <b>vest</b> to be worn under clothing or football pads, unlike traditional <b>vests</b> made of nylon or neoprene.|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{alleviate}} worker's {{thermal discomfort}} in a moderately hot environment, a new cooling <b>vest</b> {{was designed and}} proposed in this paper. To investigate {{the effect of the}} cooling <b>vest</b> and to collect the knowledge for the design of comfortable cooling <b>vest,</b> subjective experiments were conducted. Two kinds of cooling <b>vests,</b> the new one and the commercially available one, were used for comparison. The new cooling <b>vest</b> had more insulation and its surface temperature was higher than the commercially available one. Experiments were performed in the climatic chamber where operative temperature was controlled at 3 O. 2 ℃ and relative humidity was at 37 % under still air. In addition, experiment without cooling <b>vest</b> was carried out as a control condition. The results obtained in these experiments were as follow : 1) By wearing both types of cooling <b>vest,</b> the whole body thermal sensation was closer to the neutral conditions than those without cooling <b>vest.</b> This effect was estimated to be equal to the 5. 7 ℃ decrement of operative temperature. The subjects felt more comfortable with the cooling <b>vest</b> than without it. They felt more thermally acceptable than that without cooling <b>vest.</b> Wearing the cooling <b>vest</b> was useful to decrease the sweating sensation. 2) The local discomfort was observed when the local thermal sensation was "cool"～"cold" with the cooling <b>vest.</b> 3) The new cooling <b>vest</b> kept the skin temperature at chest at about 32. 6 ℃. On the other hand, by wearing the commercially available one, it lowered to about 31. 1 ℃. By wearing the new cooling <b>vest,</b> there was a tendency that local thermal sensation vote was higher and local comfort sensation vote was more comfortable than those of the condition wearing the commercially available one. It is important for the design of a comfortable cooling garment to prevent over-cool down from the body...|$|R

40|$|Objectives—A {{three year}} {{drowning}} pre-vention campaign focused on increasing {{the use of}} life <b>vests</b> among children 1 – 14 years old. An evaluation was conducted to determine campaign awareness, change in ownership and use of life <b>vests</b> by children, and predictors of life <b>vest</b> use. Setting—King County, Washington. Methods—Four telephone surveys were conducted with parents before, during, and after the campaign. Results—The campaign was recalled by 50 % of families surveyed. From before to after the campaign, reported life <b>vest</b> use by children on docks, beaches, or at pools increased from 20 % to 29 % (p< 0. 01) and life <b>vest</b> ownership for children increased from 69 % to 75 % (p= 0. 06). Among parents aware of the campaign, reported child life <b>vest</b> use increased from 20 % to 34 % (p< 0. 001) and ownership increased from 69 % to 80 % (p< 0. 01). Among families unaware of the campaign, neither life <b>vest</b> use nor ownership changed significantly. Children were more often reported to wear life <b>vests</b> if a parent knew of the cam-paign, was confident fitting the <b>vest,</b> was younger than 40 years, felt the child could not swim well, and owned a life <b>vest</b> for the child. Conclusions—A community-wide drown-ing prevention campaign resulted in a sig-nificant, although modest, increase in reported life <b>vest</b> use and ownership among children...|$|R

5000|$|A trauma plate, {{also known}} as a trauma pack, is a plate that is an add-on component/insert to a {{ballistic}} <b>vest.</b> Its primary purpose is to absorb and disrupt the kinetic energy of a bullet impact and reduce the blunt trauma transferred to the wearer of the <b>vest.</b> Trauma plates typically enhance the ballistic value (how [...] "bulletproof" [...] it is) of the part of the <b>vest</b> that they are positioned behind. Trauma plates are most commonly found in a pocket in front of the ballistic panel of a <b>vest</b> and positioned {{in the center of the}} chest.

Unique, high-end <b>vests,</b> like Dragon Skin, do away with traditional trauma plates and integrate interlinked, miniature trauma plates as scale mail, to significantly enhance overall ballistic rating, while maintaining flexibility.|$|R
