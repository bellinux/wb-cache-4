5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E

The city is {{connected}} to the global Internet by three optical lines owned by Lattelecom, TeliaSonera International Carrier and Latvenergo and a radio relay line owned by LVRTC. There are four Lattelecom telephone exchanges and the LVRTC TV station and tower, which transmits four national TV channels, two local TV channels — [...] "TV Dzintare" [...] and [...] "TV Kurzeme" [...] and six radio stations. It has two local cable TV operators with a total number of subscribers about 15000 and three local ISPs. The city also has its own amateur radio community and a citywide wireless <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> system. , digital terrestrial television is fully operational; mobile television and broadband wireless networks are ready for implementation. All four Latvian mobile operators have stable zones of coverage (GSM 900/1800, UMTS, 2100 CDMA450) and client service centers in Liepāja. The city also has fourteen post offices as well as DHL, UPS and DPD depots.|$|E
40|$|SIP协议是由IETF提出的应用层信令协议，用来建立、修改和终止多方参与的多媒体会话进程，具有很好的可扩展性、灵活性、互操作性和可重用性。在视频监控系统中使用SIP协议实现呼叫处理过程，可以使视频监控系统具有更好的兼容性和扩展能力。本文以网络视频监控系统为背景，介绍了视频监控系统的功能划分和SIP协议的相关内容，提出了基于SIP协议的视频监控呼叫处理方案，设计了支持节点注册、呼叫处理、用户认证、状态查询等功能的呼叫处理子系统，并且在视频监控系统中实现。为了满足运营级视频监控系统对呼叫处理能力的高要求，设计并实现了基于分布式系统的高性能SIP服务器，在集群上完成对高性能SIP服务器的性能测试。本文工作的主要贡献是：在视频监控系统中设计并实现了基于SIP协议的呼叫处理子系统；在分布式系统上设计并实现了具有高呼叫处理能力的高性能SIP服务器。SIP is an application-layer control {{protocol}} proposed by IETF. It's used to establish, modify, and terminate muti-party multimedia sessions and has strong extensibility, flexibility, interoperability and reusability. It can get better compatibility and expansion capability that implement the call process with SIP in <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system. In this thesis, {{based on the}} demand for network <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system, we introduce the <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system's functional division and the SIP protocol, propose a scheme for call process in <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system based on SIP protocol, design and implement the call process subsystem supporting node register, call process, user authentication and status enquiry in <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system. In {{order to meet the}} requirements of the carrier-class <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system, we design and implement the high-performance SIP server on the distributed system, and test the SIP server on the cluster. The thesis's major contribution is: design and implement the call process subsystem of <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> system based on SIP protocol; design and implement the high-performance SIP server on the distributed system...|$|R

2500|$|The wreck was {{examined}} and videotaped by remotely operated underwater vehicles and by divers from a Norwegian company, Rockwater A/S, contracted {{for the investigation}} work. The official report indicated that the locks on the bow door had failed from the strain of the waves and the door had separated {{from the rest of}} the vessel, pulling the ramp behind it ajar. The bow visor and ramp had been torn off at points that would not trigger an [...] "open" [...] or [...] "unlatched" [...] warning on the bridge, as is the case in normal operation or failure of the latches. The bridge was also situated too far back on the ferry for the visor to be seen from there. While there was <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the inner ramp, the monitor on the bridge was not visible from the conning station. The bow visor was under-designed, as manufacturing and approval process did not consider the visor and its attachments as critical items regarding ship safety. The first metallic bang was believed to have been the sound of the visor's lower locking mechanism failing, and subsequent noises were the visor 'flapping' against the hull as the other locks failed, before tearing free and exposing the bow ramp. The subsequent failure of the bow ramp allowed water into the vehicle deck, which was identified as the main cause of the capsizing and sinking: RORO ferries with their wide vehicle decks are particularly vulnerable to capsizing if the car deck is even slightly flooded because of free surface effect: the fluid's swirling motion across such a large area hampers the boat's ability to right itself after rolling with a wave.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2006, it was {{announced}} that all of the LRVs would be rehabilitated by AnsaldoBreda. The rehabilitation featured many improvements, including enhanced <b>video</b> <b>monitoring</b> of the railcar interiors, an upgraded braking system, rebuilt HVAC systems, rebuilt door systems, a new interior closely representing the agency's new look, upgraded propulsion systems and repairs to the body shells. In addition, the rail cars were to receive new monitoring systems, an automated announcement system calling out stations, new door chimes and interior/exterior LED signage to replace existing roll signs. The total project cost was estimated at $40 million for rehabilitation of the 27 cars. Because the refurbished cars have new car-to-car communications equipment, they are not compatible with unrefurbished cars and cannot run with them on the same train. The project originally planned to use SuperSteel's manufacturing facilities in Schenectady, New York for the overhaul. However, due to the loss of orders and a dip in the economy, SuperSteel closed the facility in April 2009. The closure cost 175 jobs and delayed the rehabilitation. [...] The project later was moved to Gray Manufacturing Industries, located in Hornell, New York. [...] The first two cars were due back in revenue service in July 2010. After a lengthy delay, which put the project years behind the original schedule, the first two cars (fleet numbers 114 and 123) were returned to full revenue service on March 9, 2012, 20 months later than planned. However, the cost of refurbishment per car had since gone up and now averaged $1.7 million per car with an cost of $45 million to complete all cars in the fleet. Three more cars (numbers 110, 111 and 126) were sent out and were expected to be completed before the end of 2012, but did not return to full revenue service until the fall of 2013. On October 1, 2014, car 113 also returned to full revenue service. Since then, 11 more cars (numbers 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 112, 117, 119, 120, 124 and 125) have returned to full revenue service, bringing the total number of refurbished rail cars to 17 as of September 15, 2017.|$|E

50|$|A <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> {{also called}} a {{broadcast}} <b>monitor,</b> broadcast <b>video</b> <b>monitor,</b> broadcast reference monitor or just reference monitor, is a display device {{similar to a}} television set, used to monitor the output of a video-generating device, such as playout from a video server, IRD, video camera, VCR, or DVD player. It {{may or may not}} have professional audio monitoring capability. Unlike a television set, a <b>video</b> <b>monitor</b> has no tuner (television) and, as such, is unable independently to tune into an over-the-air broadcast like a television receiver. One common use of <b>video</b> <b>monitors</b> is in television stations, television studios, production trucks and in outside broadcast vehicles, where broadcast engineers use them for confidence checking of analog signal and digital signals throughout the system.|$|R
