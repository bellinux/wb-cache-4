25|$|As Dunhuang {{was located}} near foreign lands, many traders often {{travelled}} {{from the west}} to China through the Silk Road to pay tribute or to trade. However, many wealthy locals in Dunhuang objected to trading and had even cheated foreign traders, resulting in much unhappiness among foreigners. When Cang Ci heard about this, he personally went to reassure the foreign traders and opened up special routes leading to Luoyang exclusively for those traders, while ordering his men to protect and escort the traders as they passed through. The foreigners were <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> Cang Ci.|$|E

Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.|$|E

500|$|The 2008 Chicago {{production}} was well received, and A Red Orchid Theatre again {{put on a}} production of the play in its 2009–2010 season. The Chicago {{production was}} directed by Steve Wilson, and ran from November 12, 2009 through January 3, 2010. The play's artistic director, Kirsten Fitzgerald spoke positively of rehearsals for the Chicago production: [...] "The energy that explodes into the theatre with {{the start of each}} rehearsal is palpable and impossible to deny, even from the office next door. I am ecstatic and so <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> bring last year's smash-hit to audiences old and new. The heart of last year's joyous and hilarious Chicago Premiere returns with plenty of surprises and new fun up our sleeves." [...] Crain's Chicago Business ranked the production {{as one of the top}} ten things to do for the weekend in the city. Another Illinois production ran from December 7, 2009 to January 3, 2010, by Next Theatre in Evanston. On December 2, 2009, performers sang songs from the play in a production called The Songs of Kyle Jarrow at the 92YTribeca in Manhattan, New York. Performers included Jeb Brown, Tony Award-nominee Alison Fraser, Susan Goodwillie, Caesar Samayoa, Libby Winters, and Lauren Worsham.|$|E
500|$|Soaps In Depth {{reported}} that Engen quickly gained viewer support after joining the cast as Adam, {{as did the}} character's romance with Heather. The support continued when the character took a dark turn. Engen said, [...] "To {{think there was any}} likability left in the character baffles me! I'm <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> the fans...they've been so supportive." [...] The actor said fans wanted Adam either redeemed or turned into a gray character. Davidson credited the character's likability to Engen's looks, saying, [...] "...he really nailed this character. Chris' all-American looks add another layer to this story: he looks like he regrets being so evil, but he can't help himself. When Chris informed me he was leaving, I told him he really accomplished something by being so likable playing this villain." [...] Nelson Branco repeatedly praised Engen's acting and Adam's storyline with Ashley and Victor, saying, [...] "he Haunting of Ashley is fast becoming one of my favorite all-time soap storylines ever. It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his very bitchy, and sexy performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|E

500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed {{an increase in the number}} of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing [...] "pants", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher". Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond", while saying on another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
500|$|The film is not lost, but {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published. The official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on December 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Jack Harkaway is of aristocratic birth, being {{the son of a}} wealthy Englishman's daughter and a poor young man, with whom she has eloped. Her parents bring about a separation and compel her to place the child in the hands of strangers, who are bribed to keep his whereabouts a secret from his mother. At the age of 12 Jack is placed in a school, the master of which is prejudiced against him, owing to the boy's mischievous disposition. After having received severe and unjust punishment from the schoolmaster, Jack decides to run away from school, and escapes from the room in which he is locked, through the window. Wandering along a country road, he accidentally overhears two sneak thieves planning to rob a house. Jack makes his way to the house in time to warn its mistress of the proposed robbery. Two [...] servants are placed in hiding, when the would-be thieves put in an appearance there and are immediately captured. Jack is given a fine supper by the lady of the house, who is <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him. And when the schoolmaster, accompanied by Jack's guardian, arrives, she is touched by the boy's appeal not to be turned over to his rough-looking 'friends.' Upon getting a closer view of the man who calls himself the lad's guardian, she realizes that he is the man to whom she was forced to give over her child. The man admits that Jack is her own boy, and the picture ends with the men being turned {{out of the house and}} Jack restored to his mother's arms." ...|$|E

I feel very happy and with high expectations, regardless of whether we get the Latin Grammy or not". Billboard columnist Leila Cobo, while reviewing the nominees for the Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year, stated that this is a [...] "breakthrough album" [...] for the singer, since she is going [...] "beyond her alt roots into commercial territory but with finesse and guts that stay close to her origins". Hasta la Raíz won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. The album ranked at number-one in the list for the [...] "10 Best Albums of 2015 in Mexico" [...] by newspaper El País; according to the reviewer Luis Pablo Beauregard, it is an album [...] "naked and raw, where the lyrics and fragility of her voice draw the footprint of heartbreak". The American edition of Rolling Stone magazine placed Hasta la Raíz at number 3 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Albums of the Year", arguing that [...] "the loftiness of the album's ambitions are tempered by Lafourcade's masterful songwriting, which remains as deft as a Mesut Özil cross pass". The editors of Billboard magazine ranked the album at number 2 in the list for the [...] "10 Best Latin Albums of 2015", stating that the singer [...] "manages to be retro and futuristic at the same time ... the sound is so unexpected, that coupled with Lafourcade's sweet vocals, it's arresting". Website AllMusic included the album on their list for the [...] "Best of 2015: Favorite Latin and World Albums", explaining that Lafourcade [...] "delivers an intimate, poignant, quietly powerful collection of heartbreak songs on this gem of an album".|$|E
