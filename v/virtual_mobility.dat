Moving from comparative analyses concerning urban development in the Sixties and Seventies of the Twentieth century, the chapter comes to the latest theories on immaterial and <b>virtual</b> <b>mobilities.</b> Human mobility is the core of the discussion; in the background are the main events that have revolutionized the global world, in its political, economic, technological aspects...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{convergence}} of communication and travel {{and the emergence of}} a mobile and network sociality, through investigating new communication practices based on the internet and mobile phone enacted by backpackers while on the move. These global nomads produce and maintain mobile spaces of sociality, founded on a complex intersection of face-to-face interaction and mediated communication, co-presence and virtual proximity, corporeal travel and <b>virtual</b> <b>mobilities.</b> Personal communities become a mobile phenomenon, relocalized in a plurality of online and offline social spaces. It is thus argued that network relationships are reshaped and mobilized through reconfigurations of co-presence, proximity and distance in relation to the use of new media. Exploring new media uses on the move can thus provide a useful insight into the emerging social model of the network and mobile society.

50|$|Striving for a European {{educational}} space, the European {{ministers of}} Education consider <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> {{as a necessary}} addition to the traditional ways of studying abroad, that required travelling. In Europe, databases like Educontact provide students with an overview of available courses.|$|E
50|$|Mobile {{students}} are usually {{divided into two}} groups: Free-movers are students who travel entirely on their own initiative, while programme students use exchange programmes at a department, faculty, institution, or national level (such as Erasmus, Nordplus or Fulbright). Nowadays, the traditional Erasmus exchange (which involves travelling) has been complemented with <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility,</b> or Virtual Erasmus, in which students from different countries may study together without leaving their home.|$|E
50|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> {{refers to}} {{students}} and teachers in higher education using another institution outside their own country to study or teach for a limited time, without physically leaving their home. It complements physical mobility in which students travel to study abroad, such as Erasmus Student Network. The two forms of mobility together constitute academic mobility. Student and teacher mobility are perceived as important quality issues in higher education.|$|E

40|$|In this {{working paper}} we explore to what extent mobilities shape the {{everyday}} lives of Europeans. We map out the patterns of physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>mobilities,</b> including intra-European migrations, international travel, but also individual networks across borders and online transactions. In particular, we outline how free movement within the EU, {{one of the basic}} rights of EU citizens, {{is part and parcel of}} a broader ‘mobility mix’ of transnational practices. By applying LCA (latent class analysis) to a random sample of 6000 resident nationals in six EU member states (Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Denmark and Romania: the EUCROSS survey of 2012) we build a typology of European cross-border practices, drawing a diversified picture of mobilities between two extreme positions of transnationalism and immobility. We describe in detail the typical configurations of social transnationalism in the light of their structuration on the basis of macro and micro categorical differences. Finally, we ask about the consequences of these mobilities for European integration. We do so by linking different mobility patterns identified with LCA analysis to identifications with Europe...|$|R
40|$|There are {{different}} ways to learn virtually, such as e-learning, b-Learning and m-earning. People can learn at any place through mobile devices. m-Learnig created new knowledge spaces and smathphone, tablets, etc. expanded education anywhere. Many theories contribute to enrich the pedagogical basis of m-Learning. However, {{the use of technology}} is not enough. Personal and instrumental skills are important to learn in <b>virtual</b> and <b>mobility</b> environments. People who learn in mobility create and design their own educational ecosystem or Personal Learning Environment (PLE), in order to answer their learning needs choosing their own resources...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the amount}} of time people have spent in motion has {{remained}} constant since 1950, the shift from feet and bicycles to cars and planes has increased the speed of travel fivefold. [...] This results in the twin effects of wider and shallower regions of social activity around each person (further exacerbated by electronic communication which {{can be seen as a}} form of <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility),</b> and a degradation of the social and physical environment brought about by the high speed traffic (as theorised by urban designer Donald Appleyard).|$|E
5000|$|Several typologies {{have been}} {{formulated}} {{to clarify the}} wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John Urry divides mobilities into five types: mobility of objects, corporeal mobility, imaginative mobility, <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> and communicative mobility. Later, Leopoldina Fortunati and Sakari Taipale proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‘macro-mobilities’ (consistent physical displacements), ‘micro-mobilities’ (small-scale displacements), ‘media mobility’ (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‘disembodied mobility’ (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.|$|E
5000|$|Action 1: {{testing of}} the {{repertory}} {{with a sample of}} 120 students attending the courses of the universities of the partnership. For each course (8), a target group of 15 students (10 student belonging to the country that developed the course and 5 belonging to the other countries of the partnership - “virtual mobility students”). In order to enhance the motivation of the students towards the experimentation of these <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> processes, the courses attended will be recognized through a system of credit transfer (e.g. ECTS). The results of the testing phase will contribute to define the final configuration of the LMS and of the repertory of the transnational virtual study circle.|$|E
40|$|In its {{different}} forms, mobility is {{a central}} concept to understand contemporary social life (Urry 2000 and 2007). In this paper {{we focus on the}} European context and argue that indeed social life in Europe is enacted through diverse kinds of mobilities – in both physical and virtual space. On the basis of survey data, we map out the patterns of these mobilities, including intra-European migrations, international travels, but also individual networks across borders and online transactions, and explore how they are structured depending on both individual socioeconomic characteristics and places from which they originate. Going beyond the mobilities paradigm, the analysis sheds light on how free movement within the EU, one of the basic rights of the EU citizens, is translated into a set of mobility practices. Therefore mapping out mobilities is a way of mapping EU citizenship practices in a day-to-day reality. Preliminary analyses show that there are national specificities in mobility patterns, countering the idea that mobilities ‘level the field’ and have integrative effects. We address these issues using the EUCROSS survey which was carried out in six European countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain and UK) in 2012. EUCROSS included various measures of physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>mobilities,</b> which are used as dependent variables in logistic regression models. Based on statistical analyses we draw a detailed account of EU citizenship practices across national borders...|$|R

40|$|At a EuroScience Open Forum {{meeting last}} month, scientists, {{policy-makers}} {{and the public}} discussed ‘virtual mobility’. Could it replace the conventional geographical mobility of earlycareer researchers between labs? (See also R. Garwood Nature 510, 313; 2014.) The group concluded that <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> would work, but should be combined with short-term visits to other labs to allow face-to-face contact, which in our view is crucial for building trust and for working across cultures. However, {{more than half of}} scientists questioned in a European Commission survey (www. more- 2. eu) considered that <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> would make short-term visits unnecessary. Meeting participants agreed that <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> would provide equal access to and for researchers with physical disabilities, would help those on parental leave to maintain contact with their national and international networks, and would enable researchers in poorer regions to access wellresourced labs and to collaborate internationally. We maintain that <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> should be considered on the same footing as mobility between disciplines, sectors and geographical regions, and that it should be seen as a driver of equal opportunities.

40|$|We {{present the}} UNED <b>Virtual</b> <b>Mobility</b> Campus Net Program, {{implemented}} since 2012 {{in collaboration with}} European and Latin American universities. Program´s objectives, participating institutions, procedures, and evaluation are exposed. <b>Virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> is understood as a meaningful strategy for intercultural learning by studying an undergraduate or postgraduate degree program at the local, national or international level, {{in relation to the}} student's own studies, utilizing virtual or distance methodology; <b>virtual</b> <b>mobility</b> is also the possibility of studying specific topics or a determinate number of credits or courses. The equality of opportunity is a priority objective for UNED. The diversity of students´ personal situations necessitates formulas that, along with traditional in-person mobility (e. g., Erasmus Program), utilize virtual resources to guarantee for all the students the intercultural experience of living in an academic environment different than one´s own. We hope that the UNED Campus Net Program is of interest to readers and that we can incorporate new partners into the project over the next few years. The article deals with three main dimensions of the UNED Campus Net: objectives, implementation process and participants´ evaluation.

40|$|Identifying {{with the}} field of {{cultural}} geography this studio based research project questions how the consequence and affect of global mobility has {{changed the way we}} see and encounter the world, and how this has necessitated alternative ways of visualising our position within it. This creative project explores mobility specifically associated with leisure travel, examining the phenomenon of mobility {{and what it means to}} be part of a world on the move. Through practice led research this project questions how both physical and <b>virtual</b> <b>mobilities</b> inform our ability to know and understand the world and how the experience of mobility could be visualised. Through scrutinising the visual language of traditional mapping, this research project turns to contemporary cartographic practices as a way to find out how the world may be encountered, how it can be represented visually, and how it may be experienced ontologically. At a time when every surface of the world has been discovered, surveyed or mapped in some way, and the globe is encased in the tracks of satellites, global travel and movement, this project looks at ways of making use of this information: of the spaces, journeys and experiences that this era presents. As a corollary to both mobility and mapping, the relationship between knowing and being are central in this research project. Throughout this project maps and mapping offer an enduring structural and conceptual methodology to create works that evoke some of the unknown in a world of the known. Examined through Nicolas Bourriaud’s aptly geographical metaphor of a conceptual archipelago (Bourriaud, 2009) this research project unites a series of separate yet interrelated ideas akin to metaphorical islands, and draws them together to form an archipelago of creative projects. Arising from a curiosity about how the world is encountered and represented, this research project connects cultural geography and cartographic thinking with contemporary art theory and practice, in order to seek new ways of understanding the world. Through this research project I suggest that being in our contemporary world is inextricably linked to wanderlust, mobility and mapping...|$|R
