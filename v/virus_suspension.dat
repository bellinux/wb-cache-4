50|$|On 1 December 1978 the Health and Safety Executive {{announced}} {{their intention to}} prosecute the university for breach of safety legislation. The case was heard in November 1979. Expert evidence, presented by the defence and accepted by the magistrates, showed that sufficient virus material could not be produced by the laboratory to generate an infectious dose in the telephone room where Parker was supposedly infected. Although the source of infection was traced, the mode of transmission was not. The defence witnesses claimed that 11,812 gallons of <b>virus</b> <b>suspension</b> would have been required to generate an infectious dose in the telephone room. Although the Shooter Inquiry noted the poor state of sealing of ducting in the laboratory, this was caused after the outbreak by engineers fumigating the laboratory and ducts. The university {{was found not guilty}} of causing Parker's death. In August 1981, following a formal claim for damages made by the trade union Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs in 1979, Parker's husband, Joseph, was awarded £25,000 in compensation.|$|E
5000|$|As an antidepressant, {{positive}} results {{were found in}} animal models of depression. NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have been shown in animal models to attenuate the hearing loss caused by aminoglycosides It is thought that aminoglycosides mimic endogenous polyamines at NMDA receptors and produce excitotoxic damage, leading to hair cell loss. Antagonizing NMDA receptors to reduce the excitotoxicity would prevent that hearing loss. Dizocilpine was found to block the development of kindled seizures, although {{it does not have}} any effect on completed kindled seizures. Oddly, it was discovered to decrease rabies virus production and {{is believed to be the}} first neurotransmitter antagonist to present with antiviral activity. Rat cortical neuron cells were infected with the rabies virus and those incubated with dizocilpine had virus produced reduced about 1000-fold. It is not known how MK-801 has this effect; the rabies <b>virus</b> <b>suspension,</b> without cells, was inoculated with dizocilpine and the drug failed to produce a virucidal effect, indicated that the mechanism of action is something other than direct killing of the virus. It was also tested against herpes simplex, vesicular stomatitis, poliovirus type I, and human immunodeficiency virus. It did not have activity against these other viruses, however. Dizocilpine was also shown to potentiate the ability of levodopa to ameliorate akinesia and muscular rigidity in a rodent model of parkinsonism. [...] When dizocilpine was administered to rats 15 minutes after a spinal trauma, the long-term neurological recovery of the trauma was improved. [...] However, NMDA antagonists like dizocilpine have largely failed to show safety in clinical trials, possibly due to inhibition of NMDA receptor function that is necessary for normal neuronal function. Since dizocilpine is a particularly strong NMDA receptor antagonist, this drug is particularly likely to have psychotomimetic side effects (such as hallucinations) that result from NMDA receptor blockade. Dizocilpine had a promising future as a neuroprotective agent until neurotoxic-like effects, called Olney's Lesions, were seen in certain brain regions of test rats. Merck, a drug company, promptly dropped development of dizocilpine.|$|E
40|$|Influenza <b>virus</b> <b>suspensions</b> exhibit two {{distinct}} properties in vitro {{which can be}} readily detected [...] the fixation of complement in mixture with specific immune serum (1 - 4) and the agglutination of red blood ceils (5, 6). The capacity of the <b>virus</b> <b>suspensions</b> to agglutinate red ceils appears to be closely associated, if not identical, with the infective activity of the virus. The complement-fixing antigen, on the other hand, {{has been found to}} be considerably smaller than the infective virus particle and separable from it (2, 3). In general, it resembles the well known soluble antigens of other viruses (7), and it has been assumed that this antigen and not the virus particle per se is responsible for the complement fixation reaction. The present paper reports a detailed study of the complement fixation test with influenza <b>virus</b> <b>suspensions</b> and immune sera, and the development of a sensitive and accurate method of determination of the reaction.

40|$|In {{a recent}} brief {{communication}} we described the agglutination of chicken {{red blood cells}} by materials containing the PR 8 and Lee strains of influenza virus (1). Furthermore, it was shown that the addition of specific immune serum inhibited the agglutination {{in the presence of}} the homologous virus, but not when heterologous strains were used. This paper presents the results of further experiments related to these phenomena. The first experiments deal primarily with the correlation between the agglutinating capacity of <b>virus</b> <b>suspensions</b> and their infectivity for mice. A greater number of experiments have been directed toward correlating the agglutination-inhibiting power of various sera with their virus-neutralizing capacity.

40|$|The {{filtration}} of {{two species}} of enteroviruses through membranes of porosity ranging from 50 to 220 mμ was studied. It was shown that extensive or total losses of virus may attend filtration at these porosities, apparently owing to adsorption of the virus to the membrane matrix. This could be minimized by the incorporation of serum into the <b>virus</b> <b>suspension</b> {{at the time of}} filtration, or by pretreating the membrane with serum or with a gelatin solution. It was also found that the first few drops of filtrate, even under optimal conditions, were likely to be virus-free, so that the filtration of too small a volume of <b>virus</b> <b>suspension</b> would result in a relatively great loss of titer.

40|$|After {{incubation}} for 1 hr at 37 " with caseinase C (a purified {{fraction of}} actinomycetin), the neuraminidase activity of concentrated purified influenza virus PR 8 suspension was unchanged, whereas its infectivity and haemagglutinating activity were considerably decreased. After 4 hr, infectivity and haemagglutinating activity were still more decreased {{and most of}} the neuraminidase activity was destroyed. The ability to fix complement in the presence of specific antibodies was slightly decreased, whereas the ability to neutralize haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies was not affected.

Both materials fixed complement in the presence of control P R ~ virus anti-serum. The ability of control P R 8 <b>virus</b> <b>suspension</b> to neutralize haemag-glutination-inhibiting antibodies and its ability to react with strain-specific complement-fixing antibodies were related to material sedimentable by centrifugation for 1 hr at 31, 000 g.

40|$|SUMMARY: Experiments {{were made}} to {{determine}} whether the infectivity of <b>virus</b> <b>suspensions</b> was influenced by exposure to daylight of normal laboratory intensity or by exposure to artificial light. The infectivity of dilutions of <b>virus</b> <b>suspensions</b> held in bottles or cells was determined after exposure to light under a variety of conditions; the influence of exposure was indicated by comparison with the infec-tivity of control suspensions kept in darkness. The infectivity titres indicated by serial dilutions, in phosphate saline, of unfiltered fresh suspensions of egg strains of the viruses of vesicular stomatitis, influenza, Newcastle disease and fowl-plague following exposure to daylight for 4 hr. were 3 - 5 logarithmic units lower than those indicated by the dark controls. Changes of this magnitude suggest that with these virus strains significant errors might arise in infectivity titrations if suspensions were exposed to light for much shorter periods.
