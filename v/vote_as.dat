50|$|Varying {{methods have}} been used to break down the vote into Kennedy and unpledged votes. One method is to take the 318,303 <b>votes</b> <b>as</b> Kennedy <b>votes</b> and the 324,050 <b>votes</b> <b>as</b> unpledged <b>votes,</b> giving a total much higher than the actual votes cast. Another is to take the 318,303 <b>votes</b> <b>as</b> Kennedy <b>votes</b> and the {{remainder}} (5,747 <b>votes)</b> <b>as</b> unpledged <b>votes.</b> A third is to split the 324,050 in the proportion of 5/11 to 6/11, giving 147,295 votes for Kennedy and 176,755 for unpledged electors. In all cases Richard Nixon has 237,981 votes. If the last method were used, it would mean that Nixon not only won the popular vote in Alabama, but won it nationally.|$|R
5|$|When Harding {{joined the}} U.S. Senate, the Democrats {{controlled}} {{both houses of}} Congress, and were led by President Wilson. As a junior senator in the minority, Harding received unimportant committee assignments, but carried out those duties assiduously. He was a safe, conservative, Republican <b>vote.</b> <b>As</b> during {{his time in the}} Ohio Senate, Harding came to be widely liked.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{initially}} {{registered to}} <b>vote</b> <b>as</b> a Democrat, but soon switched parties, joining the Republicans. He involved himself in Republican politics, working on Herbert Hoover's unsuccessful presidential re-election campaign in 1932. In 1938, the young attorney ran against longtime Republican incumbent Charles W. Lyon for the California State Assembly. Lyon cross-filed and secured his re-election by winning both primaries, defeating Chotiner in the Republican poll, and narrowly beating Robert A. Heinlein (who subsequently turned to writing science fiction) in the Democratic contest.|$|E

Moran was {{also a member of}} the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus, which works to advance progressive issues and opinions.

5|$|In the 1870s, white Democrats wrested {{power back}} in the state {{legislature}} from the biracial coalition at the end of Reconstruction. In the early 20th century, the legislature passed bills to impose poll taxes, followed by white primaries; these measures effectively disfranchised most blacks, poor whites and Mexican Americans. In the 1890s, 100,000 blacks voted in the state; by 1906, only 5,000 could <b>vote.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the Democratic Party dominated Texas politics from the turn of the century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy. It held power until after passage in the mid-1960s of national civil rights legislation enforcing constitutional rights of all citizens.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{stated that}} {{his goal was}} to win at least 5 percent of the <b>vote,</b> <b>as</b> winning 5 percent would allow Libertarian Party {{candidates}} equal ballot access and federal funding during the next election cycle.

In his concession speech, Lieberman announced that he would stand by his prior statements that he'd run as an independent if he lost the Democratic primary. Lieberman won the general election with approximately 50 percent of the vote; exit polls showed that Lieberman won the vote of 33 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of independents, and 70 percent of Republicans.|$|E

5|$|Militant {{action was}} not a {{hallmark}} of the movements in Wales and Welsh members, who more often identified themselves as suffragists, sought Parliamentary and public support through political and peaceful means. In 1918, across the United Kingdom, women over the age of 30 gained the right to vote, followed by the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 which saw women gain the same rights to <b>vote</b> <b>as</b> men.|$|E
5|$|The 435 {{members of}} the House of Representatives elect a Speaker by {{majority}} rule {{at the beginning of}} each session of the United States Congress, who serves until the end of the Congress. Typically, the election is a formality, as the majority party's members <b>vote</b> <b>as</b> a bloc for their party's previously-chosen Speaker-designate (such as the speaker, majority leader, or minority leader from the previous term). Open elections are uncommon but have occurred. The last Speaker election to require multiple ballots occurred in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{system was}} {{relatively}} democratic {{for a period}} during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of income as a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to <b>vote.</b> <b>As</b> an illustration, the lowest paid civil employee in 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs600$000 annually.|$|E

5|$|The sixteen contestants {{were divided}} into two tribes of eight: Tagi and Pagong. Both tribes fared equally in {{challenges}} but differed in organisational structure. Pagong was dominated by the younger, more carefree members, whereas four contestants on Tagi—Kelly, Richard, Rudy, and Susan—formed an alliance, choosing to <b>vote</b> <b>as</b> a voting bloc to ensure their safety. When ten players remained—five from each tribe—the tribes merged into one, named Rattana. The alliance strategy proved to be successful, and the four took advantage of the other contestants' lack of voting strategy to gain dominance. There was dissension in the alliance as Kelly was deemed untrustworthy, but she won four consecutive immunity challenges and was ineligible for elimination.|$|E
5|$|The talk {{became more}} {{widespread}} during {{his junior year}} as McCoy was mentioned by several analysts and voters as a potential 2008 Heisman winner. McCoy was the unanimous front-runner in an October 20 poll of 10 Heisman voters conducted by the Rocky Mountain News. Tim Tebow, quarterback of the Florida Gators, had a <b>vote</b> <b>as</b> the 2007 winner. Seven games into the season he said that McCoy would have his vote {{at that point in}} the season.|$|E
5|$|When the LM voted {{narrowly}} in May 1976 {{to rejoin}} the Liberals (222 to 211), Millhouse immediately created the New LM, and became its only parliamentary representative.

The merger was finalised on 4 June when the Liberals' State Council voted heavily in favour.|$|E
