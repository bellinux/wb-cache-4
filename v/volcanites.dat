The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene–Quaternary age. During the Miocene-Pleistocene, the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water-poor and unoxidized petrologies.

The incompatible trace element patterns of the calcalkaline <b>volcanites</b> show enrichment of LILEs (Sr, K, Rb, Ba and Th) and negative HFSEs (Nb, Ta) anomalies suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by a subduction-related process. On the other hand, alkaline <b>volcanites</b> show enrichment of both LILEs and HFSEs suggesting an enriched lithospheric source by small volume melts from the asthenosphere.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study that was conducted to determine the relationship between hydrogeochemical composition and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of the Mt.

Forty samples of spring waters were collected from local outcrops of Quaternary <b>volcanites.</b> Physico-chemical parameters were measured in the field and analyses completed for major and minor elements and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic ratios. A range of water types was distinguished varying from alkaline-earth bicarbonate waters, reflecting less intense water-rock interaction processes to alkali bicarbonate waters, probably representing interaction with volcanic rocks of Mt. Vulture and marine evaporites. The average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios suggest at least 3 different sources. However, some samples have average Sr isotope ratios (0. 70704 - 0. 70778) well above those of the <b>volcanites.</b> These ratios imply interaction with other rocks having higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, probably Triassic evaporites, which is substantiated by their higher content of Na, SO 4 and Cl. The Sr isotope ratios for some samples (e. g. Toka and Traficante) are intermediate between the value for the Vulture <b>volcanites</b> and that for the local Mesozoic rocks. The salt content of these samples also lies between the value for waters interacting solely with the <b>volcanites</b> and the value measured in the more saline samples. These waters are thus assumed to result from the mixing of waters circulating in volcanic rocks with waters presumably interacting with the sedimentary bedrock (marine evaporites). © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Tas oluk {{kaolinite}} {{deposits of}} Afyonkarahisar (western Anatolia) are hosted by both pre-Early Cambrian sericitic mica-chlorite schists and Neogene <b>volcanites,</b> the latter comprising tuffs and agglomerates. These units {{have been affected}} by hydrothermal alteration controlled by faults resulting in complex, irregular, lateral mineralogical zonation. The occurrence of a siliceous cap on altered schists and in claystone, of quartz veins in schists and tuffs, and the development of explosion cones and pit fillings indicate that alteration in both the schists and the <b>volcanites</b> is due to hydrothermal processes. Altered schists have generally large (locally small) Fe contents, and claystones are generally silicified and have small Fe contents.
