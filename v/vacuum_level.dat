25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high <b>vacuum</b> <b>level</b> necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E
25|$|Photons {{hitting a}} thin film of alkali metal or {{semiconductor}} material such as gallium arsenide in an image intensifier tube cause the ejection of photoelectrons due to the photoelectric effect. These are accelerated by an electrostatic field where they strike a phosphor coated screen, converting the electrons back into photons. Intensification of the signal is achieved either through acceleration of the electrons or by {{increasing the number of}} electrons through secondary emissions, such as with a micro-channel plate. Sometimes a combination of both methods is used. Additional kinetic energy is required to move an electron out of the conduction band and into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>level.</b> This is known as the electron affinity of the photocathode and is another barrier to photoemission other than the forbidden band, explained by the band gap model. Some materials such as Gallium Arsenide have an effective electron affinity that is below the level of the conduction band. In these materials, electrons that move to the conduction band are all of sufficient energy to be emitted from the material and as such, the film that absorbs photons can be quite thick. These materials are known as negative electron affinity materials.|$|E
2500|$|In an EBPVD system, the {{deposition}} chamber must be evacuated to a pressure {{of at least}} 7.5 Torr (10−2 Pa) to allow passage of electrons from the electron gun to the evaporation material, which {{can be in the}} form of an ingot or rod. Alternatively, some modern EBPVD systems utilize an arc-suppression system and can be operated at vacuum levels as low as 5.0 Torr, for situations such as parallel use with magnetron sputtering. [...] Multiple types of evaporation materials and electron guns can be used simultaneously in a single EBPVD system, each having a power from tens to hundreds of kilowatts. Electron beams can be generated by thermionic emission, field electron emission or the anodic arc method. The generated electron beam is accelerated to a high kinetic energy and directed towards the evaporation material. Upon striking the evaporation material, the electrons will lose their energy very rapidly. The kinetic energy of the electrons is converted into other forms of energy through interactions with the evaporation material. The thermal energy that is produced heats up the evaporation material causing it to melt or sublimate. Once temperature and <b>vacuum</b> <b>level</b> are sufficiently high, vapor will result from the melt or solid. The resulting vapor can then be used to coat surfaces. Accelerating voltages can be between 3 and 40 kV. When the accelerating voltage is 20–25 kV and the beam current is a few amperes, 85% of the electron's kinetic energy can be converted into thermal energy. Some of the incident electron energy is lost through the production of X-rays and secondary electron emission.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{electronic}} structure at interfaces found in organic semiconductor devices. The studied organic materials are C- 60 and poly (para-phenylenevinylene) (PPV) -like oligomers, and the metals are polycrystalline Au and Ag. To measure the energy levels at these interfaces, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy has been used. It is shown how the energy levels at interfaces deviate from the bulk. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the <b>vacuum</b> <b>levels</b> do not align at the studied interfaces. The misalignment is caused by an electric field at the interface. Several effects are presented that influence the energy alignment at interfaces, such as screening effects, dipole layer formation, charge transfer, and chemical interaction. The combination of interfaces investigated here is similar to interfaces found in polymer light-emitting diodes and organic bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices. The result, the misalignment of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>levels,</b> is expected to influence charge-transfer processes across these interfaces, possibly affecting the electrical characteristics of organic semiconductor devices that contain similar interfaces.

Unfortunately, this method for identifying the presence of an air leak does not determine the air leak’s location.|$|R

Therefore, a thorough characterization of the in-plane shear behavior of fabrics under diaphragm forming conditions must take into account the effect of vacuum-sealing and compaction between the two diaphragms during bias extension. The study presented here examined the shear angles of out-of-autoclave 8 -harness satin woven carbon/epoxy prepregs under diaphragm compaction. A bias extension test was conducted to study the effect of diaphragm compaction and ply interactions on shear properties. The test was performed at different compaction levels, and changes in shear angle with respect to <b>vacuum</b> <b>levels</b> and diaphragm compaction forces were observed. The contribution of diaphragm material and ply interaction to shear stiffness was evaluated and compared with results from a direct bias extension test. The samples were tested at both room temperature and at elevated temperatures using a radiant heater.
