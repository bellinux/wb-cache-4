25|$|A {{vibrating}} structure gyroscope (VSG), {{also called}} a Coriolis vibratory gyroscope (CVG), uses a resonator made of different metallic alloys. It takes a position between the low-accuracy, low-cost MEMS gyroscope and the higher-accuracy and higher-cost FOG. Accuracy parameters are increased by using low-intrinsic damping materials, resonator <b>vacuumization,</b> and digital electronics to reduce temperature dependent drift and instability of control signals.|$|E
30|$|<b>Vacuumization</b> {{processes}} {{not only}} add to friction force but also increase wear, because produced suction forces along with contact of the naked surface make easier to damage sliding surfaces. In our opinion, wear of sliding contact could be greatly reduced by searching some methods to reduce friction force. These methods may include formation of micro-roughness of special shape on the surface. Similar approach was successfully used in [7] to reduce friction force in point-contact friction system. Though we use linear contact which differs significantly in properties, specially formed surface {{can also be}} used to reduce friction and wear. According to our compressive-vacuum hypothesis of friction, this can be done by preventing <b>vacuumization.</b> This idea is supported by the experimental data obtained during the friction testing of steel surfaces with specially designed micro-roughness [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|A {{new design}} of a die for the polymer {{underwater}} granulation plants has been developed. It differs from similar plants {{in the design of}} heat-insulating elements. Vacuum hollows are used as a heat insulator. A <b>vacuumization</b> process does not require a separate operation, and it is conducted simultaneously with connection of all the elements of the die by a brazing method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} the preparation method of large scale free P+ diaphragm {{based on the}} boron doped and anisotropic wet etching techniques. It also explores {{the impact of the}} RF power configuration, pressure and SF 6 flow rate on etching rate during ICP etching. It is indicated that silicon can be used as mask to solve the problems of large scale film break and the adhesion between mask and film which are caused by <b>vacuumization</b> during ICP etching. In order to avoid over etching, twice etching technique can be employed to control etching time and end point. Results of the experiment show that through etching, free P+ diaphragm can be fabricated into sensitive free beam which can be widely used in MEMS...|$|E
30|$|Constant rate mercury {{injection}} technique {{is an important}} means to characterize the microscopic pore throat structure of reservoirs, and it can accurately separate pores and throats. The constant rate mercury injection experiment is implemented using the ASPE- 730 constant rate mercury injection device produced by Coretest Systems Company. A total of 15 standard cores with the diameter of 2.5  cm are drilled in the full-diameter core, and then dried at 50  °C after polishing. When the core sample is soaked in the mercury solution after <b>vacuumization,</b> mercury is pumped into the core at a constant, extremely low rate (0.00005  ml/min). The pressure repeatedly drops and rises as the mercury enters the process, and the experiment is stopped when the pressure reaches 900 psi, i.e., 6.2055  MPa. At this time, the radius of the corresponding throat is about 0.12  µm. Real-time monitoring and automatic data acquisition and output results by the computer system are shown in Figs.  10, 11 and 12.|$|E
