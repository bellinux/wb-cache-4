5|$|However, their cup success helped <b>Vaduz</b> {{to another}} UEFA Cup, which {{resulted}} in their first win in the competition with a 4–2 aggregate victory against FAI Cup-holders Longford Town in July 2004. Burgmeier netted his second European goal during the ties, during the 3–2 second-leg victory, before they were defeated in the second qualifying round to Belgian-side Beveren, during which Burgmeier was injured forcing him to undergo a knee operation and miss {{the first month of}} the league season. <b>Vaduz</b> repeated their efforts domestically, defeating USV Eschen/Mauren in the cup and reaching the promotion play-off game. However, they were defeated by Schaffhausen and were left with only ten players on secure contracts for the following season. Burgmeier himself left <b>Vaduz</b> after five years with the club, during which he played 115league games and scored 27goals.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{started out}} as a youth at Triesen before moving to <b>Vaduz</b> in 2000. Although based in his home country, like all Liechtenstein clubs <b>Vaduz</b> played league {{football}} in Switzerlandat the time in the third tierbut also competed in the Liechtenstein Football Cup. In Burgmeier's first season the team won promotion to the Challenge League and won the Liechtenstein Cup with a 9–0 defeat against Ruggell in the final. He scored his first goal at the higher level on 31 July 2001, in a postponed game from {{the first round of the}} season, which finished in a 4–1 victory against Thun. However, <b>Vaduz</b> finished in 11thplace in the Fall Season, before results improved and they finished in second place in the Final Table, avoiding being relegated. The team also successfully defended their Liechtenstein Cup defeating USV Eschen/Mauren 6–1 in the final.|$|E

5|$|Franz Burgmeier (born 7 April 1982) is a Liechtenstein footballer, {{who plays}} as a midfielder for <b>Vaduz</b> in the Swiss Super League. Born in Triesen, Burgmeier was a burgeoning footballer and keen skier, until {{he gave up}} the latter sport at 16 {{following}} a serious injury. Having been a youth player for Triesen, he started his professional career with <b>Vaduz.</b> Burgmeier won several Liechtensteiner Cups with <b>Vaduz,</b> who were promoted to the Swiss Challenge League in 2001, and played in the UEFA Cup. After two unsuccessful attempts to win promotion to the Swiss Super League, Burgmeier left for Aarau in 2005. He spent only one season with Aarau before a move to the previous season's runners-up Basel in 2006. His two seasons with Basel were broken up by a loan spell with Thun, before he moved to England with Darlington in August 2008, where he played for one year.|$|E
5|$|In June 2003, {{he was set}} to join St. Gallen; {{however, the}} deal never went through because the Swiss side could not afford the {{transfer}} fee. Instead he started with <b>Vaduz,</b> who came closer to gaining promotion but were again unsuccessful, after they lost in the promotion–relegation play-off match. Burgmeier scored {{one of the goals}} in the second leg against Neuchâtel Xamax, but Mobulu M'Futi scored to ensure Neuchâtel won over the two legs, and <b>Vaduz</b> stayed in the Challenge League. Despite his side defending their Liechtenstein Cup, Burgmeier missed the final.|$|E
5|$|Vaduz's {{success in}} their nation's cup ensured they {{gained access to}} the UEFA Cup, and in August 2002, Burgmeier scored his first European goal during a 1–1 with Livingston, the Scottish side's first game in Europe. In the second leg, <b>Vaduz</b> had a late goal {{disallowed}} during a 0–0, and so they {{went out in the}} qualifying round for the third successive year, losing on the away goals rule. <b>Vaduz</b> topped the Fall Season table that season, but failed to win promotion to the Swiss Super League after finishing fourth in the Final League. Their failure was offset with another victory in the Liechtenstein Cup, this time defeating Balzers in the final.|$|E

The public benefit foundation funds the worldwide promotion of Greek culture, funds the Onassis International Prizes for achievement in various fields, and the funding of scholarships for Greek university students.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{was born}} in Triesen, Liechtenstein, a small town with a {{population}} of 4,500, close to the border with Switzerland. He is the younger son of Heinz and Elsbeth, following Patrick Burgmeier, who played football for <b>Vaduz</b> and USV Eschen/Mauren. From a young age, Franz played both football and skied. He played for the Liechtenstein youth team in Swiss competitions from ages 11 to 16, winning the championship when he was 13. However, at 16, a knee injury, which he suffered while skiing, nearly ended his football career and prompted him to stop the former sport.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier, instead, {{moved to}} Aarau in Switzerland. His debut {{came in a}} 2–0 league defeat to Thun, before he was {{substituted}} {{near the end of}} the second half. Aarau were in the Super League, and finished seventh in Burgmeier's only season with the club, in which he played 35league games. His only league goal came in the second round of matches against St. Gallen, but he also scored in both the first two rounds of the Swiss Cuphis first games in the cup since <b>Vaduz</b> were not eligible for the competitionbefore they were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties. His form with Aarau won Burgmeier the Liechtensteiner Footballer of the Year award, one point ahead of fellow international Mario Frick, and also earned him a move to Basel, for whom he signed a three-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier's first {{role with}} Basel {{was to play}} in the Uhrencup as they {{defeated}} German-side FC Köln 2–1, to share the trophy with Zürich. Basel had finished the previous season as runners-up in the league to Zürich on goal difference and so qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup. Burgmeier made his Basel debut in the competition as they defeated Kazakhstan's Tobol 3–1 on 13 July, before he was replaced by Scott Chipperfield. The second leg ended in a draw, sending Basel through. The second qualifying round draw gave Burgmeier a chance to return to <b>Vaduz.</b> He was a substitute in both games as his new team won on away goals. They went on to qualify for the group stages, in which they finished bottom of their division, with two points from four games. Burgmeier scored his first goal for his new club in a 4–2 away defeat against Sion, but again the side only ranked in the Championship behind Zürich, this time by one point. Their disappointment was offset by an extra time victory over Luzern in the final of the Swiss Cup.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 23 January 1719, when Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the countship of <b>Vaduz</b> united and raised to the dignity of a principality. Liechtenstein {{was a part of}} the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805; this marked Liechtenstein's formal independence, though it was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards. While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead. Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921, Hans-Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein's politics in the early 21st century, which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003, effectively making Liechtenstein a semi-constitutional monarchy again. However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely. The current monarch is Hans-Adam II, who turned over the day-to-day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein on 15 August 2004.|$|E

25|$|Until 1956, {{there were}} only two banks in Liechtenstein: the Liechtensteinische Landesbank as an {{institution}} governed by public law, and Bank in Liechtenstein AG, a private-law company. On 6 April 1956, Guido Feger founded Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank – today’s VP Bank – in the legal form of a Liechtenstein institution with start-up capital of 2 million Swiss francs. The founding was a logical extension of Guido Feger’s Allgemeinen Treuunternehmens (ATU), at the time the largest and oldest trust company in <b>Vaduz.</b> In 1956, it employed 13 people in Liechtenstein and, on behalf of clients, four offices workers in foreign countries. Together, they catered to the needs of roughly 900 clients in matters pertaining to the fiduciary administration of real estate interests, securities portfolios and current accounts – mainly in the CHF realm and the United States – as well as patent rights, loans and fixed-term deposits.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, England's High Court {{ruled that}} Marlborough Fine Art {{had to be}} {{replaced}} by a new independent representative for the Bacon estate. The estate moved its business to Faggionato Fine Arts in Europe and Tony Shafrazi in New York. That same year, the estate sued Marlborough UK and Marlborough International, <b>Vaduz,</b> charging them with wrongfully exploiting Bacon in a relationship that was manifestly disadvantageous to him until his death in 1992, and to his estate. The suit alleged Marlborough in London grossly underpaid Bacon for his works and resold them through its Liechtenstein branch at much higher prices. It contended that Marlborough never supplied a complete accounting of Bacon's works and sales and that Marlborough handled some works it has never accounted for. The suit was dropped in early 2002 when both sides agreed to pay their own costs and Marlborough released all its documents about Bacon. In 2003, the estate was handed to a four-person trust based in Jersey.|$|E

Basel's 2015–16 Swiss Super League season began well with a home victory on 18 July against FC <b>Vaduz.</b> In fact, they started the season very well, winning each of their first eight games. Basel's clear aim for the 2015–16 Swiss Cup was to regain the title that they last won four seasons earlier {{and in the first}} round of the competition Basel were drawn away against Meyrin FC and in the second round against YF Juventus. Then, in the third round, Basel were drawn away against SV Muttenz at the Margelacker in front of a stadium record attendance of 5,800.

They were then put up against Macedonians FK Rabotnički. Basel won 6–2 at St. Jakob-Park and 1–0 at the Skopje City Stadium {{to qualify for the}} group stages where they faced tough opposition, Blackburn Rovers, Nancy, Feyenoord and Wisła Kraków. Basel's first game came against Feyenoord at home. They came away with a respectable 1–1 draw. Their next group match was at Ewood Park against Blackburn. Basel played reasonably well but shaky defending became their downfall. Nancy, at home, were their next opponents, and the match ended in a 2–2 draw. Basel's last group game was against Wisła Kraków at the Wisła Stadium. FCB needed a win to qualify but their poor European campaign came to an end after losing 3–1 despite taking an early lead through Mladen Petrić.|$|E
