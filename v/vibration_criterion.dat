40|$|The {{design of}} vibration-sensitive {{advanced}} technology facilities generally involves considerable attention to structural and mechanical aspects. In most cases, the vibration control measures {{contribute significantly to}} a facility’s cost. The selection of a <b>vibration</b> <b>criterion</b> for use in design {{is an important step}} in the design process. Many process equipment manufacturers have provided tool-specific criteria, and the literature contains several forms of “generic ” criteria. Unfortunately, there is no standardization in either tool-specific or generic criteria, and considerable confusion can arise. Often the confusion is associated with the forms of data representation being used. This paper first reviews some of the relevant fundamentals of signal processing, then uses experimental data to develop a tool-specific <b>vibration</b> <b>criterion</b> for an optical microscope. Two dissimilar approaches to generic criteria are discussed and their signal processing requirements are examined. They are compared with a manufacturer’s published vibration criteria for a projection aligner. Recommendations are given for future development of tool-specific criteria...|$|E

Microelectronic and Nanotechnology-Shamsuddin Research Center (MiNTSRC) building at UTHM is selected to be a location for ground borne vibration measurement due to human activities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In current design practice, the {{thickness}} of the slab has been determined to satisfy requirement for deflection control. However, the slab thickness in residential building may not satisfy the floor vibration criteria, even though {{the thickness}} is determined by design provisions. Thus it is necessary to develop the procedure to determine slab thickness that satisfies the floor vibration criteria. This study attempts to propose slab thickness that satisfies floor vibration criteria against occupant induced floor vibration. Since there are uncertainties in loading and material properties, probabilistic approach is adopted using Monte-Carlo simulation and equivalent SDF model. From the result, floor thicknesses for several exceedance probabilities which satisfied <b>vibration</b> <b>criterion</b> were proposed...|$|E

40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{a quick and}} easy way of quantifying {{the performance of a}} vibration-isolated platform. We measure the vibration transfer from floor to table using background noise excitation from the floor. As no excitation device is needed, our setup only requires two identical sensors (in our case, low noise accelerometers), a data acquisition system, and processing software. Background noise excitation from the floor has the additional advantage that any non-linearity in the suspension system relevant to the actual vibration amplitudes will be taken into account. Measurement time is typically a few minutes, depending on the amount of background noise. The (coherent) transfer of the vibrations in the floor to the platform, as well as the (non-coherent) acoustical noise pick-up by the platform are measured.

40|$|Abstract – In {{order to}} assess the {{variation}} of ground vibration intensity, if any, due {{to the use of}} three different blasting methods and two different types of explosives, a large number of monitored ground vibrations was analysed in an open cut coal mine. This work involved 86 sets of blast data for different types of blasting when ANFO and Slurry explosives were used in this mine. Statistical analysis of the data sets resulted in 5 of the best fitting empirical relationships between peak particle velocity and scaled distance with excellent values of coefficients of correlations. A comparison of the analytical work revealed that the level of ground vibration varies significantly with the changing method of blasting and/or explosive type. The roles of these factors have been quantified. The rate of the vibration reduction, due to the variation of blasting modes and/or explosive type, varies within each blasting method. These rates are higher in lower ranges of scaled distances, but converge to an almost constant rate at certain scaled distances. The range of this rate varies from 45. 77 % to 89. 34 % for free face blasting, and from 38. 72 % to 56. 28 % for a buffered blast, depending on the explosive type and scaled distance. It was also observed that one of the two site-specific parameters in the empirical <b>vibration</b> <b>criterion</b> is influenced significantly by the variation of the blasting method and explosive type. However, the other parameter is not much affected by these two factors, and is shown to be more loyal to ground conditions...|$|E
40|$|Director de tesis: Reynolds, PaulThis {{dissertation}} comprises {{three important}} parts. First, a detailed literature review into the state-of-the-art {{of design and}} assessment of floors supporting sensitive equipment, with particular emphasis in human-induced vibration. Second, modelling and analysis of a hospital floor structure and comparison of analytical responses with existing recorded experimental floor responses and third, assessment of the floor vibration serviceability in accordance with manufacturer specification. The hospital floor will support two sensitive scanners at its Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Unit. Each scanner will be supported on isolated composite floor structures (Area 1 and Area 2). The floor system for the isolated structures comprises a cat in-situ concrete slab on a profiled steel decking supported on deep steel cellular beams. To improve vibration performance, elastomeric bearing pads were provided to support the isolated floor structures. The main floor is made of a similar, but less stiff, composite floor system. The two isolated slabs {{and part of the}} main floor were modeled and analyzed using ANSYS FE software. In order to simulate pedestrians walking on the floor structure, real walking force time histories were input into the finite element model and responses calculated. The analytical responses were the compared with existing experimental floor responses. It was found that analytical responses reasonably match experimental responses for Area 1. However, for Area 2, there was inconsistency between the analytical and experimental responses. Finally, a vibration serviceability assessment according manufacturer specification was performed to determine the adequacy of the isolated slabs to support the planned sensitive scanners. The vibration assessment determined that the isolated structures are adequate to support the scanners when human-induced vibration is present. However, it also determined that under vehicle-induced ground-borne vibration, the isolated platforms fail to provide low-vibration levels, and therefore will compromise equipment performance. The isolated platforms failed the manufacturer <b>vibration</b> <b>criterion</b> and are not recommended to support the sensitive MRI scanners unless vibration mitigation measurements are implemented...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{times have}} {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} infrastructure and mineral resource developments. As a result, mining activities have also increased to supply the needed mineral. Blasting has been the main technique for loosening insitu rock before use. Consequently {{there is a growing}} concern of the effects of blasting activities on the environment. These effects are normally nuisances to the neighboring residence as they come in the form of: dust, toxic gases, noise, fly rocks and ground vibration. Of the set of nuisances the one that is of most concern is ground vibrations which can cause damage to structures. In most cases worldwide, after blasting activities there are the usual complaints about damage to residence, and less mining activities which is also a focus of the thesis. A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of heavy blasting in open-pit coal mines on the stability of adjoining under ground coal mine workings. There have been researches on the subject of ground vibrations to help refute some of these complaints. The works of Lewis Oriard and Charles Dowding are the foundation on which standards and regulations are built as guides to assist blasters in the prevention of creating unnecessary nuisances. Most countries have developed their own regulations with respect to blasting and parameters are set according to the geological conditions. This is of importance as the rock structures determine the transmission of the peak particle velocity. However, most countries in the west adopt standards similar to ones put forward by the United States Bureau of Mines. It my opinion that a whole scale adoption should not take place as the criteria used may not be suitable for other countries’ geological conditions. For this thesis the aim was to identify a vibration level that will not cause damage to structures close to a mining area and increase production by effective blasting.

Third is to analyse and compare the <b>vibration</b> <b>criteria</b> of the building from both vehicles and footfalls. Registrar office building in UTHM was chosen in this study as it is multi-storey building that serves as an administration building and is exposed to internal and external vibration. Laser Doppler Vibrometer was used in field measurement to obtain the vibration response from loaded passenger and footfalls. For footfalls, one people, three people and five people included vibration were measured to observe the difference in vibration response.

In the simulations, a hydraulic actuator is employed and the vibration levels of the controlled platform and each floor are evaluated by BBN <b>Vibration</b> <b>Criteria.</b> Results show that with active control, the microvibration of the platform can be greatly reduced to a quiet level compared to the floor microvibration.
