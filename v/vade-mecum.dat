6000|$|... “DEAR COLMAN,—It {{may be some}} five-and-thirty {{years since}} we met, and [...] I believe as near forty years as may be since I was {{promoted}} from my [...] garret, No. 3 Peckwater, into your ci-devant rooms in the old Quad, [...] on which occasion I bought your things. Of all your household [...] furniture I possess but one article, which I removed with myself to [...] my first house and castle in Essex, as a very befitting parsonage [...] sideboard, viz., a mahogany table, with two side drawers, and which [...] still ‘does the state some service,’ though not of plate. But I have [...] an article of yours on a smaller scale, a certain little flat [...] mahogany box, furnished partially, I should say, with cakes of paint, [...] which probably you over-looked, or undervalued as a <b>vade-mecum,</b> and [...] left. And, as an exemplification of the great vanity of over-anxious [...] care, and the safe preservation per contra, in which an article may [...] possibly be found without any care at all, that paint-box is still [...] in statu quo, at this present writing, having run the gauntlet, not [...] merely of my bachelor days, but of the practical cruelties of my [...] thirteen children, all alive and merry, thank God! albeit as unused [...] and as little disposed to preserve their own playthings or chattels [...] from damage as children usually are, yet it survives! ‘The reason [...] why I cannot tell,’ unless I kept it ‘for the dangers it had passed.’ ...|$|E

My present purpose is not, therefore, to give a history of Photography, or such an elaborate description of its principles as would involve a consideration of the theory of light and of the laws of optics and of practical chemistry, but only to make public, through the means of the Society, the process which I have myself employed in the production of a few calotype views of Hobart Town, &c., submitted for inspection at a late meeting of the Society...|$|R
60|$|Macaulay {{came upon}} the world of letters just as the middle classes were {{expanding}} into enormous prosperity, were vastly increasing in numbers, and were becoming more alive than they had ever been before to literary interests. His Essays {{are as good as}} a library: they make an incomparable manual and <b>vade-mecum</b> for a busy uneducated man, who has curiosity and enlightenment enough to wish to know a little about the great lives and great thoughts, the shining words and many-coloured complexities of action, that have marked the journey of man through the ages. Macaulay had an intimate acquaintance both with the imaginative literature and the history of Greece and Rome, with the literature and the history of modern Italy, of France, and of England. Whatever his special subject, he contrives to pour into it with singular dexterity a stream of rich, graphic, and telling illustrations from all these widely diversified sources. Figures from history, ancient and modern, sacred and secular; characters from plays and novels from Plautus down to Walter Scott and Jane Austen; images and similes from poets of every age and every nation, 'pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical;' shrewd thrusts from satirists, wise saws from sages, pleasantries caustic or pathetic from humorists; all these throng Macaulay's pages with the bustle and variety and animation of some glittering masque and cosmoramic revel of great books and heroical men. Hence, though Macaulay was in mental constitution one of the very least Shakesperean writers that ever lived, yet he has the Shakesperean quality of taking his reader through an immense gallery of interesting characters and striking situations. No writer can now expect to attain the widest popularity as a man of letters unless he gives to the world multa as well as multum. Sainte-Beuve, the most eminent man of letters in France in our generation, wrote no less than twenty-seven volumes of his incomparable Causeries. Mr. Carlyle, the most eminent man of letters in England in our generation, has taught us that silence is golden in thirty volumes. Macaulay was not so exuberantly copious as these two illustrious writers, but he had the art of being as various without being so voluminous.|$|E
6000|$|A great {{pleasure}} to me is your good and generous letter just received--with its luxurious implied licence for me of seeking this aid to prompt response; {{at a time when}} a pressure of complications (this is the complicated time of the year even in my small green garden) defeats too much and too often the genial impulse. But so far as compunction started and guided your pen, I really rub my eyes for vision of where it may--save as most misguidedly--have come in. You were so far from having distilled any indigestible drop for me on that pleasant ultimissimo Sunday, that I parted from you with a taste, in my mouth, absolutely saccharine--sated with sweetness, or with sweet reasonableness, so to speak; and aching, or wincing, in no single fibre. Extravagant and licentious, almost, your delicacy of fear of the contrary; so much so, in fact, that I didn't remember we had even spoken of the heavy lucubrations in question, or that you had had any time or opportunity, since their [...] "inception," [...] to look at one. However your fond mistake is all to the good, since it has brought me your charming letter and so appreciative remarks you therein make. My actual attitude about the Lucubrations is almost only, and quite inevitably, that they make, to me, for weariness; by reason of their number and extent--I've now but a couple more to write. This staleness of sensibility, in connection with them, blocks out for the hour every aspect but that of their being all done, and of their perhaps helping the Edition to sell two or three copies more! They will have represented much labour to this latter end--though in that they will have differed indeed from no other of their fellow-manifestations (in general) whatever; and the resemblance will be even increased if the two or three copies don't, {{in the form of an}} extra figure or two, mingle with my withered laurels. They are, in general, a sort of plea for Criticism, for Discrimination, for Appreciation on other than infantile lines--as against the so almost universal Anglo-Saxon absence of these things; which tends so, in our general trade, it seems to me, to break the heart. However, I am afraid I'm too sick of the mere doing of them, and of the general strain of the effort to avoid the deadly danger of repetition, to say much to the purpose about them. They ought, collected together, none the less, to form a sort of comprehensive manual or <b>vade-mecum</b> for aspirants in our arduous profession. Still, it will be long before I shall want to collect them together for that purpose and furnish them with a final Preface. I've done with prefaces for ever. As for the Edition itself, it has racked me a little that I've had to leave out so many things that would have helped to make for rather a more vivid completeness. I don't at all regret the things, pretty numerous, that I've omitted from deep-seated preference and design; but I do a little those that are crowded out by want of space and by the rigour of the 23 vols., and 23 only, which were the condition of my being able to arrange the matter with the Scribners at all. Twenty-three do seem a fairly blatant array--and yet I rather surmise that there may have to be a couple of supplementary volumes for certain too marked omissions; such being, on the whole, detrimental to an all professedly comprehensive presentation of one's stuff. Only these, I pray God, without Prefaces! And I have even, in addition, a dim vague view of re-introducing, with a good deal of titivation and cancellation, the too-diffuse but, I somehow feel, tolerably full and good [...] "Bostonians" [...] of nearly a quarter of a century ago; that production never having, even to my much-disciplined patience, received any sort of justice. But it will take, doubtless, a great deal of artful re-doing--and I haven't, now, had the courage or time for anything so formidable as touching and re-touching it. I feel at the same time how the series suffers commercially from its having been dropped so completely out. Basta pure--basta! ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} age {{within the field of}} {{geological}} researches, above seismology, mineralogy and petrography but together with paleontology, Volcanology appears, whose investigation techniques (as Jean-Etienne Guettard, a French mineralogist who lived between 1715 - 1786, clarified on the pages of "Memories de L'Academie Royale des Sciences" in 1752) are basically founded on the lava traces, on the marks of the multiform colors released by eruptions and included {{in a wide range of}} lava and non-lava materials, on the examination of vapors emanated by sub-circular cavities existing in nature. All this was considered by Guettard as a clue of the remote presence of activity of one or more volcanoes located in the area investigated. Actually Guettard restates, but now in the middle of the eighteenth century with renovated techniques of observation of nature, the Galilean intuition, according which men have in front of them the "big book of nature" that now they have to understand, using the optical tool (microscope) with as much philological strictness (as Galilei) starting from the hints, the traces and the clues which appear before them. "Calling things with their own name, conferring them their own functions, including observed phenomena in their belonging collection" establish that scientific method which will constitute the <b>vade-mecum</b> (also based on the Linnaeus method) for all those who will go from France to Campania in order to observe the effects of the erupting Vesuvius on the surrounding landscape. The study of the scientific reports of these European scholars about the "materia vesuviana” (Vesuvius topic), researched with the method of the morphological comparison of what was found on the ground and, more generally, in the homologous parts of Vesuvius area, constitutes the start point of our historical lecture, whose aim is to understand some of the natural elements that forms the "City of Vesuvius"...|$|E
