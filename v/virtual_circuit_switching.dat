We find that service curves provide a convenient framework for managing the allocation of performance guarantees. In particular, bounds on end-to-end performance measures can be simply obtained in terms of service curves and burstiness constraints on arriving traffic. Service curves can be allocated to the connections, and we consider scheduling algorithms that can support the allocated service curves. Such an approach provides the required degree of isolation between the connections {{in order to support}} performance guarantees, without precluding statistical multiplexing.

A novel 2 -stage Clos switch is proposed and integrated into an SDM router.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{communication}} protocol, called the virtual circuit deflection (VCD) protocol, which combines {{some of the}} individual characteristics of <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>switching</b> and deflection routing. An advantage of the VCD protocol over previous (datagram) deflection schemes is that deflections in the former occur on a per session basis (or a per subsession basis, if sessions need to be split to find adequate capacity on the outgoing links), while in the latter, they occur on a per packet basis. This makes packet resequencing at the destination considerably easier to accomplish in the VCD protocol than in datagram deflection schemes. The VCD protocol exploits the storage arising from the high bandwidth-delay product of optical fibers to provide lossless communication with little buffering at the switches and {{without the need for}} advance reservations. This makes it particularly suitable for networks that use optical switching, where buffers are expensive to implement with current optical [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Flow {{labelled}} IP over ATM {{was both}} an architecture and a technology {{to solve a}} number of problems that emerged from the train-crash that was the collision between Broadband-ISDN and the Internet. It was not merely a hack to work around the mismatch in semantics between a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>switched</b> underlay and a stateless datagram routed overlay. The intention was to take advantage of facilities offered by the underlay technology such as flow state maintenance and flowisolation and protection in switches, to offer QoS at various levels of granularity, whether for unicast or multicast. The paper was one of the seminal influences for what is now the burgeoning MPLS industry, although in the architecture described we see something simpler, more elegant, and, perhaps, more aligned to the traditional Internet design philosphy [Clark 88], than to the telecommunications mindset in the hardcore Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN) Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) proponents 1. Of course there has been a long and valiant history of tweaking IP (and other datagram protocols) to run over <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (VC) networks, dating back to the need to run IP over X. 25 in the 1970 s- 1980 s. Typically, there was no advantage taken of the underlying circuit technology (indeed there was a disadvantage in having to use it), and so the main techniques developed involved heuristics for triggering circuit setup and tear-down from a shim module that sit between IP and the VC layer and monitored IP level activity. Alongside, if you were lucky, there might be a management knob to allow you to adjust the laxity or aggressiveness of the shim, depending on potential cost/performance tradeoff decisions: X. 25, and later IP over dial-up typically incurred monetary costs by time and/or volume. B-ISDN (and, guilty by association, ATM) was originally intended as an overarching system for networking, replacing IP. It was too complex and too late to survive in that role, although the underlying cell-switching technology i...|$|R

40|$|Link {{failures}} are {{a common}} cause of service disruption in computer networks. When a link of a network fails, all communications which were using the failed link are tem-porarily interrupted. Techniques have been engineered to alleviate the consequences of hardware failure in a network by rerouting traffic from the failed link to other links. When performed by low communication layers, rerouting is fast but expensive as ad-ditional hardware is needed. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} reroute traffic at higher layers using software mechanisms, but such solutions prove to be slow. More-over, most rerouting schemes are not optimized for multicasting applications such as teleconferencing where one sender can send data to several receivers. The Internet is a datagram packet switching network where data is carried in IP packets. Recently, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) has been devised to carry IP packets over virtual circuits, thus combining the advantages of datagram packet switching and <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>switching.</b> In this thesis, we devise a solution to protect multicast communications in MPLS networks from a link failure.
