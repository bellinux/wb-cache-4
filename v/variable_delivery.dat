40|$|Insertion {{heuristics}} {{have proven}} to be popular methods for solving a variety of vehicle routing and schedulingproblems. In this paper, we focus on the impact of incorporating complicating constraints on the efficiency of insertion heuristics. The basic insertion heuristic for the standard vehicle routing problem has a time complexity of On 3. However, straightforward implementations of handling complicating constraints lead to an undesirable time complexity of On 4. We demonstrate that with careful implementation it is possible, in most cases, to maintain the On 3 complexity or, in a few cases, increase the time complexity to On 3 logn. The complicating constraints we consider in this paper are time windows, shift time limits, <b>variable</b> <b>delivery</b> quantities, fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>delivery</b> times, and multiple routes per vehicle. Little attention has been given to some of these complexities (with time windows being the notable exception), which are common in practice and {{have a significant impact on}} the feasibility of a schedule as well as the efficiency of insertion heuristics.

This report evaluates patient characteristics, PDA anatomy, hemodynamic <b>variables,</b> <b>delivery</b> technique and coil geometry to determine predictors of success. Methods. Between January 1995 and January 1997, 16 of 118 patients undergoing catheterization for PDA closure {{were found to have}} large PDAs. Their median age and weight were 14 months (range 3 months to 43 years) and 8. 5 kg (range 3. 5 to 73), respectively. The mean PDA diameter was 4. 3 mm (range 3. 5 to 5. 9). Closure of PDAs was attempted using transcatheter delivery of 0. 038 -in. (0. 096 -cm) and 0. 052 -in. coils. Differences in clinical, anatomic, hemodynamic and technical variables between successes and failures were compared. Results. Eleven (69 %) of 16 patients had successful closure of their PDA. Failures occurred only in patients 7 mm/m and a pulmonary/systemic flow ratio ≥ 2. 8 : 1. Use of 0. 052 -in. coils tended to reduce the incidence of embolization and the number of coils needed for closure. Conclusions. Patients > 8 months of age can have successful closure of large PDAs with currently available Gianturco coils. The 0. 052 -in. Gianturco coils can be used safely to close large PDAs in infants as small as 6 kg. Increased experience and improved coil design may improve closure rates of large PDAs in infants...|$|R

The work involved investigation of the potential interaction between matrix ultrastructural morphology, in vitro release kinetics, bioactivity and immunoreactivity of selected macromolecules with limited hydrolytic stability, delivered from controlled release vehicles. The underlying principle involved photo-polymerisation of the monomer, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, around frozen ice crystals, leading {{to the production of}} a macroporous hydrophilic matrix. Bead form matrices were fabricated in controllable size ranges in the region of 100 µm - 3 mm in diameter. The initial stages of the project involved the study of how <b>variables,</b> <b>delivery</b> speed of the monomer and stirring speed of the non solvent, affectedthe formation of macroporous bead form matrices. From this an optimal bench system for bead production was developed. Careful selection of monomer, solvents, crosslinking agent and polymerisation conditions led to a variable but controllable distribution of pore sizes (0. 5 - 4 µm). Release of surrogate macromolecules, bovine serum albumin and FITC-linked dextrans, enabled factors relating to the size and solubility of the macromolecule on the rate of release to be studied. Incorporation of bioactive macromolecules allowed retained bioactivity to be determined (glucose oxidase and interleukin- 2), whilst the release of insulin enabled determination of both bioactivity (using rat epididymal fat pad) and immunoreactivity (RIA).

First, electrospinning technique was employed to prepare poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-methacrylic acid) (pNIPAM-co-MAA) MFs containing ibuprofen. It was found that drug release rates from PCL MFs cannot be significantly varied by either temperature (22 – 40 °C) or pH values (1. 7 – 7. 4). In contrast, the ibuprofen (IP) diffusion rates from pNIPAM-co-MAA MFs were very sensitive to changes in both temperature and pH. The IP release from pNIPAM-co-MAA MFs was highly linear and controllable when the temperature was above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of pNIPAM-co-MAA (33 °C) and the pH was lower than the pKa of carboxylic acids (pH 2).

This case study elucidates both causes, and likely solutions, to backlog problems occurring at the loading dock of the wholesale grocery company Dagab of the Axfood Group. On-site observations and staff interviews were performed for the study. The {{purpose of the study}} was to propose improvements that may lead to more efficient planning of deliveries for storage warehouses in the grocery retail industry. Variation in demand for both the type and quantity of goods was found to be a cause for warehouse complexity, often creating a significant need for logistical flexibility in purchasing, and on the warehouse floor. Large purchases that deviated from the regular flow of goods, for example, sales campaigns or increased holiday demand, proved to be the main cause of loading-dock backlogs. This was especially problematic when individual deliveries converged due to large delivery volumes; these often resulted in problematic truck ques at the loading dock. Four principal areas of improvement were identified in Dagab’s current working methods. (1) Operational purchasers at Dagab must remain flexible in their purchasing methods and adapt methods according to the period’s demand pattern. Increased planning of large delivery volumes both during sales campaigns, and before holidays, would reduce strain within the loading dock. (2) Lack of understanding regarding the entire distribution chain prevented employees from making correct decisions at times when efficiency and productivity was most needed. In many cases this could easily have been avoided if there was more focus on cross-departmental communication. (3) Some goods occupy buffer locations and cause unnecessary handling at the warehouse. It would be advantageous to follow the cost of the goods throughout the whole flow, rather than focusing only on the purchase price. And (4), there is a lack of standardized working methods and routine. A higher standard of common working methods would increase efficiency and simplify many of the processes that tend to cause problems during peak periods. The removal of unnecessary workloads and streamlining of processes would add benefit for the company. The implementation of strategies such as these are likely to alleviate problems regarding <b>variable</b> <b>delivery</b> volumes at the loading dock, which would streamline the movement of goods through Dagab and for similar companies...|$|E

Methods: We completed a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled neuroprotection trial in selected neonates with congenital heart disease requiring operations for which deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was used. An extensive database was generated that included preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative <b>variables.</b> <b>Variables</b> (<b>delivery,</b> maternal, and infant related) were evaluated to produce a preoperative risk-of-death prediction model by means of logistic regression. An operative risk-of-death prediction model including duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was also generated. Results: Between July 1992 and September 1997, 350 (74 %) of 473 eligible infants were enrolled with 318 undergoing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. The mortality was 52 of 318 (16. 4 %), unaffected by investigational drug. The resulting preoperative risk model contained 4 variables: (1) cardiac anatomy (two-ventricle vs single ventricle surgery, with/without arch obstruction), (2) 1 -minute Apgar score (≤ 5 vs > 5), (3) presence of genetic syndrome, and (4) age at hospital admission for surgery (≤ 5 or > 5 days). Mortality for two-ventricle repair was 3. 2 % (4 / 130). Mortality for single ventricle palliation was 25. 5 % (48 / 188) and was significantly influenced by Apgar score, genetic diagnosis, and admission age. The preoperative model had a prediction accuracy of 80 %.

Appli-cation time, sponge size, sponge make (Altomed, Weck, Merocel), and 5 -FU con-centration were varied. Conjunctival and scleral tissue levels were determined in samples taken from the application site. Results—Dose-response curves for scleral and conjunctival 5 -FU levels against appli-cation time showed increasing tissue level...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} in vitro the effect of different <b>variables</b> (<b>delivery</b> system, surface contact with the irrigant, the frequency of changing the irrigant and the total volume of the irrigant) of sodium hypochlorite on the elimination of E. faecalis using rotary instrumentation and intermittent passive ultrasonic irrigation (IPUI). MATERIALS and METHODS: Sixty extracted single-rooted teeth were instrumented up to size 20 K-ﬁle, then inoculated with E. faecalis. The root canals were prepared up to a # 40 using 0. 04 proﬁle rotary ﬁles and irrigated with 2 ml of 2. 25 % NaOCl. Ultrasonic P 5 with NiTi ﬁle # 25 was oscillated for 30 seconds after # 30 ﬁle, at the end of the preparation, and after NaOCl was left in situ for 5 minutes to complete 15 minutes of preparation. A total volume of 10 ml of sodium hypochlorite was used. The root canals were divided equally into four experimental and one control groups. In Group I, pipette was used to deliver the irrigant; Group II, the total contact time of irrigant was 30 minutes; Group III, the canal was ﬂushed every 2 minutes; Group IV, the total volume of the irrigant was 20 ml and in Group V (control), chemo-mechanical preparation was carried out without IPUI. The root canals were sampled before and after instrumentation and the zone of bacterial growth were measured in mm and recorded. RESULTS: A signiﬁcant bacterial reduction was demonstrated in Groups I (P= 0. 020), II (P= 0. 001), and IV (P= 0. 000) as compared to Groups III and V. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that the ﬂushing action, the larger volume of sodium hypochlorite irrigant and the increase in the contact time of the irrigant combined with rotary instrumentation and IPUI enhanced the elimination of E. faecalis from the root canal.
