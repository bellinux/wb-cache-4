40|$|In {{approximately}} half of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 –infected individuals, the development of CXC chemokine receptor 4 –using, syncytium-inducing (SI) <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> precedes a rapid progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In other individuals, only CC chemokine receptor 5 –using (R 5), non-SI (NSI) <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> are present throughout infection. These individuals may be either long-term survivors (LTSs) or rapid progressors. The basis for this variable disease progression in individuals with only R 5 <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> is not yet fully understood. In this study, the b-chemokine sensitivity of biological HIV- 1 clones isolated from 13 individuals who harbored only R 5, NSI <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> (7 LTSs and 6 progressors) was investigated. We found a statistically significant decrease in sensitivity of <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> to RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell–expressed and –secreted) neutralization {{during the course of}} progressive in-fection, but not during follow-up of LTSs.

However, the origin and evolution of the virus population in breast milk, the likely reservoir of transmitted <b>virus</b> <b>variants,</b> are not well characterized. In this study, HIV envelope (env) genes were sequenced from <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> amplified by single-genome amplification from plasmas and milk of 12 chronically HIV-infected, lactating Malawian women. Maximum likelihood trees and statistical tests of compartmentalization revealed interspersion of plasma and milk HIV env sequences {{in the majority of}} subjects, indicating limited or no compartmentalization of milk <b>virus</b> <b>variants.</b> However, phylogenetic tree analysis further revealed monotypic <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> that were significantly more frequent in milk (median proportion of identical viruses, 29. 5 %; range, 0 to 61 %) than in plasma (median proportion of identical viruses, 0 %; range, 0 to 26 %) (P = 0. 002), suggesting local virus replication in the breast milk compartment. Moreover, clonally amplified virus env genes in milk produced functional virus Envs that were all CCR 5 tropic. Milk and plasma virus Envs had similar predicted phenotypes and neutralization sensitivities to broadly neutralizing antibodies in both transmitting and nontransmitting mothers. Finally, phylogenetic comparison of longitudinal milk and plasma virus env sequences revealed synchronous virus evolution and new clonal amplification of evolved virus env genes in milk. The limited compartmentalization and the clonal amplification of evolving, functional viruses in milk indicate continual seeding of the mammary gland by blood <b>virus</b> <b>variants,</b> followed by transient local replication of these variants in the breast milk compartment...|$|R
40|$|A quick genetic {{approach}} for the screening of influenza <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> {{was developed in}} this laboratory (S. Zou, J. Clin. Microbiol. 35 : 2623 – 2627, 1997). It uses multiplex reverse transcription and multiplex PCR to amplify and differentiate the variable region of the hemagglutinin genes of different types and subtypes of influenza <b>viruses.</b> <b>Variants</b> within the same type or subtype are then identified by the heteroduplex mobility shift assay of the amplicons.

40|$|The {{biological}} {{relevance of}} nonneutralizing antibodies elicited early after infection with noncytopathic persistence-prone viruses is unclear. We demonstrate that cytotoxic T lymphocyte–deficient TgH(KL 25) mice, which are transgenic for the heavy chain of the {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCMV) –neutralizing monoclonal antibody KL 25, mount a focused neutralizing antibody response following LCMV infection, and that this results {{in the emergence of}} neutralization escape <b>virus</b> <b>variants.</b> Further investigation revealed that some of the escape variants that arose early after infection could still bind to the selecting antibody. In contrast, no antibody binding could be detected for late isolates, indicating that binding, but nonneutralizing, antibodies exerted a selective pressure on the virus. Infection of naive TgH(KL 25) mice with distinct escape viruses differing in their antibody-binding properties revealed that nonneutralizing antibodies accelerated clearance of antibody-binding <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> in a partly complement-dependent manner. <b>Virus</b> <b>variants</b> that did not bind antibodies were not affected.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to analyse correlates of viral escape in AIDS patients. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV− donors were inoculated with AIDS patients' serum to detect neutralization-resistant cell-free virus. Infectious virus was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analysed by sequencing the V 3 region. The escaped virus species was compared with all V 3 <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> found in the patients' PBMC and plasma. In one patient escaped virus was also compared with variants found in CD 4 + T cells isolated by FACS from blood, spleen and lymph node. The frequency of the <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> was determined by cloning and sequence analysis of 20 V 3 clones for each PCR amplification.

40|$|Defining the {{earliest}} virologic events following {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) transmission may be critical {{for the design of}} vaccine strategies aimed at blocking acquisition of HIV- 1 infection.

Here we show that the dose of the virus inoculum affects these key virologic parameters following intrarectal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of rhesus monkeys. Low-dose SIV infection resulted in a lengthened eclipse phase, fewer transmitted <b>virus</b> <b>variants,</b> and decreased innate immune activation compared with these parameters in high-dose SIV infection.

40|$|Macrophage-tropic <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> evolved {{during the}} course of {{infection}} of individual rhesus monkeys with cloned, non-macrophagetropic simian immunodeficiency virus.

Cloned viruses differing at nine amino acid positions in env exhibited a more than 100 -fold difference in replicative capacity for primary cultures of rhesus monkey alveolar macrophages. At least five of the nine amino acid changes contributed to macrophage tropism. These determinants were distributed across the full length of env, including both the gp 120 and gp 41 products of the env gene. Furthermore, the emergence of macrophagetropic variants in vivo was associated with specific pathologic manifestations in which the macrophage is the major infected cell type. Thus, major determinants of macrophage tropism reside in env, they can be complex in nature, and the presence of macrophage-tropic <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> in vivo can influence the disease course and disease manifestations...|$|R

5000|$|As with HIV, the {{development}} of an effective vaccine against FIV is difficult because of the high number and variations of the virus strains. [...] "Single strain" [...] vaccines, i.e., vaccines that only protect against a single <b>virus</b> <b>variant,</b> have already demonstrated a good efficacy against homologous FIV strains.

Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are suggested {{to contribute to}} a viral bottleneck during MTCT, but their role in blocking transmission is unclear, as studies comparing the NAb sensitivities of maternal viruses have yielded disparate results. We sought to determine whether transmitting mothers differ from nontransmitting mothers in the ability to neutralize individual autologous <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> present at transmission. Ten transmitting and 10 nontransmitting HIV-infected mothers at high risk of MTCT were included in this study. Full-length HIV envelope genes (n = 100) were cloned from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained near transmission from transmitting mothers and at similar time points from nontransmitting mothers. Envelope clones were tested as pseudoviruses against contemporaneous, autologous maternal plasma in neutralization assays. The association between transmission and the log 2 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) for multiple <b>virus</b> <b>variants</b> per mother was estimated by using logistic regression with clustered standard errors. t tests were used to compare proportions of neutralization-resistant viruses. Overall, transmitting mothers had a median IC 50 of 317 (interquartile range [IQR], 202 to 521), and nontransmitting mothers had a median IC 50 of 243 (IQR, 95 to 594).

Approximately 93 % of the cases were in wildlife, and 7 % were in domestic animals. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 2, 659 raccoons (36. 6 %), 1, 973 bats (27. 2 %), 1, 478 skunks (20. 4 %), 489 foxes (6. 7 %), 274 cats (3. 8 %), 93 dogs (1. 3 %), and 57 cattle (0. 8 %). Compared with numbers of reported cases in 2006, cases in 2007 increased among dogs, bats, foxes, and skunks while decreases were reported among cattle, cats, and skunks. Increases in numbers of rabid raccoons during 2007 were reported by 11 of the 20 eastern states where raccoon rabies was enzootic, and reported cases increased by 1. 7 % overall, compared with 2006. On a national level, the number of rabies cases in skunks during 2007 decreased by 1. 1 % from the number reported in 2006.
