50|$|The German Panzer II light tank, {{which was}} one of the most {{numerous}} in German service during the invasion of Poland and the campaign in France, used a 20 mm autocannon as its main armament. Although ineffective against tank armour even during the early years of the war, the cannon was effective against light-skinned vehicles as well as infantry and was also used by armoured cars. Larger examples, such as the 40 mm <b>Vickers</b> <b>S,</b> were mounted in ground attack aircraft to serve as an anti-tank weapon, a role to which they were suited as tank armour is often lightest on top.|$|R

The chairman of the panel, Mr. Ivor Bowen (Assistant Director of Armament Research) turned to the idea of using rocket projectiles as a means of delivering a large warhead capable of destroying or disabling heavy tanks. Information was sought from the Soviets, who had just started using unguided RS-82 rockets against German ground forces in the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa.|$|R

50|$|Further {{armament}} {{trials and}} experimental modifications were performed throughout the Beaufighter's operational lifespan. By mid-1941, {{a total of}} 20 Beaufighters were reserved for test purposes, including engine development, stability and maneuverability improvements, and other purposes. In May 1941, a pair of Beaufighter Mk II aircraft, R2274 and R2306, were modified to the Beaufighter Mk III standard; removing the six wing guns and two inboard cannons to install a Boulton-Paul-built quad-gun turret directly behind the pilot. The turret, which was intended to overcome the impact of recoil and nose-down tendency that affected the aircraft due to the conventional armament, was found to obstruct the emergency egress of the pilot. For another armament experiment, the fourth prototype, R2055, had its regular armament removed and was modified {{with a pair of}} 40mm heavy guns for attacking ground targets, the two guns being a <b>Vickers</b> <b>S</b> gun mounted on the starboard fuselage and a Rolls-Royce BH gun mounted on the port fuselage; these trials led to the Vickers gun being installed on an anti-tank orientated model of the Hawker Hurricane.|$|R

40|$|Whilst ‘{{occupation}}’ and {{the links}} between occupation and health have been central tenets of occupational therapy since its inception (Reilly 1961), the place and meaning of occupation within our therapeutic repertoire has evolved and changed as the profession has developed (Wilcock & Hocking, 2015). Utilising the principles of auto/biography and autoethnography (Adams, et al 2015), this poster will explore the nature of ‘occupation’ from a professional and personal perspective across a 40 year career pathway. In the mid- 1970 s occupational therapy was a medical model profession working from a reductionist and bottom-up perspective. Crafts, such as basketry, were {{the main focus of}} {{the first year of the}} Diploma of Occupational Therapy and ‘Refer to Occupational Therapy’ (Shopland, et al 1975) provided a blueprint for their application into practice. With the advent of graduate level education, the application and critical analysis of ‘occupation’ has replaced craft learning and as therapists we engage with service users to help them to develop and re-develop meaningful occupations. From a personal perspective, baking has been a meaningful and restorative occupation. Baking has provided a means of remaining connected with friends and colleagues during a period of illness; it has become a focus for fundraising activity and the opportunity for creativity, challenge and the development of new skills. It has been a conduit for doing, being and becoming (Wilcock & Hocking, 2015). By exploring ‘occupation’ within an historical, auto/biographical and autoethnographic context this poster will give participants the opportunity to reflect on the nature and location of ‘occupation’ for themselves both professionally as occupational therapists and personally as occupational beings. By reflecting on the history of our profession we can understand not only the past but can clearly articulate our place in the health and social care of the present and the future.

Following the recent interest of the fuzzy community in topological systems of <b>S.</b> <b>Vickers,</b> we clarify completely relationships between these structures and (dual) attachment, showing that unlike the former, the latter have no inherent topology, but are capable of providing a natural transformation between two topological theories.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cetuximab-induced hypomagnesemia {{has been}} {{associated}} with improved clinical outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). We explored this relationship from a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab plus best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC alone in patients with pretreated advanced CRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Day 28 hypomagnesemia grade (0 versus ≥ 1) and percent reduction (< 20 % versus ≥ 20 %) of Mg from baseline was correlated with outcome. RESULTS: The median percentage Mg reduction at day 28 was 10 % (− 42. 4 % to 63. 0 %) for cetuximab (N = 260) versus 0 % (− 21. 1 % to 25 %) for BSC (N = 251) [P < 0. 0001]. Grade ≥ 1 hypomagnesemia and ≥ 20 % reduction from baseline at day 28 were associated with worse overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio, HR 1. 61 (95 % CI 1. 12 – 2. 33), P = 0. 01 and 2. 08 (95 % CI 1. 32 – 3. 29), P = 0. 002, respectively] in multivariate analysis including grade of rash (0 – 1 versus 2 +). Dyspnea (grade ≥ 3) was more common in patients with ≥ 20 % versus < 20 % Mg reduction (68 % versus 45 %; P = 0. 02) and grade 3 / 4 anorexia were higher in patients with grade ≥ 1 hypomagnesemia (81 % versus 63 %; P = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior reports, cetuximab-induced hypomagnesemia was associated with poor OS, even after adjustment for grade of rash. M. M. <b>Vickers,</b> C. <b>S.</b> Karapetis, D.

40|$|The {{major part}} of this thesis deals with fuzzy {{geometric}} logic and fuzzy geometric logic with graded consequence. The first chapter mainly contains the concept of topological system introduced by <b>S.</b> <b>Vickers</b> in 1989. In Chapter 2 the notion of fuzzy topological system is introduced and categorical relationship with fuzzy topology and frame is discussed in detail. Also this chapter contains some methodology to make new fuzzy topological systems from the old one. Chapter 3 provides a generalization of fuzzy topological system which shall be called L topological system and categorical relationships with appropriate topological space and frame. Furthermore, two ways of constructing subspaces and subsystems of an L topological space and an L topological system are respectively provided. Chapter 4 deals {{with the concept of}} variable basis fuzzy topological space on fuzzy sets and contains a new notion of variable basis fuzzy topological systems whose underlying sets are fuzzy sets. In this chapter categorical relationship between space and system is established. Chapter 5 contains a different proof of one kind of generalized stone duality, which was done directly by Maruyama, introducing a notion of n fuzzy Boolean system.

Little effort has been made to find out patient preferences for chronic disease care, hence, we conducted a study aimed at identifying these. Methods: A 20 -item questionnaire, asking for patients&rsquo; and providers&rsquo; preferences and perceptions, was mailed out to 1000 randomly selected patients in Olmsted County, Minnesota, identified through a diabetes registry to have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a prototypical prevalent chronic disease. Surveys were also sent to 42 primary care providers. Results: There were 254 (25. 4 %) patient responders and 28 (66 %) provider responders. The majority of patients (&gt; 70 %) and providers (89 %) expressed willingness to have various aspects of diabetes care managed by a care manager. Although 75 % of providers would be comfortable expanding the care manager role to other chronic diseases, only 39. 5 % of patient responders would be willing to see a care manager for other chronic problems. Longer length of time from initial diagnosis of diabetes was associated with decreased patient likelihood to work with a care manager. Conclusion: Despite study limitations, such as the lack of validated measures to assess perceptions related to care management, our results suggest that patients and providers are willing to collaborate with a care manager and that both groups have similar role expectations of a care manager.

40|$|Net-impressed and {{horizontally}} corded pottery {{was first}} documented in southern Manitoba in the 1950 <b>s</b> by Chris <b>Vickers</b> and Richard <b>S.</b> MacNeish. At that time, the net-impressed pottery was labeled Rock Lake net-impressed, while the horizontally corded pottery was labeled as Avery Corded ware. These two wares assigned to certain foci {{belonging to the}} original Manitoba chronology. The net-impressed pottery found in southwestern Manitoba, was included with the Rock Lake focus, a cultural manifestation created by Vickers, and subsequently built upon by MacNeish. In the southeastern portion of the province, MacNeish encountered similar net-impressed pottery but assigned it to the cultural manifestation known as the Nutimik focus, a designation later deemed unfounded. Horizontally corded pottery, although labeled, was never assigned to a cultural entity. Alternatively, in Minnesota, net-impressed and horizontally corded pottery have been assigned to the Elk Lake culture and are known as Brainerd ware. This cultural manifestation has a long duration in the state, beginning ca. 3500 B. P. and lasting until approximately ca. A. D. 400, when {{the origins of the}} Avonlea horizon begin to appear. This thesis re-examines the work of Vickers and MacNeish, in particular the Avery, United Church, Lockport and Cemetery Point sites, where net-impressed and horizontally corded pottery have been recovered. It is illustrated that there are strong similarities between the two styles of pottery found in southern Manitoba and Minnesota. These similarities include both metric and non-metric traits. As well, four types of Brainerd ware are identified: (1) net-impressed; (2) horizontally corded; (3) parallel-grooved; and (4) plain. These kinds of pottery become important when examining ware from the Avonlea horizon, particularly in regards to the presence of net-impressed, parallel-grooved, and plain pottery. The work of Vickers and MacNeish was incredibly important {{to the development of a}} culture history for southern Manitoba, their work and that of subsequent researchers, such as Joyes (1969, 1970) needs to be re-examined...|$|R
