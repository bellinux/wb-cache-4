50|$|One of {{the most}} common {{fail-safe}} systems is the overflow tube in baths and kitchen sinks. If the <b>valve</b> <b>sticks</b> open, rather than causing an overflow and damage, the tank spills into an overflow.

50|$|Other freeflows may {{be caused}} by the second stage valve jamming due to grit or {{corrosion}} products fouling the movement of the valve poppet, or the purge <b>valve</b> <b>sticking</b> in the depressed position. These can sometimes be stopped by pressing the purge button a few times to free up the works. If all else fails, the diver can breathe from a freeflowing demand valve by allowing excess air to escape from the sides of the mouth and the exhaust valve, which may allow a safe ascent, or at least the use of as much remaining gas as possible. When a full-face mask is used, excess gas will be vented through the exhaust valve and around the mask skirt, usually allowing the diver to continue to breathe without difficulty during the freeflow. This does not help after the cylinder has emptied.|$|E

25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or dry suits.

There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The low flow rate Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the <b>valve</b> <b>sticks</b> open.

Examples of situations {{that could lead}} to transmission failure include warming up the catalytic converter on petrol engine-powered vehicle with too high RPM, or while measuring amount of smoke on diesel engine-powered vehicle and keeping the throttle full for too long time.The correct procedure would be to stop the engine for at least 90 seconds, do the test (without selecting again D or R, this means without re-pressurizing the gearbox) for no longer than a minute, and if the procedure must be repeated, stop again for at least 90 seconds and repeat.Another issue is the governor <b>valve</b> <b>sticking,</b> which can be caused by contamination. i.e. clutch plates or other parts disintegrating. The fine debris finds its way past the filter and tends to accumulate in the governor, causing it to stick. A temporary solution is to remove and clean the governor. The problem will often recur as debris from damaged parts continues to build up in the governor. If the problem continues after cleaning the governor then it may be necessary it replace the autobox.Usual symptoms are failing to shift after 1st gear while the gearbox is still cold, and then failing to kickdown to 1st while at a stop. The governor is located {{at the end of the}} gearbox and usually it starts to work again after a cleanup.|$|E

50|$|Missile 15A was {{launched}} on April 5, following two aborted launch attempts on March 28 and April 1, {{the latter being}} called off when a propellant leak started a fire on the launch pad. Because aerodynamic heating was believed to have caused the electrical malfunctions on 13A and 11A, more insulation and resistors were added around the vernier wiring (the verniers were also added to the roll program for the first time) and the fairing around the engine nozzles extended. The flight was uneventful until T+96 seconds when a momentary drop in B-1 thrust occurred. Total engine shutdown occurred at T+105 seconds and the Atlas fell into the Atlantic Ocean, remaining structurally intact until impact. Postflight analysis concluded that a bearing in the LOX turbopump gearbox had come loose, resulting in shutdown of the pump and loss of thrust. The Atlas A program concluded with the flight of 16A on June 3, which mostly completed its mission objectives, although several hardware malfunctions occurred. The pneumatic system experienced difficulties and helium bottle pressure was nearly down to zero at BECO. This {{was thought to be}} caused by a <b>valve</b> <b>sticking</b> open that allowed helium to enter the LOX tank uncontrollably, although the boil-off valve operated correctly and opened to vent the tank and prevent excessive pressure buildup. Telemetry data for the propellant utilization system was erratic or nonexistent for most of the flight, and the guidance tracking beacon failed at T+69 seconds; it was thought to have been torn off the missile. The pressure level in the turbopump gearbox was also modified slightly to prevent a recurrence of the malfunctions on 13A and 15A.|$|E

40|$|Exploitation of {{the natural}} {{reserves}} of petroleum products has put a tremendous onus on the automotive industry. Increasing pollution levels and the depletion of the petroleum reserves have lead {{to the search for}} alternate fuel sources for internal combustion engines. Usage of vegetable oils poses some challenges like poor spray penetration, <b>valve</b> <b>sticking</b> and clogging of injector nozzles. Most of these problems may be solved by partial substitution of diesel with vegetable oil. In this work, the performance and emission characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine fueled by waste cooking oil-diesel emulsion with different water contents are evaluated. The use of waste cooking oil-diesel emulsion lowers the peak temperature, which reduces the formation of NOx. Moreover the phenomenon of micro explosion that results during the combustion of an emulsified fuel finely atomizes the fuel droplets and thus enhances combustion. Experiments show that CO concentration is reduced as the water content is increased and it is seen that 20 % water content gives optimum results. Also, there is a significant reduction in NOx emissions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Stiction {{in control}} valves is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the control valve to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the control valves to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the control <b>valve</b> <b>sticks</b> and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty control valve, especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such faulty control valves...|$|R

50|$|Magog {{is finally}} {{directed}} {{to go to}} the complex's nuclear reactor control room and pull the safety rod out of the atomic pile, starting a chain reaction that will build to a nuclear explosion, which in turn will destroy the entire facility. Sheppard arrives in time to push the safety rod back into the pile, stopping the chain reaction. He then attacks the robot with a flame thrower and disables it, but Gog soon follows its twin to the reactor room to finish the job. Sheppard's flame thrower runs out of fuel as the robot advances on him. Dr. Van Ness arrives with another flame thrower, but the control <b>valve</b> <b>sticks,</b> and Gog now turns on him. Sheppard desperately begins using the nozzle of his flame thrower as a bludgeon, trying to smash the robot's electronic tubes. The now-crippled robot begins spinning back and forth, its arms thrashing about wildly. At that point, Gog suddenly comes to a halt, its metal arms falling limply to its sides. American F-86 and F-94 jet fighters have found and destroyed the enemy plane, ending NOVAC's reign of destruction. Van Ness then realizes that Sheppard and Merritt have been exposed to an overdose of radiation from the reactor.

40|$|The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} safety features in modern vehicles. It is a device integrating complicated electronic systems, hydraulic systems and mechanical components. It is possible to produce faults in these systems due to extreme vehicle operating conditions, which may lead to the failure of the ABS. However, there has not been an effective mechanism available in current operation and service facilities, which allows the performance of the ABS to be checked on-board or at a service base. This research therefore aims to investigate and develop approaches which allow the ABS systems to be monitored in different ways. As the ABS is a highly integrated system, conventional monitoring methods cannot be applied to it directly. The primary objective of this research is to develop a condition monitoring model for a typical ABS system under different conditions and then to monitor the dynamic characteristics and performance of the ABS according to simulation and experimental results. The Rapid Control Prototype (RCP) technique is used by applying dSpace MicroAutoBoxII on the ABS controller. A full mathematical model has been developed to simulate the ABS system under different conditions and seeded fault conditions. This results in a full understanding of the characteristics of measurable variables such as wheel velocity and vehicle velocity. This work has led to the conclusion that a model-based condition monitoring approach is the method with the most potential for the monitoring of the ABS systems. To overcome inevitable measurement noise and model uncertainties, a Kalman filter (KF) has been designed and evaluated through both simulation data and experimental results. This has been found to have acceptable performance and has subsequently been incorporated into the model-based condition monitoring system. The performance of the model-based condition monitoring system has been evaluated using an ABS test system. The ABS test rig consists of the basic ABS components and also the dSpace MicroAutoBoxII components, together with NI data acquisition equipment. The ABS test rig developed in this research is highly flexible to allow experimental investigations under different fault conditions with different severities. It has demonstrated that the monitoring system can reliably detect different possible faults in the ABS such as speed sensor failure, solenoid <b>valve</b> <b>sticking</b> or stuck, hydraulic fluid leakage and pump efficiency loss. All these faults occur with high possibility according to a systematic failure mode analysis based on that of similar components. Obviously, there is still considerable work which needs to be carried out to adopt this system in industry. For example, interfaces to integrate this new system into existing vehicle electronics should be investigated. In addition, specific fault conditions from different vehicle manufacturers should be simulated to tailor the system to specific vehicles specifically...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature search}} and a confidential survey were critically analyzed {{to determine the}} effects of water on the stability of hydrofluorocarbon/synthetic lubricant systems and to identify key areas requiring further investigation. Following are highlights from the analysis: Clathrate hydrates are solid solutions formed when water molecules are linked through hydrogen bonding creating cavities that can enclose various guest molecules from hydrate formers, such as hydrofluorocarbons R- 32, R- 125, R- 134 a, R- 407 C and R- 410 A. The four methods for preventing clathrate formation were drying the gas, heating it, reducing its pressure, or using inhibitors. The hydrolysis of polyolester lubricants was mostly acid-catalyzed and its reaction rate constant typically followed the Arrhenius equation of an activated process. Hydrolytic stability improved with hindered molecular structures, and with the presence of acid catcher additives and desiccants. Water vapor can effect the adsorption of long-chain fatty acids and the chemistry of formation of protective oxide film. However, these effects on lubrication can be either positive or negative. Fifty to sixty percent of the moisture injected into an air-conditioning system remained in the refrigerant and the rest mixed with the compressor oil. In an automotive air-conditioning system using R- 134 a, ice would form at 0 C evaporating temperature when the water content in the vapor refrigerant on the low-pressure side was more than 350 ppm. Moisture would cause the embrittlement of polyethylene terephthalate and the hydrolysis of polyesters, but would reduce the effect of amine additives on fluoroelastomer rubbers. The reactions of water with refrigerants and lubricants would cause formicary and large-pit corrosion in copper tubes, as well as copper plating and sludge formation. Moreover, blockage of capillary tubes increased rapidly in the presence of water. Twenty-four companies responded to the survey. From the responses, the water concentrations specified and expected for different refrigerant/lubricant systems varied depending on the products, their capacities and applications, and also on the companies. Among the problems associated with high moisture level, lubricant breakdown was of greatest concern, followed by acid formation, compressor failure and expansion <b>valve</b> <b>sticking.</b> The following research topics are suggested: 1. The air-conditioning and refrigeration industry needs to measure and record the water content and total acid number of the lubricant of newly installed systems as well as operating systems that are shutdown for service or repair. The reason for the shutdown needs to be documented. A database can then be established to correlate water content with type and cause of breakdown. 2. Detailed studies on the distribution of water in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems should be conducted to pinpoint problem areas associated with free water. 3. Research is needed to validate the current theories and mechanisms of formicary corrosion. Corrosion inhibitors need to be developed. 4. The conditions for clathrate formation and decomposition of other alternative refrigerants, such as R- 23, R- 41, R- 116, R- 125, R- 143 a, R- 404 A and R- 507 C, and water should be determined to avoid possible problems associated with tube plugging.

40|$|Abstract — Industrial surveys {{reported}} that, {{almost one}} third of poorly performing control loops are caused by nonlinearities present in the control valves, {{one of which is}} static friction. The effect of this nonlinearity is usually observed as oscillations in process variable. Since industrial plants include numerous interacting loops, the oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. Doubtlessly, repairing the faulty valves will be the only solution to this problem, which is possible only during process shut down. But, as shutting down the process to isolate the faulty valve for maintenance purposes is not economical, this solution does not count as the primary one. So, {{there is a need for}} a method to compensate the destructive effect of the stiction phenomenon in the control valve, especially when maintenance is not available. This paper focuses on existing compensation issues, followed by a proposal of a new model-based compensation approach for the stiction nonlinearity present in control valves.

50|$|The MCA-Jet {{system has}} a small third valve {{separate}} from the intake and exhaust valves. Separate passages in the intake manifold feed each MCA-Jet valve. Since these passages are smaller than the main intake manifold passages, the air/fuel mixture must move faster. When the faster moving air/fuel mixture from the MCA-Jet valve hits the slower moving air/fuel mixture from the intake valve, a strong air swirling effect occurs that promotes more complete combustion. With MCA-Jet {{it was found that}} stable combustion could be obtained even with large amounts of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), NOx could be reduced, and combustion improved. Honda's CVCC Stratified charge engine approach also used a small third valve, but sent a richer air/fuel mixture to a small pre-combustion chamber near the spark plug, to help ignite a leaner air/fuel mixture in the main combustion chamber. MCA-Jet was a simpler system that sent the same air/fuel mixture to all intake and MCA-Jet valves. Each MCA-Jet valve is quite small and may be prone to carbon build-up, causing the MCA-Jet <b>valve(s)</b> to <b>stick</b> open. If a Mitsubishi-designed engine has low compression, the MCA-Jet valve(s) could be the cause. Fortunately, each MCA-Jet valve and valve seat are a self-contained cylinder-shaped unit that screws into the cylinder head for easy replacement. Aftermarket MCA-Jet valves are available. With the advent of 4-valve-per-cylinder engines, manufacturers typically design the camshaft(s) to open one intake valve slightly before the other to create a swirling effect. This has made the MCA-Jet system obsolete. The MCA-Jet system was used in certain Mitsubishi-designed engines installed in both Mitsubishi-branded and Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth-branded vehicles during the late 1970s to late 1980's.|$|R
