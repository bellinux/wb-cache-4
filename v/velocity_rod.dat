40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} homogenized {{model for}} dynamic fluid-structure interaction i a pressurized water eactor core {{is used to}} study {{the influence of the}} virtual density and spacer's tiffness. The model consists of a linear system of partial differential equations for fluid <b>velocity,</b> <b>rod</b> velocity and pressure. For these equations analytical solutions are deduced for boundary conditions prescribing either periodic wall oscillations or linearly growing wall accelerations from rest. The theoretical model for the virtual density is verified by comparison to an experiment. For zero spacer stiffness, purely acoustic oscillations appear. For positive spacer stiffness, additional oscillations arise with relative rod motions. The wavelengths of the latter oscillations are small for weak spacers. Large numerical effort would be required in a more complete three-dimensional core-model to resolve such short wave lengths. In fact in a typical core the spacer's tiffness cs is small in comparison to the fluid bulk modulus K. For cs/KgO. 1 it might be appropriate to neglect he influence of the spacers. 1...|$|E

Results showed that the combustion <b>velocity</b> of the <b>rod</b> decreased when the content of CaO and MgO increased. The rods with 0. 2 g MgO and 1. 2 g or 1. 5 g CaO were easy to control, which combustion velocities were about 12 mm·s- 1. No obvious changing rule was found for the density of the slag when the content of additives changed. But the densities of slag were all lower than that of metal Fe and Cu. Viscosity calculation showed that the viscosity value of slag increased when the temperature drop. The additive CaO and MgO reduced the slag viscosity.

40|$|In {{previous}} publications by {{the authors}} of this paper it was shown that elastic media become dispersive {{as the result of the}} coupling between the finite rotation and the elastic deformation. Impact-induced harmonic waves no longer travel, in a rotating rod, with the same phase velocity and consequently the group velocity becomes dependent on the wave number. In this investigation, the propagation of impact-induced longitudinal waves in mechanical systems with variable kinematic structure is examined. The configuration of the mechanical system is identified using two different sets of modes. The first set describes the system configuration before the change in the system topology, while the second set describes the configuration of the system after the topology changes. In the analysis presented in this investigation, it is assumed that collision between the system components occurs first, followed by a change in the system topology. Both events are assumed to occur in a very short-lived interval of time such that the system configuration does not appreciably change. By using the first set of modes, the jump discontinuity in the system velocities is predicted using the algebraic generalized impulse momentum equations. The prop-agation of the impact-induced wave motion after the change in the system topology is described using the Fourier method. The series solution obtained is used to examine the effect of the topology change on the propagation of longitudinal elastic waves in constrained mechanical systems. It is shown that, while, for a nonrotating rod, mass capture or mass release has no effect on the phase and group <b>velocities,</b> in rotating <b>rods</b> the phase and group velocities depend on the change in the system topology. In particular the phase velocities of low harmonic longitudinal waves are more affected by the change in the system topology as compared to high frequency harmonic waves. ...|$|R
