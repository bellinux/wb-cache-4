5|$|Agrippa's {{death in}} 12BC {{elevated}} Tiberius and Drusus {{with respect to}} the succession. At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then elect a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear favorite of Democratic–Republicans was Jefferson, although he was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> run. There was little doubt that Adams would be {{the choice of a}} great majority of the Federalists. Even so, Hamilton also had hoped to lead the party.|$|E
5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E

5|$|After {{a request}} from Army Group F to Himmler, a {{decision}} was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: the Bosnians were <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> take up the {{invitation}} and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E

5000|$|As the {{popularity}} of freestyle skateboarding declined, Mullen was urged to transform his style to join the street skating trend that was becoming increasingly popular at that time; however, Mullen was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> due <b>to</b> a fear of compromising his integrity, whereby the foundation of his skateboarding would be [...] "sold out". Such pressure is alluded to in the World Industries video, Rubbish Heap, in which Mullen's sequence ends with team member, Jeremy Klein, deliberately breaking his freestyle skateboard and then handing him a note from Rocco, accompanied by a street skateboard deck, in which the end of freestyle is declared.|$|R

25|$|Initially, Aspasia was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> {{accept the}} romantic {{advances}} of the prince. Renowned for his many female conquests, Alexander {{seemed to her}} untrustworthy, also because their social differences impeded any serious relationship.

To cope with isolation, Waikato Māori, under Te Puea's leadership, increasingly returned to the old Pai Marire (Hau hau) cult of the 1860s.|$|E
50|$|H. gigas is {{primarily}} a diurnal species. It {{is also a very}} active and inquistive snake, which will spend much of the day climbing, burrowing and even swimming.

Captive-bred specimens can become quite tame and trusting and many exhibit a high level of intelligence.|$|R
60|$|The Spanish army {{occupied}} {{both sides}} of the river, the wing on the right bank being protected from attack by the river Lippe, which falls into the Rhine at Wesel, and by a range of moorland hills called the Testerburg. The Dutch cavalry saw that the slopes of this hill were occupied by the Spaniards, but believed that their force consisted only of a few troops of horse. Young Count Philip of Nassau proposed that a body of cavalry should swim the Lippe, and attack and cut them off. Prince Maurice and Sir Francis Vere gave a <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> consent <b>to</b> the enterprise, but finally allowed him to take a force of five hundred men.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The task of {{planning}} humanitarian relief operations within {{a high number}} of hardly collaborating and vaguely linked non-governmental organizations is a challenging problem. We suggest an alternative knowledge based approach to the coalition formation problem for humanitarian and peace-keeping missions. Owing to the very special nature of this domain, where the agents representing individual organisations may eventually agree to collaborate, but are <b>very</b> often <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> share their knowledge and resources, we tried to reduce the problem complexity by splitting the community of agents into alliances. We combined classical negotiation mechanisms with the acquaintance models and social knowledge techniques {{in order to reduce the}} communication traffic and to keep the privacy of knowledge. Experimental results are discussed in the paper. ...|$|R
25|$|After peaking {{during the}} {{whirlwind}} campaign {{west of the}} Oder, {{the morale of the}} French troops hit a new low point in Poland. The bad weather and approaching winter made Napoleon's troops <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> continue the campaign. The Polish roads went from deep mud to frozen ruts as the weather grew colder. The emperor was forced to dispense a bonus in pay and extra shirts and shoes for his soldiers. Even so, French military discipline grew worse. At this time, Napoleon first used the term, les grognards (the grumblers), to describe his troops.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{have argued}} that at least in North America, wolves {{contribute}} little to overall livestock losses. In 2005 0.11% of all cattle losses were due to wolves. In states with wolf populations, they were responsible {{for an average of}} 2.5% of predation on sheep. Jim Dutcher, a filmmaker who raised a captive wolf pack, observed that the wolves were <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> try meat that they had not previously eaten or seen another wolf eat before, possibly explaining why livestock depredation is unlikely except in cases of desperation. In Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, wolf predation accounts for 1% of total sheep deaths.|$|E
25|$|Inimicus are piscivorous ambush predators. They are nocturnal and {{typically}} lie partially buried {{on the sea}} floor or on a coral head during the day, covering themselves with sand and other debris to further camouflage themselves. They have no known natural predators. When threatened, they spread their brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, they are <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> leave their hiding places. When they do move, they display an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion---they crawl slowly along the seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of their pectoral fins as legs.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{argue against}} {{the view that}} {{widening}} economic imbalances necessarily imply that the conjuncture is deteriorating, and more specifically against concluding that the UK imbalances, {{at the end of}} 2001, were clearly unsustainable. The term imbalance is in any case too widely used, and it is important to distinguish between stocks and flows, and therefore between an unsustainable level of debt and an unsustainable growth of debt. Policy-makers should be <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> about seeking <b>to</b> correct imbalances, as there is little certainty over what the "right" level of debt, or current account, is at any particular time.

25|$|In October 1956, Eden, {{after two}} months of pressure, finally and reluctantly agreed to French {{requests}} to include Israel in Operation Revise. The British alliances with the Hashemite kingdoms of Jordan and Iraq had made the British <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> fight alongside Israel, lest the ensuing backlash in the Arab world threaten London's friends in Baghdad and Amman. The coming of winter weather in November meant that Eden needed a pretext to begin Revise as soon as possible, which meant that Israel had to be included. This was especially the case as many Conservative backbenchers had expected Eden to launch operations against Egypt in the summer, and were disappointed when Eden had instead chosen talks. By the fall of 1956, many Tory backbenchers were starting to grow restive about the government's seeming inability to start military action, and if Eden continued to put off military action for the winter of 1956–57, {{it is possible that}} his government might not had survived.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{change into}} a girl, she {{is shown in}} the anime as {{completely}} clueless about basic matters related to being a girl such as feminine modesty, how she walks, talks, and handles herself throughout the day. In the manga, this is shown to a much lesser extent and Hazumu is able to adjust to living like a girl much quicker and with less direct interference from others than in the anime. In the anime, Tomari tries to teach Hazumu everything there is about being a girl, but in the manga she is <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Hazumu's sex has changed and tries to help her as little as possible in becoming more feminine. Hazumu's personality in the manga is more direct than her anime counterpart, such as when expressing outward annoyance towards her parents' eccentric behaviors, and Hitoshi's awkwardly straightforward interferences in her love life. Also, during the day at the beach in the manga version, Hazumu seeks out Asuta when she is being hit on by two guys and asserts that Asuta is her boyfriend, but in the anime Asuta takes the role of Hazumu's protector and asserts that she is his girlfriend.|$|E
25|$|Beyer {{originally}} intended to have Ernst Busch {{play the role of}} Krämer, but the singer declined because his face was half-paralyzed from injuries during a bombing raid in World War II. Erwin Geschonneck was chosen in his stead. The director also picked his neighbor's son, the four-year-old Jürgen Strauch, to portray the child saved by the resistance. DEFA sought out foreign actors for the roles of the foreign members of the resistance, like Soviet actor Viktor Avdyushko, who was already well known in East Germany and cast as Bogorski. A minor part was given to Apitz himself - he appeared as an old man caring for the child who is found dead after the camp's liberation. Beyer also retained several of the actors who performed in the television adaptation, like Wolfram Handel, Fred Delmare and Peter Sturm, who was called to depict August Rose for the second time. The actor was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> take the role and had to be pressured by Apitz and the director, Sturm, who had been twice incarcerated in Buchenwald, was badly depressed by the work on the film, falling ill after it ended.|$|E
60|$|The last bell of {{the steamer}} rang. Cytherea had {{forgotten}} herself, {{and what she}} was looking for. In a fever of distress lest Owen should be left behind, she gathered up in her hand {{the corners of her}} handkerchief, containing specimens of the shells, plants, and fossils which the locality produced, started off to the sands, and mingled with the knots of visitors there congregated from other interesting points around; from the inn, the cottages, and hired conveyances that had returned from short drives inland. They all went aboard by the primitive plan of a narrow plank on two wheels--the women being assisted by a rope. Cytherea lingered till the <b>very</b> last, <b>reluctant</b> <b>to</b> follow, and looking alternately at the boat and the valley behind. Her delay provoked a remark from Captain Jacobs, a thickset man of hybrid stains, resulting from the mixed effects of fire and water, peculiar to sailors where engines are the propelling power.|$|R
50|$|Knowing they won't be able {{to protect}} {{themselves}} without the magic potion, Asterix and Vitalstatistix desperately attempt to have Getafix brew some, resulting in explosions and the occasional flying cauldron, and thus alert the Romans that something is up.

However, one of these makes him lighter than air causing him to float away, where he reports their problem. The Romans soon send a patrol to investigate, and come back with the Soothsayer instead, whom the villagers think had been driven off by a sceptical Asterix. The centurion is quickly convinced that Prolix is genuine (much to his dismay since Gaulish soothsayers are to be arrested) and decides to use him to chase away the villagers. Soon Prolix appears at the gates and foretells doom if the village is not abandoned — apart from Asterix, Obelix and a still crazed and potion brewing Getafix, the entire village leave for a nearby island.|$|R
