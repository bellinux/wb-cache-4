25|$|The {{empennage}} of the Hydro-triplane {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of lattice girders, parallel in plan and each constructed from a horizontal member fixed to the upper wing {{at the top of the}} innermost interplane struts and a member below it which sloped upward from the lower wing to meet the upper one at the tail. Three sloping cross braces completed each girder. The rectangular tailplane, fitted with elevators, was placed over the ends of the girders, its leading edge braced by a central, <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> to the hull which also supported the rudder post out beyond the hull on upper and lower sloping struts. The trapezoidal rudder extended a little above the horizontal tail, which had a deep V-shaped cut-out to accommodate its movement.|$|E
2500|$|The Poppenhausen had a simple, {{constant}}-chord wing {{much like}} that of the Hols der Teufel though of 16% greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. [...] Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Hols der Teufel, ending at the blunt, rounded tips. [...] The wing was supported over the fuselage by two vertical cabane struts, one {{on each side of the}} forward cockpit and a single, <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> centrally behind the rear cockpit. Two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about 40% of the span.|$|E
2500|$|The 156 uses a {{platform}} {{derived from the}} Alfa Romeo 155, which in turn {{was derived from the}} Fiat Group's [...] "Tipo" [...] platform. However it is sufficiently different from the original [...] "Tipo" [...] one {{to be seen as a}} new platform. The 156 is a highly developed front-wheel drive car; (the Cross/Sportwagon Q4 offered four-wheel drive in left-hand drive markets) with a double high wishbone front suspension and Camuffo type rear suspension, which consists of a telescopic <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> with coaxial spring and two transverse links of different lengths and a longitudinal strut. This structure means that the rear wheels have a tiny passive steering ability. Weight saving material (aluminium) has been used in several parts both front and rear suspension.|$|E

2500|$|The Jacobs plans {{show the}} Hols der Teufel had a simple, {{constant}} chord wing {{much like that}} of the Zögling though of greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. [...] Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Zögling and its round cornered, tapered tips were less angular. [...] As before, the wing was supported by the forward members of its girder fuselage; a <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> near the leading edge and an inverted V-strut behind. [...] As the wing was strut rather than wire braced there was no longer a need to extend these struts above the wing into a pylon. [...] The two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about mid-span.|$|E
2500|$|The first glider to {{be named}} the Hols der Teufel was the {{influential}} Djävaler Anamma, designed by Alexander Lippisch in 1923. The name {{was associated with the}} cursing of two Swedish students in the Wasserkuppe workshops whose favourite phrase it was. [...] It translates into German as Hols der Teufel. Its key structural feature was an A-frame which carried wire braced wings and linked to a flat girder rear fuselage. [...] It later evolved through the Schneider Grunau 9 into the very popular Zögling, which avoided the controversial [...] "skullsplitter" [...] forward member of the A-frame with a <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> behind the pilot, and was related to the secondary RRG Prüfling glider that replaced wire bracing with rigid lift struts. [...] The Hols der Teufel of 1928, designed by Lippisch and Hans Jacobs, possibly with the assistance of Alexander Schleicher had the Zögling girder frame and the strut braced wings, making it very different from its ancestral namesake.|$|E
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre had an {{undercarriage}} {{composed of}} both wheels and floats, {{though it was}} possible to remove the former; photographs show the aircraft in both configurations. [...] There was no cross-axle, each wheel being mounted individually on two pairs of outwardly splayed V-struts from the feet of the inner interplane struts and another to the feet of the nearest centre-section struts. Its floats were mounted immediately ahead of the wheels, articulated at a forward point on their centreline by a strut from the outrigger, a strut from the wing leading edge over the wheels and another from the wheel axle. A rear strut had a pneumatic shock absorber. [...] A third float, similar in size and shape, was mounted on a <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> attached to the girder cross-member ahead of the tailplane, braced at its lower end by a pair of struts angled up {{to the ends of the}} vertical girders. [...] The floats were flat bottomed with segmental section and an almost square plan, with a width about 70% of their length. As on Fabre's original aircraft, they were mounted with a pronounced angle of attack.|$|E
40|$|Trussed beam {{with the}} 46 m span was {{considered}} {{as an object}} of investigations. Pultrusion composite profiles and steel cables were considered as the materials of the trussed beam top chord, web and bottom chord, correspondingly. Trussed beam with strut frames, trussed beam with triangular web and trussed beam with <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> were compared {{from the point of view}} of maximum vertical displacements. The trussed beam with <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> is characterized by the increased deformability in case if the load is uniformly distributed by the half of the span. It was shown, that the application of additional diagonals allows to decrease the deformability of trussed beam with <b>vertical</b> <b>struts.</b> The dependence of load-bearing capacity on construction height and material consumption was obtained for the trussed beam with <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> with the 46 m span. It was shown, that load-bearing capacity of trussed beam changes within the limits from 11. 4 to 26. 1 kN/m when the height of the trussed beam changes from 3 to 7 m, correspondingly. The materials consumption changes within the limits from 1705 to 2516 kg at the same time...|$|R

There are also basalt blocks, handrails and iron balustrades with oval decorative elements between the <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> and horizontal bands.|$|R
25|$|The Short Kent {{flying boat}} was {{essentially}} an enlarged, four-engined {{version of the}} Calcutta, with the same passenger carrying capacity but with an increased payload for mail and fuel. It was powered by four Bristol Jupiter XFBM radial engines mounted on <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> between {{the upper and lower}} planes.|$|R
2500|$|The core of {{the flat}} frame {{fuselage}} was formed with a horizontal beam about [...] long, to which two other [...] converging struts were attached, making overall a vertical A-frame. The downward sloping extremities of these beams carried a slightly deeper horizontal box structure below the cross beam, with the open pilot's seat and controls upon it. On some later aircraft there was an extra vertical member for the lower cross beam to the wing root to provide the pilot with a backrest. [...] Others enclosed him or her in a simple, light, short nacelle between the nose and the backrest strut. The rear part of the fuselage frame was based on two longer beams reaching to the tail. [...] The upper one was horizontal and attached to both converging A-frame beams, near but not at its apex. The lower one sloped upwards and {{was attached to the}} rear sloping part of the A-frame just below the cross-member. [...] These two rear fuselage beams were cross braced with three more struts, one vertical about halfway to the tail, forming two bays which were crossed diagonally by the other two struts. [...] There was another, short <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> in the rear bay between the upper and diagonal members. [...] For landings a skid ran between three projecting ends of the forward and lower A-frame.|$|E
5000|$|It had a {{tailskid}} undercarriage with independently mounted wheels 1.665 m apart. Each wheel {{was mounted}} {{on its own}} axle, about 700 mm long and hinged at its inner end to a <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> from the inboard fuselage underside and another, outward leaning one above the axle to the centre-section near its edge. A faired vertical leg with a steel tube core from near the edge supported the outer axle end on a rubber shock absorber. Four cables supplied fore-and-aft rigidity.|$|E
50|$|The {{empennage}} {{was supported}} by an open frame fuselage with longitudinal upper and lower pairs of longerons or booms, each side braced with four <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> pairs. At the rear, fixed and almost square horizontal tailplanes stretched between the upper and the lower pairs of booms. A pair of trapezoidal rudders were hinged on the last two verticals, assisted by another central one further forward. The elevator was all moving and mounted ahead of the wings {{on a pair of}} vertically converging booms with vertical cross braces.|$|E
25|$|The {{outrigger}} style empennage {{consisted of}} a single large vertical stabilizer and tailplane connected to the center main wing with two horizontal tubular spars. Two <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> were attached to the aft end of each tube spar and met at the extreme rear of the fuselage forming a very robust triangle structure.|$|R

5000|$|Chanute Field {{was named}} in honor of Octave Chanute (1832-1910), a pioneer {{aeronautical}} engineer and experimenter, and friend and adviser to the Wright Brothers. Chanute's biplane glider (1896) with [...] "two arched wings held rigidly together by <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> and diagonal wire bracing" [...] (the principle of the Pratt truss used in the railroad bridges which Chanute constructed) served as a prototype design for airplanes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} uses {{a standard}} hang glider wing, made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its double surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The wing {{is supported by}} a single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. The engine is a two-stroke, single cylinder Solo 210 of , depending on the model. The engine is mounted behind the pilot, while the fuel tank is mounted above. The landing gear consists of two wheels mounted below the control bar and a single tail wheel mounted on a <b>vertical</b> <b>strut.</b> A folding propeller is a standard feature.|$|E
50|$|The Poppenhausen had a simple, {{constant}}-chord wing {{much like}} that of the Hols der Teufel though of 16% greater span, built around two spars and fabric covered except at the leading edge which was plywood skinned. Its broad, constant chord ailerons were longer than those of the Hols der Teufel, ending at the blunt, rounded tips. The wing was supported over the fuselage by two vertical cabane struts, one {{on each side of the}} forward cockpit and a single, <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> centrally behind the rear cockpit. Two faired, parallel lift struts on each side ran from the lower forward fuselage to the wing at about 40% of the span.|$|E
50|$|The LeO H-10 (H for hydravion or waterplane) was a two-seat {{floatplane}} {{designed for}} reconnaissance work from Naval vessels. It was an unstaggered biplane with unswept wings of constant chord {{that could be}} folded for ease of onboard stowage. The interplane strut arrangement was unusual: outboard, there were conventional upright pairs but just inboard of these another pair ran diagonally in Warren girder style, replacing the conventional flying wires. The lower wing folded at a rear hinge on a short stub wing; outboard of the break was a single <b>vertical</b> <b>strut.</b> Central cabane struts provided an upper hinge so the wings, with their trailing edges folded downwards, leaned inwards over the fuselage when stowed.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} unorthodox configuration, the {{aircraft}} was of standard wood and fabric construction for the period. The wings {{had a single}} bay, but to prevent the long flying and landing wires from vibrating in flight, light <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> were added mid-bay to brace the wires, giving the aircraft {{the appearance of a}} two-bay biplane.The SPAD S.A.2 was an improved version of the S.A.1 which first flew on 21 May 1915.|$|R
50|$|One {{variant of}} this {{patented}} hull concept has three <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> that pierce the water surface, {{much like a}} multi-hull SWATH design. The two transversely separated aft struts provide the stability {{that is needed to}} resist the torque reacted by the single turbine/generator unit. The configuration of the struts also ensure that the device weathervanes about its midwater mooring buoy such that it always points into the direction of the current.|$|R
50|$|The double {{railroad}} {{is carried}} by four longitudinal steel trough girders, with {{the sides of}} the troughs acting as guards against derailment. These are supported by massive cross-girders riveted to the underneath of the <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> and lower booms of the main trusses, at 5.2 metre intervals. The decking consists of ironbark longitudinals bedded on bitumen and sand, and bolted to steel tee bars which connect the trough girders transversely.|$|R
5000|$|The S8 {{includes}} subtle detailing {{to distinguish}} it from its related A8.

The rear boot-lid incorporates a subtle rear spoiler, and the rear is finished with four chromed oval exhaust tailpipes. Adaptive Xenon-plus high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps include static turning lights, along with [...] "swiveling" [...] dynamic cornering lights. Daytime running lamps are five light-emitting diodes (LEDs) incorporated into a cloverleaf designed reflector, incorporated into the main headlamp housing.|$|E

50|$|Truss battens, {{sometimes}} referred to as double battens, use a pipe-over-pipe arrangement (often 12 in center-to-center), with <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> welded between the upper and lower pipes to provide rigidity. Truss battens generally permit greater loads than single-pipe battens and may not require as many lift lines due to improved ability to span between lift lines. Truss battens are typically designed to support 25 to 50 lb of live load per foot.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{fuselage}} was rectangular in section, with {{a wooden}} frame which was wire cross-braced internally and ply-covered forward, with fabric covering aft. The wings were mounted over the fuselage on four <b>vertical</b> cabane <b>struts</b> and were braced {{with a pair of}} sloping parallel struts on each side between the wing spars and the engine-bearing frames. The latter were each attached to the fuselage with three more sets of struts, two to the lower fuselage and one to its upper longeron, as well as pairs of <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> to the wing undersides. The CAP 1 had two [...] water-cooled Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V12 engines housed in long cowlings with front-mounted radiators; the fuel tanks were in the wings but oil reservoirs were placed in the engine housings.|$|R
5000|$|The R.16 was {{powered by}} three [...] Lorraine 9N Algol nine {{cylinder}} radial engines enclosed by long chord NACA-type cowlings. One {{was in the}} nose of the fuselage and the other were mounted under the wing centre section from the forward wing struts, aided by bracing struts rising inwards to the wing root and short <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> to the forward spar. Long nacelles behind the outer engines tapered to the rear wing strut.|$|R

50|$|Designed during World War II by K. Abe, a Japanese schoolteacher, the Mizet II flew for {{the first}} time on 9 December 1948. It has {{constant}} chord, square tipped wings mounted onto a single, central girder which runs from just ahead of the leading edge back to the empennage. The pilot sits on an unenclosed seat below the leading edge, suspended from the central girder by a <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> and within an open, continuous frame defined by a second vertical girder from near the trailing edge, a horizontal keel girder which carries the lower seat mountings, rudder pedals and the simple tricycle undercarriage and completed by a sloping member ahead of the pilot on which simple instruments are mounted. A 25 hp (18.6 kW) motor car engine is mounted immediately behind the pilot in pusher configuration on an extension of the seat struttage.|$|E
5000|$|The CAMS 52 was {{powered by}} two uncowled [...] nine-cylinder radial Gnome-Rhône 9Akx Jupiter engines, their steel tube frames {{mounted on the}} wing {{underside}} from the forward spar and fixed to the rear spar with a cone of tubes. Two 600 L fuel tanks were contained in the wing centre-section with another of the same capacity under the forward pilot's seat. Below each engine three steel struts, two in an inverted V and one vertical, joined the float centreline. Another <b>vertical</b> <b>strut</b> joined the float to the rear spar and two more ran obliquely from the lower fuselage to the engine frames. The floats were long, with hard chine and a single step. They were plywood skinned and were subdivided internally into watertight compartments. [...] Though the CAMS 52 {{was designed as a}} floatplane, it could be adapted to use wheeled landing gear.|$|E
50|$|The Aquarius {{barrier system}} used at Middleton Beach is {{composed}} of heavy duty marine ropes with a nylon plastic <b>strut</b> design. The <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> are made from solid nylon plastic that is sufficiently rigid that marine life can't become caught in it; small creatures pass through it, larger ones are blocked without being trapped. The horizontal ropes give the structure strength in the water. The barrier has a 7300 kg horizontal breaking strength and has an expected lifespan of around 10 years.|$|R
50|$|The {{very well}} {{preserved}} covering {{of the seat}} is made of finely woven material in a herringbone pattern. As is common for this period, the high back is inclined to the rear. The back is supported from behind by three <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> running in parallel. The two outer struts were supplemented with gilt wood edging. Armrests and seat frame were strengthened by gilt wood edging too and continued from the armrests up {{to the back of}} the chair. Gilt bronze nails supplement the wooden tenon joints.|$|R
50|$|It had a {{one-piece}} wing of rectangular plan out to semi-elliptical {{tips and}} built around two spruce spars and plywood ribs. There was no dihedral. The leading edge was ply covered, with fabric elsewhere. The centre-section was joined {{to the upper}} fuselage frame by internal, <b>vertical</b> <b>struts</b> and the wing braced on each side with a parallel pair of streamlined steel tubes between the wing spars and the lower fuselage frame. Its short, broad ailerons were metal framed, fabric covered apart from duralumin leading edges and externally mass-balanced.|$|R
