40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{accounting}} {{standards for the}} <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> have evolved to better reflect the economic reality facing publicly accountable companies. An important change is the measurement of an increasing array of financial assets and liabilities at “fair value, ” i. e., at the price that knowledgeable and willing parties would pay in an arm’slength transaction at {{the date of the}} financial statement. In principle, this allows for financial statements that are more relevant and more easily comparable across entities. However, since markets are prone to bouts of excessive optimism and pessimism, the use of fair value accounting can affect the economy and the financial system in unintended ways—for example, by reinforcing the peaks and troughs of the economic cycle.

The proposed model for financial markets is rich enough to provide analytical tools that are mostly obtained in models that arise as the solution of SDEs with deterministic coefficients. In the presented model the augmentation by a shadow stock of the price evolution has a Markovian character. As in a previous paper, the results obtained on valuation of European contingent claims and American contingent claims do not require the full range of the volatility matrix. Under some additional continuity conditions, the conceptual framework provided by the model makes it possible to regard the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> of the European type as a particular case of valuation of instruments of American type.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis, it was realized that the mathematical models used for the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> and the quantification of risk inherent in portfolios consisting of these financial instruments exhibit a substantial model risk. Consequently, regulators and other stakeholders have started to require that the internal models used by financial institutions are robust. We present an approach to consistently incorporate the robustness requirements into the quantitative risk management process of a financial institution, with a special focus on insurance. We advocate the Wasserstein metric as the canonical metric for approximations in robust risk management and present supporting arguments. Representing risk measures as statistical functionals, we relate risk measures with the concept of robustness and hence continuity with respect to the Wasserstein metric. This allows us to use results from robust statistics concerning continuity and differentiability of functionals. Finally, we illustrate our approach via practical applications...|$|E

40|$|Conclusion] It {{is being}} {{increasingly}} {{held in the}} literature that, in a globalizing world, flexible exchange rates are no longer enough to insulate an economy against external shocks. Our empirical results corroborate the observation that, {{in the past few}} years, global factors have had a crucial impact on domestic financial market prices and that it is becoming increasingly difficult for EMEs to find shelter. Global liquidity, in particular, has been the dominant element of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> markets in the emerging economies. What this means with respect to possible policy recommendations to EMEs on how they can best protect themselves from the adverse impact of volatile international capital flows is that neither flexible nor fixed exchange rates are capable <b>of</b> sheltering domestic <b>financial</b> markets from foreign shocks and <b>of</b> stabilizing the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> What appear more promising are efforts to exploit the advantages <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> integration {{while at the same time}} taking precautions to ensure that external shocks can be absorbed by a sound financial sector with high standards of safety. In this connection, too, a stable macroeconomic environment can also help prevent temporary disruptions from becoming a full-blown hazard to macroeconomic stability...|$|R

40|$|The general {{problem of}} asset pricing when the {{discount}} rate differs from {{the rate at which}} an asset's cash flows accrue is considered. A pricing kernel framework is used to model an economy that is segmented into distinct markets, each identified by a yield curve having its own market, credit and liquidity risk characteristics. The proposed framework precludes arbitrage within each market, while the definition of a curve-conversion factor process links all markets in a consistent arbitrage-free manner. A pricing formula is then derived, referred to as the across-curve pricing formula, which enables consistent <b>valuation</b> and hedging <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> across curves (and markets). As a natural application, a consistent multi-curve framework is formulated for emerging and developed inter-bank swap markets, which highlights an important dual feature of the curve-conversion factor process. Given this multi-curve framework, existing multi-curve approaches based on HJM and rational pricing kernel models are recovered, reviewed and generalised, and single-curve models extended. In another application, inflation-linked, currency-based, and fixed-income hybrid securities are shown to be consistently valued using the across-curve valuation method. Comment: 50 page...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 2007 / 2008 {{financial}} crisis exposed the fragility {{in the global}} banking sector - accordingly, inter-bank defined interest rates, viz. LIBOR, EURIBOR, JIBAR, etc., that were once deemed to be default-free, or at least close proxies thereof, are now deemed to be credit risky. In response to this, global financial markets have adopted a credit and liquidity homogenous multi-curve interest rate framework. The risk-neutral <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> has also been fundamentally altered, following the acceptance of a new proxy for a default-free discounting curve - this being the Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) curve. Major financial markets, like the U. S. and the Euro zone, have swiftly developed liquid OIS markets, and have therefore adopted OIS discounting. The lack of consensus on, and the inaccessibility of, a tradable overnight rate in South Africa has hindered {{the development of an}} OIS market. Nonetheless, there is still a need for a South African default-free discounting curve, as the prevalent South African defined inter-bank JIBAR rates also carry an element of credit risk. In this paper we provide a potential solution, using cointegration to estimate an OIS curve for the South African market from a JIBAR-linked swap curve...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis in 2007 highlighted the credit and liquidity risk present in interbank (LIBOR) rates, {{and resulted in}} changes to the pricing and <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> The shift to Overnight Indexed Swap (OIS) discounting and multi-curve framework led {{to changes in the}} construction of interest rate zero curves, with the OIS curve being central to this methodology. Developed markets, such as the European (EUR), were able to adopt this framework due to the existence of a liquid OIS market. In the case of the South African (ZAR) market, the lack of such tradeable instruments poses the issue of how to construct or infer the OIS curve. Jakarasi et al. (2015) proposed a method to infer the OIS curve through the statistical relationship between SAFEX ROD and 3 M JIBAR. The extension of the statistical relationship used by Jakarasi et al. (2015) to more statistically rigorous models, capable of capturing more information relating to the relationship between the rates, arises from the expected cointegrating relationship exhibited between rates.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introduction and five articles in the field <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> mathematics. The main topics of the papers comprise credit risk modelling, optimal stopping theory, and Dynkin games. An underlying theme {{in all of the}} articles is <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> various <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> Namely, Paper I deals with <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> a game version of a perpetual American option where the parties disagree about the distributional properties of the underlying process, Papers II and III investigate pricing of default-sensitive contingent claims, Paper IV treats CVA (credit value adjustment) modelling for a portfolio consisting of American options, and Paper V studies a problem motivated by model calibration in pricing of corporate bonds. In each of the articles, we deal with an underlying stochastic process that is continuous in time and defined on some probability space. Namely, Papers I-IV treat stochastic processes with continuous paths, whereas Paper V assumes that the underlying process is a jump-diffusion with finite jump intensity. The information level in Paper I is the filtration generated by the stock value. In articles III and IV, we consider investors whose information flow is designed as a progressive enlargement with default time of the filtration generated by the stock price, whereas in Paper II the information flow is an initial enlargement. Paper V assumes that the default is a hitting time of the firm's value and thus the underlying filtration is the one generated by the process modelling this value. Moreover, in all of the papers the risk-free bonds are assumed for simplicity to have deterministic prices so that {{the focus is on the}} uncertainty coming from the stock price and default risk...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve well-functioning capital markets, firms have to provide investors and other {{stakeholders}} with relevant and reliable information. Especially, for financial firms {{a large amount of}} assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The complexity and lack of liquid markets <b>of</b> certain <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> has made the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> such <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> complicated. Hence, fair value accounting for <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> leads to some subjective estimation of input data used in the valuation process. This subjectivity can be misused by managers for their own interest (i. e. opportunistic behaviour). However, opportunistic behaviour can be reduced with efficient and sophisticated internal and external control mechanisms. This dissertation investigates which control mechanisms that are suitable in monitoring managers related to fair value accounting <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> in <b>financial</b> firms. In the first essay, the effect of corporate governance on the value relevance of fair values is analysed. The assumption is that stronger boards with an appropriate structure are more effective in monitoring managers. The results indicate that board independence and gender diversity {{have a positive effect on}} the information quality of fair value estimates. In addition, the results indicate that board size is negatively associated with the value relevance of fair value estimates. Thereby, firms with smaller, more independent, and more diverse boards disclose fair value estimates of the highest quality. The second essay examines whether the value relevance of fair values varies across investor protection environments. The premise is that the better the investor feels protected from the firm, the more likely the investor will trust in the manager’s ability to estimate reliable and relevant fair values. This essay finds evidence that the value relevance of fair values is positively associated with the investor protection environment of the firm’s home country. In countries with undeveloped investor protection traditions, investors do not trust managers when it comes to estimating the fair value <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> The third essay examines whether audit quality has an impact on the value relevance of fair values. It can be assumed that managerial opportunism is mitigated by independent high quality auditing. The results suggest that client importance affects the information quality of fair value estimates negatively and that non-audit services have a positive effect on the value relevance of fair values. Hence, the results imply that higher level of information quality <b>of</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instruments</b> can be achieved with independent audit of high quality...|$|R
40|$|Background and problem: In August 2010, HQ Bank’s license was revoked by the SFSA (sw. Finansinspektionen). One of {{the reasons}} for the SFSA to revoke the license was HQ Bank’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>financial</b> <b>instruments.</b> Mr. Johan Dyrefors was the auditor of the bank at that time. Both he and the audit firm KPMG was {{reported}} to the SBPA (sw. Revisorsnämnden) since SFSA did not share Mr. Dyrefors opinion that the trading portfolio had been measured in a correct way. Therefore, we investigate how the SFSA and Mr. Dyrefors argue for their notion of the concept of an active market and what supports their opinions in current regulation and previous research, which also is the research question of this thesis. Limitations: This thesis does not investigate the level of activity of the options, which existed in HQ Bank’s trading portfolio, nor their markets activity properties. No deeper investigation <b>of</b> the underlying <b>financial</b> aspects, such as which measure of volatility is the most appropriate or examination of the fitness <b>of</b> <b>valuation</b> models, will be carried out since these topics concern financial economics rather than accounting. Neither the management of the bank nor how it affected the liquidation will be examined. Method: An explanatory case study has been performed in combination with a qualitative text analysis to compare the parties' opinions and legal dogmatics to compare the opinions with the standards and current law. Finally, market data have been extracted from a <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> used in both the SFSA’s and Mr. Dyrefors’ line of argumentation. Results and conclusions: Firstly, the parties agree that activity existed on the market, but their interpretation of whether it was large enough to be useful for the valuation diverge. Mr. Dyrefors’ arguments, consistent with some academics, indicate that fair value is problematic when markets are illiquid and spreads are large. Secondly, our findings show that HQ Bank’s definition of an active market lead to a possibility to manipulate the market, though this might not have been the purpose. Finally, lacks of general proofs from both parties’ basis of conclusions reduce creditability in the discussion. As long as assumptions are fully motivated and consistently handled, both opinions may fall within the boundaries of the IAS 39. The fall of HQ Bank clearly indicates that the scope of interpretations in IAS 39 might be too broad. Suggestions for further research: A quantitative study of the level of activity of the options in HQ Bank’s trading portfolio or the properties of their market activity would be interesting, as well as if observable market data was used enough as input in the models and how this affected the accounting. Also, whoever aims to evaluate new valuation techniques, which improve characteristics of reliability, must be encouraged, since both science and regulation seems to be missing solutions to this fundamental accounting issue...|$|R

In the context of this economic turmoil at international level, the main stakeholders and the accountants professionals find themselves in the position of revising their procedures, objectives, strategies, but also their behaviour, their attitude in general, in order to limit or even eliminate the negative consequences of the financial crisis. From our perspective, the communication among company, stakeholders, and auditors represents the fundament of a successful business strategy. However, communication difficulties could be encountered, especially under conditions of uncertainty and crisis.
