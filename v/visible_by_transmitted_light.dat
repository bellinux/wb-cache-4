40|$|On {{the basis}} of their morphological, cultural, and {{biochemical}} charaeteristics, Slanetz and Rettger (1) identified four varieties of fusobacteria and designated them as types I, II, III, and IV. Since attempts to isolate type specific carbohydrates have thus far been unsuccessful in our hands as well as in those of Spaulding and Rettger (2), we shall report herewith the demonstration of type specific proteins in extracts of three of these types. Strains of Fusobacteria Studied Four strains were investigated (Table I). Strains A and B were isolated from the lungs of human cases of pulmonary abscess, while strains S and R came from an abscess in the gums of a patient with pyorrhea. Fusobacterium A is a long, slender, pointed, non-motile, Gram-negative rod which, in stained smears, resembles bundles of twigs or crisscross figures and shows no evidence of granules. The individual bacilli are fairly uniform in size, being 0. 5 # thick and 3 to 7. 5 g long, with an occasional variant 20 to 30 ~ long. The strain is strictly anaerobic and was isolated on plates of serum-extract-agar in Varney's phosphorus jar (5). The colonies are ground glass in appearance, fairly soft, friable, and granular, with serrated edges. When examined <b>by</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>light,</b> they have a coarse, rosette pattern with slightly raised, yellowish centers. Several biochemical characteristics are given in Table I. Fusobacterium B is also a strictly anaerobic, non-motile rod, without granules, but with a tendency to form interlacing filaments and U forms. Its measurements are similar to A. When viewed by reflected light, the colonies have a somewhat coarser pattern than type A. <b>By</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>light</b> they appear as flat, round colonies with undulating or serrated edges and slightly raised, yellowish centers from which emanate delicate, hnear markings.
