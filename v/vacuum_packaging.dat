25|$|To improve {{tenderness}} of beef, it {{is often}} aged (i.e., stored refrigerated) to allow endogenous proteolytic enzymes to weaken structural and myofibrillar proteins. Wet aging is accomplished using <b>vacuum</b> <b>packaging</b> to reduce spoilage and yield loss. Dry aging involves hanging primals (usually ribs or loins) in humidity-controlled coolers. Outer surfaces dry out and can support growth of molds (and spoilage bacteria, if too humid), resulting in trim and evaporative losses.|$|E
25|$|Evaporation {{concentrates}} {{the remaining}} proteins and increases flavor intensity; the molds can contribute a nut-like flavor. After {{two to three}} days there are significant effects. The majority of the tenderizing effect occurs in the first 10 days. Boxed beef, stored and distributed in <b>vacuum</b> <b>packaging,</b> is, in effect, wet aged during distribution. Premium steakhouses dry age for 21 to 28 days or wet age up to 45 days for maximum effect on flavor and tenderness.|$|E

40|$|The study compares {{cost and}} {{benefits}} {{of carbon dioxide and}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>packaged</b> boxed beef distribution to retail grocery outlets In the retail grocery segment of the beef distribution channel, the major portion still moves fresh in the form of hanging quarters or primals. However, a recently important method of shipment to the retail grocery segment is beef in boxed, palletized form. Although nc accurate data are available to document the proportion of beef which is distri-buted boxed versus hanging, industry corr-sensus is that the boxed, palletized method will continue to increase in im-portance (4).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the improvements of an advanced digital VGA-IRFPA developed by Fraunhofer-IMS. The uncooled IRFPA {{is designed for}} thermal imaging applications in the LWIR (8 [...] 14 µm) range with a full-frame frequency of 30 Hz and a high sensitivity with NETD < 100 mK @ f/ 1. The microbolometer with a pixel-pitch of 25 µm consists of amorphous silicon as the sensing layer. The structure of the microbolometer has been optimized for a better performance compared to the 1 st generation IRFPA 1. The thermal isolation has been doubled by increasing the length and by decreasing {{the width of the}} legs. To increase the fill-factor the contact areas have been reduced. The microbolometers are read out by a novel readout architecture which utilizes massively parallel on-chip Sigma-Delta-ADCs. This results in a direct digital conversion of the resistance change of the microbolometer induced by incident infrared radiation. Two different solutions for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>package</b> have been developed. To reduce production costs a chip-scale-package is used. This <b>vacuum</b> <b>package</b> consists of an IR-transparent window with antireflection coating and a soldering frame which is fixed by a wafer-to-chip process directly on top of the read substrate. An alternative solution based on the use of a standard ceramic package is utilized as a <b>vacuum</b> <b>package.</b> This packaging solution is used for high performance applications.

Treatment of casings with phosphoric acid 0. 1 % alone did not inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria and reduced the aerobic plate count by 1 log. The activity of nisin against lactic acid bacteria was enhanced by the addition of phosphoric acid, demonstrating a synergistic effect.
