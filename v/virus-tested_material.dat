40|$|Grapevine leafroll disease (GLRD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} virus diseases of grapevines around the country and the world. The disease reduces yields, delays fruit ripening, reduces soluble solids and can cause irregular or undesirable flavors. One response to minimize economic losses from GLRD, is the use of virus-tested grapevines. This study constructs a cost benefit analysis of using this material in California and New York. Benefits arise from the reduction in costs and increase in yield due to the reduction of disease prevalence from planting screened material and optimally managing the disease. <b>Virus-tested</b> <b>material</b> is available to nurseries and growers from grape centers including Foundation Plant Services in Davis, California and New York State Agriculture Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. Over the period 2006 - 2015 in California, estimated cumulative benefits by 2015 are $ 1. 51 billion (2002 dollars) and cumulative costs to operate Foundation Plant Services in Davis, CA, amount to $ 12. 9 million, a benefit to cost ratio of 117. Projecting over the next ten years, by 2025 cumulative net benefits (benefits-costs) will reach an estimated $ 3. 26 billion. Across the country in New York, benefits do not accrue until 2020 due to later adoption of <b>virus-tested</b> <b>material.</b> We estimate cumulative benefits reach $ 19. 5 million and funding from the National Clean Plant Network (NCPN) to operate the grape center in Geneva, NY totals $ 2. 7 million by 2025. Additionally, this thesis conducts a welfare analysis to determine the distribution of net benefits within California between grape producers and wine producers who purchase grapes to crush. The results suggest that grape growers receive most benefits because supply is inelastic relative to demand. These findings are valuable to understand the return of public and private investment in grape centers that produce virus-tested stocks for the industry, as well as help the industry understand the economic benefits of using the material, incentivizing stronger adoption...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{differences}} in virus incidence were consistently demonstrated between cultivars. 'Victoria' gardens planted with elite (<b>virus-tested)</b> <b>material</b> became almost totally re-infected with PNRSV within eight years. Mechanical inoculation of PNRSV into {{a range of}} hop cultivars suggested ' Victoria' was more susceptible than traditional ones. In contrast, the spread rate of HpL V, HpMV, and PNRSV was consistently slower in 'Opal' gardens, and this {{was found to be}} the most field resistant cultivar to infection by all three viruses. PNRSV was detected by double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) in chronically infected ' Victoria' plants throughout the growing season. Testing of a range of tissues from 'Victoria' plants suggested a symmetrical distribution ofPNRSV within the plant. Similar testing of 'Nugget', 'Pride of Ringwood', and 'Opal' plants suggested an asymmetrical distribution of PNRSV within the plant. The longer period of elevated virus levels in all tissues in 'Victoria' may increase the probability of virus transmission and be responsible for the accelerated transmission of PNRSV in this cultivar. The asymmetric virus distribution in 'Nugget', 'Pride of Ringwood', and 'Opal' suggested that accurate virus testing relies upon sampling from several hines from each string. Spatial analysis of PNRSV epidemics by ordinary run and radial correlation analyses in 'Victoria' gardens in Myrtleford, Victoria and Bushy Park, Tasmania associated PNRSV transmission with mechanical mowing of basal growth. Transmission was reduced in field trials by preventing basal growth contact between infected and virus-free plants 5 along rows early in the season. This demonstrated that plant contact early in the season increases the probability of transmitting PNRSV to virus-free plants by decreasing the distance infective virions have to travel to infect new plants. Glasshouse trials also confirmed PNRSV to be transmitted by contact and simulated slashing between infected and virus-free plants. Root grafting was also successful at transmitting PNRSV between infected and virus-free plants. The presence of root grafts in Tasmanian hop gardens was suggested by injection of the translocatable herbicide marker, glyphosate. However, quantifi cation {{of the extent to which}} root grafts contribute to transmission of all three viruses requires further work. Spatial analysis of carl avirus epidemics showed different distributions between 'Victoria' gardens in Myrtleford and Bushy Park. Random distributions of both HpL V and HpMV at Myrtleford suggested transmission by alatae aphid vectors. Autocorrelated along row distributions of both viruses at Bushy Park suggested transmission by either mechanical transmission through basal growth mowing, and/or aphid vectors (alatae or apterous) directed along rows from basal growth bridges formed through basal growth mowing between rows. A significant positive association between HpLV and HpMV was consistently demonstrated in several cultivars. This may suggest transmission by common aphid vector species, transencapsidation, or the possibility that infection by one virus makes the plant more susceptible to infection by the other. 6 In most hop cultivars grown in Australia the slow rate of virus transmission and significant effect of some viruses on yield of cones and levels of brewing organic acids suggested the continued use of a virus certification scheme for planting stock is warranted. However, in 'Victoria', the usefulness of certification schemes is uncertain because of the rapid spread ofviruses in this cultivar and its tolerance to infection...|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{quarantine}} laws in some states, like Michigan, that prohibit importing blueberry plant material {{that have not}} been tested for the virus. Growers need to buy only <b>virus-tested</b> planting <b>material.</b> Plants should be monitored for symptoms during bloom and suspicious plants should be marked. If there is suspicion, take leaf samples from multiple branches and send them to a diagnostic lab for testing. There is no known cure for blueberry shock virus, so extra precaution should be taken when buying and handling suckers and plant material.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Viral {{diseases}} affecting sweetpotato are {{the most}} devastating and cause up to 98 % yield loss. In this paper, we report, meristem culture, graft transmission and virus indexing for management of viral pathogens in seven elite sweetpotato cultivars. Plantlets were developed in vitro from the apical meristematic dome with one to two leaf primordia. Mericlones were grafted on virus-sensitive indicator plant Ipomoea setosa and no viral disease symptoms were seen on I. setosa leaves in most cases. This indicates that no viruses translocated from meristem-derived scions to the virus-sensitive root stock. On the other hand, most of the non-tested traditional planting material induced distinct disease symptoms upon grafting, which revealed the presence {{of one or more}} viruses in it. About 85 % of mericlones recovered from 0. 3 â€“ 0. 5 mm size meristem were tested as virus free, whereas it is dif-ficult to culture meristems smaller than 0. 3 mm due to dissection damage and too small a size. Virus-tested mer-iclones were further micropropagated and transferred to the field. Only few plants were found to be diseased in the R 1 field trial. Root yield in the R 2 generation was increased significantly when compared with non-tested control plants. During field exposure, only a low percentage of healthy plants were found infected with viruses when managed in a net house. This implies that viral vectors were present during the growing season and reinfection could be effectively reduced by net house management. We concluded that this low-cost technique of producing <b>virus-tested</b> planting <b>material</b> would significantly boost the yield through efficient removal of yield-reducing pathogens...|$|R
