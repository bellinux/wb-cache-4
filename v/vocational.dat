5|$|The {{emphasis}} on liberal {{arts in the}} revised degree titles (for both the A.L.B. and A.L.M. degrees) {{was not intended to}} signify a difference in the degree itself versus the University's other offerings, but instead to serve as a response to concerns expressed by some that programs catering to non-traditional students were overly <b>vocational</b> in nature. The purpose of the name was to reaffirm adherence to the University's historic focus on the liberal arts, and distinguish it from other, more <b>vocational,</b> institutions.|$|E

25|$|Initially, <b>vocational</b> {{education}} in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was {{looked down upon}} as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as <b>vocational</b> education was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and <b>vocational</b> educational was regarded low quality and typically {{out of step with}} the changing needs of employers. The perception of technical and <b>vocational</b> {{education in}} Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting to realize that there are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values <b>vocational</b> and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country’s economic development. <b>Vocational</b> education has been an important part of Singapore’s unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of <b>vocational</b> education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils. <b>Vocational</b> schools such as the Institute of Technical Education were intended to revolutionize <b>vocational</b> education and portray the institution as a world-class example of the importance of <b>vocational</b> skills being translated to a 21st-century knowledge-based economy. Since 1995, enrollment in <b>vocational</b> schools has doubled, now making up 65% of the cohort who go on to post-secondary education (ages 16–18), with 25% accepted into the ITE and another 40% attending polytechnic universities.|$|E

These schools tend to offer technical and <b>vocational</b> instruction in one of five main fields: agriculture, fisheries, trade-technical, home industry, and ‘non-traditional’ courses while offering a host of specializations. During the first two years, students study a general <b>vocational</b> area, from the five main fields mentioned. During the third and fourth years they specialize in a discipline or vocation within that area. Programs contain a mixture of theory and practice.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{educational}} reform tenets, polytechnic colleges were to {{give priority to}} admitting secondary <b>vocational</b> and technical school graduates and providing on-the-job training for qualified workers. Education reformers continued to press for the conversion of about 50 percent of upper secondary education into <b>vocational</b> education, which traditionally had been weak in the rural areas. Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into <b>vocational</b> middle schools, and <b>vocational</b> training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, {{education}} policy was reorganised aiming more choice and better quality in <b>vocational</b> technical education. Enhanced and improved technical education programs where implemented in 2007 {{in an effort}} to revitalize this sector which had been almost discontinued after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, when many <b>vocational</b> technical schools were administratively upgraded to higher education technical colleges and other were simply closed. This happened despite those <b>vocational</b> technical schools have been generally regarded as reputed institutions with a record of very high standards in <b>vocational</b> technical education across the decades they were supplying the technical labor needs of the country.|$|E
