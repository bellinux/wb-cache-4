40|$|In the Rojales area, at the southem {{border of}} the Low Segura Basin (province of Alicante), we have studied four {{formations}} already defined by Montenat (1973, 1977). All of them constitute a continue stratigraphic succession and represent a general regressive sequence, where open basin facies (Hurchillo Marls Fm.), shelf and coastal facies (Rojales Sandstone Fm.) and continental facies (<b>Variegated</b> <b>Sandstones</b> and Marls Fm. and Segura Conglomerates Fm.) gradually evolve from the bottom to the topo The biostratigraphic data of planktonic foraminifera allows the date {{the top of the}} Hurchillo Marls Fm. as {{the upper part of the}} lower Pliocene (NI 9 -N 2 &# 252; of the Blow zonation). The study of a new site of microvertebrates, named as Rojales, allows the dating the top of the <b>Variegated</b> <b>Sandstones</b> and Marls Fm. (in the transition with the Segura Conglomerates Fm.) as upper Ruscinian (start of MN 15 of the Mein biozonation). These chronological data show that the whole stratigraphic succession of the Rojales area has a age corresponding to the final part of the lower Pliocene. En el sector de Rojales (Alicante), situado en el borde meridional de la Cuenca del Bajo Segura, se han estudiado cuatro formaciones ya definidas por Montenat (1977). Todas ellas se suceden en continuidad estratigr&# 225;fica y representan una secuencia general regresiva en la que evolucionan gradualmente (desde la base hasta el techo) conjuntos de facies marinas de cuenca abierta y de transici&# 243;n a plataforma (Fm.

40|$|A coryphodontid pantodent fossil was {{discovered}} from the basal {{part of the}} Ooyake Formation on the middle Eocene Nougata Group at Takaroku, Munakata City, Fukuoka Prefecture. The fossil was collected from coarse-grained arkose pebbly sandstone 5 m above an unconformity between the Cretaceous granitic rocks and basal conglomerate of the Ooyake Formation. A 20 m-sequence above the basal conglomerate consists of cyclic sediments of cross-stratified pebbly sandstone, massive dirty <b>variegated</b> <b>sandstone</b> and variegated red-purple and green-gray siltstone and shale. The former sedimentary facies shows their deposition in fluvial erosional channel and point-bar, and the latter indicates their deposition on natural levee and floodplain of meandering river under subtropical climatic condition.

30|$|The Datta Formation is {{of early}} Jurassic age, {{and it is}} well {{developed}} in the Trans-Indus Ranges and the Salt Range (Dalnichik 1961; Dalnichik and Shah 1967). The formation consists of <b>variegated</b> <b>sandstone,</b> with shale, siltstone, and mudstone (Shah 1977). It extends as a tongue into Kala Chitta, Hazara {{and part of the}} Kohat area (Shah 1977). The Datta Formation has disconformable lower contact with the Kingriali Formation, and the upper contact with the Shinawri Formation is gradational. In the Kohat area, the formation is reported to be composed of quartzose, dolomitic, and oolitic limestone, suggesting a shallow marine shoreline with the development of a supratidal flat (Fatmi et al. 1990). The age is of Datta Formation is reported as early Jurassic (pre-Toarcian) (Shah 2009). The Jurassic system in Pakistan characterizes mainly limestones, shale, and sandstone. The lower part of the early Jurassic (Datta Formation) is composed of arenaceous and argillaceous sediments dominantly continental origin, grading upward in a sequence of marine calcareous/argillaceous rocks of Shinawri formation. The marine transgression in the Kohat–Potwar depositional basin is suggested to have occurred during late early Jurassic (Shah 2009). The siliciclastic sequence of Datta represents autocyclic sedimentation sequence caused due to environmental and depositional system fluctuations such as river avulsion, delta-lobe switching, and tidal channel migration.|$|E

Palynological {{stratigraphy}} of the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic collision-related conglomerates at Qiabulin, Xigaze, Xizang (Tibet) and its {{bearing on}} palaeoenvironmental development. Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, 38 (3 - 4), 86 - 95. The stratigraphy, age, depositional environment and correlation of the collision-related <b>variegated</b> <b>sandstone</b> and conglomerate beds exposed {{along the southern}} side of the Gangdise Mountains {{to the north of}} the Yarlung Zangbo suture in the Xigaze region, Xizang (Tibet) have been much debated. Generally referred to as the Dagzhuka Formation, these beds of great thickness have, until recently, not been reported to contain any convincing fossils. Two distinctly different palynological assemblages, indicating Late Cretaceous and Oligocene-Early Miocene ages respectively, have now been recovered from lithologically distinguishable units of the sedimentary succession at Qiabulin to the west of the town of Xigaze. This means that instead of one stratigraphic unit, as has been generally accepted hitherto, at least two are represented. As a result, the Dagzhuga Formation is considered here to refer only to the Cenozoic deposits and the Qiabulin Formation, previously regarded as a synonym, is resurrected to accommodate the Cretaceous beds. These two formations were juxtaposed by tectonic movements. Our finding indicates that the stratigraphic successions on the southern Laurasian continental margin of Xizang reflect changes from a deep forearc basin through shallow littoral environments to a mountainous landscape during the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic. This interpretation compares well with those documented from the Gamba and Tingri districts to the south of the Yarlung Zangbo suture. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Near {{one hundred}} fossil sites {{containing}} dinosaur and avian eggs and eggshells {{have been recorded}} from coastal and non-marine deposits of late Cretaceous to late Paleocene age in South-central Pyrenees. Five eggsite types have been distinguished, three of them with autochthonous and two with allochthonous assemblages. The egg-bearing sediments consist in marine sandstones from the Aren Formation, and coastal and non-marine red beds from the Tremp Formation. Inferred nesting paleoenvironments range from sand beaches and strand plain at the seashore (Aren Sandstone sites), to tidal mud-flats in lagoonal margins (La Posa Grey Marls, lower Member of the Tremp Formation), and perilagoonal, estuarine and alluvial flood plains (bioturbated siltstones, <b>variegated</b> claystones, <b>sandstones</b> and conglomerates of the Tremp red beds). About thirty ootaxa, mainly from tubospherulitic, prismatic and ratite morphotypes have been observed, which greately overpass the dinosaur and avian diversity deduced from bones. These sites indicate a nest-fidelity reproductive behaviour for Pyrenean dinosaurs and birds. A decrease in abundance and diversity is recorded from late Campanian to Maastrichtian times, while a recovery occurs in late Paleocene...|$|R
5000|$|Though much altered, {{this is one}} of Scotland's most {{beautiful}} ancient churches. According to Crail Parish Church's website (see external link below) in its first form the church building consisted of an unaisled rectangular nave and chancel of romanesque design. In the early 13th century a fine western tower with small spire was added, and a double arcade of round pillars of <b>variegated</b> red <b>sandstone</b> in the nave. It was in this form in 1243 that the church was dedicated to St Maelrubha by the Bishop of St Andrews. (In later times it was known as St Mary's probably after a later dedication in a later period that disliked vestiges of the Celtic Church.) The side walls were rebuilt in Regency times, and the large pointed windows, filled with panes of clear glass held by astragals rather than leads, allow light to flood into the interior. The unaisled chancel, now housing a huge organ, has been shortened. The church retains some 17th-century woodwork. The early Christian cross-slab mentioned at the start of this article is on display in the church: it is of unusual form (perhaps 10th century), formerly set in the floor. The church building is open on some afternoons in the summer.|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} archives record "hyperthermic" crises, {{along with}} their consequences on the biota and physical environment. Among these, the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) is often considered as the closest analogue to the current climate crisis due to its global character and the speeds at which the CO 2 rate and average temperatures increased. The shallow to deep marine environments from various paleolatitudes have been studied intensively (e. g. Aubry et al, 2007), but apart notable paleontological studies, the PETM impact on the terrestrial realm at a regional scale has probably not been studied and integrated enough (Zachos et al,. 2008). Moreover very few studies aimed at checking if the drastic rises of greenhouse gases and temperature had a real impact on the weathering profiles development during the PETM. Such a regional study is proposed in the "Sparnacian" terrestrial and lagoonal units of the Paris Basin, which offers rich and diversified interconnected paleoenvironments, and on its emerged interfluves and borders. The paleoweathering profiles here considered belong to the so-called "Landenian" quartzites, or "Sparnacian" silcretes, and are locally well correlated to the first terrestrial units of the Tienen and Mortemer Fm, between the Upper Thanetian and Lower Ypresian marine units. However some silcretes and ferruginous sandstones are sometimes dated no better than Early Paleogene. To improve the error bar from 25 Ma to 5 Ma would mark a significant progress. Paleomagnetism {{is one of the}} methods useful to improve the uncertainty being often the status of those geological objects. Goethite and hematite, main iron oxides formed in weathering profiles, acquire a chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) {{in the direction of the}} ambient geomagnetic field. Consequently paleomagnetism is often considered as the most suitable method for dating weathering profiles (e. g. Idnurm & Senior, 1978; Ricordel-Prognon et al, 2010). The fossil geomagnetic direction enables one to calculate the virtual magnetic pole (VMP) of the site where magnetic minerals were precipitated. Dating the minerals is then possible by comparing their recorded paleomagnetic poles (VGP) with the apparent polar wander path (APWP) of the continent in which the site is located. In situ weathering profile formed upon the Upper Thanetian glauconitic sands from the Grandglise section (Belgium) have been sampled in details and various analyses have been performed: granulometry, XRD and magnetic mineralogy, petrography, paleomagnetism. Haematite is the main magnetization carrier, directions are well clustered, with a low MAD (maximum angular deviation). However the dating obtained around the Paleocene-Eocene boundary is consistent with the stratigraphic position of the Grandglise paleosol and gives evidence of a fossil weathering, instead of a recent one related to a Neogene to Quaternary re-exposure often invoked for such red and <b>variegated</b> <b>sandstones.</b> Our results and others recently obtained in the neighboring Avesnois help to decipher the correlation between the Grandglise paleosol and surroundings silcretes and to precise the terrestrial paleogeographic evolution on the emerged areas during this critical interval...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The Middle and West Forks of Little Sheep Creek in the {{southern}} Tendoy Range have incised valleys across Cenozoic structural features exposing strata that {{range in age from}} the Mississippian to the Neoene. Paleozoic strata are 1, 349 m thick and belong to the Mission Canyon Limestone, the Big Snowy, Amsden, Quadrant, and Priosphoria FormationS. The Scott Peak Formation of the White Knob Group of Idaho is allochtononous and forms the upper plate of the Medicine Lodge thrust. Paleozoic and Triassic strata of the thesis area represent sedimentation across a transition zone between a stable craton to the east and the Cordilleran miogeosyncline to the west. Regional unconformities are recognized locally {{at the top of the}} Mission Canyon Limestone and the Phosphoria and Thaynes Formations, but not at the top o the Big Snowy, Amsden, or Quadrant Formations, Mesozoic strata have a total thickness of 1, 404 m and belong to the Dinwoody, Woodside, and Thaynes Formations, the newly recognized Gypsum Spring Tongue of the Twin Creek Formation, the Sawtooth and Rierdon Formations of the Ellis Group, the Morrison and Kootenai Formations, the Colorado Shale, and the Beaverhead Formation. Cenozoic strata are represented by the newly named Round Timber limestone (informal) of the Medicine Lodge beds (Miocene) and the Edie School rhyolite (Pliocene). Detailed stratigraphic and petrographic analyses were made of the Triassic Dinwoody, Woodside, and Thaynes Formations, the Jurassic Gypsum Spring Tongue, and the Niocene Round Timber limestone in order to determine environments of deposition. The limestones, calcareous siltstones, and silty limestones of the Dinwoody and Thaynes Formations were deposited in a shallow marine shelf environment as a result of two transgressive pulses separated by an Early Traissic regression. The Triassic seas had transgressed eastward onto the craton from the miogeosyncline. The Dinwoody arid Thaynes fauna indicate normal salinities and open marine conditions; the widespread regional distribution of the limestone-siltstone facies indicates broad equable conditions for sedimentation. Deposition was primarily a tractive process genarated by storm-driven, tidal, and long-shore currents within a maximum depth of approximately 50 m. The Early Triassic regressive phase is represented by the deposition of the <b>variegated</b> siltstone, <b>sandstone,</b> limestone, and dolomite of the Woodside Formation in a tidal flat environment. The Gypsum Spring Tongue consists of interbedded <b>variegated</b> siltstone, <b>sandstone,</b> limestone, dolomite, and limestone conglomerate that were deposited in a tidal flat and restricted marginal marine environment extending east from southwestern Montana and eastern Idaho across Wyoming arid southern Montana. The Middle Jurassic sea transgressed South across the North American continent. The Miocene Round Timber limestone was deposited in a fresh-water lake in which calcite was being deposited as encrustations on the green algae Chara and as a precipitate directly from solution. The folding and faulting within the thesis area are the result of cratonic and miogeosynclinal responses to Cretaceous-Early Tertiary orogenesis. A southwestward-plunging anticline has been refolded into northeastward-yielding, overturned, doubly-plunging folds oriented northwest-southeast. High angle reverse faults of minor displacement have occurred along the southeastern limb of Garfield anticline and within the axis of the Seybold syncline. Post-Laramide relaxation of compressional forces has caused north- and northwest-oriented normal faults that transect earlier structures.

40|$|The Tunggur Formation is {{presently}} exposed {{along the edge}} of the Tunggur Tableland. Being mostly flat-lying and with a maximum thickness of less than 80 m (most sections are less than 40 m thick), exposures along the northern, western, and southern edges of the platform all produce vertebrate fossils. The American Museum Wolf Camp Quarry and Platybelodon Quar-ry produced most of the early collections. To the east, the Tableland gradually blends into the landscape, and its distribution becomes less well delineated. At the extreme eastern end, the Tunggur Formation is probably overlain by the late Miocene Baogeda Ula Formation. The Tunggur Formation has its stratotype along a small exposure at Mandelin Chabu in the north-west edge of the Tableland. The Tunggur Formation in the Tableland is divided into two informal sedimentary units, the upper and lower beds.
