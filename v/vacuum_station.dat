50|$|Especially {{difficult}} situations as ribbon, peripheral settlements on flat terrain with high specific conduit lengths of longer than 4 metres per inhabitant are predestined {{for the application}} of vacuum sewerage systems. In the case of sparse population density the influence of the costs for the collection chambers and <b>vacuum</b> <b>stations</b> are less important in comparison to the costs of long and deep sewers on gravity.|$|R
50|$|Usually only {{a single}} <b>vacuum</b> pump <b>station</b> is {{required}} rather than multiple stations found in gravity and low pressure networks. This frees up land, reduces energy costs and reduces operational costs.|$|R

50|$|A vacuum {{sewer system}} is a method of {{transporting}} sewage from its source to a sewage treatment plant. It uses the difference between atmospheric pressure and a partial vacuum maintained in the piping network and <b>vacuum</b> <b>station</b> collection vessel. This differential pressure allows a central <b>vacuum</b> <b>station</b> to collect the wastewater of several thousand individual homes, depending on terrain and the local situation. Vacuum sanitary sewers take advantage of available natural slope and are most economical in flat sandy soils with high ground water.|$|E

5000|$|The United Kingdom is {{well served}} by Vacuum Sewerage Systems, the region most {{extensively}} served are the low lying fenlands of the East of England. High water tables (in some cases less than 1metre below the surface) and poor ground conditions have meant that the local Water Company, Anglian Water, has embraced the use of Vacuum Sewerage, {{taking advantage of the}} system's requirement for small bore sewer pipes laid in shallow trenches, dramatically reducing the requirement for pumping stations as would be required by conventional gravity sewer systems. The largest Vacuum Sewerage scheme in this region serves the villages of Outwell and Upwell, 4 <b>vacuum</b> collection <b>stations</b> serve some 1500 homes in this agglomeration. On initial costings for a conventional gravity sewer to serve the area, previously served by domestic septic settlement tanks the site would have required the installation of 32 pumping <b>stations.</b> Using a <b>vacuum</b> sewer system, this number of pumping stations was reduced to 4 <b>vacuum</b> <b>stations.</b> Other companies in the UK such as Southern water operate vacuum sewer systems, too.|$|R
50|$|A {{simple and}} {{automated}} {{type of car}} wash that is typically coin-operated or token-operated self-service system. Newer self-service car washes offer the ability to pay with credit cards or loyalty cards. The vehicle is parked inside a large covered bay that {{is equipped with a}} trigger gun and wand (a high-pressure sprayer) and a scrub foam-brush. When customers insert coins or tokens into the controller, they can choose options such as soap, tire cleaner, wax or clear water rinse, all dispensed from the sprayer, or scrub the vehicle with the foam brush. The number of coins or tokens inserted determines the amount of time customers have to operate the equipment; in most instances, a minimum number of coins is necessary to start the equipment. These facilities are often equipped with separate <b>vacuum</b> <b>stations</b> that allow customers to clean the upholstery and rugs inside their cars. Some self-service car washes offer hand-held dryers, a somewhat new feature.|$|R

50|$|Once {{arrived in}} the vacuum {{collection}} tank at the <b>vacuum</b> <b>station,</b> the wastewater is pumped to the discharge point, which could be a gravity sewer or the treatment station directly. As the dwell time of the wastewater inside the system is very short and the wastewater is continuously mixed with air, the sewage is kept fresh and any fouling inside the system is avoided (less H2S).|$|E
50|$|In low-lying communities, {{wastewater}} may be {{conveyed by}} vacuum sewer. Pipelines {{range in size}} from pipes of six inches (150 mm) in diameter to concrete-lined tunnels of up to thirty feet (10 m) in diameter. A low pressure system uses a small grinder pump located at each point of connection, typically a house or business. Vacuum sewer systems use differential atmospheric pressure to move the liquid to a central <b>vacuum</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{technology}} {{is based on}} differential air pressure. Rotary vane vacuum pumps generate an operation pressure of -0.4 to -0.6 bar at the <b>vacuum</b> <b>station,</b> {{which is also the}} only element of the vacuum sewerage system that must be supplied with electricity. Interface valves, that are installed inside the collection chambers, work pneumatically. Sewage flows by means of gravity from each house into a collection sump that might collect sewage from 2-6 houses and is located in public area. After a certain fill level inside this sump is reached, the interface valve opens. The impulse to open the valve is usually transferred by a pneumatically (pneumatic pressure created by fill level) controlled controller unit. No electricity is needed to open or close the valve. The energy is provided by the vacuum itself. While the valve is open, the resulting differential pressure between atmosphere and vacuum becomes the driving force and transports the wastewater towards the <b>vacuum</b> <b>station.</b> Besides these collection chambers, no other manholes, neither for changes in direction, nor for inspection or connection of branch lines, are necessary. High flow velocities keep the system free of any blockages or sedimentation.|$|E

The growth rate was adjusted {{to be as}} low as 10 nm s− 1 to avoid differential evaporation of the metal. Thermal oxidation of Zn films using Naber therm Furnace was carried out at 550 °C for 2 h, in order to grow thin zinc oxide films on the glass substrate.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} the possibility of ejecting liquid metals using drop on demand printing technology. The plan was to make transducers for operation in the 100 MHz frequency range and to use these transducers to demonstrate the ability to eject drops of liquid metals such as gallium. Two transducers were made by indium bonding piezoelectric lithium niobate to quartz buffer rods. The lithium niobate plates were thinned by mechanical polishing to a thickness of 37 microns for operation at 100 MHz. Hemispherical lenses were polished in the {{opposite ends of the}} buffer rods. The lenses, which focus the sound waves in the liquid metal, had an F-number equals 1. A mechanical housing was made to hold the transducers and to allow precise control over the liquid level above the lens. We started by demonstrating the ability to eject drops of water on demand. The drops of water had a diameter of 15 microns which corresponds to the wavelength of the sound wave in the water. A videotape of this ejection was made. We then used a mixture of Gallium and Indium (used to lower the melting temperature of the Gallium) to demonstrate the ejection of liquid metal drops. This proved to be difficult because of the oxide skin which forms {{on the surface of the}} liquid. In some instances, we were able to eject metal drops, however, this was not consistent and reproducible. An experiment was set up at NASA-Lewis to stabilize the process of drop on demand liquid metal ejection. The object was to place the transducer and liquid metal in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>station</b> so that no oxide would form on the surface. We were successful in demonstrating that liquid metals could be ejected on demand and that this technology could be used for making sheet metal in space...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyze the {{malfunctioning}} vacuum sewer system in Ondangwa, Namibia. The system did not form adequate vacuum to transport sewage from the formation place to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>station</b> and therefore the collection chambers were flooding. The aim was to find the failures that caused malfunctioning, causes of the failures and solutions for the failures. In addition, four other vacuum sewer systems in Namibia were studied for comparison purposes. They were located in Gobabis, Henties Bay, Kalkrand and Stampriet. A two month field trip was done in Namibia in October and November 2014 and three methods were {{used to analyze the}} vacuum sewer systems in Namibia. The methods were literature survey, semi-structured interview and observation. The vacuum sewer system in Ondangwa has faced many failures {{since the beginning of the}} design phase in 2006 until November 2014. The failures have been related to the vacuum pumps, vacuum sewers and collection chambers. There had been issues also during the design and construction phases. Majority of the failures have been caused by external factors (vandalism, misuse of the system and poor maintenance). However, the system is also difficult to maintain in the local conditions and material defect of the vacuum sewer system has also caused failures: the valve controllers break down easily when they are in touch with moisture. The impacts of the failures have exposed users and operators of the system to health risks and environment to contamination due to the sewage on the streets. The failures and the causes of the failures in the other vacuum sewer systems in Namibia have been very similar with the system in Ondangwa. Thesystem in Henties Bay had the least amount of failures and the vacuum sewer system in Ondangwa had the biggest amount of failures. In November 2014 the system in Ondangwa did not operate anymore due to broken vacuum pumps. Ondangwa and the four other LA’s of Namibia have two options. They should either invest a lot on the improvement of the vacuum sewer systems or replace them with more applicable sewer systems. For example gravity sewer system is more familiar technology to the sewer system operators and users in Namibia. However, the improvement of the maintenance and protection of the system and education of the users is essential with gravity, vacuum or any other system. Otherwise vandalism and inadequate maintenance will cause failures also in the future, no matter what system is operating. The vacuum sewer system operation can be improved by fixing all the failures with proper materials and by proper contractors. The findings of this thesis are useful for improving the poor sanitation situation in Ondangwa and in the four other LA’s...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} between atomic chromium {{and neat}} 2 -vinylpyridine {{leads to the}} polymerization of the monomer, forming a polymer glass. The product of the rapid polymerization of neat monomer is atactic poly(2 -vinylpyridine) in which the chromium has been incorporated as a complex. From cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption studies, it was proposed that the chromium forms a neutral complex with a severely distorted octahedral geometry and consists of a formally Cr 2 + metal center. The metal would then form an organometallic complex that is also bound via the nitrogen atom to pendant pyridine rings. The polymerization of 2 -vinylpyridine in 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran at - 78 °C after reaction with chromium atoms leads {{to the formation of}} isotactic poly(2 -vinylpyridine) with 50 % mmm isotactic content from the 13 C NMR spectrum. A coordination polymerization mechanism at a chromium metal center is proposed to occur during this reaction. Semicrystalline poly(2 -vinylpyridine) was formed by annealing the isotactic polymer. The highest melting temperature reported for this polymer by differential scanning calorimetry was that observed with our sample at 217 °C. The atactic polymer from the rapid polymerization of neat monomer displayed a glass transition at 95 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/minute, but did not melt. The morphology of the crystalline portions of the isotactic polymer after annealing consisted of spherulites displaying both "Maltese Cross" and banding under cross polarizers. Bis(eta 6 - 1 -methylnaphthalene) chromium was synthesized by the metal atom route. This complex was reacted with 2 -vinylpyridine producing an atactic polymer glass from the resulting rapid polymerization of the monomer. This rapid polymerization was not inhibited by CO 2 (g), but was quenched upon addition of hydroquinone. These results support a radical propagation mechanism that forms the polymer glass. A cryogenic <b>vacuum</b> <b>station</b> was designed and constructed for the low-temperature (15 K) electron paramagnetic resonance characterization of the reaction products from the cocondensation of atomic vanadium with 2 -vinylpyridine. The cocondensation of benzene with vanadium atoms produced bis(eta 6 -benzene) vanadium that displayed the characteristic axial spectrum. No signal was observed for reactions between vanadium atoms and nitrogen heterocycles including 2, 6 -dimethylpyridine and 2 -vinylpyridine. The incorporation of atomic iron and cobalt into 2 -vinylpyridine following the addition of atomic chromium leads to a rapid polymerization reaction forming a polymer composite consisting of magnetic metal particles embedded in poly(2 -vinylpyridine). The particle sizes were measured by transmission electron microscopy to be 1. 5 [...] 22 nm in diameter. Magnetometry studies indicated the additional presence of smaller particles not identified by microscopy. The observation of a ferromagnetic resonance spectrum from the cobalt sample at X-band frequency is consistent with the cobalt particles having undergone an allotropic phase transition to the face-centered cubic phase. The addition of atomic Ni to the monomer did not yield metal particles, but instead, a nickel complex with the polymer matrix is formed. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of this polymeric material below 40 K are consistent with the Ni metal being present as an organometallic formally Ni 1 + center in an octahedral complex bound to the polymer...|$|E

40|$|Thermoelectric power {{generation}} {{has been around}} for over 50 years but has seen very little large scale implementation due to the inherently low efficiencies and powers available from known materials. Recent material advances appear to have improved the technology's prospects. In this work we show that significantly increased generated power densities are possible even for established material technologies provided that parasitic losses are controlled and effective strategies are found for handling the large resulting heat fluxes. We optimize the performance of a thermoelectric generator in this regime, and discuss fundamental performance limits in this context. We present a design of a thermoelectric generator using conventional material and a microchannel heat sink that we predict can generate many times the power of a conventional thermoelectric, at a comparable efficiency. A high temperature <b>vacuum</b> test <b>station</b> is used to characterize the {{power generation}}, efficiency, and material properties of thermoelectric materials and generators.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{system for}} {{computer}} {{control of working}} pressure in a plasma nitriding unit by using a DCM (Distributed Controlled Modules) system is described. Plasma nitriding as a thermochemical process of materials surface treatment is widely used {{in many areas of}} industrial applications such as microelectronics, automotive industry, air space industry etc. This process is in development, especially concerning plasma generators and related electronics. The processes at the surface of workpieces require a very precise control of many process parameters, the most important being the working gas composition, substrate temperature, pressure and discharge voltage. Generally electrical discharge is used for both the plasma processing and heating of the substrate by the surface bombarding particles. The first process step is the so called cleaning and heating stage, which is characterized by large number of glow-to-arc discharge instabilities. Besides an independent and precise control of the process parameters cited above, a computer control is needed to minimized the arcing processes and the other plasma instabilities. The total pressure inside the processing chamber is important for homogeneity control of the surface treatment of complex shaped substrates. The local overheating due to so called hallow cathode effect may be controlled by appropriate working pressure adjustment. This paper deals with computer control of working pressure in the plasma nitriding unit JONEL 1254, which consists of gas supply <b>station,</b> <b>vacuum</b> chamber with corresponding vacuum components, plasma generator, measuring unit and control unit for computer acquisition and control of plasma processing parameters. The control unit is a DCM slave node, connected to the PC through the serial BitBus interconnect. Each DCM node contains a microcontroller Intel 8051, which provides data processing inside the node itself. A DCM communication software, actually an operating system for BitBus compatible modules, is developed and used for the communication between PC and control unit, i. e. between DCM master and slave node.

40|$|This {{study of}} the design basis {{capacity}} of process systems was prepared by Fluor Federal Services for the Spent Nuclear Fuel Project. The evaluation uses a summary level model of major process sub-systems to determine the impact of sub-system interactions on the overall time to complete fuel removal operations. The process system model configuration and time cycle estimates developed in the original version of this report have been updated as operating scenario assumptions evolve. The initial document released in Fiscal Year (FY) 1996 varied the number of parallel systems and transport systems over a wide range, estimating a conservative design basis for completing fuel processing in a two year time period. Configurations modeling planned operations were updated in FY 1998 and FY 1999. The FY 1998 Base Case continued to indicate that fuel removal activities at the basins could be completed in slightly over 2 years. Evaluations completed in FY 1999 were based on schedule modifications that delayed the start of KE Basin fuel removal, {{with respect to the}} start of KW Basin fuel removal activities, by 12 months. This delay resulted in extending the time to complete all fuel removal activities by 12 months. However, the results indicated that the number of Cold <b>Vacuum</b> Drying (CVD) <b>stations</b> could be reduced from four to three without impacting the projected time to complete fuel removal activities. This update of the design basis capacity evaluation, performed for FY 2000, evaluates a fuel removal scenario that delays the start of KE Basin activities such that staffing peaks are minimized. The number of CVD stations included in all cases for the FY 2000 evaluation is reduced from three to two, since the scenario schedule results in minimal time periods of simultaneous fuel removal from both basins. The FY 2000 evaluation also considers removal of Shippingport fuel from T Plant storage and transfer to the Canister Storage Building for storage...|$|R
