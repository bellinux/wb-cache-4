30|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} using the dataset combination 2. Experiments were repeated on two machines {{to measure the}} computation time. Of the total corpus of 400 K, 10 % of the data (40 K) was used as labeled data (L) for the first iteration of the Co-Training algorithm. The parameters that yielded the best performance in phishGILLNET 2 are employed to build phishGILLNET 3. This implies that number of topics K is 200 and the weak learner for the AdaBoost is logistic regression (see Table 7). The parameters of the Co-Training algorithm are p (phish) = 200 and n (not phish) = 1800. This unbalanced dataset is realistic with proportion of phishing emails in large-scale mail systems. The size of the unlabeled pool U' is 5000. After each iterations of Co-Training, the text view classifier labels 2, 000 emails and the hyperlink <b>view</b> <b>labels</b> 2, 000 emails resulting in 4, 000 additional labeled data for the next iteration of Co-Training. The pool U' is replenished by selecting 4, 000 additional emails randomly from the unlabeled set U.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} case of {{transparent}} word labels (e. g., "push") placed on glass doors, when viewed {{from the other side}} as mirror-reversed script, hence requiring an action opposite to word meaning. As compared with a regular <b>view,</b> <b>labels</b> seen "from the other side" in the glass door situation caused strong delays of actions and a tripling of error rates. This problem is unrelated to mirror reading but is at least partially due to the need to act opposite to word meaning. The glass door effect was not related to practice and age and showed no adaptation effect after incompatible trials. Distribution analyses showed an increased correct reaction time (RT) effect for slower responses, whereas accuracy effects were specific for fast responses. In the literature, problems with such mixed mappings have often been interpreted in the sense of competing action tendencies. Experiments 1 to 4, however, demonstrated that this might merely be a task difficulty effect due to the necessity for a mental transformation in case of mirror-reversed labels. Moreover, our results strongly advocate against using transparent labels because they may pose a considerable risk...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to revisit the category known as “brazilianism”. This category is analyzed from a traditional and historical perspective, which regards “brazilianisms” as particular expressions or words, coined in Brazil, that diverge from Portuguese expressions. This category is also analyzed from a lexicographical perspective, which, based on a traditional <b>view,</b> <b>labels</b> certain lexical items as “brazilianisms”. This paper is based on literature review dating back to the first records of these formations, as well as on the investigation of modern dictionaries. A common core of all definitions of “brazilianisms” discussed throughout this paper is that this category distinguishes Brazilian Portuguese (BP) from European Portuguese (EP), although there is disagreement with respect to the etymological origins of these formations. This paper does not acknowledge this as a problematic fact, and further concludes that the profusion of etymological sources (e. g., Amerindian, African, and Portuguese) is one of the fundamental characteristics of “brazilianisms”. Additionally, this paper revisits Mario de Andrade’s contributions to the topic, based on his particular view of “brazilianisms”, from his project titled Gramatiquinha. The label “brazilianism” is then extended to encompass not only words, but also various constructions and strategies which, nonetheless, would be typical of BP. Finally, the main contribution of this paper lies in the attempt to trace back the history of the concept of “brazilianism”, to rediscover it, and to think about which structures and contemporary trends in BP could be investigated under this category...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Textile product {{labels are}} {{provided}} on the clothing and household textile products to assist consumers with important product information. However, the assumption cannot {{be made that}} because the label is available on these products {{it will be used}} by consumers. Consumers do not base their pre– and post–purchasing decisions on reality but rather on what they perceive to be the reality. Thus consumers’ perceptions of textile product labels need to be studied as it influences their pre– and post–purchasing decisions and use of these labels. Consumers use their perceptions as a frame of reference for making purchasing decisions. This study determined consumers’ perceptions, in order to form a better understanding of their textile pre– and post–purchasing decisions. However, perception is not a singular concept but an interactive process. Therefore, the present study, done in the Gauteng Province, aimed to determine consumers’ perceptions of clothing and household textile labels, by focusing on the perceptual process of consumers. The first objective was to determine consumers’ awareness of labels on clothing and household textile products. Secondly, it was determined whether consumers’ attention is drawn to labels of clothing and household textile products. Thirdly it was determined whether labels on textile products are important to consumers and finally, whether consumers interpret labels on textile products. An interviewer–administered questionnaire was used as the data collection technique. A total of 411 questionnaires were administered by trained fieldworkers. The study location was three different regions in Gauteng Province, namely: Pretoria, Vereeniging and the West Rand. Public locations were used for the recruitment of respondents selected within the three regions, which included: schools, retirement villages, parking areas and government institutions. This contributed to the probability that a diverse group of respondents participated. The study population consisted of 44. 5 % males and 55. 5 % females. The home languages most spoken among the respondents were English (20. 9 %), Afrikaans (21. 1 %) or isiZulu (16. 5 %). Respondents generally tended to have a positive perception regarding textile product labels. The results illustrated that respondents tended to agree to be aware of label information and that the front and back panels of the label draw their attention. However respondents tended to be neutral as to whether the information is important enough to read. Respondents mostly agreed that they interpret the symbols on textile product labels. Although respondents tended to perceive textile product labels positively, it still remains unclear whether it is important enough for consumers to use these labels found on textile products. By striving to improve consumers’ perceptions regarding textile product labels through better labelling initiatives and consumer education on labels, consumers might <b>view</b> <b>labels</b> as important and use them before and after purchasing a textile product. This will in effect teach consumers how to clean and maintain textile products to extend the product’s lifespan. This would in turn contribute to the consumer’s pre– and post–purchasing satisfaction. This study additionally found that respondents’ perceptions of textile product labels were influenced by some of their demographic characteristics. Although there were no large effect sizes which illustrated practical significance, there were some small to medium tendencies regarding respondents’ perceptions of textile product labels and their demographic characteristics. Different tendencies were especially found when analysing the relationships between respondents’ perceptions and age or language. Older respondents (60 and older) tended to have a more positive perception of textile product labels than younger respondents (18 to 29 years). In addition, respondents with an African language as their home language seemed to differ from Afrikaans and English respondents. To understand South African consumers fully, researchers should understand the diversity and political history of South Africa, by focusing on cultural differences and reasons thereof. Different age generations need to be examined in further South African studies {{in order to determine the}} perceptions of consumers from different age groups regarding textile product labels.
