30|$|The video {{concentrator}} comprises, amongst other things, {{a common}} master clock, a clock gating circuit, a camera controller, a Channel-Link® serialiser and a Camera-Link® Interface. The Channel-Link® serialiser takes the two <b>video</b> <b>busses</b> and the Camera-Link® timing signals and serialises them onto four high speed differential serial lines. These are then mapped onto the Camera-Link® interface (in the order {{defined by the}} standard) and finally transmitted over the Camera-Link® cable to the frame grabber. The host computer ultimately receives and de-multiplexes the video data to produce a wide 1280 x 480 composite stereo-image.|$|R

5000|$|The eighty Image Engines have {{multiple}} functions. Firstly, each Image Engine controls {{a portion of}} the raster memory, which {{in the case of the}} InfiniteReality, is a 1 MB SGRAM organized as 262,144 by 32-bit words. Secondly, the following OpenGL per-fragment operations are performed by the Image Engines: pixel ownership test, stencil test, depth buffer test, blending, dithering and logical operation. Lastly, the Image Engines perform anti-aliasing and accumulation buffer operations. To deliver pixel data for display, each Image Engine has a 2-bit serial bus to the Display Generator board. If one Raster Manager board is present in the pipeline, the Image Engine uses the entire width of the bus, whereas if two or more Raster Manager boards are present, the Image Engine uses half the bus. Each serial bus is actually a part of the <b>Video</b> <b>Bus,</b> which has a bandwidth of 1.2 GB/s. Four Image Engine [...] "cores" [...] are contained on an Image Engine ASIC, which contains nearly 488,000 logic gates, comprising 1.95 million transistors, on a 42 mm2 (6.5 by 6.5 mm) die that was fabricated in a 0.35 micrometre process by VLSI Technology.|$|E

The floppy disk interface supported dual density, and disk capacities up to 800 KB, {{more than four times}} the capacity of the original TRS-80. A special version of NewDos/80, (an improved TRS-DOS compatible Disk operating system) was used to support these disk capacities when using the TRS-80 compatibility mode.|$|R

30|$|Camera-Link® and APIX® {{share many}} {{technical}} characteristics {{that make them}} ideal for automotive vision although they are intended for different domains. However, they both seem to lack an obvious way for interconnecting multiple cameras per interface. This is where this paper makes a contribution. In this project Camera-Link® was selected {{as a basis for}} what could become an Automotive <b>Video</b> <b>Bus</b> due to the reasons mentioned in the forgoing as well as its superior bandwidth. Camera-Link was extended, to allow the interconnection of multiple synchronised cameras in a multivision set. APIX® would have been an equally adequate starting point but APIX® compliant hardware is only just appearing on the market. That said, much of what is presented for Camera-Link® is also directly applicable to APIX® so the results are portable across both interfaces.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{communication}} needs for this application {{are important and}} computation needs are much heavier, we have chosen the simplest hardware communication solution (using point-to-point connections). Thus, the multistage architecture-based point-to-point links are used since it satisfies the application communication needs for relatively low implementation costs and reduces {{the communication}} overhead to have {{little effect on the}} global computation time. To this end, the developed <b>video</b> <b>bus</b> drives the input image through the parallel architecture where all processing nodes are independent and perform different image sizes. Thanks to CubeGen framework, the parameterization of the parallel architecture makes it possible to match the specific application needs in terms of BRAM memory and FIFO size that need to buffer large amounts of data. In addition, the two-pipeline architecture represents staged computation where parallelism can be achieved by computing different stages simultaneously on different inputs, mainly when dealing with more than one side simultaneously.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} our optimized cross-layer FEC schemes for four CIF (352 × 288 pixels) <b>video</b> sequences: <b>Bus,</b> Foreman, Coastguard, and Akiyo. These sequences were encoded using H. 264 /AVC JM 14.2 reference software [51] at 840 kbps and 150 bytes slice size, for a GOP length of 30 frames with GOP structure IDR B P B…P B at 30 frames/s. The slices were formed using dispersed-mode FMO with two slice groups per frame. Two reference frames were used for predicting the P and B frames, with error concealment enabled using temporal concealment and spatial interpolation. We have used a channel transmission rate of C= 1.4 to study the performance over AWGN channels.|$|R

Public/private key pairs are assigned to devices by a trusted authority, which possesses a master secret. If an attacker can recover 40 public/private key pairs that span the module of public keys, then the authority's master secret can be recovered in a few seconds. With the master secret, an attacker can eavesdrop on communications between any two devices and can spoof any device, both in real time. Additionally, the attacker can produce new key pairs not on any key revocation list. Thus the attacker can completely usurp the trusted authority's power. Furthermore, the protocol is still insecure even if all devices' keys are signed by the central authority. 2...|$|E

30|$|Automotive vision faces another {{formidable}} challenge – bandwidth. Having several cameras {{running at}} high frame rates and at high resolutions quickly pushes such applications into the multi GBit/s domain.

New automotive video interface standards will be required, and while {{it makes sense to}} base these on existing and proven interconnects, it may be argued that a completely new standard is needed to properly address the requirements of this peculiar market.
