Alcohol analysis was initiated at 40. 4 ～ 39. 3 %, and alcohol contents in the jar and stainless container decreased as aging time increased. <b>Volatile</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> slightly increased in the reduced pressure (RP) jar and stainless container and showed a different result in the atmospheric pressure (AP) container. Amount of acetic acid did not change either in the jar or stainless container as aging time increased. In the case of 2 -thiobarbituric acid (TBA), RP was lower than AP after distillation, and TBA value did not change much either in the jar or stainless container. In the case of fusel alcohol by aging time, n-propanol content did not increase either in the jar or stainless container as aging time increased. Iso-butanol content was reduced in the jar but did not change in the stainless container. In the AP container, more aromatic components were measured on the 180 th day of aging time than after distillation. High boiling point aromatic components increased in particular. In the stainless container, more aromatic components were generated on the 180 th day of aging, but their amount was relatively lower than in the jar.

40|$|The {{presence}} of various volatile matters in silage {{has long been}} known. The authors have made a comparison between methods for determining dry matter in silage. The determinations in these tests included the toluene distillation method, and the drying methods with infrared ray and with oven. One of the two oven drying methods tested was a usual one {{and the other was}} a simplified one, in which a 20 to 40 g. of fresh and finely cut silage was directly weighed before drying in a large weighing bottle(6 cm× 5 cm). Of fifty silage samples, the contents of organic acids, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and dry matter as well as the pH values were determined. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) Fifty silage samples(14 chinese milk-vetch, 13 Italian ryegrass, 6 oat, 5 corn, 3 sweet potato vines, 5 mixed hay crops and 4 others) contained 11. 3 to 47. 5 (mean 20. 7 ± 7. 6 g.) of dry matter by the distillation method, 0. 07 to 3. 86 (1. 40 ± 0. 95 g.) of volatile fatty acid, 0. 09 to 1. 16 (0. 58 ± 0. 29 g.) of total N and 6. 5 to 407. 4 (110. 6 ± 98. 3 mg) of ammonia N, per 100 g. 2) The losses(D. M. by the distillation method-mean value of D. M. by the drying methods) were significantly correlated with <b>volatile</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content,</b> r=+ 0. 69, with butyric acid content, r=+ 0. 70, with ammonia N, r=+ 0. 64, with pH, r=+ 0. 46 and with appraisal marks of silage, r=- 0. 60. Therefore, the percentage of underestimating dry matter in poor silages is higher than that in good silages. 3) The quantity of dry matter estimated by the infrared ray drying was generally larger than that by the oven drying, but lower than that by the distillation method. Even in employing the distillation method, however, further investigation will be necessary to determine the real quantity of dry matter in silage...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{study shows}} the {{potential}} of near infrared spectroscopy for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of wine and brandy in the distilling industry. Wines intended for further processing by the distillation industry have to meet certain specifications to ensure an efficient and cost-effective distilling process with a suitable product yield. Certain compounds have, therefore, been recognised as significant quality parameters and through their regulation, a product of consistent quality can be ensured. These quality parameters include alcohol, total acid, volatile acid, total sulphur dioxide, total phenolics, reducing sugars and acetaldehyde concentrations and pH. The effective control of all these compounds in the wines prior to distillation, is critical to maintain the feasibility and efficiency of the process. Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) {{can be used as}} a rapid and accurate analytical method for the determination of alcohol concentrations in distilling and brandy base wine. The choice of path length for the liquid sampling cell is an important consideration. In this study, alcohol with its strong absorption of OH bands in the near infrared region was not significantly affected, but difference in path length showed a significant influence on the prediction of the volatile acid concentration in distilling wine. Very strong correlations were found between the spectral data and the alcohol concentration data in distilling wine (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) and brandy base wine (r = 0. 92, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Good predictions were obtained for the <b>volatile</b> <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> of brandy base wine (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1) but better accuracy could be obtained by incorporating a wider concentration range and more sensitive, although not the accepted reference methods, such as HPLC and GC, into the modelling. In contrast to the brandy base wine, the much cruder, turbid distilling wine (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1) yielded poor calibration results for volatile acid. FT-NIRS can also be used as a rapid screening method to measure the total acid content, pH and total phenol levels in brandy base wine samples. Satisfactory predictions were obtained for the total acid content (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) and total phenol levels (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 mq. L" GAE). The SEP of all the parameters compared well with the SEL and were within acceptable limits. The range of the concentration measurements were, however, very narrow and the accuracy of these models (measured as the ratio of the range to the standard error of prediction) were all below 10, indicating that modelling of these parameters in brandy base wine should be attempted with reference values covering a wider range. Poor correlations and predictions were obtained between the wine spectral data and the acetaldehyde (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), residual sugar (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") and total sulphur dioxide (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 mq. L") concentration data. The unique character of potstill distillates, originating from the grape cultivar, type and age of the oak casks, lends itself to the development and blending of different brandies. The process of blending and correcting the brandy is necessary to obtain a product and brand of established and recognised character. The brandy is generally divided into different classes prior to blending based on the degree of "smoothness" or "hardness" of the matured distillate as determined by a sensorial panel. The ideal would, however, be to replace this subjective evaluation method with a more objective approach, such as an instrumental method like NIRS. Near infrared spectroscopy showed potential to successfully discriminate and classify brandy samples in terms of their sensorial classification status. The near infrared spectra of unblended three-year old brandies were measured and discriminant analysis performed using the subjective sensory classification data of the brandy. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) models were developed by calculating separate peA (principal component analysis) models for each of the classes for which qualitative analysis were required. An assessment of class membership of an unknown sample was made on the basis of the distance to the cluster centroid. Two types of NIRS instruments, a Fourier transform near infrared system and a diode array spectrophotometer were employed to examine the discriminatory abilities of NIRS. Excellent predictions (90. 9 %- 100 %) were obtained for the "smoothest" and "hardest" classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons with FT-NIRS. For the diode array spectra reasonable classification data were obtained for all the classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons, as well as an excellent classification rate (100 %) of the smoothest class in the 1999 season. Prediction results for class membership of the brandy samples from the three season's combined data did not deliver satisfactory discriminatory results. By applying NIRS and SIMCA, rapid and objective classification of brandy samples within seasonal context can be established to enhance the blending processes. Having accurate reference data in the calibration set is essential in near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The precision (usually decided by blind duplicate determination) of the reference data serves as the performance target for correlation-based near infrared analysis. The differences between reference values obtained from two independent laboratories and the Foss Winescan FT 120, which is also a predictive method, for the alcohol and volatile acid determinations in distilling wine and between two independent laboratories for the measurement of the total sulphur dioxide content, were investigated. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni testing) revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between all three measurements for the volatile acid analysis. One laboratory differed significantly from the other two measurements in its measurement of the alcohol content in distilling wine. A paired t-test performed on the two laboratories' values obtained for total sulphur dioxide revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between the two sets of results. This study restated the importance of obtaining reliable reference data for calibration purposes to maintain the efficiency and accuracy and therefore the reputability of NIRS as an accurate and reliable analytical method. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie studie dui op die potensiaal van naby infrarooi spektroskopie (NIRS) vir beide die kwalitatiewe en kwantitatiewe analise van wyn en brandewyn in die distillasie industrie. Sekere spesifikasies word gestel waaraan wyn met voldoen voor dit verdere prosessering tydens distillasie kan ondergaan. Die regulering van wynkwaliteit is noodsaaklik om die distilleringsproses ekonomies volhoubaar te maak. Sekere komponente in die wyn het 'n direkte invloed op die kwaliteit van die eindproduk en word beskou as betekenisvolle parameters wat beheer moet word om 'n produk van konstante hoë kwaliteit te lewer. Hierdie parameters sluit alkohol, titreerbare suur- en vlugtige suurinhoud, asook die pH, totale swaweidioksied, totale fenol vlakke, reduserende suikers en asetaldehied konsentrasies in. Die regulering van al hierdie komponente in die wyne is essensieel voor die aanvang van distillasie om die effektiwiteit en produktiwiteit van die proses te verseker. Fourier transformasie naby-infrarooi spektroskopie (FT-NIRS) kan benut word as 'n vinnige en akkurate analitiese metode om die alkohol konsentrasie in stook- en rabatwyn te bepaal. 'n Geskikte padlengte kuvet moet gekies word vir die ontleding van vloeistof monsters met NIRS. In hierdie studie is gevind dat die voorspelling van alkoholkonsentrasie in wyn, nie soseer beïnvloed is deur die keuse van padlengte nie. 'n Vlugtige komponent soos asynsuur, wat die maatstaf van die vlugtige suurinhoud van die wyn is, word egter regstreeks beïnvloed deur die keuse van padlengte. 'n Sterk korrelasie is gevind in die datastel vir die alkoholinhoud van die stookwyn (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) en rabatwyn (r = 0. 92, SECV = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Baie goeie voorspellings is ook gevind vir die vlugtige suurinhoud van rabatwyn (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1). Die akkuraatheid van die metode (uitgedruk as die RER waarde) het egter aangedui dat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang en meer akkurate verwysingswaardes gebruik moet word om 'n geskikte model vir vlugtige suur kwantifikasie in rabatwyn te bewerkstellig. In teenstelling met die resultate verkry vir die rabatwyn, het die ruwer, turbiede stookwyn swak gekalibreer vir die vlugtige suurinhoud (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1). FT-NIRS kan ook gebruik word as 'n vinnige seleksie metode om titreerbare suur vlakke, pH en totale fenolinhoud van rabatwyn monsters te bepaal. Sterk korrelasies is in die datastel gevind vir die titreerbare suurinhoud (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) en totale fenol vlakke (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 rnq. L" GAE) van rabatwyn. Die SEP waardes verkry vanaf die NIRS bepalings het baie goed vergelyk met die standaard foute wat verkry is vir die chemiese bepalings. Die konsentrasie omvang van die verwysingswaardes was, egter, beperk en die akkuraatheid van die NIRS modelle (uitgedruk as die verhouding tussen die konsentrasie omvang en die standaard fout van voorspelling) was laer as 10. Dit het daarop gedui dat die NIRS kalibrasie van die parameters eerder uitgevoer moet word met monsters wat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang dek en gemeet is met meer sensitiewe analitiese metodes soos HPLC en GC. Die kalibrasie en voorspelling van die asetaldehied inhoud (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), reduserende suiker konsentrasie (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") en totale swaweldioksiedinhoud (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 rnq. L") het onaanvaarbare voorspellings gelewer. Die unieke karakter van potketel distillate wat bepaal word deur die druifkultivar, tipe en ouderdom van die eikehoutvate, bied die potensiaal vir die ontwikkeling en versnyding van verskillende style brandewyn. In 'n poging om 'n produk en handelsnaam van erkende en gevestigde karakter te verkry, moet die brandewyn eers versny word na veroudering. Die brandewyn word geklassifiseer in verskillende style op grond van sensoriese gehalte. NIRS is gebruik as 'n vinnige tegniek om te onderskei tussen verskillende style onversnyde drie jaar-oue brandewyn. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) modelle is ontwerp deur aparte PCA (hoof komponent analise) modelle vir elke klas waarvoor kwalitatiewe analise vereis is, te ontwikkel. 'n Skating van klas lidmaatskap van 'n onbekende monster is gemaak deur die afstand van die monster na die groepsmiddelpunt te bereken. Twee soorte NIRS instrumente, 'n FT-NIR en 'n diode array spektrofotometer is gebruik tydens die studie om die diskrimineringsvermoë van elk te ondersoek. Uitstekende voorspellings (90. 9 %- 100 %) is gekry vir die "sagste" en "hardste" klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene met FTStellenbosch NIRS. Met die diode array spektra is redelike klassifikasie resultate verkry vir al die klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene, asook 'n uitstekende klassifikasie (100 %) vir die sagste klas binne die 1999 seisoen. Voorspellings vir klas lidmaatskap van die brandewyn monsters vir die drie seisoene se gekombineerde data het egter onaanvaarbare diskriminasie resultate gelewer. NIRS en SIMCA sal 'n vinnige en objektiewe klassifikasie proses van onversnyde brandewyn monsters kan meebring wat tot voordeel van die versnydings- en produksieproses sal wees. Hierdie voorspellings sal egter binne seisoensverband moet geskied. Akkurate verwysingsdata in die kalibrasie datastel is 'n essensiële fasset van naby infrarooi spektroskopie. Die presisie (bepaal deur blinde duplikaat bepalngs) van die verwysingsdata dien as 'n prestasie teiken vir korrelasie-gebaseerde naby infrarooi voorspellings. Die verskille tussen die data verkry vir die alkohol- en vlugtige suurinhoud van stookwyn deur twee onafhanklike laboratoriums en 'n instrumentele metode (Foss Winescan FT 120) asook die verskille tussen die data verkry van twee laboratoriums vir die totale swaweidioksied metings, is ondersoek. ANOVA en post-hoc toetse het aangedui dat al die data verkry vir die vlugtige suur bepalings, statisties betekenisvol van mekaar verskil het (p< 0. 05). Vir die alkohol bepalings in stookwyn, het die data verkry van een laboratorium betekensvol verskil van die ander twee datastelle. Gepaarde t-toetse uitgevoer op die data verkry vir totale swaweldioksiedinhoud, het ook betekinisvolle verskille aangedui tussen die twee laboratoriums. Hierdie studie het die belangrikheid van betroubare verwysingsdata vir kalibrasie doeleindes beklemtoon, veral waar 'n tegniek soos NIRS se werksverrigting afhang van die akkuraatheid van dié waardes...|$|E

The reactor contained 144 electrode pairs in 24 modules. Enrichment of an exoelectrogenic biofilm required ~ 60 days, which {{is longer than}} typically needed for laboratory reactors. Current generation was enhanced by ensuring adequate organic <b>volatile</b> fatty <b>acid</b> <b>content</b> (VFA/ SCOD≥ 0. 5) and by raising the wastewater temperature (31 ± 1 °C). Once enriched, SCOD removal (62 ± 20 %) was consistent at a hydraulic retention time of 1 day (applied voltage of 0. 9 V). Current generation reached a maximum of 7. 4 A/m 3 by the planned end of the test (after 100 days). Gas production reached a maximum of 0. 19 ± 0. 04 L/L/day, {{although most of the}} product gas was converted to methane (86 ± 6 %). In order to increase hydrogen recovery in future tests, better methods will be needed to isolate hydrogen gas produced at the cathode. These results show that inocula-tion and enrichment procedures are critical to the initial success of larger-scale systems. Acetate amendments, warmer temperatures, and pH control during startup were found to be critical for proper enrichment of exoelectro-genic biofilms and improved reactor performance...|$|R

Since a direct replacement strategy (i. e., supply of methanol as a sole carbon source to a propionic-fed PAO-enriched sludge) failed, a novel process was designed and implemented successfully: development of a consortium with anaerobic biomass and polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). Methanol-degrading acetogens were (i) selected against other anaerobic methanol degraders from an anaerobic sludge; (ii) subjected to conventional EBPR conditions (anaerobic[*]+[*]aerobic); and (iii) bioaugmented with PAOs.

40|$|Background: <b>Volatile</b> fatty <b>acid</b> {{intoxication}} (acidosis), {{a common}} process failure recorded in anaerobic reactors, leads to drastic losses in methane production. Unfortunately, {{little is known}} about the microbial mechanisms underlining acidosis and the potential to recover the process. In this study, triplicate mesophilic anaerobic reactors of 100 L were exposed to acidosis resulting from an excessive feeding with sugar beet pulp and were compared to a steady-state reactor. Results: Stable operational conditions at the beginning of the experiment initially led to similar microbial populations in the four reactors, as revealed by 16 S rRNA gene T-RFLP and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the two dominant phyla, and although they were represented by a high number of operational taxonomic units, only a few were dominant. Once the environment became deterministic (selective pressure from an increased substrate feeding), microbial populations started to diverge between the overfed reactors. Interestingly, most of bacteria and archaea showed redundant functional adaptation to the changing environmental conditions. However, the dominant Bacteroidales were resistant to high <b>volatile</b> fatty <b>acids</b> <b>content</b> and low pH. The severe acidosis did not eradicate archaea and a clear shift in archaeal populations from acetotrophic to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurred in the overfed reactors. After 11 days of severe acidosis (pH 5. 2 +/- 0. 4), the process was quickly recovered (restoration of the biogas production with methane content above 50 %) in the overfed reactors, by adjusting the pH to around 7 using NaOH and NaHCO 3. Conclusions: In this study we show that once the replicate reactors are confronted with sub-optimal conditions, their microbial populations start to evolve differentially. Furthermore the alterations of commonly used microbial parameters to monitor the process, such as richness, evenness and diversity indices were unsuccessful to predict the process failure. At the same time, we tentatively propose the replacement of the dominant Methanosaeta sp. in this case by Methanoculleus sp., to be a potential warning indicator of acidosis...|$|R

Broiler starter ration with 7 % total NSP and 2850 kcal/kg of ME served as control ration (T 1). Ration T 2 and T 3 were formulated to contain 10 % total NSP each but with either low (2623 kcal/kg, T 2) or similar caloric density (T 3) to that of T 1. Similarly, ration T 4 and T 5 were formulated to have 14 % total NSP but with either low (2376 kcal/kg, T 4) or similar energy density (T 5) as that of control. At the end of five weeks, body weight of birds fed with rations T 2 and T 3 (1310 ± 23. 1 and 1338 ± 32. 4 g, respectively) were comparable to T 1 (1361 ± 32. 7) whereas birds received T 4 and T 5 had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower body weight (1243 ± 23. 5 and 1271 ± 23. 9 g) to that of T 1.

The emissions of N 2 O (0. 34 g/d), CO 2 equivalent (0. 27 kg/d), CO 2 (1. 68 kg/d) were not significantly influenced by the diet.

However, TVFA does not provide sufficient information to reveal the overall reactor performance, and individual components have been considered of particular interest. Although some attempts {{have been described as}} on-line measurements for individual VFAs, normally they are determined by off-line chromatographic techniques (GC and HPLC). A previous interlaboratory study showed the lack of harmonization in the analytical methodologies dealing to individual VFAs, and giving an overall analytical performance rather poor. One of the reasons to justify these results was the inappropriate calibration procedures. It is widely used to check the linearity of the calibration curves based on the correlation and determination coefficients. However, these statistical parameters are erroneously interpreted. The objective of this interlaboratory study was to achieve the harmonization of results. By this way, the use of internal standard methodology (ISTD) should be useful to obtain accurate calibration functions. In addition, five different statistical parameters such as lack of fit test, residual standard deviation, relative standard deviation of the slope, relative standard deviation of the sensitivity and relative error were proposed to evaluate the linearity of calibration curves. Of these, lack of fit was unable to detect appropriately the linearity mainly due to its sensitivity to the precision of analytical results. The rest of statistical parameters reported could be considered as starting point for comparative purposes, being useful as acceptance criteria. The principal advantage of the GC/ISTD analytical methodology was the normalization of the slopes obtained by the participating laboratories, being very helpful to the harmonization of results.
