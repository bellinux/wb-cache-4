5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was {{composed}} of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, {{and a number of}} other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit. Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating probation; this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life. Bruce began his professional wrestling career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met Rob Van Dam and Sabu, two other first-timers with whom he became <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends.</b> During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.|$|E

25|$|Two coal {{companies}} {{accounted for}} the coal trade carried by the railroad. At first competitors, the Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal and Iron Company and the Bell, Lewis, and Yates Coal Mining Company became <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends</b> when Frederick Bell, George Lewis, and Arthur Yates took seats on the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway board of directors. In fact, with Iselin's resignation {{as president of the}} railway company, Yates took his place. The two coal companies then negotiated an agreement which eased competitive pressures and allocated access to the railroad's coal-transporting capacity. While Yates concentrated on coal, Merchant ran the railroad.|$|E

"What {{is really}} great about this clip, the in-joke that informs, underlines {{everything}} you see, {{is that these}} are three very famous people, working in exactly the same field, competing directly for television ratings and advertising dollars, who should supposedly have very large egos, making fun of all of that, and revealing— wait... is that irony, on American TV?— that they are probably <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends,</b> having a very good time." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{fans have}} always {{expected}} to see a relationship between Grissom and Catherine Willows, in whom he is shown confiding many times, once even likening her to being his [...] "wife". The two were never [...] more than <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends,</b> as the show's producers see them as more of brother and sister than lovers. Catherine has many times encouraged Grissom to be more open and less self-absorbed, and to pursue something with Sara Sidle.|$|E

500|$|In August 1933, Lombard and Powell {{divorced}} after 26 {{months of}} marriage, although they remained <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends</b> {{until the end}} of Lombard's life. At the time, she blamed it on their careers, but in a 1936 interview, she admitted that this [...] "had {{little to do with the}} divorce. We were just two completely incompatible people". She appeared in five films that year, beginning with the drama From Hell to Heaven and continuing with Supernatural, her only horror vehicle. After a small role in The Eagle and the Hawk, a war film starring Fredric March and Cary Grant, she starred in two melodramas: Brief Moment, which critics enjoyed, and White Woman, where she was paired with Charles Laughton.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{played at}} the opening of the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959, which was in the cellar of Mona Best's house. Aspinall later rented a room in the house and became <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends</b> with then-Beatle Pete Best. The Beatles had {{previously}} used public transport to get to local gigs, but by February 1961, they were playing two or three concerts per night at different locations and needed someone to drive them. Best asked Aspinall to be a part-time road manager for the band, so Aspinall bought an [...] "old, grey and maroon Commer van" [...] for £80, and charged each of the group five shillings (25p) per concert. Harrison later said: [...] "Our early van became the centre of attention every time it pulled up. It was brush-painted red and grey and from head to foot was covered in graffiti – girls' names, and things like 'I love you, John'. It looked interesting, but the moment anybody saw it they would feel free to write all over it.” The Beatles returned from their second trip to Hamburg in July 1961, and Aspinall left his job to become their permanent road manager, as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant.|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he told me about the track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends.</b> Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E
500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends</b> for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E

Asked, before the event, [...] by a close friend how {{he had managed to}} have his invitation accepted Capel's reply was said to have been: [...] "How, why I gave him a good licking and that made him civil. We are <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends</b> now." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{supposed}} remark when meeting another leading physicist, Paul Ehrenfest, {{illustrates this}} notion of an arrogant Pauli. The two met at a conference for the first time. Ehrenfest was familiar with Pauli's papers and was quite impressed with them. After {{a few minutes of}} conversation, Ehrenfest remarked, [...] "I think I like your Encyclopedia article [...] better than I like you," [...] to which Pauli shot back, [...] "That's strange. With me, regarding you, it is just the opposite." [...] The two became <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>friends</b> from then on.|$|E
2500|$|M.C.

Therefore, Hammer was first invited to perform the song [...] "U Can't Touch This", prior to its release, on The Arsenio Hall Show in 1989.
