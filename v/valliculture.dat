These case studies {{are typical of}} the countries involved, namely semi-intensive polyculture (Portugal and Spain), extensive polyculture in esteros (Spain), integrated systems (France), <b>valliculture</b> (Italy), nursery ponds (Greece, Portugal, France and Italy) and eel ponds (France). This article was written having as objective the providing of a concise summary of the characteristics that SEACASE collaborators found to be central to build a complete and trustable Certification system for products of sustainable non-intensive aquaculture (for “certification of sustainability”, see Ojeda, 2008). The 6 Codes of Conduct are the basic information to build such a system in the future. This study {{has been carried out}} with the financial support from the Commission of the European Communities, specific RTD programme “Specific Support to Policies”, SSP- 2005 - 44483 “SEACASE - Sustainable {{extensive and}} semi-intensive coastal aquaculture in Southern Europe”, and does not necessarily reflect the European Commission views and in no way anticipates the Commission’s future policy in this area.
