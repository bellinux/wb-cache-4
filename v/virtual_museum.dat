40|$|Various {{conceptual}} {{approaches for}} the creation and presentation of <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> can be found. However, less work exists that concentrates on collaboration in <b>virtual</b> <b>museums.</b> The support of collaboration in <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> provides various benefits for the visit {{as well as the}} preparation and creation of virtual exhibits. This paper addresses one major problem of collaboration in virtual museums: the awareness of visitors. We use a Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) for the visualization of generated <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> to offer simple awareness through co-location. Furthermore, the use of smartphones during the visit enables the visitors to create comments or to access exhibit related metadata. Thus, the main contribution of this ongoing work is the presentation of a workflow that enables an integrated deployment of generic <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> into a CAVE, which will be demonstrated by deploying the <b>virtual</b> Leopold Fleischhacker <b>Museum...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aims: The study {{presents}} the results of a pilot project in which <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> were used for teaching modern painters to sixth-grade primary school students. Study Design: Experimental study with one experimental and two control groups. Place and Duration of Study: A total of 132 students participated in the study coming from 6 primary schools located in Athens, Greece. The duration of the projects was between January to February 2017. Methodology: The <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> were developed by the students using the program Artsteps. For comparing the learning outcomes, two additional groups of students were formed. To the first, the teaching was conventional, while in the second the teaching was supported by multimedia presentations. Research data was collected using questionnaires and evaluation sheets. Results: From the analysis of the results it became evident that students that developed the <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> surpassed, in most cases, the other groups of students. The views of students for their work with <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> were highly positive. Conclusion: The results lead to the need for further investigation of the matter...|$|R

25|$|The Smithsonian Institution, in {{collaboration}} with the University of Texas at El Paso and Second Life, have created a Smithsonian Latino <b>Virtual</b> <b>Museum</b> and accompanying multimedia e-book: Día de los Muertos: Day of the Dead. The project's website contains some of the text and images which explain the origins of some of the customary core practices related to the Day of the Dead, such as the background beliefs and the offrenda (the special altar commemorating one's deceased loved one). The Made For iTunes multimedia e-book version provides additional content, such as further details; additional photo galleries; pop-up profiles of influential Latino artists and cultural figures over the decades; and video clips of interviews with artists who make Dia de Muertos-themed artwork, explanations and performances of Aztec and other traditional dances, an animation short that explains the customs to children, virtual poetry readings in English and Spanish.|$|E

IntelligentBox has provided various software components called boxes, which are 3 D visible, reactive objects. IntelligentBox allows the user to develop 3 D graphics applications by combining already existing boxes through direct manipulations on a computer screen. Recently the authors have been interested in the development of network collaborative <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> using IntelligentBox as one topic of their collaboration researches. In this paper, the authors propose interaction models for network collaborative <b>virtual</b> <b>museums</b> and explain 3 D visual component based approach for the implementation of those interaction models based on using IntelligentBox...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Presentation {{of content}} is an {{important}} aspect of today’s virtual reality applications, especially in domains such as <b>virtual</b> <b>museums.</b> The large amount and variety of exhibits in such applications raise a need for adaptation and personalization of the environment. This paper presents a content personalization platform for <b>Virtual</b> <b>Museums,</b> which is based on a semantic description of content and on information implicitly collected about the users through their interactions with the museum. The proposed platform uses stereotypes to initialize user models, adapts user profiles dynamically and clusters users into similar interest groups. A science fiction museum has been set up as a case study for this platform and an evaluation has been carried out...|$|R
