In addition to having a large public sector relative to the European Union (EU) 15 average, the composition of revenues is skewed, on the one hand, toward direct taxes. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> on the other hand, is broadly in line with the European Union (EU) 15 average.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the effects <b>of</b> {{government}} <b>expenditures</b> on long-run economic growth in developed countries using their different breakdown. Empirical analysis is performed for a panel of 34 OECD countries in the period 2000 - 2012. Above all, the results support the idea that conclusions of previous studies on this topic may be strongly distorted by inappropriate classification <b>of</b> <b>expenditures,</b> typically in the case <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> on education and health. These are usually considered productive and thus growth enhancing, but if their part <b>of</b> R&D <b>expenditures</b> is detached, their effect on growth is in fact negative.

40|$|Background Wearable {{monitors}} {{are increasingly}} being used to objectively monitor physical activity in research studies {{within the field of}} exercise science. Calibration and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> these devices are vital to obtaining accurate data. This article is aimed primarily at the physical activity measurement specialist, although the end user who is conducting studies with these devices also may benefit from knowing about this topic. Best Practices Initially, wearable physical activity monitors should undergo unit calibration to ensure interinstrument reliability. The next step is to simultaneously collect both raw signal data (e. g., acceleration) from the wearable monitors and rates <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure,</b> so that algorithms can be developed to convert the direct signals into energy expenditure. This process should use multiple wearable monitors and a large and diverse subject group and should include a wide range of physical activities commonly performed in daily life (from sedentary to vigorous). Future Directions New methods of calibration now use "pattern recognition" approaches to train the algorithms on various activities, and they provide estimates <b>of</b> energy <b>expenditure</b> that are much better than those previously available with the single-regression approach. Once a method <b>of</b> predicting energy <b>expenditure</b> has been established, {{the next step is to}} examine its predictive accuracy by cross-validating it in other populations. In this article, we attempt to summarize the best practices for calibration and <b>validation</b> <b>of</b> wearable physical activity monitors. Finally, we conclude with some ideas for future research ideas that will move the field of physical activity measurement forward...|$|R

40|$|Evolutionarily stable {{strategy}} models {{suggest that}} biparental care will be stable when parents partially compensate {{for changes in}} care by the other parent Previous work has emphasized the relationship between parental expenditure and the current component of fitness (e. g., offspring survival and fecundity) in causing partial compensation. This study shows that partial compensation depends critically on the effect <b>of</b> current parental <b>expenditure</b> on a parent's future fitness (e. g., survival to and fecundity in subsequent breeding seasons). Partial compensation is favored and biparental care is stable when future fitness is a concave-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is more costly than the previous). However, when future fitness is a convex-down function <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (i. e., each increment <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> is less costly) biparental care is unstable.
