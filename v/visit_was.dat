5|$|Caligula did {{not trust}} the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had {{connections}} with Egyptian separatists. In AD 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus. According to Philo, the <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as {{the king of the}} Jews. Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish synagogues. As a result, riots broke out in the city. Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{left the}} {{mainland}} on May 19, and his final stop was in Hawaii, {{where he was}} a guest of Admiral Felix Stump, the commander of United States Pacific Fleet. The reason for the <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> to discuss Diệm's concerns over America's reaction if South Vietnam came under communist attack. Stump reiterated Washington's opinions that nuclear weapons would be used to defend any anti-communist country that was attacked by communists, in accordance with public statements made by Eisenhower and Dulles. He said the Americans would do so by dropping nuclear weapons on communist China.|$|E

40|$|Background/aim: Predischarge home {{assessment}} <b>visits</b> <b>are</b> {{a commonly}} accepted, but little researched, aspect of occupational therapy practice. The {{aim of this}} research was to systematically investigate current predischarge occupational therapy home assessment visit practices in a rehabilitation ward of a regional Australian hospital. Methods: A retrospective chart audit was conducted over a 7 -month time period and included 227 patients discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation ward at the study hospital. Results: Fifty-five per cent of patients in the study sample received home assessment visits. At least one recommendation for change was made {{as a result of the}} visit for 99 % of those patients receiving visits. A total of 139 <b>visits</b> <b>were</b> completed and resulted in 1179 recommendations for change. The median number of recommendations made for the home assessment <b>visits</b> <b>was</b> 10 (range 0 – 33). The most common types of recommendations, timing of visits, persons present during the visit and documentation of <b>visits</b> <b>were</b> also investigated. Conclusion: Although occupational therapy home assessment <b>visits</b> <b>are</b> routinely completed, there is limited research available to provide evidence-based guidelines relating to predischarge occupational therapy home assessment visit practices. Recommendations for future practice and areas for further research into occupational therapy home assessment <b>visits</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
5|$|France was in {{constitutional}} crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris. Although {{moved by the}} death and destruction taking place around him, Etty felt {{that the purpose of}} his <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> to study paintings, and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets. On 31July he decided to abandon the trip; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp, he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre and set off for London.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the Warsaw Scientific Society {{offered her}} the {{directorship}} {{of a new}} laboratory in Warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing Radium Institute {{to be completed in}} August 1914, and on a new street named Rue Pierre-Curie. She visited Poland in 1913 and was welcomed in Warsaw but the <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> mostly ignored by the Russian authorities. The Institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the French Army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Raymond's {{office had}} {{accepted}} {{a commission to}} design a dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry, part of French India in southeast India. A preliminary site <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> made by George Nakashima and the schematic design was completed in 1936. Although Raymond had envisioned that the dormitory would be completed in six months, Sri Aurobindo was concerned that the noise of construction would disturb the ashram, so he decided that the building would be constructed by its residents.|$|E

The Beatles' interest in the Maharishi was led by George Harrison's commitment, and it changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of Transcendental Meditation.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1938, a {{state visit}} to France by the King and Queen was {{postponed}} {{for three weeks}} because {{of the death of}} the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Hawaii on 22 July, {{the ships}} next stopped at Auckland, Sydney, and Melbourne.

In this paper, I examine {{the effect of}} state visits on international trade.

5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed key {{positions}} in the public service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, suggested that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society {{could be attributed to}} the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing special trade agreements with Japan.|$|E

5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} before the shooting, the Israeli {{opposition}} leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the <b>visit</b> <b>was</b> provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} corporate site visits on analysts’ forecast accuracy based on a sample of such visits to Chinese listed firms during 2009 – 2012. We find that analysts who conduct visits (“visiting analysts”) have a greater increase in forecast accuracy than other analysts. Consistent {{with the notion that}} site visits facilitate analysts’ information acquisition through observing firms’ operations, we find that the results are stronger for manufacturing firms, firms with more tangible assets, and firms with more concentrated business lines. Moreover, we find that the effect of a site <b>visit</b> <b>is</b> greater when the site <b>visit</b> <b>is</b> an analyst-only <b>visit,</b> when the current <b>visit</b> <b>is</b> preceded by fewer visits, and when <b>visiting</b> analysts <b>are</b> based far from the visited firms. Furthermore, we find that site visits partially mitigate nonlocal analysts’ information disadvantage. Collectively, these results indicate that site <b>visits</b> <b>are</b> an important information acquisition activity for analysts. postprin...|$|R
