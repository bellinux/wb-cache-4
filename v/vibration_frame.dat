40|$|The {{feasibility}} of reducing <b>frame</b> <b>vibrations</b> in automotive vehicles with controlled hydraulic engine mounts is investigated. Only engine idle situations are considered. Two modes of control are studied: semi-active and active. A dynamic model is {{developed for the}} semi-active hydraulic mount. The model is verified experimentally through impedance measurements. Sensitivity studies reveal the effectiveness of various parameter control schemes. Experimental implementation of the semi-active hydraulic mounts on a commercial vehicle confirm their ability to reduce <b>frame</b> <b>vibration</b> levels at engine idle speeds. A simplified vehicle system model is used to investigate <b>frame</b> <b>vibration</b> control with active engine mounts. Closed-loop control designs using variations of the LQG control design method are evaluated through simulations.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceBill ZhangVibration {{has been}} a {{consideration}} in many types of structures, and as the advancement of technology has allowed steel and concrete sections to become lighter, vibration has {{become more of a}} consideration in the design of structures. This report focuses on occupant induced <b>vibration</b> of steel <b>framed</b> floors due to running as the vibration source. The history of vibration analysis and criteria in structures is discussed. However, lack of research and experimentation on running as the source of vibration exists; therefore, the history section focuses on walking as the source of vibration. The current design criteria for <b>vibration</b> of steel <b>framed</b> floors in the United States of America is the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Design Guide 11 : <b>Vibrations</b> of Steel <b>Framed</b> Structural Systems Due to Human Activity. This design guide discusses vibration due to walking, running, and rhythmic activities as well as gives design criteria for sensitive occupancies and sensitive equipment. In order to apply the Design Guide 11 analysis procedure for running as the source of vibration, the Kansas State University Chester E. Peters Recreation Complex is used as a case study. The recreation complex includes a 1 / 5 -mile running track that is supported by a composite steel framed floor. Based on the Design Guide 11 criterion, the running track is deemed acceptable. Lastly, this report discusses remedial procedures in the case of annoying floor vibration specific to floors that have running as a source of vibration. In addition, areas of further research are suggested where running is a source of <b>vibration</b> on steel <b>framed</b> floors...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{vibration}}, due to the natural vibration analysis of at-ground structure, {{the first and second}} frequency of vertical overall bend vibration is 32.9 and 62.4  Hz separately and at 88.2, 91.4, 97.2  Hz, there is <b>frame’s</b> local vertical <b>vibration.</b> So, the <b>vibration</b> peaks of <b>frame’s</b> center and bottom’s center are existed at this frequency. From the second vertical bend modal (62.4  Hz), the <b>frame’s</b> local vertical <b>vibration</b> modal appeared. So, before about 50  Hz, because of the overall vertical vibration of at-ground structure, the acceleration values of frame’s center and bottom’s center are nearly equal and between 50 and 100  Hz, and the acceleration of frame’s center is much bigger than bottom’s center acceleration based on the <b>frame’s</b> local vertical <b>vibration.</b> Therefore, the <b>frame’s</b> vertical <b>vibration</b> is high frequency (compared with the bottom’s vibration).|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple model of energy {{transfer}} {{in the course}} of ball milling in a vibrating frame device : the energy transferred per impact goes as the mass of the ball and the square of the amplitude and frequency of <b>vibration</b> of the <b>frame.</b> A reduction efficiency factor must be introduced, which depends on the ball rigidity with respect to that of the material being processed. The frequency of impact between the ball and the material goes as the amplitude and frequency of <b>vibration</b> of the <b>frame</b> and as the inverse of the terrestrial gravitation constant. For assessing the role of the above parameters in stabilizing metastable phases by ball milling, a new device has been built which allows to keep good vacuum during long time milling treatments. Preliminary results on Ni 10 Zr 7 point to the crucial role of the efficiency factor in reaching full amorphization. Under good vacuum, continuous foils of amorphous material can be obtained...|$|R

40|$|A moving linkage exerts {{fluctuating}} {{forces and}} moments on its supporting frame. One strategy {{to suppress the}} resulting <b>frame</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is to reduce the}} exciting forces and moments by adding counterweights to the linkage links. This paper develops a generic methodology to design such counterweights for planar linkages, based on formulating counterweight design as a second-order cone program. Second-order cone programs are convex, which implies that these nonlinear optimization problems have a global optimum that is guaranteed to be found in a numerically efficient manner. Two optimization criteria are considered: the <b>frame</b> <b>vibration</b> itself and the dynamic force transmitted to the machine floor. While the methodology is valid regardless of the complexity of the considered linkage, it is developed here for a literature bench-mark consisting of a crank-rocker four-bar linkage supported by a rigid, elastically mounted frame with three degrees of freedom. For this particular benchmark, the second-order cone program slightly improves the previously known optimum. Moreover, numerical comparison with current state-of-the-art algorithms for nonlinear optimization shows that our approach results in a substantial reduction of the required computational time...|$|R

50|$|Instead, if {{the engine}} is rigidly mounted to the <b>frame,</b> <b>vibrations</b> pass to and are {{dissipated}} via the whole frame, and the rider. Rigid mounting allows the engine {{to contribute to the}} overall stiffness of the frame. It also becomes possible to mount the swingarm directly to the engine rather than the frame, avoiding the need for frame members extending downward to the swingarm pivot. By increasing the number of mounting points between the engine and <b>frame,</b> <b>vibrations</b> and stress can be better dissipated in the frame, typically creating a triangle between the swingarm in the rear, the cylinder head at the top and the lower crankcase area at the front. If a rigidly mounted engine not only contributes to, but is critical to, the stiffness of the frame, and {{is an integral part of}} closing the triangle or trellis structure that transfers force from the headstock to the swingarm, to the point that without the engine the frame would be deformed, {{the engine is}} called a stressed member, or a lifted engine.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, {{comparing}} with the unfiltered curves, the 50 -Hz low-pass filter acceleration curves of frame’s center are little different with bottom’s center acceleration curves {{and both the}} curves (50 -Hz low-pass filter) have obviously three peaks (due to three Maglev train marshalings). So, although the frame’s center acceleration value is much bigger than bottom’s center acceleration value (unfiltered curves and time–history), it {{is caused by the}} <b>frame</b> local vertical <b>vibration</b> and the vibration is high frequency (more than 50  Hz). The different low-frequency vibration is little caused by the overall vertical vibration (less than 50  Hz). Due to the China’s <High-Speed Railway Design Standard>, the bridge’s limited value of vertical acceleration at ballast less track is 0.5  g considering the 20 -Hz low-pass filter. The limited filter value references the European Standard. Because the <b>vibration</b> of <b>frame</b> and bottom belongs to two different frequency domains, using the filter limited value (20 -Hz low-pass filter) to filter the vertical acceleration curves based on the China’s <High-Speed Railway Design Standard> is slightly unsuitable.|$|R

40|$|Simulating {{the dynamic}} {{response}} of trucks requires that a model be constructed {{and subjected to}} road inputs. Inclusion or omission of flexible frame effects is often based on intuition or assumption. If <b>frame</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is assumed to be}} sig-nificant, it is typically incorporated in one of two ways. Either a complex finite element model of the frame is used, or a simplified linear modal expansion model (which assumes small motions) is employed. The typical low-order modal expansion model, while computationally efficient and easier to use, is limited by the fact that 1) large rigid body mo-tions and road grade changes are not supported, and 2) longitudinal dynamics are not coupled to vertical and bounce dynamics. In this paper, a bond graph model is presented which includes coupled pitch and bounce motions, longitudi-nal dynamics, and transverse <b>frame</b> <b>vibration.</b> Large rigid body motions are allowed, onto which small flexible vibra-tions are superimposed. Frame flexibility is incorporated using modal expansion of a free-free beam. The model allows for a complete pitch-plane representation in which motive forces can propel the truck forward over varying terrain, in-cluding hills. The effect of frame flexibility on vehicle dynamics can then be studied. This is an extension of the typical half-car model in which suspension motion is assumed vertical, pitch angles are small, and longitudinal dynamics are completely decoupled or omitted. Model output shows the effect of frame flexibility on vehicle responses such as for-ward velocity, pitch angle, and payload acceleration.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{part of a}} dowel-type {{connection is}} the embedment of a steel dowel into the timber that surrounds it, and the stiffness of the timber in embedment {{is represented by the}} foundation modulus. A standard experimental method for identifying the foundation modulus under static load is modified to assess the secant stiffness exhibited under one-sided cyclic load. It is shown that the steady-state secant stiffness is significantly higher than the static stiffness under initial loading, and that, if the amplitude of the cyclic component of the load is sufficiently small, a simple analytical elastic model predicts the foundation modulus well. The analytical model is based on a complex stress function for the timber in embedment and the frictional interaction between the dowel and the timber. The foundation modulus calculated in this way can be used to predict the stiffness of complete connections for analysis of <b>vibration</b> in <b>frames</b> modelled with semi-rigid joints. Although the application of the model is limited to vibration about a non-zero mean load, with no load-sign reversal, this form of vibration encompasses various important types of in-service vibration of structures, such as that induced by turbulent wind or footfall...|$|R
