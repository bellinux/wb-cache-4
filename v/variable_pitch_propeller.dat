40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present a novel {{quaternion}} based control scheme for the attitude control problem of a quadrotor equipped with <b>Variable</b> <b>Pitch</b> <b>Propellers.</b> A quaternion is a hyper complex number of rank 4 that can be utilized to avoid the inherent geometrical singularity when representing rigid body dynamics with Euler angles or the complexity of having coupled differential equations with the Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM). In the presented approach the quadrotor's attitude model, <b>Variable</b> <b>Pitch</b> model and the proposed non-linear Proportional squared ($P^{ 2 }$) control algorithm have been implemented in the quaternion space, without any transformations nor calculations in the Euler angle space nor the DCM space. Throughout the thesis, {{the merits of the}} proposed novel approach are being analyzed and discussed, while the efficiency of the suggested novel quaternion based controller and the use of <b>Variable</b> <b>Pitch</b> <b>Propellers</b> are being evaluated by extended simulation and experimental results.

50|$|More {{distinct}} was the Maillet 21, a rebuild of {{the second}} Maillet 20 under construction in May 1935, with the pilot in the rearmost seat; this allowed the forward glazing to be lowered and faired smoothly into the forward fuselage. The pilot's seat was raised with a clear forward view through a small windscreen in a head-wide, faired, part glazed dorsal enclosure. A metal, <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>propeller</b> improved the take-off performance and the Maillet 21 was expected to clear a 30 m obstacle 600 m {{from the start of}} its run.

In plan the horizontal tail was elliptical, with a small cut out for movement of the curved rudder, which extended down to the keel.|$|E
50|$|The SR.N6 was piloted from a forward-seated {{position}} {{at the front of}} the main passenger cabin.

For navigation purposes, some SR.N6s were outfitted with onboard radar; multiple radar arrangements were used with the type, including pilots receiving radio guidance from on-shore radar operators in some circumstances.|$|E

In contrast to the popular quadrotor UAVs that can hover at a single attitude, the hexrotor presented in this paper is capable of hovering at any attitude provided that thrust is sufficiently large. A geometric controller is also developed on the special Euclidean group to track given desired position and attitude trajectories under the effects of unknown disturbances.
