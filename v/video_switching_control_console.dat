50|$|Bridge-O-Rama was {{a system}} of {{electro-mechanical}} display boards on which an audience could view {{a representation of the}} bidding and play of hands at high-level contract bridge tournaments. Developed in Italy and first used in the World Championships at the Bermuda Bowl in 1958, representations of the actual playing cards in each hand were arranged in frames on the display and were able to be lighted from behind as play progressed. The lighting was operated by a number of <b>switches</b> at a <b>control</b> <b>console</b> wired to the displays.|$|R
5000|$|The 704 itself {{came with}} a <b>control</b> <b>console</b> which has 36 {{assorted}} <b>control</b> <b>switches</b> or buttons and 36 data input switches, one for each bit in a register. The <b>control</b> <b>console</b> essentially allows only setting the binary values of the registers with switches and seeing the binary state of the registers displayed {{in the pattern of}} many small neon tubes, appearing much like modern LEDs. For human interaction with the computer, programs would be entered on punched cards initially rather than at the console, and human-readable output would be directed to the printer.|$|R
