And {{while he is}} very quiet, reserved, and a bit morbid at times, he quietly begins to develop feelings for Hikari and is unable to express this feelings only through his music. While Hikari does not see this, she will find herself in a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> when she discovers that she also has feelings for him. And while a bit naïve and carefree at the beginning story, Hikari will gain in maturity throughout the manga series and find her comfort from all her emotional turmoil through rhythmic gymnastics.|$|E
25|$|In March 1643, Ormonde ventured {{his troops}} to New Ross, {{deep in the}} {{territory}} of the Catholic Confederation, and won a small but indecisive victory there (Battle of New Ross) before returning to Dublin. Nevertheless, Ormonde was in a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>situation.</b> The Confederates held two thirds of the island. The English Civil War, started in September 1642, had removed the prospect of more reinforcements from England and indeed the king desired to recall troops. In addition the Scots Covenanters, who had landed an army in the northeast of Ireland at Carrickfergus to counter the Catholic rebellion {{in that part of the}} country in early 1642, had subsequently put northeast Ireland on the side of the English Parliamentarians against the king; and the relatively strong Protestant presence in and around Derry and Cork City was inclined to side with the Parliamentarians as well, and soon did so.|$|E

500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>situation</b> to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

Rarely, the occipital artery has to be sacrificed if spasm cannot be induced or is short living, following which particles can be injected from a distance without entering the mastoid foramen. Occluding the occipital artery proximally has no effect on distal perfusion, as collaterals and anastomoses from superficial temporal artery, posterior auricular artery, and opposite occipital artery take over the supply...|$|R
