50|$|Modern {{vehicles}} now use {{the compact}} alternator layout. This is electrically and magnetically similar, but has improved air cooling. Better cooling permits more power from a smaller machine. The casing has distinctive radial <b>vent</b> <b>slots</b> {{at each end}} and now encloses the fan. Two fans are used, one at each end, and the airflow is semi-radial, entering axially and leaving radially outwards. The stator windings now consist of a dense central band where the iron core and copper windings are tightly packed, and end bands where the windings are more exposed for better heat transfer. The closer core spacing from the rotor improves magnetic efficiency. The smaller, enclosed fans produce less noise, particularly at higher machine speeds.|$|R
50|$|Clay grain {{stores were}} found {{in many parts of}} Europe but not in the south or east. The Laimes were {{distinctive}} for a number of reasons. They were uniquely positioned (with some exceptions), outside of a walled farmhouse courtyard, on the public road front. In Rozumice they were formed with split logs that were daubed with clay and straw only on the outside, no openings other than metal grille protected <b>vent</b> <b>slots</b> at high level. Some six to eight metres high, originally roofed in wood shingle but due to fire hazard were replaced later with fixed stone slates. The lower floor was raised off the ground on stone pillars. Bins were positioned to hold the animal feed grain and grain for the family flour. Hams and Speck were hung from the roof.|$|R

3000|$|Dental {{implants}} {{do exist}} with various geometries, different lengths and diameters, and features, such as, pits, pores, <b>vents,</b> and <b>slots.</b> Essentially, a highly rough surface produces better initial stability and anchorage. Moreover, a rough {{surface with a}} larger surface area facilitates particles exchange between the implant and surrounding tissues. It could be concluded that such coatings with an increased surface area could have better clinical performance [35]. This developed electro-deposition process, can be applied  to deposit a nano-HA-Zr coating to complex implant surfaces and thus increases their surface area, surface roughness, initial stability and clinical performance.|$|R
40|$|This {{final test}} report {{presents}} the results obtained during the static hot firing and cold-gas high Q tests of the first Transient Pressure Test Article (TPTA) 1. 1. The TPTA consisted of field test joints A and B, which were the original RSRM J-insulation configuration, with a metal capture feature. It also consisted of a flight configuration nozzle-to-case test joint (Joint D) with shorter <b>vent</b> <b>slots.</b> Fluorocarbon O-rings were used in all the test joints. The purpose of the TPTA tests is to evaluate and characterize the RSMR field and nozzle-to-case joints {{under the influence of}} ignition and strut loads during liftoff anf high Q. All objectives of the cold-gas high Q (TPTA 1. 1 A) test were met and all measurements were close to predicted values. During the static hot-firing test (TPTA 1. 1), the motor was inadvertently plugged by the quench injector plug, making it a more severe test, although no strut loads were applied. The motor was depressurized after approximately 11 min using an auxiliary system, and no anomalies were noted. In the static hot-firing test, pressure was incident on the insulation and the test joint gaps were within the predicted range. During the static hot-firing test, no strut loads were applied because the loading system malfunctioned. For this test, all measurements were within range of similar tests performed without strut loads...|$|R
5000|$|The RCA TK-40 is {{considered}} to be the first color television camera, initially used for special broadcasts in late 1953, and with the follow-on TK-40A actually becoming the first to be produced in quantity in March 1954. The TK-40 was produced by RCA Broadcast to showcase the new compatible color system for NTSC - eventually named NTSC-M or simply M - which the company is credited with inventing (though several other companies including Philco were involved in development). Color had been attempted many times before, often in a semi-mechanical fashion, {{but this was the first}} series of practical, fully electronic cameras to go into widespread production.The camera was quickly followed with the TK-41, a line that shared a very similar shape, but featured streamlined and enhanced electronic subsystems. Earlier TK-40s are distinguished by the lack of <b>venting</b> <b>slots</b> on the sides (the cameras were prone to overheating, necessitating the addition of these openings). The last variation of the TK-41 was the TK-41C, released circa 1960. The cameras are considered to have been of very good quality, better than the very different TK-42 which succeeded the TK-40/41, and probably better than anything produced by RCA for several years after the production line shut down (NBC didn't fully replace their TK-41s in Rockefeller Center or their Burbank, California broadcast facility until the release of the TK-44A around 1968). Prior development in the late 1940s and early 1950s had included the TK-X (for [...] "experimental").|$|R
50|$|Muzzle brakes {{are simple}} in concept, {{such as the}} one {{employed}} on the 90 mm M3 gun used on the M47 Patton tank. This consists of a small length of tubing mounted at right angles {{to the end of the}} barrel. Brakes most often utilize <b>slots,</b> <b>vents,</b> holes, baffles, and similar devices. The strategy of a muzzle brake is to redirect and control the burst of combustion gases that follows the departure of a projectile.|$|R

Data have been taken in an impedance tube, modified to accommodate an average flow, and in a resonance tube. Results are given for the influence of flow through a subsonic exhaust vent on an acoustic field. Measurements for circular and <b>slot</b> <b>vents</b> of several sizes and for two frequencies show that the flow through the vent causes a transfer of energy from the average flow field to the acoustic field: The vent acts as a source or gain of acoustic energy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of interactions between acoustic waves and a non-uniform steady flow field. Data {{have been obtained}} for a resonance tube having a vent at the center in the lateral boundary, an average flow being introduced at the ends. Experiments have been done for both circular and <b>slot</b> <b>vents,</b> over ranges of both frequency and Mach number. According to the one-dimensional linear stability analysis, the interactions between the longitudinal acoustic field and the mean flow {{in the vicinity of}} the vent cause a net transfer of acoustic energy from the average flow to the acoustic field. This result has been verified by the experiments reported here. The gain of energy measured is less than that deduced from a one-dimensional analysis...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) {{has been}} used to study the surface composition and chemistry of Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) exposed materials including silvered Teflon (Ag/FEP), Kapton, S 13 GLO paint, quartz crystal monitors (QCM's), carbon fiber/organic matrix composites, and carbon fiber/Al Alloy composites. In each set of samples, silicones were the major contributors to the molecular film accumulated on the LDEF exposed surfaces. All surfaces analyzed have been contaminated with Si, O, and C; most have low levels (less than 1 atom percent) of N, S, and F. Occasionally observed contaminants included Cl, Na, K, P, and various metals. Orange/brown discoloration observed near <b>vent</b> <b>slots</b> in some Ag/FEP blankets were higher in carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen relative to other contamination types. The source of contamination has not been identified, but amine/amide functionalities were detected. It is probable that this same source of contamination account for the low levels of sulfur and nitrogen observed on most LDEF exposed surfaces. XPS, which probes 50 to 100 A in depth, detected the major sample components underneath the contaminant film in every analysis. This probably indicates that the contaminant overlayer is patchy, with significant areas covered by less that 100 A of molecular film. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of LDEF exposed surfaces during secondary electron microscopy (SEM) of the samples confirmed contamination of the surfaces with Si and O. In general, particulates were not observed to develop from the contaminant overlayer on the exposed LDEF material surfaces. However, many SiO 2 submicron particles were seen on a masked edge of an Ag/FEP blanket. In some cases such as the carbon fiber/organic matrix composites, interpretation of the contamination data was hindered by the lack of good laboratory controls. Examination of laboratory controls for the carbon fiber/Al alloy composites showed that preflight contamination was the most significant factor for all the contaminants generally detected at less than 1 atom percent, or detected only occasionally (i. e., all but Si, O, and C). Flight control surfaces, including sample backsides not exposed to space radiation or atomic oxygen flux, have accumulated some contamination on flight (compared to laboratory controls), but experimentally, the LDEF exposed surface contamination levels are generally higher for the contaminants Si and O. For most materials analyzed, Si contamination levels were higher on the leading edge surfaces than on the trailing edge surfaces. This was true even for the composite samples where considerable atomic oxygen erosion of the leading edge surfaces was observed by SEM. It is probable that the return flux associated with atmospheric backscatter resulted in enhanced deposition of silicones and other contaminants on the leading edge flight surfaces relative to the trailing edge. Although the Si concentration data suggested greater on-flight deposition of contaminants on the leading edge surfaces, the XPS analyses did not conclusively show different relative total thicknesses of flight deposited contamination for leading and trailing edge surfaces. It is possible that atomic oxygen reactions on the leading edge resulted in greater volatilization of the carbon component of the deposited silicones, effectively 'thinning' the leading edge deposited overlayer. Unlike other materials, exposed polymers such as Kapton and FEP-type Teflon had very low contamination on the leading edge surfaces. SEM evidence showed that undercutting of the contaminant overlayer and damaged polymer layers occurred during atomic oxygen erosion, which would enhance loss of material from the exposed surface...|$|R
40|$|Data were {{obtained}} for a resonance tube having a vent at the center in the lateral boundary, an average flow being introduced at the ends. Experiments were done for both circular and <b>slot</b> <b>vents,</b> over ranges of both frequency and Mach number. It was demonstrated that a subsonic exhaust vent in the lateral boundary of a cold flow resonance tube provides a gain of acoustic energy for the fundamental mode within the resonance tube. The gain of acoustic energy increases approximately linearly with the Mach number, as predicted by the one-dimensional analysis. The one-dimensional result gives the values for the slope representing the variation of the attenuation coefficient of the exhaust vent {{with respect to the}} average Mach number of the flow within roughly 30 % of those measured. It has been verified that the subsonic vent produces a gain proportional to the average Mach number, proportional to the frequency, and independent of the shape. The results may be applicable to the study of vibration phenomena in solid propellant rocket engines...|$|R
40|$|Bicycle helmet is {{a useful}} {{personal}} device for protecting bicyclist's head and brain during accidents. Nowadays most bicycle helmets are made of polymer foams such as expended polyurethane and expended polystyrene. The current polymer foams used mostly have closed cells structure, resulting in poor ventilation. This can only be improved by adding the ventilation <b>slots</b> (<b>vents),</b> {{with the cost of}} the reduction in the impact protection. A research project concentrating on the impact strength, the effectiveness of the ventilation and the selection of alternative materials had been conducted for two years. This thesis summarizes the investigation results of the project. Polymer foam has been widely used in bicycle helmets as an efficient energy-absorption material. This study examines the energy-absorbing capacity and various failure modes of polymer foam laminated structure by a series of static and impact experiments using both MTS and Dynatup 8250. When a head is subjected to an impact, violent force and moment caused by sudden deceleration of the head are applied to the brain. Wearing a helmet substantially reduces the risk of head injury in a crash. Therefore, the highest head acceleration, the energy-absorbing capacity and the failure analysis of bicycle helmets under specially designed Impact Test Rig have been studied on various anvils. To improve the design of bicycle helmets, a mechanics model has been proposed which is capable of estimating the acceleration - time curve and predicting the energy absorbed by the bicycle helmet. The predictions have shown good agreement with the experimental measurements. Based on our experimental studies and modeling, some improvements in the alternative selection of materials has also been suggested. It has been found that the grid-domed textile composites possess outstanding impact energy-absorption capacity and good ventilation. This has raised a possibility of employing this new type of material as the cushioning layer (i. e. liner) in bicycle helmets of new generation...|$|R
40|$|The {{climate in}} {{southern}} coastal British Columbia (BC) {{is characterized by}} a long rainy winter. Building envelope failures that have occurred in recent years in this region promoted the adoption of the rainscreen principle in both rehabilitation and new construction and are now mandatory in the wet regions of Be. In addition to the functions of a capillary break and drainage, drying in an air cavity behind the cladding of the rainscreen wall system may occur through cavity ventilation. Current practice varies in terms of cavity depth and vent heights for rainscreen walls clad with panel systems, especially with respect to the top <b>slot</b> <b>vents.</b> The awareness of potential drying provided by cavity ventilation initiated the idea of providing top vents on brick veneer walls recently in the BC construction industry. However, there exist different views on the drying provided by cavity ventilation based on existing research. Whether cavity ventilation would be beneficial for this climate remained open for discussion. To answer this question, a comprehensive research program was designed by Dr. Hua Ge with the candidate using a two-storey building envelope test facility at British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) which Dr. Hua Ge developed. The candidate investigated twelve wall specimens, six clad with brick veneer and six clad with fibre cement panels, installed on the southeast façade, which faced the prevailing wind-driven rain direction. The test variables include cladding type, air cavity depth and height, vent configurations and initial moisture load in plywood sheathing to evaluate the impact of cavity ventilation on the drying and wetting of test walls. The hygrothermal conditions across the wall assemblies were monitored for moisture content (both resistive and gravimetric), temperature, relative humidity, air speed in the cavity and pressure differentials between top and bottom of each cavity. The on-site weather conditions were measured including wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, horizontal rainfall, and wind-driven rain. Indoor conditions were controlled at 22 ± 1 °C and 55 ± 5 % RH In this study, the drying and wetting rates of plywood sheathing in the test walls during the winter and spring seasons were quantified, under-cooling effects on the temperature of cavity-surfaces of claddings and plywood sheathing were analyzed and the daily hours of condensation on the cavity-surface of claddings for all test walls were calculated. Simulation and measurements of MC in plywood sheathing for two brick veneer walls and two fibre cement walls were compared...|$|R
