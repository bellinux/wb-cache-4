Substance abuse impedes the productivity {{of the labor force}} and reduces economic growth. Workers are either nonusers and therefore fully productive, a number of whom are employed by the government in drug-control activities, or users who are only partially productive. Efficient management of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s portfolio of workers involves eradicating drug use when initial <b>user</b> <b>numbers</b> are lower than a critical level, but allows <b>user</b> <b>numbers</b> to rise to, and be accommodated at, a stationary level when initial <b>user</b> <b>numbers</b> exceed a critical level...|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous {{networks}} (HetNets) give users {{the opportunity}} to access different access points(APs), which will simultaneously affect user performance and system performance, so user association in HetNets plays {{a critical role in}} enhancing the load balancing and the system sum-throughput of networks. Meanwhile, the incremental sum-throughput currently fails to meet the escalating data demands. Besides, ensuring fairness amongst users constitutes another urgent issue in the radio resource management (RRM) of HetNets. What is more, few works consider the maximum service <b>user</b> <b>number</b> constraint in femtocell access points (FAPs). To solve the aforementioned problem, this paper associates users to APs by considering system sum-throughput and fairness {{at the same time in}} HetNets under a maximum service <b>user</b> <b>number</b> constraint of FAPs; accordingly, the user association problem is formulated. By releasing constraint, the optimal user association algorithm is obtained by Lagrangian function, and based on this optimal solution, a low complexity suboptimal user association algorithm is proposed. At last, this paper investigates the relationship between system sum-throughput and maximum service <b>user</b> <b>number</b> of FAPs. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can improve sum-throughput and fairness at the same time at a specific maximum service <b>user</b> <b>number</b> of FAPs...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} on non-cooperative multiuser multiple-input multiple-output with space-time block code (MIMO-STBC) communication systems is a challenging and important task.

We consider both problems jointly as a multiple hypothesis testing problem. Based on this idea, we propose a joint modulation classification and <b>user</b> <b>number</b> detection algorithm for the multiuser MIMO-STBC systems. The proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the propagation channel or noise power, and thus might be suitable for the non-cooperative scenario.

However, website administrators who can track unique user traffic {{over a longer period}} of time can build up a reliable view on their performance against direct competitors within the sector.
