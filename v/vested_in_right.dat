50|$|A {{third-party}} beneficiary only acquires a {{right of}} action to enforce his benefit once he has accepted the benefit provided for in the contract. Under the South African interpretation, however, prior to formal acceptance of the benefit, the third-party beneficiary only has a spes, or expectation; in other words, {{he does not have}} the right to accept, but rather a mere competency. Acceptance may also be a suspensive condition in certain contracts. Under Scots law, acceptance is not necessary to be <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> a <b>right</b> of action, but is necessary to be liable. Before acceptance, however, the ius quaesitum tertio is tenuous so that acceptance of a benefit does not create a right, but rather entrenches that <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> either case, the contracting parties may vary or rescind the contract until acceptance or reliance.|$|R

40|$|This Essay {{addresses}} {{this question}} {{in the context of}} the evolving status of indigenous peoples in international law. International instruments <b>vest</b> <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> indigenous peoples, and establish indigenous peoples as international legal actors to whom States and other international legal actors owe legal duties and obligations. These developments began between the First and Second World Wars, when the International Labour Organization (ILO) began to supervise indigenous working conditions in colonies. They continued after the Second World War with ILO Conventions No. 107 and 169, which <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> indigenous populations located in States that are a party to their terms. More recently, the U. N. General Assembly enacted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which declares that indigenous peoples possess a wide array of rights, including the right to self-determination. It affirms the international legal existence of indigenous peoples by recognizing them as legal subjects, and it renders international law applicable to their relations with States. Some of these international instruments, such as conventions adopted by the ILO, legally bind States that are a party to their terms. Others, like the U. N. Declaration, do not, strictly speaking, legally bind international legal actors, but they nonetheless have diffuse legal consequences for the development of both international and domestic law...|$|R

50|$|The {{funds were}} being {{distributed}} to redress the breach of a tribal land treaty and appellee alleged that its exclusion violated its equal protection {{rights under the}} Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The district court rendered judgment in favor of appellee and enjoined further distributions. The appellate court affirmed and appellants sought review. The Court reversed, ruling that Congress' omission of appellee from the distribution did not offend due process and was tied rationally to the fulfillment of Congress' unique obligation toward the Indians. Appellee was not a recognized tribal entity; it was simply individual Indians with no <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> <b>in</b> any tribal property. The statute distributed tribal, not individually owned, property. Appellee had previously been excluded from a distribution of tribal assets. Congress deliberately limited the distribution under the statute to avoid problems that might attend a wider distribution.|$|R

Several questions arise: Does the acquisition of a new nationality imply the loss of the European citizenship? Are there any <b>vested</b> <b>rights?</b> <b>In</b> case these <b>rights</b> are lost, since when? In order to address these questions, we will analyse the link between European citizenship and nationality, as well as the consequences on citizenship if Catalonia secedes from Spain. This study will take into account the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union defending its competence to ensure compliance with European citizenship according to EU law. Two additional questions follow from this analysis: firstly the obligation to negotiate in case of secession, and secondly the possibility that the European citizenship has gone a step further evolving to a new concept. The result of the referendum in the UK adds a new scenario which is also contemplated...|$|R
