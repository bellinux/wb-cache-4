50|$|In November 1976, WBLF {{was granted}} {{permission}} to double its daytime power to one thousand watts. In 1989, {{the station was}} granted limited nighttime power of 61 watts, which allowed it {{to remain on the}} air 24 hours if desired. The station was sold by Allegheny Mountain Network to Clark-Richards Broadcasting for $105,000 in April 1993, and studios were moved to 751 <b>S.</b> <b>Eagle</b> Valley Road in Bellefonte. The station was sold again to Citadel Communications Corporation in May 1997, and then changed hands again in September 1999 as it was sold to Marathon Media, and studios again were moved, this time to 160 Clearview Avenue in State College. This ownership was also short-lived, as the station was sold to Dame Broadcasting in March 2000. Independent programming for WBLF was abandoned, with the station rebroadcasting new AM sister station WRSC, which was the news/talk/sports station for the State College market.|$|R

50|$|The crested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird of prey}} that is found in forested habitats across tropical Asia. Within its widespread range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia, there are considerable variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> holospila), Andaman serpent <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> elgini) and South Nicobar serpent <b>eagle</b> (<b>S.</b> klossi) were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle. All members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers {{on the back of}} the head giving them a maned and crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the ceres while the powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and tail have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the Circaetus snake-eagles in the subfamily Circaetinae.|$|R

40|$|A fossil deposit {{excavated}} {{from the}} floor of Kids Cave, West Coast, South Island, New Zealand, is interpreted as having been primarily accumulated by New Zealand falcon Falco novaeseelandiae, with some contribution by Haast 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eagle</b> Harpagornis moorei. The fauna is rich: 3699 bones represented 41 bird species, two frog species, unspecified geckoes and skinks, and one bat species. Fossil deposition was mainly within the Last Glacial Maximum from about 22, 000 cal yr bp to about 15, 000 cal yr bp, with a marked change in sediment characteristics {{at the onset of the}} LGM 2 ̆ 7 s coldest period. Chronological control is given by three Uranium-series dates for a speleothem and radiocarbon AMS dating of four avian eggshell samples and one bone. The fauna is the first extensive predator accumulation of LGM age described from the West Coast of the South Island, and it indicates a palaeoenvironment of a mosaic of shrublands with forest patches. The onset of the coldest part of the LGM (Aurora 3 glacial advance, 19, 500 - 19, 000 cal yrs bp) saw marked climate cooling/drying affecting the site, but the avifauna indicates that although open-country taxa became more common in this period, some forest persisted nearby throughout the remainder of the LGM...|$|R
