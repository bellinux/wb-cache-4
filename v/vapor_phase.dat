25|$|The {{pervaporation}} method uses a membrane {{that is more}} permeable to the one constituent than {{to another}} to separate the constituents of an azeotrope as it passes from liquid to <b>vapor</b> <b>phase.</b> The membrane is rigged to lie between the liquid and vapor phases. Another membrane method is vapor permeation, where the constituents pass through the membrane entirely in the <b>vapor</b> <b>phase.</b> In all membrane methods, the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a permeate (that which passes through) and a retentate (that which is left behind). When the membrane is chosen so that is it more permeable to one constituent than another, then the permeate will be richer in that first constituent than the retentate.|$|E
25|$|Saturation {{temperature}} means boiling point. The {{saturation temperature}} is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure {{at which a}} liquid boils into its <b>vapor</b> <b>phase.</b> The liquid {{can be said to}} be saturated with thermal energy.

25|$|If the {{pressure}} in a system remains constant (isobaric), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy (heat) is removed.

Empirical and theoretical approaches agreed to highlight that PMMA modified with monophosphonated comonomer is more efficient in both condensed and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases</b> in terms of flammability and char formation. These results were attributed to the ability of phosphonate groups to interact with ester groups and also to the weakness of the P-C-N bonds.

40|$|Fuel injection, vaporization, {{and mixing}} {{results in an}} {{extremely}} complex multiphase flow field that requires extensive experimental study in order to correctly characterize the behavior of combustion systems. Accurately measuring the mass fraction and volume distribution of liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases</b> has been a particularly challenging task. Previous experiments have over predicted local measurements of mole fraction at the interface between regions of liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases.</b> Increasing our knowledge and understanding in this area has great potential for addressing essential requirements {{for the improvement of}} combustor and engine design such as reducing emissions, increasing fuel efficiency, and boosting performance. The goal of the current work is to develop a diagnostic strategy that is able to successfully discriminate between the liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases.</b> Laser-induced fluorescence is employed to perform in situ measurements without disturbing the underlying physics of the flow. However, the photophysics of ketones—such as acetone—and aromatic hydrocarbons that are commonly found in fuels are drastically different. A dissimilarity between these two classes of fluorescing molecules that may prove to be a key component in liquid-vapor discrimination is their response to oxygen, and the ensuing effects of collisional quenching. Experiments were performed at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base investigating the effects of oxygen when present in the surrounding environment as well as when the fuel had been purged with various quantities of oxygen via a technique called sparging. Results are briefly discussed and recommendations for future work are presented...|$|R

25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its <b>vapor</b> <b>phase</b> and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present. Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4% by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} method of {{measuring}} amino acid hydrophobicity is partitioning between two immiscible liquid phases. Different organic solvents are {{most widely used}} to mimic the protein interior. However, organic solvents are slightly miscible with water and the characteristics of both phases change {{making it difficult to}} obtain pure hydrophobicity scale. Nozaki and Tanford proposed the first major hydrophobicity scale for nine amino acids. Ethanol and dioxane are used as the organic solvents and the free energy of transfer of each amino acid was calculated. Non liquid phases can also be used with partitioning methods such as micellar <b>phases</b> and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases.</b> Two scales have been developed using micellar phases. Fendler et al. measured the partitioning of 14 radiolabeled amino acids using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles. Also, amino acid side chain affinity for water was measured using <b>vapor</b> <b>phases.</b> <b>Vapor</b> <b>phases</b> represent the simplest non polar phases, because it has no interaction with the solute. The hydration potential and its correlation to the appearance of amino acids on the surface of proteins was studied by Wolfenden. Aqueous and polymer phases were used {{in the development of a}} novel partitioning scale. Partitioning methods have many drawbacks. First, it is difficult to mimic the protein interior. In addition, the role of self solvation makes using free amino acids very difficult. Moreover, hydrogen bonds that are lost in the transfer to organic solvents are not reformed but often in the interior of protein.|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} the phenomena of flashing fluid flow in small diameter tubes (on {{the order of}} 1 mm). Small diameter tubing is often used as the expansion device in refrigeration systems. Tubing used as a refrigeration system expansion device {{is referred to as}} capillary tubing; however, these tubes exhibit no appreciable capillarity behavior. Experimental test have shown capillary-tube flow behaves as any other conduit flow. Emphasis of this study is placed on refrigeration applications to facilitate ~e use of the proposed model for capillary-tube modeling. A review of the literature shows that capillary-tube modeling has changed little over the past 40 years. The two-phase flow models used in the fIrst capillary-tube models were homogeneous models. Homogeneous-flow models are still used almost exclusively today. Experimental evidence shows, however, that the two-phase flow in capillary tubes is not entirely homogeneous. The liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases</b> are substantially removed from equilibrium at the inception of vaporization and near the capillary-tube exit. A model that accounts for the interaction between the liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases</b> is required for accurate modeling. A model is presented that treats the liquid and <b>vapor</b> <b>phases</b> separately. In this way, the effect of phase nonequilibrium can be included in the model. The model is developed so that it will simplify to the homogeneous model as the phases approach equilibrium. Once the model is developed, a discussion is given outlining the application of the model to capillary-tube optimization models, as well as to refrigeration system models.

25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} shows a {{negative}} azeotrope of ideal constituents, X and Y. Again the bottom trace illustrates the boiling temperature at various compositions, and again, below the bottom trace the mixture must be entirely liquid phase. The top trace again illustrates the condensation temperature of various compositions, and again, above the top trace the mixture must be entirely <b>vapor</b> <b>phase.</b> The point, A, shown here is a boiling point with a composition chosen very near to the azeotrope. The vapor is collected at the same temperature at point B. That vapor is cooled, condensed, and collected at point C. Because this example is a negative azeotrope rather than a positive one, the distillate is farther from the azeotrope than the original liquid mixture at point A was. So the distillate is poorer in constituent X and richer in constituent Y than the original mixture. Because this process has removed a greater fraction of Y from the liquid than it had originally, the residue must be poorer in Y and richer in X after distillation than before.|$|E
25|$|Azeotropes {{can form}} {{only when a}} mixture {{deviates}} from Raoult's law. Raoult's law applies when the molecules of the constituents stick to each other {{to the same degree}} as they do to themselves. For example, if the constituents are X and Y, then X sticks to Y with roughly equal energy as X does with X and Y does with Y. A positive deviation from Raoult's law results when the constituents have a disaffinity for each other – that is X sticks to X and Y to Y better than X sticks to Y. Because this results in the mixture having less total sticking together of the molecules than the pure constituents, they more readily escape from the stuck-together phase, which is to say the liquid phase, and into the <b>vapor</b> <b>phase.</b> When X sticks to Y more aggressively than X does to X and Y does to Y, the result is a negative deviation from Raoult's law. In this case because there is more sticking together of the molecules in the mixture than in the pure constituents, they are more reluctant to escape the stuck-together liquid phase.|$|E
