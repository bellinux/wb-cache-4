40|$|Integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} in a new, future fleet-management paradigm where a conscious effort is made to shift aircraft maintenance from a schedule-based approach to a more proactive and predictive approach (that is, condition-based maintenance). Its goal is to maximize fleet operational availability while minimizing the logistics footprint through monitoring of the deterioration of equipment conditions. A comprehensive integrated vehicle health-management system will be executed {{in an environment that}} includes different sensor technologies, multiple information systems, and different data models. Integrated vehicle healthmanagement implementers have to therefore deal with an integration problem that involves different specialized algorithms and embedded hardware platforms. Integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> applications will have common execution logic, and many will share the same data-processing algorithms; hence, development productivity and the quality of integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> applications can be increased through reusable software building blocks and algorithm libraries or, in particular, by using a software development framework. This paper presents an approach to distributed integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> systems that offers reusable software architecture for a class of integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> applications. The focus of this paper deals with an open software framework for development of integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> applications stemming from the open system architecture for a condition-based maintenance specification, which is an architecture-promoting interoperability and a component framework that enables reuse, data-process partitioning, configuration, and rapid prototyping. The framework is developed using Java and Internet communications engines' distributed middleware, and its application is demonstrated through a gearbox health-monitoring system, where the integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> software is deployed on the distributed embedded devices. This approach provides software-enabled capability to distribute/reconfigure the integrated <b>vehicle</b> health <b>management</b> data process (through the open system architecture for condition-based maintenance common interface and data model) across the hardware platforms to meet the given system configuration. The performance evaluation for the test example shows negligible overhead in the central processing unit, band width, and latency when using the framework...|$|R
