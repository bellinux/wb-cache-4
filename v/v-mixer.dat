40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the mixing process of free flowing polymers binary mixtures at different densities and colors in two different mixers, namely the bubbling fluidized bed and <b>V-mixer.</b>   The mixing of solids was studied by analyzing the variation of the proportions of the marked particles with time and position in the bed or in the mixer. The variation of mixture composition based on the samples was incorporated into Lacey mixing index which describes the degree of mixing of the particles at particular time. The performance and the mixing behavior in these two mixers were also presented. Results showed that gas velocity and bed depth were important parameters influencing solids mixing in a bubbling fluidized bed. While the rotation speeds and filled up levels were proved as important parameters in influencing the solids mixing in <b>V-mixer.</b> From the results, complete mixings were attained at a bed depth of 17 cm and gas velocity of 1. 38 Umf in the fluidized bed and 40 % filled up level and 40 rpm in the <b>V-mixer.</b> From the energy consumption point of view, it was found that the fluidized bed mixer offers the most efficient and economical process compared to <b>V-mixer.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} an {{experimental}} study of mixing process of free flowing polymers binary mixtures at different densities and colours in three mixers was investigated. The state of mixing of solids was studied by analysing the variation of the proportions of the marked particles with time and position in the bed or in the mixer. The variation of mixture composition based on the samples was incorporated into Lacey mixing index which describes the degree of mixing of the particles at particular time. This method enables assessment of the overall mixing behaviour {{in terms of the}} rate of mixing (through estimation of the time required for the mixing index to increase from zero to a certain value), together with the degree of mixing at the mixing equilibrium. Results showed that gas velocity and bed depth are important parameters influencing solids mixing in a bubbling fluidised bed. Whilst it was observed that the rotation speeds and filled up levels are important parameters influencing solids mixing in <b>V-mixer</b> and Nauta-mixer. From the results, complete mixing was attained at a bed depth of 17 cm and gas velocity of 1. 38 U mf in the fluidised bed; 40 % filled up level and 40 rpm in the <b>V-mixer</b> and 50 % filled up level and 5 rpm in the Nauta-mixer. From the energy consumption analysis made, it was found that a fluidised bed mixer offers the most efficient and economical process compared to the <b>V-mixer</b> and Nauta-mixer...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} for disposition using an electrometallurgical technique results in two high-level waste forms: a ceramic waste form (CWF) and a metal waste form. Reactive metal fuel constituents, including all the transuranic metals {{and the majority of}} the fission products remain in the salt as chlorides and are processed into the CWF. The solidified salt is containerized and transferred to the CWF process where it is ground in an argon atmosphere. Zeolite 4 A is ground and then dried in a mechanically-fluidized dryer. The salt and zeolite are mixed in a <b>V-mixer</b> and heated to 500 °C to occlude the salt into the structure of the zeolite. The salt-loaded zeolite is cooled, mixed with borosilicate glass frit, and transferred to a crucible, which is placed in a furnace and heated to 925 °C. During this process, known as pressureless consolidation, the zeolite is converted to the final sodalite form and the glass thoroughly encapsulates the sodalite, producing a dense, leach-resistant final waste form...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} for disposition using an electrometallurgical technique results in two high-level waste forms: a ceramic waste form (CWF) and a metal waste form (MWF). The CWF is a composite of sodalite and glass, which stabilizes the active fission products (alkali, alkaline earths, and rare earths) and transuranic (TRU) elements. Reactive metal fuel constituents, including all the TRU metals {{and the majority of}} the fission products remain in the salt as chlorides and are processed into the CWF. The solidified salt is containerized and transferred to the CWF process where it is ground in an argon atmosphere. Zeolite 4 A is dried in a mechanically-fluidized dryer to about 0. 1 wt% moisture and ground to a particle-size range of 45 µ to 250 µ. The salt and zeolite are mixed in a <b>V-mixer</b> and heated to 500 °C for about 18 hours. During this process, the salt occludes into the structure of the zeolite. The salt-loaded zeolite (SLZ) is cooled and then mixed with borosilicate glass frit with a comparable particle-size range. The SLZ/glass mixture is transferred to a crucible, which is placed in a furnace and heated to 925 °C. During this process, known as pressureless consolidation, the zeolite is converted to the final sodalite form and the glass thoroughly encapsulates the sodalite, producing a dense, leach-resistant final waste form. During the last several years, changes have occurred to the process, including: particle size of input materials and conversion from hot isostatic pressing to pressureless consolidation, This paper is intended to provide the current status of the CWF process focusing on the adaptation to pressureless consolidation. Discussions will include impacts of particle size on final waste form and the pressureless consolidation cycle. A model will be presented that shows the heating and cooling cycles and the effect of radioactive decay heat on the amount of fission products that can be incorporated into the CWF...|$|E
