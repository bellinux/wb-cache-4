The game was successfully greenlit and released for Windows on 18 February 2016. On 6 July 2016, Sorath released an OS X version of Devil Daggers. Alongside this release, two new enemy types {{were added to the}} game and the Devil Daggers soundtrack was added to the game's directory. Support for <b>vertical</b> <b>sync,</b> increased field of view, and virtual surround sound via HRTF-processing were also added. On 19 September 2016, a Linux version of Devil Daggers was released along with the ability to view replays from a top-down perspective. The update also added more statistics such as tracking a player's total survival time across all runs.|$|E
2500|$|RGB is {{also the}} term {{referring}} to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry. [...] It consists of three signals—red, green, and blue—carried on three separate cables/pins. RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS-170 and RS-343 standards for monochrome video. This type of video signal is widely used in Europe {{since it is the}} best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector. This signal is known as RGBS (4 BNC/RCA terminated cables exist as well), but it is directly compatible [...] with RGBHV used for computer monitors (usually carried on 15-pin cables terminated with 15-pin D-sub or 5 BNC connectors), [...] which carries separate horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> signals.|$|E
50|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} (also called <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> or VSync) {{separates the}} video fields. In PAL and NTSC, the <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> pulse occurs within the vertical blanking interval. The <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> pulses {{are made by}} prolonging the length of HSYNC pulses through almost {{the entire length of}} the scan line.|$|E
5000|$|In some high-definition applications, a 'tri-level sync' {{signal is}} used instead. This signal is {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} synchronization signal used in component analogue video (CAV); and {{is similar to the}} synchronization signals used in VGA (the main difference being, in VGA the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>syncs</b> are carried on different wires; whereas TLS signals include both H and V syncs).|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1985 {{with the}} video release of The Cotton Club, Macrovision {{licensed}} to publishers {{a technology that}} exploits the automatic gain control feature of VCRs by adding pulses to the <b>vertical</b> blanking <b>sync</b> signal. These pulses do not affect the image a consumer sees on his TV, but do confuse the recording-level circuitry of consumer VCRs. This technology, which is aided by U.S. legislation mandating the presence of automatic gain-control circuitry in VCRs, is said to [...] "plug the analog hole" [...] and make VCR-to-VCR copies impossible, although an inexpensive circuit is widely available that will defeat the protection by removing the pulses. Macrovision has patented methods of defeating copy prevention, giving it a more straightforward basis to shut down manufacture of any device that descrambles it than often exists in the DRM world.|$|R
50|$|For older analog {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) technology, display lag is {{extremely}} low, {{due to the nature}} of the technology, which does not have the ability to store image data before display. The picture signal is minimally processed internally, simply for demodulation from a radio-frequency (RF) carrier wave (for televisions), and then splitting into separate signals for the red, green, and blue electron guns, and for timing of the <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>sync.</b> Image adjustments typically involved reshaping the signal waveform but without storage, so the image is written to the screen as fast as it is received, with only nanoseconds of delay for the signal to traverse the wiring inside the device from input to the screen.|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, a {{scrambler}} is {{a device}} that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations {{carried out in the}} digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing <b>vertical</b> or horizontal <b>sync</b> pulses in television signals; televisions {{will not be able to}} display a picture from such a signal. Some modern scramblers are actually encryption devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.|$|R
50|$|Atari's 16-bit {{computer}} range utilized a 13-pin DIN connector for its video output; {{this single}} connector could carry the colour RGB signals, a composite video signal, the high-resolution monochrome video signal, <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>sync,</b> ground, mono audio, and later, external video clock input, each {{on its own}} dedicated pin. If Pin 4 was connected to ground, the computer would detect this and boot into the high-resolution monochrome video mode that was not user-selectable and only worked with specially designed monitors (the vertical refresh rate being 71 Hz as opposed to 50/60 Hz for colour modes). Atari also used a 14-pin DIN connector for their external floppy disk drives, primarily for space-saving reasons; the port occupies much less of the crowded rear of the computer than on contemporaries such as the Amiga and Macintosh, which used physically larger D-shell connectors with a 20+ pin count.|$|R

Mengungkapkan development and construction services in analyzing the impact of the judicial verdict of No. NO. 55 / G / 2012 / PTUN-JKT to tender for the implementation of construction in West Kalimantan. Expressing and analyzing the development of institutional arrangements effort construction services more effectively and efficiently in the future. Through research methods Characteristically Juridical as the target of this research is legal or norm (norm). Understanding the rules here include the principle of law, legal norms in terms of value, setting concrete law and the legal system. in connection with normative legal research object in the form of general principles of law, legal systematics, extent of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>sync,</b> then through meteode the study was concluded that the incidence of cases Based chronological dualism of Construction Services Development Board (LPJK) is rather complicated and confusing. Regulation of the Minister that contains the management LPJK in value by LPJK Version Munas unfair and loaded with interest by certain officials. National Conference party looked LPJK national consensus mechanism is the most powerful legally, and they perceive that the STI (Information Technology Systems) LPJK version adopted PU Djoko Kirmanto as head of the Ministry of Public Pkekerjaan {{is the result of the}} 2008 National Conference should not be as good as the STI LPJK munas version. Polemic LPJK dualism is not long before problems occur, especially for LPJK area. Juridical Impact Of The verdict Number: 55 / G / 2012 / PTUN-JKT associated with Object dispute 1 and 2, namely Number: IPR 4. 01. 05. 2171 / 11 Letter and Number: 054 823 dated January 10, 2012, regarding Trademark Registration Change of Address INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES CONSTRUCTION (LPJK) and Logo Creation CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTE (LPJK) in the General Register of Works No. 054 823, which was signed by the Director of Copyright, Industrial Design, Design of Integrated Circuits and Trade Secrets on behalf of the Minister of Justice and Human Rights of the Republic of Indonesia clearly states that the copyright in the form of the logo valid legally owned by the National Conference LPJK version. It stretcher resulted in chaos in the two institutions in which each of these institutions claim to invalidity appliances logo. Berdarnya circulars of each institution have seriously affected the legal certainty tender Construction Services in Indonesia in general and especially in West Kalimantan. Efforts laws governing construction services development agencies more effectively and efficiently to the front post verdict of No. 55 / G / 2012 -DPS administrative court is to conduct civil remedies, efforts constitutional law, administrative law efforts, and the efforts of the criminal law. As for the suggestion terhadapa authors of this study is the implementation of the decision of the Administrative Court Administrative Court No. 55 / G / 2012 -DPS administrative court has not considered effective and efficient so it must be due to the lack of observance of the board or state officials that there are two LPJK the environment. It 2 ̆ 7 s time the government (President) in demand to take a firm stand end to this conflict, so that there is certainty of law to the world of construction in Indonesia. The need for the application of the principles of good governance so that the implementation of the government will be more transparent, pro-democracy and prosperity of the people. And conflicts regarding the tender exercisingConstruction Services can be reduced. If it has been decided by the Court TUN, then its implementation easier adhered and resolved with concrete legal certainty. Tesis ini membahas tentang dampak yuridis putusan ptun no. 55 /g/ 2012 /ptun-jkt terhadap tender jasa konstruksi di Kalimantan Barat ". adapun tujuan penulisan tesisi ini adalah Mendapatkan data dan menganalisis faktor-faktor yang menyebabkan terjadinya dualisme lembaga pengembangan jasa konstruksi di Indonesia. Mengungkapkan dan menganalisis dampak yuridis dari Putusan PTUN No NO. 55 /G/ 2012 /PTUN-JKT terhadap pelaksanaan tender jasa konstruksi di Kalimantan Barat. Mengungkapkan dan menganalisis upaya pengaturan lembaga pengembangan jasa konstruksi yang lebih efektif dan efesien ke depan. Melalui metode penelitian Bersifat Yuridis karena sasaran penelitian ini adalah hukum atau kaidah (norm). Pengertian kaidah di sini meliputi asas hukum, kaedah hukum dalam arti nilai, pengaturan hukum konkrit dan sistem hukum. Berkaitan dengan penelitian hukum normatif obyeknya berupa asas-asas hukum, sistematika hukum, taraf sinkronisasi vertikal dan horizontal, maka melaui meteode penelitian tersebut diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa Berdasarkan kronologisnya kasus timbulnya dualisme dari Lembaga Pengembangan Jasa Konstruksi (LPJK) memang agak rumit dan membingungkan. Peraturan menteri yang berisikan tentang kepengurusan LPJK tersebut di nilai oleh LPJK Versi Munas tidak adil dan sarat dengan kepentingan oleh pejabat tertentu. Pihak LPJK Munas memandang mekanisme musyawarah nasional adalah yang paling kuat secara hukum, dan mereka memandang bahwa STI (Sistem Teknologi Informasi) LPJK versi PU yang diadopsi Djoko Kirmanto sebagai Kepala kementerian Pkekerjaan Umum adalah hasil dari Munas 2008 yang selayaknya tidak sebaik STI LPJK versi munas. Polemik dualisme LPJK ini tidak lama kemudian menimbulkan permasalahan, terutama bagi LPJK daerah. Dampak Yuridis Dari Putusan PTUN Nomor: 55 /G/ 2012 /PTUN-JKT terkait dengan Objek sengketa 1 dan 2 yaitu Nomor : HKI 4. 01. 05. 2171 / 11 Surat dan Nomor : 054823 tanggal 10 Januari 2012, mengenai Pendaftaran Perubahan Alamat Merek LEMBAGA PENGEMBANGAN JASA KONSTRUKSI (LPJK) dan Ciptaan Logo LEMBAGA PENGEMBANGAN JASA KONSTRUKSI (LPJK) dalam Daftar Umum Ciptaan Nomor 054823, yang ditandatangani oleh Direktur Hak Cipta, Design Industri, Design Tata Letak Sirkuit Terpadu, dan Rahasia Dagang atas nama Menteri Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia Republik Indonesia jelas menyatakan bahwa hak cipta berupa Logo itu sah secara hokum di miliki oleh LPJK versi Munas. Hal terebut mengakibatkan kisruh di kedua lembaga tersebut yang mana masing-masing lembaga tersebut mengklaim ke absahan pemakian logo. Berdarnya surat edaran dari masing-masing lembaga sangat berdampak terhadap kepastian hokum tender Jasa Konstruksi yang ada di Indonesia pada umumnya dan di Kalimantan Barat pada khusunya. Upaya-Upaya hukum pengaturan lembaga pengembangan jasa konstruksi yang lebih efektif dan efesien ke depan pasca Putusan PTUN No. 55 /G/ 2012 PTUN-JKT yaitu dengan melakukan upaya hukum perdata, upaya hukum tata negara, upaya hukum administrasi, dan upaya hukum pidana. adapun saran penulis terhadapa penelitian ini adalah Pelaksanaan putusan PTUN PTUN No. 55 /G/ 2012 PTUN-JKT dirasa belum efektif dan efesien sehingga harus karena kurangnya ketaatan dari pengurus atau pejabat Negara yang ada dilingkungan kedua LPJK tersebut. Sudah waktunya pemerintah (Presiden) di tuntut untuk mengambil sikap tegas mengakhiri konflik ini, agar ada Kepastian hokum terhadap dunia konstruksi diIndonesia. Perlunya penerapan prinsip good governance sehingga pelaksanaan pemerintahan akan lebih transparan, berpihak pada demokrasi dan kemakmuran rakyat. Dan konflik-konflik mengenai Pelakasanaan tender Jasa Konstruksi bisa lebih berkurang. Jika sudah diputus oleh Pengadilan TUN, maka pelaksanaannya lebih mudah ditaati dan terselesaikan dengan kepastian hukum yang konkrit...|$|R

Some models (for example the AT070TN92) also feature input/display enable, horizontal scan direction and vertical scan direction signals.|$|E
50|$|The “giant sprites” {{trick was}} that sprites were {{composed}} {{by a set}} of small parts that allowed reusing of those parts in different characters (e.g., a lot of enemies share the same trousers and leg movements). In some ports, a problem with the <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> of the monitor lets the player to easily see this trick (sometimes characters got rendered divided in two clearly different slices).|$|E
50|$|VGA uses a DE-15 {{connector}}. This connector fits on {{the mounting}} tab of an ISA expansion card. An alternative method of connecting VGA devices that maintains very high signal quality is the BNC connector, typically {{used as a}} group of five connectors, one each for Red, Green, Blue, Horizontal Sync, and <b>Vertical</b> <b>Sync.</b> With BNC, the coaxial wires are fully shielded end-to-end and through the interconnect so that no crosstalk or external interference is possible.|$|E
5000|$|The monitor is a CRT with a {{phosphor}} area diagonal: 41 cm (16"), {{dot pitch}} of 0.26 mm. The screen has a short persistence phosphor with an anti-reflection and anti-static coating. The horizontal sync frequency is 27.0-86.0 kHz, and the <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> is 50-160 Hz. The maximum video resolution 1600 × 1200, non-interlaced. In 2000 this model received a tube upgrade: a Mitsubishi Diamondtron FD tube with [...]24 dot pitch was equipped.|$|E
50|$|A display list {{should not}} be built with a hi-res (Mode F) {{instruction}} in scan line 247—the last displayable scan line. If the DMACTL Playfield Width bits are not 00 then ANTIC will not generate the <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> properly potentially causing display distortion. In any case, this is easy to avoid, since {{this is not a}} practical Display List arrangement as this places the Mode line in the overscan area where it is not ordinarily visible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> {{signal is}} a series of much longer pulses, {{indicating}} {{the start of a new}} field. The sync pulses occupy the whole of line interval of a number of lines at the beginning and end of a scan; no picture information is transmitted during vertical retrace. The pulse sequence is designed to allow horizontal sync to continue during vertical retrace; it also indicates whether each field represents even or odd lines in interlaced systems (depending on whether it begins at the start of a horizontal line, or midway through).|$|E
5000|$|The {{connector}} contains 10 standard signal {{pins and}} 3 larger positions {{that can be}} fitted with either special pins with two concentric contacts for coaxial cable or with special high current pins. When used for video signals on the computer side, the pins are female but the coaxial connectors in the large positions are male. The coaxial connectors carry the video signal split into red, green/gray, and blue; the standard signal pins carry four grounds, three [...] "sense" [...] pins used {{to communicate with the}} monitor, <b>vertical</b> <b>sync,</b> horizontal sync, and a composite sync signal.|$|E
50|$|A {{video signal}} {{generator}} {{is a type}} of signal generator which outputs predetermined video and/or television oscillation waveforms, and other signals used in the synchronization of television devices and to stimulate faults in, or aid in parametric measurements of, television and video systems. There are several different types of video signal generators in widespread use. Regardless of the specific type, the output of a video generator will generally contain synchronization signals appropriate for television, including horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> pulses (in analog) or sync words (in digital). Generators of composite video signals (such as NTSC and PAL) will also include a colorburst signal as part of the output.|$|E
50|$|The chip {{generates the}} signals {{necessary}} {{to interface with}} a raster display but does not generate the actual pixels, though it does contribute cursor and video-blanking information to the pixel video (intensity) signals. It is used to produce correctly timed horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> and provide the address in memory from which the next pixel or set of pixels should be read. The process of reading that value, converting it into pixels, and sending it to a CRT is left to other circuits. Because of this, systems using the 6845 may have very different numbers and values of colors, or may not support color at all.|$|E
50|$|VGA {{connectors}} and cables carry analog component RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, <b>vertical</b> <b>sync)</b> video signals, and VESA Display Data Channel (VESA DDC) data. In {{the original}} version of DE-15 pinout, one pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole; this prevented non-VGA 15 pin cables from being plugged into a VGA socket. Four pins carried Monitor ID bits, which were rarely used; VESA DDC redefined some of these pins and replaced the key pin with +5 V DC power supply. Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide 5V ±5% and supply a minimum of 300 mA {{to a maximum of}} 1 A.|$|E
50|$|A {{videogame}} console or PC {{will send}} out a new frame once it has finished performing the necessary calculations to create it. The rate at which this is achieved is measured with the frame rate. Using common 60 Hz monitor as an example, the maximum theoretical frame rate is 60 FPS (frames per second), which means the minimum theoretical input lag for the overall system is 17 ms. Theoretical maximum FPS is usually limited by the video monitor, since the game cannot display more frames per second than the monitor's refresh rate (with exception of turning <b>vertical</b> <b>sync</b> (v-sync) off which in turn causes graphical artifacts). In situations where the CPU and/or GPU load is high, FPS can drop below the monitors refresh rate.|$|E
