The probe is inserted into the source block through a <b>vacuum</b> <b>lock.</b> The sample is introduced to the well using a glass capillary.

50|$|As {{previously}} stated, in FAB {{the samples}} {{are mixed with}} a non-volatile environment (matrix) {{in order to be}} analyzed. FAB uses a liquid matrix that is mixed with the sample in order to provide a sample ion current that is sustained, reduces damages made to the sample by absorbing the impact of the primary beam, and keeps the sample molecules form aggregating. The liquid matrix, like any other matrix, most importantly provides a medium that promotes sample ionization. The most widely accepted matrix for this type of ionization is glycerol. Choosing the appropriate matrix for the sample is crucial because the matrix can also influence the degree of fragmentation of the sample (analyte) ions. Once the sample and matrix are mixed together properly, the sample can then be introduced to FAB analysis. The normal method of introducing the sample-matrix mixture is through an insertion probe. The sample-matrix mixture is loaded on a stainless steel sample target on the probe, which is then placed in the ion source via a <b>vacuum</b> <b>lock.</b> The alternative method of introducing the sample is by using a device called continuous flow fast atom bombardment (CF)-FAB.|$|E

40|$|Non-Abelian BPS vortex {{solutions}} are constructed in N = 2 theories with gauge groups SO(N) × U(1). The model has Nf flavors of chiral multiplets in the vector representation of SO(N), and we consider a color-flavor <b>locked</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{in which the}} gauge symmetry is completely broken, leaving a global SO(N) C+F diagonal symmetry unbroken. Individual vortices break this symmetry, acquiring continuous non-Abelian orientational moduli. By embedding this model in high-energy theories with a hierarchical symmetry breaking pattern such as SO(N + 2) → SO(N) × U(1) →, the correspondence between non-Abelian monopoles and vortices can be established through homotopy maps and flux matching, generalizing the known results in SU(N) theories. We find some interesting hints about the dual (non-Abelian) transformation properties among the monopoles...|$|R

In the color-flavor <b>locked</b> <b>vacuum</b> with degenerate hypermultiplet masses, a subgroup of the color-flavor diagonal symmetry remains unbroken and gives internal orientational moduli to vortices which confine monopoles in the Higgs phase.

Large and small bodies fall at the same speed through air or water providing they are of the same density. Since ebony weighs a thousand times as much as air (which he had measured), it will fall only a very little more slowly than lead which weighs ten times as much. But shape also matters—even a piece of gold leaf (the heaviest of metals) floats through the air and a bladder filled with air falls much more slowly than lead.|$|R

40|$|The {{low-energy}} vortex {{effective action}} is constructed {{in a wide}} class of systems in a color-flavor <b>locked</b> <b>vacuum,</b> which generalizes the results found earlier {{in the context of}} U(N) models. It describes the weak fluctuations of the non-Abelian orientational moduli on the vortex worldsheet. For instance, for the minimum vortex in SO(2 N) x U(1) or USp(2 N) x U(1) gauge theories, the effective action found is a two-dimensional sigma model living on the Hermitian symmetric spaces SO(2 N) /U(N) or USp(2 N) /U(N), respectively. The fluctuating moduli have the structure of that of a quantum particle state in spinor representations of the GNO dual of the color-flavor SO(2 N) (C+F) or USp(2 N) (C+F) symmetry, i. e. of SO(2 N) or of SO(2 N + 1).

40|$|An {{innovative}} research program is proposed {{to investigate the}} corrosion of steel by lead alloys, and in particular lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE). In our previous work, some steels {{were found to be}} far more resistant to corrosion by LBE than others depending on surface preparation (cold working). This program would allow testing of crucial hypotheses about the causes of the observed increased corrosion resistance. We propose to build a new test facility at UNLV to expose steel samples to LBE as well as facilities to prepare steel samples as indicated by our work. The unique capabilities of the test system will make investigations of the fundamentals of lead alloy corrosion under a variety of conditions feasible and lead to the establishment of new protocols for the minimization of molten lead alloy corrosion of structural materials. These capabilities include fast and controlled sample introduction via a <b>vacuum</b> load <b>lock</b> system, both high temperature operation and controlled chemical environment by the use of alumina and silica or other refractory materials for lead alloy containment, and highly modifiable flow systems for determination of fundamental kinetics and parameters and thus accurate modeling of lead alloy systems. In parallel with the test effort we will prepare well characterized samples of candidate materials and model systems. In particular we shall look at modifications of the sample surface and near surface composition (e. g. the effects of cold working). In addition we shall investigate the feasibility of using the mass selected ion facility at UNLV developed by Prof. Farley to both modify surface composition (e. g. ion implant oxygen to compensate for oxygen deficiencies) of test samples and to introduce stable isotope labels into known steels to determine mass transport properties inside the steels...|$|R
