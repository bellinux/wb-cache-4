5|$|At its opening, Chang {{claimed the}} record for the tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> of any roller coaster in the world. At the time, it was the world's tallest, fastest and longest {{stand-up}} coaster. It also claimed records for the largest drop and the most inversions on a stand-up roller coaster. All of these records had eclipsed those set by Mantis, which opened at Cedar Point in 1996. In 1998 Riddler's Revenge opened at Six Flags Magic Mountain, and Chang surrendered its titles.|$|E
5|$|In late June 2007, reports {{circulated}} {{that the}} park was testing the new Gerstlauer trains. Eyewitnesses reported red and blue trains running on the track with test dummies in the seats. On July 4, 2007, Son of Beast reopened {{for the first time}} since the accident the year before. Despite the lack of the <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> the coaster continued to hold the record as tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world.|$|E
5|$|Superman: Krypton Coaster is a Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster at the Six Flags Fiesta Texas {{amusement}} park in San Antonio, Texas, USA. Opened in 2000, Superman: Krypton Coaster {{was one of}} the first floorless roller coasters in the world. The well-received ride held the title for the world's tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> (145 feet) from its opening until 2013. It is also known as for being the world's tallest and fastest floorless coaster at 168ft (51 m) high and a top speed of 70mph (110km/h). Six Flags describes the coaster Thrill Level at MAXIMUM. Six Flags has announced plans to add Virtual Reality to Superman: Krypton Coaster to enhance the experience.|$|E

5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E
5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout {{and they were not}} sure how to fit it into the park. On July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced the name of their new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> a Boomerang, and a corkscrew. As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, a trim brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E

50|$|The ride {{starts with}} a slow 93-foot chain lift hill, leading to a right hand near {{vertical}} curved first drop, and two consecutive <b>vertical</b> <b>loops.</b> The ride then turns into left-hand helix, up and {{through the center of}} second loop. Another left turn helix, goes down and goes straight upward diagonally between the <b>vertical</b> <b>loops,</b> followed by a 360-degree helix, starting from right, leading into a brake run that leads into two right turns and back into the station.|$|R

25|$|On 2 May 1993, {{during the}} 1993 MCAS El Toro airshow, an F-86 Sabre crashed {{on the runway}} after failing {{to pull out of}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> The F-86 pilot, James A. Gregory, died on impact. No one was hurt on the ground. The airshow continued.

25|$|In 2013, 2015 and 2017, {{two or more}} wooden roller {{coasters}} with inversions opened. As opposed to the <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> that Son of Beast had, Outlaw Run and Hades 360, Mine Blower and Twisted Colossus have more complex inversions. Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City has a double barrel roll and a 153° over-banked turn, and Hades 360 has a single corkscrew. Other elements which partially invert riders, such as the overbanked turn which occasionally turn riders beyond 90 degrees, are not typically considered inversions.|$|E
25|$|Son of Beast {{opened in}} 2000, {{the second year}} of the area's two-year expansion. It was the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster {{in the world and the}} first of its kind to feature a <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> As a result of a number of {{structural}} issues and two accidents, the ride closed permanently in 2009 and was eventually demolished in 2012. Other notable rides include Delirium, which opened in 2003 as the largest Giant Frisbee ride in the world, and Banshee, the world's longest inverted roller coaster which opened in 2014 at the former location of Son of Beast.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the ride's announcement, {{construction}} had already begun on unused land bordered by quarry walls and an irrigation pond. The initial plans for the ride specified it would have seven inversions including a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> and a [...] dive loop. Following the ride's announcement, the design was altered to remove the dive loop and increase the size of the <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> to [...] This saw Superman: Krypton Coaster obtain the record for the world's tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> when it officially opened to the public on March 11, 2000.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>loops</b> have 3 purposes: Lowers load/deflection rate, {{provides}} {{horizontal control}} {{and act as}} break between the teeth which allows each tooth to move independently. Horizontal loops further reduces the load/deflection rate and provides vertical control.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Viper, a {{multiple}} looping coaster designed by Arrow Dynamics opened. It features a 188 ft drop, {{speeds up to}} 70 mi/h km/h, 3 <b>vertical</b> <b>loops,</b> a batwing turn that inverts riders twice, and a double corkscrew.|$|R

500|$|On March 6, 2010, Six Flags Fiesta Texas offered {{exclusive}} ride time on Superman: Krypton Coaster to help {{celebrate the}} ride's 10th anniversary. On June 22, 2013, Superman: Krypton Coaster lost {{the title of}} having the world's tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> since Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California [...] opened Full Throttle which features a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> [...] taller than the loop on Superman: Krypton Coaster.|$|E
500|$|Kumba {{was officially}} {{announced}} in November 1992 as a record-breaking Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster set {{to become the}} park's signature attraction. The ride officially {{opened to the public}} on April 20, 1993. When Kumba opened, it featured the world's tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> and was also the tallest, fastest and longest roller coaster in Florida. In 1995, Kumba conceded the title of ride with the world's tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> to Dragon Khan at PortAventura which features a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> In 1996, it conceded Florida's titles of tallest and longest roller coaster to Montu, a Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster in the Egypt section of the park. In 1999, it conceded the fastest title to Islands of Adventure's The Incredible Hulk, yet another Bolliger & Mabillard roller coaster.|$|E
500|$|After {{the train}} left the station, it climbed the [...] chain lift hill. It then dropped [...] before {{entering}} the first [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> This {{was followed by a}} [...] cobra roll and a [...] zero-g roll. A second, smaller <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> would lead the train into a large helix before the mid-course brake run. The ride then dropped into another small helix before navigating through a corkscrew. A third helix followed before the train slowed in the final brake run and returned to the station.|$|E
50|$|Its {{track is}} blue with white {{supports}} {{and a yellow}} color scheme on the inversions. Its inversions are 2 <b>vertical</b> <b>loops</b> which are lit up with orange and yellow lights at night. The lift is also lit up with orange and yellow lights.|$|R
50|$|Another common {{occurrence}} of greyouts is in roller coaster riders. Many roller coasters put riders through positive g-forces, particularly in <b>vertical</b> <b>loops</b> and helixes. Roller coasters rarely have high enough negative g-forces to induce redouts, as most low-g elements {{are designed to}} simulate weightlessness.|$|R
50|$|With some exceptions, {{stand-up}} {{roller coasters}} normally feature {{at least one}} inversion. These inversions can include <b>vertical</b> <b>loops,</b> incline loops, dive loops and corkscrews. Only one stand-up roller coaster, the Shockwave at Drayton Manor Theme Park in the United Kingdom, includes a zero-gravity roll.|$|R
500|$|The [...] Kumba stands [...] tall. With a {{top speed}} of , the ride {{features}} seven inversions including a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> a dive loop, a zero-g roll, a cobra roll and two interlocking corkscrews. The <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> featured on Kumba wraps around the lift hill. Kumba was the first ride in the world to feature a number of now-common roller coaster elements, including interlocking corkscrews and a dive loop. Riders of Kumba experience up to 3.8 times the force of gravity on the 3 minute ride.|$|E
500|$|In March 2000, The Riddler's Revenge conceded {{the title}} of the world's tallest <b>vertical</b> <b>loop</b> to [...] at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. The floorless roller coaster {{featured}} a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> [...] taller than that of The Riddler's Revenge. The park closed several rides including The Riddler's Revenge in early 2017 to begin the construction of Metropolis, a new themed area that resulted in new paint schemes along with modified entrance and exit queues for some attractions. The new area opened on July 12, 2017, which marked the reopening of The Riddler's Revenge.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{begins with}} the floor {{retracting}} {{which leads to the}} front gate opening. [...] The trains leaves the station with a small dip and turnaround out of the station tracking towards the [...] chain lift hill. Once at the top, riders twist down [...] and into a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> reaching speeds of up to 65 miles per hour (105km/h). Following the <b>vertical</b> <b>loop,</b> an Immelmann loop comes next, and provides a footchopper element with the pylon. After completing the Immelmann, the train goes through a zero-g roll, where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. Following the zero-G roll, riders are then inverted twice during the batwing element which leads into the mid-course brake run. A twisting dive to the right immediately follows the brake run and leads into a [...] <b>vertical</b> <b>loop.</b> A series of corners and a corkscrew lead the train to the final brake run and back into the station.|$|E
50|$|Canyon Blaster is {{an indoor}} roller coaster at the Adventuredome theme park in Las Vegas, Nevada, US. It {{features}} back-to-back <b>vertical</b> <b>loops</b> and corkscrews, {{and ends with}} a helix inside the mountain that takes up {{a large portion of}} the park. It is proclaimed as the world's largest indoor double-loop, double-corkscrew coaster.|$|R
50|$|The ride's layout {{features}} many twisting drops, three <b>vertical</b> <b>loops</b> and {{a double}} upward helix finale. The ride twists underneath, in between and around its supports. It also goes underneath the former UFO Maze attraction, {{which has been}} removed {{to make way for}} another roller coaster; Gerstlauer's Galaxy Orbiter, during the helix.|$|R
500|$|The [...] Kraken stands [...] tall. With a {{top speed}} of , the ride was the fastest roller coaster at SeaWorld Orlando until the opening of Mako in Summer of 2016. The ride {{features}} seven inversions including two <b>vertical</b> <b>loops,</b> a dive loop, a spiraling camelback (zero-g roll), a cobra roll and a flat spin (corkscrew).|$|R
