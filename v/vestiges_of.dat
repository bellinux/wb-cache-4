5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With {{the demise of the}} Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E

5|$|Aided by NATO air cover, {{the rebel}} militia pushed westward, {{defeating}} loyalist armies and securing {{control of the}} centre of the country. Gaining the support of Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi, the NTC armies surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya. In August, the rebels seized Zliten and Tripoli, ending the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> Gaddafist power.|$|E
5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings {{in the area around}} the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 million in federal funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from a tent adjacent to the station, and there were <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> a carousel within the station.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated a Roman army in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War. Following this success they built a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome. At the Battle of Populonia in 282 BC Rome finished off the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> Etruscan power in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Dzordzor Chapel {{was built}} {{on the bank of the}} Makuchay River at Dzordzor by Bishop Zachariah in 1314 on very modest lines, making use of the <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> an earlier {{religious}} monument dated between the 10th and 12th centuries. During the period of Ottoman rule, some parts of the building were destroyed. Later, the chapel came under threat of submergence from a proposed dam and had to be shifted to a new location upstream.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Glastonbury {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by hippie ethics and the free festival movement in the early 1970s, beginning with the Isle of Wight Festival, which featured performances by The Who, amongst many other artists. Organiser Michael Eavis decided to host the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970. The festival retains <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> this tradition such as the Green Fields area, encompassing the Green Futures and Healing Field.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few months}} after the failed {{offensive}} against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> unity and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.|$|E

5|$|Regarded as a {{major event}} in British culture, the festival is {{inspired}} by the ethos of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, {{with the number of}} attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad was {{completed}} between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854. During the 1880s, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was proposed {{to compete with}} the Pennsylvania. It received the backing of William Henry Vanderbilt, head of the New York Central Railroad (the Pennsylvania's chief rival). Andrew Carnegie also provided financial support, since he was unhappy with rates charged by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Construction began on the rival line in 1883, but stopped when the railroads reached an agreement in 1885. After construction halted, the only <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the South Pennsylvania were nine tunnels, some roadbed and piers for a bridge over the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Linnaeus {{classified}} {{for ease}} of identification, {{the idea of the}} Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal- and Plant Kingdoms was formulated {{toward the end of the}} 18th century, well before On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species were Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative but widely read <b>Vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844.|$|E
