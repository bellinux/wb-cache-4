Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> dispersal abilities, depending as they do on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E

50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century and beyond, {{opinions}} over the MDC movements have tended towards two positions. The first, adopted by free market economists, asserts that the financial success {{of some of these}} companies shows that they could have been a significant help to the poor, if their operation was not interrupted by the arrival of social housing in the form of London County Council estates. Others argue that the failure of MDCs {{to meet the needs of}} the <b>very</b> <b>poorest</b> demonstrates that they were a stepping stone towards the inevitable necessity of state intervention to solve the housing crisis.MDCs have been particularly criticised for failing to provide for the <b>very</b> <b>poorest</b> of society, concentrating on the labour aristocracy, the upper strata of the working classes.|$|R

5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (<b>very</b> <b>poor),</b> based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
25|$|As populations grew {{during the}} Early Modern Period in Europe, urban towns swelled {{with a steady}} influx {{of people from the}} countryside.

60|$|I {{stated in}} the Observations, and more at large in the Inquiry into rents,(11*) that under the same demand for labour, and the same {{consequent}} power of purchasing the means of subsistence, a high money price of corn would give the labourer a very great advantage in {{the purchase of the}} conveniences and luxuries of life. The effect of this high money price would not, of course, be so marked among the <b>very</b> <b>poorest</b> of the society, and those who had the largest families; because so very great a part of their earnings must be employed in absolute necessaries. But to all those above the <b>very</b> <b>poorest,</b> the advantage of wages resulting from a price of eighty shillings a quarter for wheat, compared with fifty or sixty, would in the purchase of tea, sugar, cotton, linens, soap, candles, and many other articles, be such as to make their condition decidedly superior.|$|R

However, Sierra withdrew it from circulation, after itself and Valve had failed to resolve licensing issues with Cruise Control over the film. The critical reception of the film was <b>very</b> <b>poor.</b> The plot of the film was that a journalist infiltrates the Black Mesa Research Facility, trying to discover what has happened there.|$|E

50|$|New Welfare {{programs}} have integrated the multidimensional, social risk management, and capabilities approaches into poverty alleviation. They focus on income transfers and service provisions while aiming to alleviate both long- and short-term poverty through, among other things, education, health, security, and housing.

5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> {{condition}} following an accidental collision {{with the heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen late in the war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E
5|$|Brownsea Castle was {{purchased}} by Mary Bonham-Christie in 1927. She allowed the property to fall into disrepair {{and by the time}} of her death in 1961 it was in a <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> condition. It was then purchased by the National Trust and leased to the John Lewis Partnership, who restored it over many years. In the 21st century it is still used by the Partnership as a corporate hotel for their employees and retired staff.|$|E

There were 628 single rooms with shared cooking and sanitary facilities, plus a top floor for the <b>very</b> <b>poorest</b> families. The buildings were named after the philanthropist Catherine Courtney.|$|R
50|$|A bording house {{known as}} Pjaltenborg, which {{provided}} accommodation for the <b>very</b> <b>poorest</b> {{part of the}} city's population, was located on the corner with Aabenraa.

5|$|Flight tests {{revealed}} difficult handling, {{and a lack}} of power due to the non-availability of the intended ACh-30BF engines. Flight tests continued without the waist guns and their gunner until the ACh-30BF's were fitted between May and July 1944. Despite modifications, the aircraft still suffered from poor controllability at low speeds and high weights as well as <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> gliding performance. Throughout the flight tests the engines performed satisfactorily in the air, but were found {{to be very difficult to}} start in low ambient temperatures and had slow response to throttle movements. Further development was canceled.|$|E
5|$|Grimm {{mounted a}} second {{expedition}} in June 1981 aboard the research vessel Gyre, with Spiess and Ryan again joining the expedition. To increase {{their chances of}} finding the wreck, the team employed a much more capable sonar device, the Scripps Deep Tow. The weather was again <b>very</b> <b>poor,</b> but all 14 of the targets were successfully covered and found to be natural features. On {{the last day of}} the expedition, an object that looked like a propeller was found. Grimm announced on his return to Boston that Titanic had been found, but the scientists declined to endorse his identification.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. Rail services from London to Oxford were <b>very</b> <b>poor</b> at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built {{it would have been the}} shortest route between Oxford and the City of London.|$|E
