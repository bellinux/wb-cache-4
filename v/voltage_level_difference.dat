It is particularly designed for use with batteries that can be damaged by overcharging, such as Lithium-ion type batteries. In detail. the method includes the following steps: 1) sensing the actual <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> of the individual cell; 2) comparing the actual <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> of the individual cell with a reference value and providing an error signal representative thereof; and 3) by-passing the charging current around individual cell necessary to keep the individual cell <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> generally equal a specific <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> while continuing to charge the remaining cells. Preferably this is accomplished by by-passing the charging current around the individual cell if said actual <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> is above the specific <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> and allowing the charging current to the individual cell if the actual <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> is equal or less than the specific <b>voltage</b> <b>level.</b> In the step of bypassing the charging current, the by-passed current is transferred at a proper <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> to the power supply.

40|$|Introducing {{renewable}} electricity as {{distributed generation}} {{may be an}} attractive option in the shift towards a more sustainable electricity system. Yet, {{it is not clear}} to what extent an increased use of distributed generation is beneficial from a systems perspective. We therefore investigate the impacts from increased employment of distributed solar and wind power on losses and transformer capacity requirements in distribution systems. The analysis is based on a dispatch model with a simple representation of typical <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> in the distribution system. When electricity is transferred between <b>voltage</b> <b>levels,</b> we subtract losses estimated as the transferred energy times a constant loss factor. Our results show that the losses depend on how load is distributed between <b>voltage</b> <b>levels.</b> For total penetration levels up to 40 – 50 % on an energy basis, we find that wind and solar power could potentially reduce distribution losses. Results further indicate that solar photovoltaic capacity in the low <b>voltage</b> <b>level</b> has a limited potential to decrease peak power flows between <b>voltage</b> <b>levels</b> in a setting where seasonal variations in demand and solar output are opposite to each other. Thereby distributed solar generation also has limited potential to defer investments in transformer capacity between <b>voltage</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
