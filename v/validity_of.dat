40|$|Research {{into the}} dynamicity of job {{performance}} criteria has found evidence suggesting {{the presence of}} rank-order changes to job performance scores across {{time as well as}} intraindividual trajectories in job performance scores across time. These findings have influenced a large body of research into (a) the dynamicity <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> individual differences predictors of job performance and (b) the relationship between individual differences predictors of job performance and intraindividual trajectories of job performance. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues {{within the context of the}} Five Factor Model of personality. The Five Factor Model is arranged hierarchically, with five broad higher-order factors subsuming a number of more narrowly tailored personality facets. Research has debated the relative merits of broad versus narrow traits for predicting job performance, but the entire body of research has addressed the issue from a static perspective [...] by examining the relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets. While research along these lines has been enlightening, theoretical perspectives suggest that the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets may differ in their stability across time. Thus, research is needed to not only compare the relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets at a single point in time, but also to compare the relative stability <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets across time. Also necessary to advance cumulative knowledge concerning intraindividual performance trajectories is research into broad vs. narrow traits for predicting such trajectories. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues using a four-year longitudinal design. The results indicated that the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global conscientiousness were stable across time, while the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> conscientiousness facets were more likely to fluctuate. However, the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> emotional stability and extraversion facets were no more likely to fluctuate across time than those of the factors. Finally, while some personality factors and facets predicted performance intercepts (i. e., performance at the first measurement occasion), my results failed to indicate a significant effect of any personality variable on performance growth. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Duration Calculus (DC) is a {{real-time}} logic with {{measurement of}} duration of propositions in observation intervals. It {{is a highly}} expressive logic with continuous time behaviours (also called signals) as its models. <b>Validity</b> checking <b>of</b> DC is undecidable. We propose a method for <b>validity</b> checking <b>of</b> Duration Calculus by reduction to a sampled time version of this logic called well sampled Interval Duration Logic (WSIDL). This reduction relies on representing a continuous time behaviour by a well-sampled behaviour with 1 -oversampling. We provide weak and strong reductions (abstractions) of logic DC to logic WSIDL which respectively preserve the validity and the counter examples. By combining these reductions with previous work on deciding IDL, we implement a tool for <b>validity</b> checking <b>of</b> Duration Calculus. This provides a partial but practical method for <b>validity</b> checking <b>of</b> Duration Calculus. We present some preliminary experimental results to measure {{the success of this}} approach. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1992, Moss and Parikh {{studied a}} bimodal logic of {{knowledge}} and effort called Topologic. In this current paper, Topologic is extended {{to the case of}} many agents who are assumed to have some private information at the outset, but may refine their information by acquiring information possessed by other agents, possibly via yet other agents. Let us assume that the agents are connected by a communication graph. In the communication graph, an edge from agent i to agent j means that agent i can directly receive information from agent j. Agent i can then refine its own information by learning information that j has, including information acquired by j from another agent, k. We introduce a multi-agent modal logic with knowledge modalities and a modality representing communication among agents. We show that the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> Topologic remain valid and that the communication graph is completely determined by the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> the resulting logic. Applications of our logic to current political dilemmas are obvious. ...|$|R

Additionally, the applicants were graded in a simulator checkflight. On the basis of training records, the pilots were classified as performing either standard or below standard about three years after employment in the hiring company. In a multiple regression model, this dichotomous criterion for job success can be predicted with 73, 8 % accuracy through the simulator checkflight and flying experience prior to employment. By adding the personality questionnaire to the regression equation, the number of correct classifications increases to 79, 3 %. On the average successful pilots score substantially higher on the interpersonal scales and lower on emotional scales of the TSS...|$|R
