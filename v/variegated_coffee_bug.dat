50|$|Antestiopsis is a genus of shield bug, {{commonly}} known as antestia and the <b>variegated</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>bug.</b> Several species in eastern Africa are pests of coffee plants, giving the coffee beans a distinctive 'potato taste', which {{is thought to be}} caused indirectly by bacteria entering through wounds created by the insects, leading to an increase in the concentration of isopropyl methoxy pyrazine. They feed on flowers, berries and growing tips, injecting a toxic saliva that often contains the spores of the Ashbya fungus, and then suck juices out.|$|E
40|$|The <b>variegated</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>bug</b> Antestiopsis thunbergii Gmelin {{is a key}} pest of Coffea arabica in East Africa. Although the bug {{feeds on}} {{various parts of the}} coffee plant, it has a strong {{preference}} for mature green berries which are essential for the bug to complete its life cycle, reproduce and enhance its longevity. To locate mature green coffee berries, we hypothesized that second instar nymphs, which are the most mobile and active feeding immature stage of the bug, must rely on key volatile compounds emitted by the host for recognition. We tested this hypothesis using behavioral and electrophysiological assays and chemical analysis. In olfactometer assays, the second instar nymphs were strongly attracted to volatiles emitted from mature green berries but avoided those from ripe coffee berries of C. arabica. Coupled gas chromatography–electroantennographic detection (GC/EAD) isolated five antenally active components from mature green berries volatiles, four of which were identified by coupled GC–mass spectrometry as toluene, anisole, methyl 3 -ethyl- 4 -methylpentanoate and (5 S, 7 S) -conophthorin. In concentration assays, in which second instar nymphs did not respond to toluene, they were strongly attracted to anisole, methyl 3 -ethyl- 4 -methylpentanoate and (5 S, 7 S) -conophthorin, and a blend from the three compounds at concentrations lower or equivalent to the natural volatile extract. Our results suggest that the blend from these three compounds allows host recognition in second instar nymphs of the <b>variegated</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>bug</b> and is a candidate kairomone for monitoring the pest in coffee plantations.

5000|$|The story {{opens in}} a town called Doughnut Center with a caption that reads [...] "What A Hole" [...] and Sam reading a {{newspaper}} indicating that a local widow has just inherited $50 million (about $ today). Sam plots to marry the widow and take the money, close the orphanage {{and get rid of}} the police department, but Bugs overhears him and plots to foil the plan by posing as a rival French suitor. The widow, who bears a striking resemblance to Granny, is very excited to have two suitors, but Sam is not. Challenging Bugs by throwing down a gauntlet, he slaps him with a glove; Bugs slaps him with a brick-filled glove. Bugs then challenges Sam to a shooting round at ten paces. Timing the steps, Bugs waits until a bus arrives for Sam to fire, causing him to be run over by it. Bugs then poses as the widow, teasing him and pushing a piano down the stairs on him. The real widow arrives and offers a cup of black coffee. While Sam waits for his <b>coffee,</b> <b>Bugs</b> returns disguised again, and asks whether Sam wants one lump or two (of sugar). Sam replies two, and receives two blows from a mallet.|$|R
40|$|A variegação das fôlhas do cafeeiro tanto em plantas novas como em plantas adultas tem sido freqüentemente observada. Plantas variegadas podem ocorrer espontaneamente nas progénies das diversas variedades de Coffea arabica L., motivo porque não devem constituir variedade distinta dessa espécie, como foi proposto por Cramer. As plantas variegadas em estudo puderam ser agrupadas em duas categorias, isto é, aquelas em que a variegação não se acha associada com anomalias na forma e textura das folhas e aquelas nas quais a variegação é acompanhada dessas anomalias. No primeiro grupo o padrão de variegação não é uniforme para tôdas as fôlhas, enquanto no segundo grupo o padrão é semelhante para tôda a planta. Usualmente apenas alguns ramos das plantas do primeiro grupo são variegados. Observou-se algumas vezes que as duas fôlhas do mesmo verticilo têm padrões semelhantes de variegação. Encontraram-se também fôlhas variegadas nas quais a metade da lâmina é variegada ou mesmo albina, enquanto a outra metade apresenta a côr verde normal. Os dados genéticos obtidos, embora preliminares para a maioria das plantas variegadas em investigação, permitiram concluir que o padrão de variegação da planta 180, pertencente ao primeiro grupo, é herdado pelo citoplasma e não é transmitido pelo pólen. O padrão de variegação da planta 253 - 21, pertencente ao segundo grupo, no entanto, parece ser transmitido pelo polen. Leaf {{variegation}} {{in coffee}} plants {{is a relatively}} common abnormality, and variegated seedlings {{have been found to}} occur spontaneously in progenies of most varieties of Coffea arabica L. For this reason it is thought that variegated types should not be described as distinct varieties, as it was done before by Cramer. <b>Variegated</b> <b>coffee</b> plants can be grouped in two categories : first, those in which variegated leaves are normal in shape and texture, but do not show a uniform variegation pattern; and second, those in which malformation is present, but the variegation pattern is uniform throughout the entire plant. Usually only a few branches of plants in the first group are variegated, and it has been observed that sometimes the two leaves from the same node may show similar patterns of variegation. Variegated leaves have also been found in which half the blade is variegated or even albino, whereas the other half presents normal green color. Only preliminary genetical data are available for most of the variegated plants under investigation. It has been determined that the type of variegation of plant number 180, belonging to the first group, is inherited through the cytoplasm, but not through the pollen. The type of variegation of plant 253 - 21, of the second group, seems to be transmitted through the pollen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Citrus {{variegated}} chlorosis (CVC) {{and coffee}} stem atrophy (CSA) are important diseases in Brazil associated with closely-related strains of Xylella fastidiosa, but little is know about host overlapping {{and importance of}} citrus and coffee as inoculum sources of these strains. In this study, reciprocal-inoculation experiments were performed to determine if CVC and CSA isolates are biologically similar within citrus and coffee plants. These two hosts were mechanically inoculated with a CVC and a CSA isolate of X. fastidiosa at four concentrations ranging between 103 and 109 colony forming units CFU mL- 1. At two, four and eight months after inoculation, the infection efficiency and bacterial populations of the isolates in each host were determined by culturing. The CVC isolate infected both citrus and coffee plants, but developed lower populations in coffee. The CSA isolate did not colonize citrus. Inoculation of coffee plants with the CVC isolate resulted in low rates of infection and required an inoculum concentration ten-fold higher than that necessary to obtain a similar (25 %) rate of infection in citrus. The relatively low infection rates and bacterial numbers of the CVC isolate in coffee plants compared with those observed in citrus suggest that coffee is not a suitable host {{to serve as a}} source of inoculum of the CVC strain for primary spread to citrus or within coffee plantations.

The treatment consisted of three level concentrations of botanical pesticide(15 ml, 30 ml, and 60 ml/lof water), Beauveria bassiana(at a dose 100 g spore per ha), metidation spraying (2 ml formulation per litre of water) and two control treatments (with and without soap). The field experiment was arranged in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. The results showed that botanical pesticide at the concentration of 30. 0 ml stock solution per litre of water and applied four times with monthly interval was effective in controlling coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) and <b>coffee</b> mealy <b>bug</b> (Planococcus citri). The effectiveness was not significantly different compared to metidation and Beauveria bassianaat the dose of 0. 8 l and 100 g formulation per ha per application. Application of the botanical pesticide did not show negative effect on the usefull predatory insects and other arthropods population in coffee ecosystem.

40|$|Bed bugs are ectoparasites {{of humans}} and require a blood meal for their growth and reproduction. Since humans consume Ibuprofen as pain {{medication}} and drink <b>coffee</b> (caffeine), bed <b>bugs</b> are likely to acquire these drugs through blood feeding. In this study, we determined the biological effects of Ibuprofen and caffeine on bed bug feeding, fecundity and egg hatch. Five concentrations of Ibuprofen and caffeine were incorporated into reconstituted human blood (RHB). Control treatment had no Ibuprofen or caffeine. Each treatment had six replications. Groups of 20 adult bed bugs (10 males: 10 females) /treatment/replication were pre-weighed, allowed to feed for 45 minutes, and then reweighed. After feeding, bed bugs were transferred into a glass jar equipped with harborage and all the jars were placed in an environmental chamber undisturbed for three 7 -day intervals to determine fecundity and nymph emergence. Ibuprofen data showed that the mean mass of the 20 adult bed bugs increased by 0. 1074 g (125. 65...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Xylella fastidiosa is a {{plant pathogen}} {{with a history}} of economically damaging introductions of subspecies to regions where its other subspecies are native. Genetic evidence is presented demonstrating the introduction of two new taxa into Central America and their introgression into the native subspecies, X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa. The data are from 10 genetic outliers detected by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of isolates from Costa Rica. Six (five from oleander, one from coffee) defined a new sequence type (ST 53) that carried alleles at six of the eight loci sequenced (five of the seven MLST loci) diagnostic of the South American subspecies Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca which causes two economically damaging plant diseases, citrus <b>variegated</b> chlorosis and <b>coffee</b> leaf scorch. The two remaining loci of ST 53 carried alleles from {{what appears to be a}} new South American form of X. fastidiosa. Four isolates, classified as X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa, showed a low level of introgression of non-native DNA. One grapevine isolate showed introgression of an allele from X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca while the other three (from citrus and coffee) showed introgression of an allele with similar ancestry to the alleles of unknown origin in ST 53. The presence of X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca in Central America is troubling given its disease potential, and establishes another route for the introduction of this economically damaging subspecies into the US or elsewhere, a threat potentially compounded by the presence of a previously unknown form of X. fastidiosa...|$|R
