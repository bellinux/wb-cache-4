40|$|Nowadays, HCFC 22 {{is widely}} used in heat pump systems in China, which should be phased out in the future. Thus, {{eco-friendly}} mixture CO 2 /dimethylether is proposed to replace HCFC 22. Compared with pure CO 2 and pure dimethylether, the mixture can reduce the heat rejection pressure, and suppress the flammability and explosivity of pure dimethylether. According to the Chinese National Standards on heat pump water heater and space heating system, performances of the subcritical heat pump system are discussed and {{compared with those of}} the HCFC 22 system. It can be concluded that CO 2 /dimethylether mixture works efficiently as a refrigerant for heat pumps with a large heat-sink temperature rise. When mass fraction of dimethylether is increased, the heat rejection pressure is reduced. Under the nominal working condition, there is an optimal mixture mass fraction of 28 / 72 of CO 2 /dimethylether for water heater application under conventional condensation pressure, 3 / 97 for space heating application. For water heater application, both the heating coefficient of performance and <b>volumetric</b> <b>heating</b> capacity increase by 17. 90 % and 2. 74 %, respectively, compared with those of HCFC 22 systems.

50|$|Since {{the bulk}} density of a solid {{chemical}} element is strongly related to its molar mass (usually about 3 R per mole, as noted above), there exists noticeable inverse correlation between a solid’s density and its specific heat capacity on a per-mass basis. This {{is due to a}} very approximate tendency of atoms of most elements to be about the same size, despite much wider variations in density and atomic weight. These two factors (constancy of atomic volume and constancy of mole-specific heat capacity) result in a good correlation between the volume of any given solid chemical element and its total heat capacity. Another way of stating this, is that the volume-specific heat capacity (<b>volumetric</b> <b>heat</b> capacity) of solid elements is roughly a constant. The molar volume of solid elements is very roughly constant, and (even more reliably) so also is the molar heat capacity for most solid substances. These two factors determine the <b>volumetric</b> <b>heat</b> capacity, which as a bulk property may be striking in consistency.
