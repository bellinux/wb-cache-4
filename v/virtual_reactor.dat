40|$|In this work, a {{scalable}} algorithm for {{model calibration}} in nuclear engineering applications is presented and tested.

Experimental evidence suggests that adsorbed water on the surfaces of SiO 2 and A 1203 is responsible for enhancement in OH reactivity with mineral dust surfaces under high humidity conditions. Mass spectra of the gas-phase species produced from the heterogeneous reaction of OH with NaCl were obtained in order to characterize the reaction products and the kinetic mechanism. Evidence for gas-phase HC 1, supplemented with kinetics modeling and experiments on heterogeneous 03 reactivity strongly suggest that C 12, sole product of the heterogeneous reaction, transforms to HCI in the presence of H radicals. (cont.) The C 12 yields per OH collision were determined to be 0. 020 and 0. 022 at 0 % and 6 % of RH, respectively. Enhancement in C 12 production was observed under wet conditions, consistent with a measured chlorine deficit on the NaCl surface.

40|$|An {{essential}} component of the neutron transport solver is the resonance self-shielding calculation used to determine equivalence cross sections. The neutron transport code, MPACT, is currently using the subgroup self-shielding method, in which the method of characteristics (MOC) is used to solve purely absorbing fixed-source problems. Recent efforts incorporating multigroup kernels to the MOC solvers in MPACT have reduced runtime by roughly 2 ×. Applying the same concepts for self-shielding and developing a novel lumped parameter approach to MOC, substantial improvements have also been made to the self-shielding computational efficiency without sacrificing any accuracy. These new multigroup and lumped parameter capabilities have been demonstrated on two test cases: (1) a single lattice with quarter symmetry known as VERA (<b>Virtual</b> Environment for <b>Reactor</b> Applications) Progression Problem 2 a and (2) a two-dimensional quarter-core slice known as Problem 5 a- 2 D. From these cases, self-shielding computational time was reduced by roughly 3 – 4 ×, with a corresponding 15 – 20 % increase in overall memory burden. An azimuthal angle sensitivity study also shows that only half as many angles are needed, yielding an additional speedup of 2 ×. In total, the improvements yield roughly a 7 – 8 × speedup. Given these performance benefits, these approaches have been adopted as the default in MPACT...|$|R

In some cases, the external communication is still adopted [17]. However, the reliability and stability of microgrids will be affected substantially by the communication system. The complicated communication system would also increase the difficulties significantly in design and implementation of large scale microgrids.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effective}} {{cross sections}} (XSs) in the direct whole core calculation code nTRACER are {{evaluated by the}} equivalence theory-based resonance-integral-table method using the WIMS-based library {{as an alternative to}} the subgroup method. The background XSs, as well as the Dancoff correction factors, were evaluated by the enhanced neutron-current method. A method, with pointwise microscopic XSs on a union-lethargy grid, was used for the generation of resonance-interference factors (RIFs) for mixed resonant absorbers. This method was modified by the intermediate-resonance approximation by replacing the potential XSs for the non-absorbing moderator nuclides with the background XSs and neglecting the resonance-elastic scattering. The resonance-escape probability was implemented to incorporate the energy self-shielding effect in the spectrum. The XSs were improved using the proposed method as compared to the narrow resonance infinite mass-based method. The RIFs were improved by 1 % in 235 U, 7 % in 239 Pu, and > 2 % in 240 Pu. To account for thermal feedback, a new feature was incorporated with the interpolation of pre-generated RIFs at the multigroup level and the results compared with the conventional resonance-interference model. This method provided adequate results in terms of XSs and k-eff. The results were verified first by the comparison of RIFs with the exact RIFs, and then comparing the XSs with the McCARD calculations for the homogeneous configurations, with burned fuel containing a mixture of resonant nuclides at different burnups and temperatures. The RIFs and XSs for the mixture showed good agreement, which verified the accuracy of the RIF evaluation using the proposed method. The method was then verified by comparing the XSs for the <b>virtual</b> environment for <b>reactor</b> application-benchmark pin-cell problem, as well as the heterogeneous pin cell containing burned fuel with McCARD.

40|$|CFD {{simulation}} for a PWR is {{an important}} part for the development of Numerical <b>Virtual</b> <b>Reactor</b> (NVR) in Harbin Engineering University of China. CFD simulation can provide the detailed information of the flow and heat transfer process in a PWR. However, a large number of narrow flow channels with numerous complex structures (mixing vanes, dimples, springs, etc.) are located in a typical PWR. To obtain a better CFD simulation, the challenges created by these structural features were analyzed and some quantitative regularity and estimation were given in this paper. It was found that both computing resources and time are in great need for the CFD simulation of a whole reactor. These challenges have to be resolved, so two schemes were designed to assist/realize the reduction of the simulation burden on resources and time. One scheme is used to predict the combined efficiency of the simulation conditions (configuration of computing resources and application of simulation schemes), so it can assist the better choice/decision of the combination of the simulation conditions. The other scheme is based on the suitable simplification and modification, and it can directly reduce great computing burden...|$|E
40|$|SiC {{epitaxial}} films {{grown in}} an inverted chimney CVD reactor are analyzed and compared for growth rates, doping concentration and surface morphology using silane-propane-hydrogen and dichlorosilane (DCS) -propane-hydrogen chemistry systems. A general 1 -D analytical model {{is presented to}} estimate the diffusivity of precursor gases, boundary layer thickness and growth rates for both gas systems. Decomposition of precursor gases into Si growth species is investigated by a commercial simulation tool, <b>Virtual</b> <b>Reactor</b> (VR). DCS suppresses the formation of elemental Si at lower pressures, reduces precursor losses, and leads to increased growth rate. However, at higher pressures, even DCS decomposes into elemental Si, which contributes to high Si depletion, limiting the maximum achievable growth rate. Reduction of Si loss using DCS is verified by mass measurements of parasitic depositions in the injector tube. The doping concentration of the epitaxial film is governed by the effective C/Si ratio at the growth surface rather than the inlet C/Si ratio, which is examined at various growth pressures. In addition to the widely known Si-depletion, C-depletion is also shown to exist and it plays {{a critical role in}} determining the doping concentration at various growth conditions. Increased roughness for the DCS growth at higher pressures is addressed and attributed to excessive HCl etching at higher pressures.

40|$|Plans to {{introduce}} pilot lines or fabs for 300 mm processing are in progress. The IC technology is simultaneously moving towards 0. 25 / 0. 18 micron. The convergence {{of these two}} trends places unprecedented stringent demands on processes and equipments. More than ever, computational modeling is called upon to play a complementary role in equipment and process design. The pace in hardware/process development needs a matching pace in software development: an aggressive move towards developing "virtual reactors" is desirable and essential to reduce design cycle and costs. This goal has three elements: reactor scale model, feature level model, and database of physical/chemical properties. With these elements coupled, the complete model should function as a design aid in a CAD environment. This talk would aim at the description of various elements. At the reactor level, continuum, DSMC(or particle) and hybrid models will be discussed and compared using examples of plasma and thermal process simulations. In microtopography evolution, approaches such as level set methods compete with conventional geometric models. Regardless of the approach, the reliance on empricism is to be eliminated through coupling to reactor model and computational surface science. This coupling poses challenging issues of orders of magnitude variation in length and time scales. Finally, database development has fallen behind; current situation is rapidly aggravated by the ever newer chemistries emerging to meet process metrics. The <b>virtual</b> <b>reactor</b> would be a useless concept without an accompanying reliable database that consists of: thermal reaction pathways and rate constants, electron-molecule cross sections, thermochemical properties, transport properties, and finally, surface data on the interaction of radicals, atoms and ions with various surfaces.

40|$|Two MCNP models ({{detailed}} and approximated) of University of Maryland Training Reactor were created. The detailed model {{attempted to}} simulate the reactor according to engineering specifications while the simplified model eliminated all structural materials {{above and below the}} core. Neutron flux spectrum calculations for both models within the core showed that the results obtained from both models agreed within less than 0. 5 %. It was concluded that reactors equipped with standard TRIGA fuels enriched to 20 percent in uranium- 235 can be modeled with all structures above and below the core eliminated entirely from the model without increasing the error due to geometry modeling simplifications of the core. In TRIGA reactors supplied with standard TRIGA fuels enriched to 20 percent in U- 235, the graphite reflectors above and below the fuel act as "neutron energy regulators. " Neutrons reflected back into the core through the graphite reflectors quickly become thermalized even if their energies were altered due to the change in materials properties above and below the core. Both MCNP models results agree well with measured data. It was also found that simplification in the target geometry leads to substantial uncertainty in the calculated results. The neutron energy spectrum, thermal flux, and total flux were calculated at the thermal column access plug face; in the pneumatic transfer system rabbit, and on top and bottom sections of the most center fuel element. The thermal flux and the total flux at the thermal column access plug face both agreed with measured data within a 5 % uncertainty. The thermal flux, fast flux, and the total flux in the rabbit differ by 18. 8 %, 35 %, and 5. 7 % respectively, from the measured data. The relatively high uncertainty (in the neutron energy distribution but not the total neutron flux) was attributed to the use of air as the target irradiated inside the rabbit. For such a thin target (15 mg/cm 2), a precise neutron balance between reflection and absorption events is difficult to obtain; that will alter the thermal or fast flux values. The contribution of this work to the reactor users is that a <b>virtual</b> <b>reactor</b> model that compared well with experiment is created. Experiments utilizing the reactor experimental facilities (thermal column, through tube, pneumatic transfer system rabbit, and beam ports) can now be optimized before they are executed. The contribution of this work to the research reactor community at is that research reactors equipped with standard TRIGA fuels can be modeled with core geometry approximations, such as these adopted in this work, without affecting the precision and accuracy of the Monte Carlo calculations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work the existente of mass {{transfer}} limitations in slurry, photocatalytic reactors is studied. Experimental validation {{is made in}} a flat plate reactor {{that is part of}} a recycling system. The reactor is described with a mathematical model previously developed [Ballari et al., 2008 a. Chemical Engineering Journal 136, 50], considering a transient, two-dimensional mass balance (TDM). The complete reactor model was developed to show the existence of these effects, which result from the occurrence of concentration gradients in reaction space. They develop when these reactors are operated under some operating conditions whose effects should be always analyzed before assuming the validity of existence of perfect mixing in reaction space. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) was the adopted model compound. To solve TDM, a kinetic expression for DCA acid was determined before under well mixed conditions [Ballari et al., 2009. Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research 48 (4), 1847]. The studied variables are flow rate, catalyst loading, and irradiation rates. The experimental data agree quite well when they are interpreted in terms of the two-dimensional model (TDM) regardless of the operating mode. The perfect mixing model (PMM), normally employed to describe this and other types of slurry photoreactors, does not have the same level of universal application; i. e. it is restricted to perfect mixing, but in many cases far simpler to use. However, it can be concluded that when the photocatalytic reaction is not fast, employing catalyst loadings below 1 gL– 1, irradiation rates at the reactor wall below 1 x 10 x- 6 Einstein cm- 2 s- 1 and good mixing operation (Re 41700) it will be always safe to assume that mass transport limitations in the bulk of the fluid are non existent. In a typical batch reactor the above flow conditions are equivalent to very intense mixing. If the catalyst concentration is in creased, the mixing conditions should be improved in the same proportion. Within limits, higher solid loadings can be compensated with lower irradiation rates[Ballarietal., 2008 a. Chemical Engineering Journal 136, 50]. In addition, with the validated model, additional simulations are shown, operating the reactor under different <b>virtual</b> <b>reactor</b> thicknesses to widen amplitude of the reached conclusions. These findings Hill be useful in kinetic studies to prevent incursion in certain ranges of experimental conditions that could lead to erroneous interpretation of the obtained kinetic data.
