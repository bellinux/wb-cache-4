60|$|D. Arcos. Our {{soldiers}} marched {{together on}} the plain; We two rode on, and left them far behind, Till, coming where we found the <b>valley</b> <b>wind,</b> We saw these Moors; who, swiftly as they could, Ran on to gain the covert of a wood. This we observed; and, having crossed their way, The lady, out of breath, was forced to stay: The man then stood, and straight his faulchion drew; Then told us, we in vain did those pursue, Whom their ill fortune to despair did drive, And yet, whom we should never take alive. Neglecting this, the master straight spurred on; But the active Moor his horse's shock did shun, And, ere his rider from his reach could go, Finished the combat with one deadly blow. I, to revenge my friend, prepared to fight; But now our foremost men were come in sight, Who soon would have dispatched him on the place, Had I not saved him from a death so base, And brought him to attend your royal doom.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurements from Whitehorse upper-air {{and nearby}} mountaintop {{stations}} were analyzed {{with a focus}} on wind energy development in the region. Fifty years of measurements indicate the region has become warmer and windier. Measurements at the upper-air station have shown increases of 2. 7 ˚C for surface temperature and 1 m s- 1 for mid-valley winds over the past 50 years (1956 – 2005). The winters have warmed more dramatically than the summers. Winter temperature inversions have become shallower, and a mid-valley winter jet has become a predominant feature. Wind data for 2001 – 05 indicate that a minimum annual mean wind speed of 6 m s- 1 begins at about 150 m above the Whitehorse valley floor, or 850 m above sea level. At this elevation and higher, wind speeds reach a maximum in December and a minimum in July. The predominant wind direction above the mountaintops was from the southwest, while stations within the Whitehorse <b>Valley</b> recorded <b>winds</b> from the south-southeast. Stations that were more exposed to the southwest reported more predominant winds from this direction. An analysis of the relationship between geostrophic and <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> concluded that, relative to <b>winds</b> aloft, <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> were as strong in parallel valleys as they were in perpendicular valleys. The pressure gradients associated with the winds aloft were the dominant forcing mechanism for winds in a perpendicular <b>valley.</b> Geostrophic <b>winds</b> that were parallel to the valley forced the <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> along the same direction through a downward momentum transport. Wintertime inversions suppress the downward momentum transport, but pressure-driven winds are only indirectly modulated by stratification (because of turbulent friction, which is likely to be suppressed by stable stratification) and so are less sensitive to that factor.

40|$|An {{observational}} dataset from a wintertime field {{campaign in}} the Inn Valley, Austria, is analysed in order to study mechanisms of air pollution transport in an Alpine valley. The results illustrate three types of mechanisms: transport by a density current, back-and-forth transport by <b>valley</b> <b>winds,</b> and transport by slope winds. The first type is associated with an air mass difference along the valley. Cooler air located in {{the lower part of}} the valley behaves like a density current and produces the advection of pollutants by upvalley winds. In the second type, strong horizontal gradients in pollution concentrations exist close to ground. Multiple wind reversals result in a back-and-forth transport of pollutants by weak <b>valley</b> <b>winds.</b> In the third type, upslope winds during daytime decrease low-level pollution concentrations and cause the formation of elevated pollution layers...|$|R

40|$|Diurnal {{mountain}} wind systems are thermally driven wind systems {{produced by the}} buoyancy effects associated with the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling over mountainous terrain. This project evaluates the potential of these winds for generation of wind energy, analysing the effect of different geometric and climatic parameters on the mountainous wind systems, and the considering the performance of wind turbines under these conditions. The suitable turbines will often be of small scale due to the usually weak nature of these winds. This project was conceived as an initial approach to a more ambitious research the purpose {{of which is to}} study the feasibility of installing arrays of wind turbines in dams, as a novel alternative to produce renewable energy. This solution, if proven feasible, would provide a second, complementary use of the existing infrastructures in dams for management and distribution of hydroelectric energy. The effects of the thermal difference, height, slope angle, heating of the mountain, ambient stability and other factors relevant to the features of slope and <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> have been further examined. For this purpose, two theoretical models of slope <b>winds</b> and <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> have been studied and used, which provided estimated values of wind speed. These data were then used to compute the wind energy that could be potentially produced with several models of turbines. The results show that <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> might be used as a new alternative in the renewable energy field under specific meteorological and geographical conditions. However, if focusing only on the Mediterranean region, in certain areas, the winds might not be strong enough to produce significant wind energy in an efficient way. <b>Valley</b> <b>winds</b> may reach wind speeds up to 7. 5 ms- 1, using fixed atmospheric conditions, similar to those found in the Mediterranean region, producing between 0. 2 and 0. 87 MW per year depending on the performance of the different turbines studied in this project...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{structure}} of two Himalayan glacial lakes, Tsho Rolpa and Imja {{in the eastern}} Nepal, was examined by observations in the pre-monsoon seasons of 1996 and 1997. Tsho Rolpa had an isothermal mixed layer at water depths of 0 – 20 m, whereas Imja did not possess such an isothermal layer. This difference in the thermal structure is explained by the condition that diurnal <b>valley</b> <b>winds,</b> producing wind-driven currents, blow strongly near the water surface of Tsho Rolpa, but very weakly near that of Imja. The wind observations above or near the end moraine indicated that a daily wind system of strong, diurnal <b>valley</b> <b>winds</b> and weak, nocturnal mountain winds is common to the lakes. It was suggested that {{with respect to the}} <b>valley</b> <b>winds,</b> the weak winds near the surface of Imja result from topographic screening effects of the upwind dead-ice zone and end moraine 20 – 25 m higher than the water surface. In order to ascertain the topographic effects, three-dimensional numerical simulation of airflow was carried out by making topographic models of actual size in the calculation domain, corresponding to Tsho Rolpa and Imja and their surrounding topography. The simulation revealed that, when winds blow at constant velocities of 1 – 5 m s− 1 at 2 m above the points corresponding to the weather stations, the wind velocity at 2 m above the water surface for Imja is 33 – 42 % smaller than for Tsho Rolpa. With increasing heights of the end moraine and dead-ice zone, the wind velocity near the lake surface efficiently decreased by decreasing the lake length from 3. 1 or 2. 2 km to 1. 2 km...|$|R
