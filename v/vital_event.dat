5000|$|Civil {{registration}} {{is the system}} by which a government records the vital events (births, marriages, and deaths) of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a civil registry , civil register (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a <b>vital</b> <b>event),</b> vital records, and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a bureau of vital statistics, registry of vital records and statistics, registrar, registry, register, registry office (officially register office [...] ), or population registry. The primary purpose of civil {{registration is}} to create a legal document {{that can be used to}} establish and protect the rights of individuals.

In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was France in 1539, using the Catholic Church registers, Sweden followed in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden on the demand of the Swedish king.|$|E
40|$|Thesis(M. P. H.) [...] University of Washington, 1991 <b>Vital</b> <b>event</b> {{statistics}} such as infant {{births and}} infant mortality rates {{are used by}} health professionals {{for a wide variety}} of purposes. Infant births and mortality rates are used for program planning and evaluation at the local, state, and federal levels. For example, the infant mortality rate is regarded as a summary measure of infant health, and in its broadest use, a measure of the quality of Jtfe in a society. Comparing infant mortality rates between groups can help describe how factors present before, during, and after pregnancy affect the developing fetus and newborn. Studying trends through time allows further advancement in knowledge about how best to prevent morbidity and mortality, and how to promote a healthy society. Implicit in the use of <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> statistics is the assumption that the information is collected and analyzed correctly. Without accurate data, credible conclusions are not possible. Information on births is subject to limitations, but to a lesser extent than mortality information, since birth records include information on not only the child, but also the mother and father. Infant death records provide information only on the infant. An important problem in interpreting <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> information results from the apparent lack of information put into the records to verify characteristics such as race...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In {{clinical}} and cohort research, mortality estimates are often derived from manual reports generated by physicians or electronic reports from <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> registries. We examined {{the rate of}} underreporting of deaths by manual methods as compared with electronic reports from a <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> registry. Methods The retrospective analyses included deaths among participants registered in an observational cohort who initiated highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) between August 1, 1996 and June 30, 2006. Deaths were routinely reported manually by physicians and through annual electronic record linkages with a population-based <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> registry. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to assess independent predictors of death reporting by manual methods. Results Of the 3, 116 individuals included in the analyses, 622 (20. 0 %) died during follow-up. Manual reporting by physicians only identified 377 (60. 6 %), while electronic linkages captured 598 (96. 1 %) of all deaths. Multivariate analysis indicated that deaths among individuals with lower CD 4 cell count, higher HIV plasma viral load, a history of injection drug use, and {{under the care of}} an HIV-experienced physicians {{were more likely to be}} reported manually. Furthermore, non-accidental deaths were more likely to be reported manually, and manual reporting of deaths increased over time. Conclusions Relying only on manual reports to ascertain deaths significantly underestimates the total number of deaths in the population. This can generate important biases when evaluating the impact of therapeutic interventions in the populational setting. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, development, and test {{results of a}} tool for adjusting properties of emergent environment maps automatically according to a given scenario. Adjusting properties for a scenario allows a specific scene to take place while still enables players to meddle with emergent maps. The tool uses genetic algorithm and steepest ascent hill-climbing to learn and adjust map properties. Using the proposed tool, the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive parameter adjustments when setting up scenarios in emergent environment maps is greatly reduced. The tool works by converting the paths of events created by users (i. e., the spreading of fire and the flow of water) for a map to {{the properties of the}} map that plays out the scenario set by the given paths of events. <b>Vital</b> <b>event</b> points are preserved while event points outside the given scenario are minimized.

40|$|Most low-income {{countries}} lack complete and accurate vital registration systems. As a result, measures of under-five mortality rates rely mostly on household surveys. In collaboration with partners in Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, and Mali, we assessed the completeness {{and accuracy of}} reporting of births and deaths by community-based health workers, and the accuracy of annualized under-five mortality rate estimates derived from these data. Here we report on results from Ethiopia, Malawi and Mali. In all three countries, community health workers (CHWs) were trained, equipped and supported to report pregnancies, births and deaths within defined geographic areas {{over a period of}} at least fifteen months. In-country institutions collected these data every month. At each study site, we administered a full birth history (FBH) or full pregnancy history (FPH), to women of reproductive age via a census of households in Mali and via household surveys in Ethiopia and Malawi. Using these FBHs/FPHs as a validation data source, we assessed the completeness of the counts of births and deaths and the accuracy of under-five, infant, and neonatal mortality rates from the community-based method against the retrospective FBH/FPH for rolling twelve-month periods. For each method we calculated total cost, average annual cost per 1, 000 population, and average cost per <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> reported. On average, CHWs submitted monthly <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> reports for over 95 percent of catchment areas in Ethiopia and Malawi, and for 100 percent of catchment areas in Mali. The completeness of vital events reporting by CHWs varied: we estimated that 30 %- 90 % of annualized expected births (i. e. the number of births estimated using a FPH) were documented by CHWs and 22 %- 91 % of annualized expected under-five deaths were documented by CHWs. Resulting annualized under-five mortality rates based on the CHW vital events reporting were, on average, under-estimated by 28 % in Ethiopia, 32 % in Malawi, and 9 % in Mali relative to comparable FPHs. Costs per <b>vital</b> <b>event</b> reported ranged from $ 21 in Malawi to $ 149 in Mali. Our findings in Mali suggest that CHWs can collect complete and high-quality vital events data useful for monitoring annual changes in under-five mortality rates. Both the supervision of CHWs in Mali and the rigor of the associated field-based data quality checks were of a high standard, {{and the size of the}} pilot area in Mali was small (comprising of approximately 53, 205 residents in 4, 200 households). Hence, there are remaining questions about whether this level of vital events reporting completeness and data quality could be maintained if the approach was implemented at scale. Our experience in Malawi and Ethiopia suggests that, in some settings, establishing and maintaining the completeness and quality of vital events reporting by CHWs over time is challenging. In this sense, our evaluation in Mali falls closer to that of an efficacy study, whereas our evaluations in Ethiopia and Malawi are more akin to an effectiveness study. Our overall findings suggest that no one-size-fits-all approach will be successful in guaranteeing complete and accurate reporting of vital events by CHWs...|$|E
