This paper investigates the vibration of composite archery arrows through a finite difference model based on Euler–Bernoulli theory, and a three-dimensional finite element modal analysis. Results from the numerical simulations are compared to experimental measurements using a Polytec scanning laser Doppler vibrometer (PSV- 400).

40|$|In {{the present}} {{manuscript}} {{an approach to}} modelling and simulation of nanocones has been suggested for their use as sensing mediums. The <b>vibrational</b> <b>behaviours</b> of bridged and cantilever Single-Walled Carbon nanocones are modelled using three-dimensional elastic beams of carbon- carbon bonds and atomic masses. Also, the dynamic analysis of bridged and cantilever configurations of these nanocones with different disclination angles of 60 °, 120 °, 180 °, and 240 ° is performed to evaluate the variation in stiffness with different configurations. The analysis also exhibits the effect {{of change in the}} length of nanocones on the vibrational frequencies. For the said purpose a mass equivalent to a carbon atom has been added at the nodes. It is observed that increasing side length of a Single-Walled Carbon nanocones with a constant apex angle results in a reduction in the fundamental frequency. It is also clear from the results that Single-Walled Carbon nanocones with larger apex angles exhibit smaller values of fundamental frequencies. The results suggest that smaller lengths of nanocones are better candidates for sensing applications as they exhibit substantial change in the fundamental frequencies. It can be stated that with higher number of bonds and atoms Single-Walled Carbon nanocones undergoes substantial bending with large declination angle which can be considered as an important finding...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric icing {{presents}} serious {{challenges to}} the development of wind power of the wind energy industry in cold regions. The potential detrimental impact on the safe operation of wind turbines and the energy harvest hasn???t been fully understood and requires further investigation. This thesis presents the research on icing profiles under different weather conditions and their impact on natural frequency, fatigue life, and lift and drag of the wind turbine blade. The research aims to develop a further understanding of the effect of atmospheric ice accretion on the structural integrity and aerodynamic performance of wind turbine blades through numerical and aerodynamic investigations to address the challenges facing the industry. A 5 -MW NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) wind turbine blade was selected for this study, due to availability of required geometric design parameters and experimental data for verification. The turbine rotor and its three blades were modelled and numerically simulated with commercial finite element software ANSYS. Three icing scenarios were chosen according to the ISO Standard and the corresponding icing profiles were developed to investigate their influence on <b>vibrational</b> <b>behaviours</b> of the wind turbine blade and rotor under different weather conditions. Icing loads were applied on {{the leading edge of the}} blade and natural frequency results were compared between clean and iced blades. It was found that harsh icing weather drove the natural frequency down to the near resonance limit, which could lead to significant issue on structural integrity of the wind turbine. The effect of atmospheric ice accretion with additional load due to varying wind speeds on the fatigue life of the wind turbine blade has been investigated. Significant reduction of fatigue life was found due to the increase of the von Mises stresses. Finally, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was carried out to investigate the effect of atmospheric ice accretion on the aerodynamic performance of typical 1 -MW and 5 -MW wind turbine blades. Results of the drag and lift coefficients and power production under different icing scenarios were obtained for five angles of attack. Compared with the results of the clean aerofoil profile, remarkable reduction in the power generation was observed due to the accreted ice at various aerofoil sections in the spanwise direction of the blade, demonstrating the detrimental impact of atmospheric icing on energy harvest for the wind energy industry...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{vibrational}} characteristics of thin, mass-loaded, stepped plates are investigated. The {{dimensions of the}} plates are chosen so that the steps {{can be thought of}} as representing the periodically placed stiffeners commonly found in many engineering structures. To achieve this, a classical analytical approach for the analysis of the vibration of a simply supported, stepped plate is first considered. Next, a method for the analysis of such plates carrying concentrated masses is reviewed. The above two analytical methods are then combined to analyse the <b>vibrational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of thin, simply supported and mass-loaded stepped plates. To assess the accuracy of these methods, the resultant frequency responses of the unloaded plate are compared with the Dynamic Stiffness method [1] and those for both the unloaded and mass loaded plates with finite element calculations. For a uniform, mass-loaded plate, there is perfect agreement between the frequency responses obtained from these methods. For the mass-loaded, stepped plate, the agreement is not so complete, the reasons for which are discussed in the paper. The final part of the paper deals with optimisation of the mass positions in order to improve the <b>vibrational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the plate. In this work, the integral of the frequency response function of the mass-loaded plate over a frequency range containing some 10 – 15 natural frequencies is regarded as the objective function. The drive and response points are chosen to lie at opposite ends of a plate with high aspect ratio and transverse stiffeners, so that minimizing the frequency response is equivalent to designing vibration isolation characteristics into the plate. The Genetic Algorithm, which is an evolutionary optimization method, is employed to produce the required designs. It is demonstrated that the optimized mass positions significantly improve the <b>vibrational</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the plate...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{presenting}} the ground-structure interaction for plates {{involved in the}} tramway railroad. This analytical modelling allows us {{to take into account}} the vibration of several finite plates lying on a stratified ground. The plates interact with each other via the ground. The ground behaviour, in response to the plate vibration, is described thanks to Navier equations, the one of the flexural plates with the Kirchhoff-Loves equation. The plate vibrations are decomposed in modal series of the flexural plate modes. The ground vibrational field is classically decomposed with the Helmholtz potentials and transformed in the Fourier domain. This leads to the calculation of ground cross-modal impedances re{{presenting the}} influence of the underlying ground on each plate mode. Moreover since several plates are considered, these impedances take into account the interaction between the plates due to the propagation in the underlying ground. This allows us to explain the <b>vibrational</b> plate <b>behaviour</b> of a single plate and its effects on the ground free surface at a characteristic distance and to compare with the case where a companion plate is lying parallel and close to the first. Moreover, this modelling allows us to calculate the stress field under both plates and especially below the second one representing building foundations. The calculation of the stress field under the plates can be useful for who wants to proceed to vibration calculation in buildings, using finit element modelling or SEA method (Statistical Energy Analysis), since mechanical injected powers can be easily deduced...|$|R
40|$|We {{treat the}} {{kinetics}} {{of the three}} dominant species in a hydrogen plasma expansion, which was studied using various laser spectroscopic techniques. Whereas the ground-state H/sub 2 / molecules expand like a normal gas, the behaviour of H atoms and ro-vibrationally excited molecules is considerably altered {{as a consequence of}} their reactivity. The hydrogen atoms are primarily lost via surface association. In the source, H atoms are lost {{on the surface of the}} nozzle, reducing the atomic flux, and in the expansion, the H atoms diffuse out due to large H atom concentration gradients between the plasma and the background that exists as a result of surface association on the vessel walls. The loss process of H atoms in the nozzle, surface association, is the main production process of H/sub 2 / molecules with high rotational and <b>vibrational</b> excitation. The <b>behaviour</b> of these ro-vibrationally excited H/sub 2 / molecules in the expansion shows the relaxation process from the high temperature in the upstream region to the low temperature of the downstream region. The lower rotational levels (J 2 ̆ 6 lt; 5) adapt to the local temperature as expected, but the higher levels (J 2 ̆ 6 gt; 7) do not because of the large energy spacing between the hydrogen rotational levels. The consequence of this high rotational excitation is demonstrated in the dissociative attachment of electrons to H/sub 2...|$|R

Most of the time, each instrument {{is the only}} representation left of a style or a historical period.

Nevertheless, the museum audience has no way to evaluate the acoustical properties of these historical instruments except when a copy (or fac-simile) is ordered. This paper intends to apply a global vibrational analysis on the harp corpus of the Musée de la musique to understand the consequences on the potential acoustical behaviour of the different construction techniques used by two famous harp makers, Erard and Cousineau. The idea is to survey the whole corpus, using the least invasive techniques which are still effective when applied to instruments in a conservation state and to define a vibrational descriptor able to represent different making strategies from the acoustical point of view.

The rate coefficients OH/OD(v= 1, 2, 3) + SO₂, k₁, over the temperature range 295 – 810 K {{were used to determine}} the limiting high pressure limit, k₁∞.

In the present case, however, the rate coefficients showed an additional fast removal contribution as evidenced by the increase in k₁ with <b>vibrational</b> level; this <b>behaviour</b> together with its temperature dependence is consistent with the existence of a weakly bound complex on the potential energy surface prior to adduct formation.

Several new isomers have been established and characterised near the proton drip line using a recoil isomer tagging technique at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. The latest experiments have been performed with a modified setup where the standard GREAT focal‐plane double‐sided silicon‐strip detector was changed to a dual multi‐wire proportional‐counter arrangement. This new setup has improved capability for short‐lived isomer studies where large focal‐plane rates can be tolerated. The results of key recent experiments for nuclei situated above (153 Yb, 152 Tm) and below (144 Ho, 142 Tb) the N  =   82 shell gap were presented.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{calculations}} of the vibrational spectra appropriate to structural {{models of the}} elemental amorphous semiconductors a-Ge, a-As and a-Se are presented. Simple dynamical models, involving restoring forces for bond length and angle variations only, provide information on the structure-dependence of the vibrational spectra and hence on the typical structures of the real materials. Calculations are presented for four-fold coordinated continuous random network (CRN) models of a-Ge, for a three-fold coordinated CRN model of a-As and for isolated- and interacting-chain models of a-Se. In order to obtain a more realistic description of the structure and <b>vibrational</b> and electronic <b>behaviour</b> of a-Ge, calculations of the vibrational and electronic spectra {{of a series of}} seven CRS models are presented. The results show that the form of the vibrational spectrum is determined by the angular distortions whereas the form of the electronic spectrum is determined by the topology of the corresponding network. The vibrational spectra calculated using the more realistic dynamical model for a-Ge are also significantly different to those obtained previously using simple bond stretching and bending forces only. The results are discussed in relation to the structure of a-Ge and amorphous III-V compounds such as a-GaAs, the existence of an 'excess specific heat' at low temperatures in amorphous semiconductors, the applicability of such calculations to other systems and the modifications of the method for the calculations of infra-red and Raman spectra appropriate to the structural models.

40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} with superior physical properties hold promise {{for the development}} of novel nanodevices. Full potential applications of such advanced materials require accurate characterization of their physical properties, which in turn necessitates the development of computer-based simulations along with novel experimental techniques. Since controlled experiments are difficult for nanoscale materials and atomic studies are computationally expensive, continuum mechanics-based simulations of nanomaterials and nanostructures have become the focal points of computational nano-science and materials modelling. In this study, emphasis is given to predicting the mechanical behaviour of carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, nanowire (NW), and nanowire encapsulated in carbon nanotube (NW@CNT), which are important nanostructures in a variety of real-world applications such as aerospace, automotive, MEMS/NEMS, and electronics. Using elastic continuum models, nonlinear transverse vibration and postbuckling behaviour of CNTs and graphenes embedded in polymer medium is studied. The source of nonlinearity comes from the van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers as well as between surrounding polymer medium and carbon-based nanostructure, in which the latter is investigated {{for the first time in}} literature. Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories are employed to model CNTs while classic Kirchhoff plate theory is used to model graphene sheets (GSs). A nonlinear function in terms of the graphene or CNT deflection is derived from the interfacial cohesive law to describe the interfacial interactions preserving true nonlinear nature of the vdW forces. Harmonic balance method is successfully employed to solve the nonlinear governing equations and provide parametric and explicit equations for predicting nonlinear resonant frequencies and postbuckling equilibrium path of the embedded CNTs and GSs. Unlike linear analysis results, the resonant frequencies and postbuckling loads are deflection dependent. The surrounding medium effect on the <b>vibrational</b> and buckling <b>behaviour</b> of these embedded carbon-based nanostructures have been studied systematically. Regarding NWs and NW@CNTs, the effects of surface elasticity and residual surface stress on the stiffness, vibration and buckling of these nano structured materials are investigated using Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam models to reveal their size-dependent properties. The vdW interactions between the NW and CNT at the interface of NW@CNT are accurately described by using the cohesive Law. Effects of axial load, size, boundary conditions and mode shape number on the vibration and buckling of above mentioned nanostructures are discussed in detail. The quantitative and parametric analysis in this study may contribute to a better understanding on the mechanical behaviour of these nanostructures, thus leading to a better design in real applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the <b>vibrational</b> and {{acoustic}} <b>behaviour</b> {{of a product}} has become an important criterion in the design process in the machine industry {{as well as in}} the transportation industry. The noise and vibration properties do not only influence the perceived quality of a product, human exposure to noise and vibration is also a health concern of growing importance. Since numerical tools reduce the need for very expensive and time-consuming physical prototype testing, they allow to take the vibro-acoustic properties of a product into account early in the design process, leading to better products as outcomes from shorter and more cost effective design cycles. The ideal numerical tool should be applicable to the whole frequency range of interest, provide accurate results within reasonable computational efforts and be representative for the actual dynamic behaviour. The tools most frequently used for steady-state dynamic analysis, the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA), are limited to low and high frequency applications, respectively. Between those application ranges, there exists a so-called mid frequency gap, in which the typical wavelengths are neither large nor small as compared to the problem dimensions. This leads to a too high computational load for the FEM and a lack of randomness in the response for SEA to be generally applicable. Nevertheless, the effects of non-determinism, i. e. product variability and uncertainty, can be of major importance in this region as the response of a product becomes increasingly sensitive to small variations with increasing frequency. About 15 years ago, research was started on the development of the Wave Based Method (WBM), a novel deterministic simulation technique for the solution of steady-state dynamic problems. Thanks to its selection of wave-like functions to represent the system response, a highly efficient deterministic technique is obtained. As a result, it is able to extend the frequency range of the FEM. However, the WBM faces geometrical limitations and only gives deterministic results, of which the representativeness reduces in the mid frequency range. Therefore, this work focuses on those two aspects. A first part aims at reducing the geometrical limitations of the WBM for structural problems and this by allowing local inhomogeneities. A multi-level framework for acoustic scattering problems is extended to bounded structural problems and allows problems with holes or inclusions to be easily modelled. A second framework introduces point connections, leading to an efficient technique for simulation and optimisation of active or passive vibration control treatments. A second part aims at efficiently modelling the effects of non-determinism in the mid frequency range. In a first step, a sensitivity study is performed to create a statistical ensemble using only the WBM for such non-determinism. In a second step, a hybrid WBM-SEA has been developed as an extension of an existing hybrid FEM-SEA, in order to model typical mid frequency problems in which some parts behave deterministically, while others behave statistically, and each should be modelled accordingly. Both goals have led to a significant step forward in the applicability of the WBM for mid frequency dynamic problems. status: publishe...|$|R

By the late 1970 ’s, the presence of intruder states and shape coexistence were identified, but the underlying vibrational nature remained intact. More recently, the robustness of the multiphonon states was questioned, prompting detailed spectroscopic investigations at a number of facilities, including the use of the (n, n'γ) reaction and β-decay studies with modern γ-ray spectrometers. Combining results from these studies, a re-examination {{of the structure of the}} mid-shell Cd isotopes suggests that they may represent deformed γ-soft rotors rather than spherical vibrators...|$|E
40|$|The <b>vibrational</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{of a long}} haulage truck {{has been}} {{investigated}} both on roads of strongly varying quality and on hydrodynamic test benches. The results are necessary to show {{the state of the}} art, to draw up a precise specification book for the active suspension concerning frequency range, spring travel, power, etc., and to validate the simulation model to be configurated. As a principle problem of passive truck suspensions, {{it turned out that the}} resonance frequencies of chassis, cab and seat are too close to each other.
