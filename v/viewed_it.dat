The album peaked at number 5 on the Top Jazz Albums chart and received generally positive reviews from most music critics, despite some criticism from writers who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> as a cash-in compilation from the release's label. The album was later compiled, along with other For Lovers titles, onto the box set The Complete Verve for Lovers Collection.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{was among}} the councilman and {{citizens}} who expressed outrage at the light punishment issued by the mayor's office over a multimillion-dollar city contract scheme.

5|$|The Great Silences soundtrack was {{composed}} by Ennio Morricone, Corbucci's frequent musical collaborator since Navajo Joe, and conducted by Bruno Nicolai.

The soundtrack was released on CD, also containing five tracks from Morricone's score for That Splendid November, in 1995, 2005 and 2014. A limited edition LP (consisting of 500 copies) was released by Dagored in April 2016.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E

Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop thinking about it, in contrast to Bathurst, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

The album also reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, UK Albums Chart and Australian Albums Chart, and has sold five million units worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E

Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, who <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E

5|$|Louise {{inspired}} {{the establishment of}} a conservative women's organization known as Königin-Luise-Bund, often shortened to Luisenbund ("Queen Louise League") in which her person achieved an almost cult-like status. The group's main purpose was to promote patriotic feelings among German women, and it emphasized the family and German morality. The Königin-Luise-Bund was active {{during the time of the}} Weimar Republic and the first years of the Third Reich. Despite having actively supported the National Socialist movement since its early stages all through their accession to power in 1933, the Queen Louise League was nonetheless disbanded by the Nazis in 1934, as they <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> as a hostile organization.|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1925, Houphouët {{began his}} career as a doctor's aide at a {{hospital}} in Abidjan, where he founded an association of indigenous medical personnel. This undertaking proved short-lived as the colonial administration <b>viewed</b> <b>it</b> unsympathetically, considering it a trade union. As a consequence, they decided to move Houphouët to a lesser hospital in Guiglo on 27 April 1927. After he proved his considerable talents, however, he was promoted on 17 September 1929 to a post in Abengourou, which until then had been reserved for Europeans. At Abengourou, Houphouët witnessed the mistreatment of indigenous cocoa farmers by the colonists.|$|E
