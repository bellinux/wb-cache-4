5|$|Agent Orange was to {{a lesser}} extent used outside <b>Vietnam.</b> Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia was also sprayed with Agent Orange during the <b>Vietnam</b> War because forests on the border with <b>Vietnam</b> were used by the Vietcong.

30|$|The {{increases}} in <b>Vietnam’s</b> HS 3006 imports from the EU would be modest in both value and growth rate in two scenarios (Table  5), equivalent to about USD 0.4 million at 1.2  % growth rate. However, <b>Vietnam’s</b> integration with the TPP and ASEAN +  3 nations would affect greater on <b>Vietnam’s</b> imports of HS 3006 than imports of HS 3005 from the EU. In fact, <b>Vietnam’s</b> imports of HS 3006 from the EU in scenario 2 decrease by 12.5  % compared to scenario 1 whereas this figure for HS 3005 is only 3.9  %. The US {{would be the}} new destination substituting substantially the EU in <b>Vietnam’s</b> imports of HS 3006.

By the end of 1972 the Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{visit was}} a highmark in {{relations}} between Australia and South <b>Vietnam.</b> Over time, Diệm became unpopular with his foreign allies, {{who began to}} criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By {{the time of his}} assassination, he had little support. Australia later sent troops to support South <b>Vietnam</b> in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North <b>Vietnam</b> and opposition to the <b>Vietnam</b> War grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South <b>Vietnam</b> after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National coalition to power in 1975, Vietnamese refugees were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, by {{the time}} the Paris Peace Accord was concluded, South <b>Vietnam</b> possessed the fourth largest air force in the world. Despite their size, however, Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force {{operations}} were severely curtailed due to cutbacks in U.S. military aid. Furthermore, the Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force were prevented from undertaking reconnaissance and ground support missions due to the threat posed by formidable anti-aircraft weapons deployed by North <b>Vietnam.</b> When the North Vietnamese military renewed their offensive early in 1975, the Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> Air Force was virtually handicapped and many of their aircraft were either lost or captured as formations of the <b>Vietnam</b> People's Army swept through the Central Highlands of South <b>Vietnam.</b>|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Cẩn was a {{follower}} of the nationalist Phan Bội Châu. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he worked to organise support for Diệm as various Vietnamese groups and international powers sought to stamp their authority over <b>Vietnam.</b> Cẩn, who succeeded in eliminating alternative nationalist opposition in central <b>Vietnam,</b> became the warlord of the region when his brother {{became president of the}} southern half of the partitioned nation in 1955. He became notorious for his involvement in smuggling and corruption, as well as his autocratic rule. Cẩn was regarded as an effective leader against the Viet Cong communist insurgency, which was much weaker in central <b>Vietnam</b> than in other parts of South <b>Vietnam.</b> His Popular Force militia was regarded by US officials in central <b>Vietnam</b> as a successful counter to the communists.|$|E
5|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the <b>Vietnam</b> War, North <b>Vietnam</b> supplied the Viet Cong in the South by two methods. The first was to extend the Ho Chi Minh Trail southward into the tri-border region of Laos/Cambodia/South <b>Vietnam.</b> The Trail, a labyrinth of paths, roads, river transportation systems and way-stations, was constantly being expanded and improved. It served as a logistical jugular vein, for both men and material, for the North Vietnamese war effort against South <b>Vietnam.</b> The second method was to transport supplies by sea.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of <b>Vietnam's</b> economic reform policies, growing market liberalization and personal wealth have {{for the first time}} given consumers choice- and advertising has been a key factor. Despite significant effects of the recent Asian financial crisis on the country-substantial declines in foreign investment and exports- the consumer confidence is still strongly positive and the long-term outlook of <b>Vietnam's</b> advertising industry remains bright. <b>Vietnam's</b> healthy economic growth should resume within the next two years with a consequent further development of advertising industry. This paper provides insights about this young industry within the context of <b>Vietnam's</b> culture and economy and suggests the importance of future advertising research in this market...|$|R
