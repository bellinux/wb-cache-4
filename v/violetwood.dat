50|$|Modern {{makers of}} oboes d'amore include Howarth of London ({{instruments}} in African Blackwood or Cocobolo wood), F. Lorée in Paris (instruments in African Blackwood or <b>Violetwood)</b> and others such as French makers Rigoutat, Fossati and Marigaux, Italian maker Bulgheroni (who offer instruments in Grenadilla, <b>Violetwood,</b> Cocobolo, Rosewood, Palisander, and Cocus wood), Japanese maker Joseph and German makers Püchner, Mönnig and Ludwig Franck. New instruments cost approximately £8,250 at 2016 prices (roughly $11,885 US), {{comparable to the}} cost of a new cor anglais. This cost, coupled with the limited call for the instrument, leads many oboists not to possess their own , but to rent one when their work dictates the need. For the same reason, however, second-hand oboes d'amore surface from time to time with very little wear (and yet with very little reduction in price over a new instrument).|$|E
50|$|The modern {{standard}} oboe is {{most commonly}} made from grenadilla, {{also known as}} African blackwood, though some manufacturers also make oboes out of {{other members of the}} genus Dalbergia, which includes cocobolo, rosewood, and <b>violetwood</b> (also known as kingwood). Ebony (genus Diospyros) has also been used. Student model oboes are often made from plastic resin, to avoid instrument cracking to which wood instruments are prone, but also to make the instrument more economical. The oboe has an extremely narrow conical bore. It is played with a double reed consisting of two thin blades of cane tied together on a small-diameter metal tube (staple) which is inserted into the reed socket {{at the top of the}} instrument. The commonly accepted range for the oboe extends from B3 to about G6, over two and a half octaves, though its common tessitura lies from C4 to E6. Some student oboes only extend down to B3 (the key for B is not present). However this variant is becoming less common.|$|E
