50|$|Alternative to {{employing}} a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system {{to enrich the}} fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor in the 1950s for the primary two Venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors {{through the end of}} production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main metering jets. The tops of the rods are connected to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>piston</b> or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) or when manifold vacuum drops (<b>vacuum</b> <b>piston).</b> When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two Venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.|$|E
50|$|Phase 3: Blasting: When activated, a {{solenoid valve}} purges the air circuit, thus {{creating}} an air <b>vacuum.</b> Then, the <b>piston</b> inside triggering mechanism is abruptly pushed back by negative pressure, thus creating a sudden blast {{from the air}} contained in the pressure vessel. This phase is measured in milliseconds.|$|R
40|$|Currently used jet {{vacuum ejector}} has a defect of high air {{consumption}} {{due to its}} requirement of continuous air supply. Focusing on this problem, {{a new type of}} <b>piston</b> <b>vacuum</b> generator (PVG for short) has been researched. The PVG has two pairs of pistons. One is for driving and another is for vacuum generating. Besides the maximum vacuum value, the vacuum response time and air consumption are the most concerning performances. Special structural design is made so as to meet all the requirements, in which the unequal diameters of pistons, using directional control valves instead of the check valves and stepped flow rate control scheme are proposed and realized. Experimental results have shown that for the prototype of <b>piston</b> <b>vacuum</b> generator its maximum vacuum is about 93 kPa, the response time is about 3. 7 s and the air consumption is reduced by about 71. 3 % in time interval of 60 s compared to the same level of vacuum ejector...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pressurized}} {{steam inlet}} valve and low-pressure steam exhaust valves are opened. Pressurized steam from the boiler enters the top {{part of the}} cylinder above the piston, pushing it down, and the steam below the piston is drawn into the condenser, creating a <b>vacuum</b> below the <b>piston.</b> The pressure difference between the steam at boiler pressure above the <b>piston</b> and the <b>vacuum</b> below it drives the piston down.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{because of}} George A. Thompson, Thompson Pump and Manufacturing is known {{worldwide}} for its different lines {{of high quality}} pumps, {{ranging in size from}} 2 to 18 inches. Thompson Pump sells and rents their entire line of pumps to the areas of public works, municipalities, construction, agriculture, dewatering, mining, sewer/lift stations, and water/waste water. Types of pumps engineered include wet prime trash pumps; dry prime trash pumps with compressor-assisted or vacuum-assisted priming systems; sound attenuated pumps; utility trash pumps; diaphragm pumps; hydraulic power units with submersible pump ends; rotary, <b>vacuum</b> and <b>piston</b> wellpoint pumps and high pressure jet pumps. In addition, Thompson provides engineering services and special applications consulting for complicated wellpoint, bypass or multiple pump systems; and offers thorough pump and dewatering education and training through its Pumpology courses.|$|R
50|$|The brake {{cylinder}} {{is contained in}} a larger housingâ€”this gives a reserve of <b>vacuum</b> as the <b>piston</b> operates. The cylinder rocks slightly in operation to maintain alignment with the brake rigging cranks, so it is supported in trunnion bearings, and the vacuum pipe connection to it is flexible. The piston in the {{brake cylinder}} has a flexible piston ring that allows air to pass from {{the upper part of}} the cylinder to the lower part if necessary.|$|R
50|$|RTM {{requires}} an injection apparatus capable of injecting resin {{at a high}} pressure and temperature. One method of injecting epoxy for RTM fabrication is a positive displacement injection system. In the positive displacement injection system, resin is placed into a special cylinder. The bottom of the cylinder is a movable piston. A degassing process can be conducted after loading the resin into the cylinder by sealing the cylinder and applying a <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>piston</b> can move up the cylinder to decrease cylinder volume and force resin out a tube and into the mold. The piston is connected to an actuator. The actuator pushes the piston up the cylinder forcing the resin out at high pressure through tubing and into the mold. Positive displacement injectors have the advantages of precise control over resin pressure, flow rate, and temperature control. It also allows for resin de-gassing.|$|R
50|$|However Brunel was {{concerned}} about the efficiency of available steam locomotives, and he had been interested in the 1840 demonstration of the atmospheric system at Wormwood Scrubs. The system is fully described in the article Atmospheric railway and in the technical section below. Briefly, it involves a pipe laid between the running rails, and stationary steam engines located at intervals of a few miles along the line; they exhaust air from the pipe, forming a partial <b>vacuum.</b> A <b>piston</b> carriage is placed at the head of each train, and it carries a piston which travels in the tube. The tube is slotted at the top to enable the piston bracket to pass, and a continuous leather seal prevents unwanted admission of air. With a partial vacuum in the pipe ahead of the piston, the pressure of the atmosphere behind it drives it forward, drawing the train. The leather seal is opened by rollers immediately ahead of the bracket carrying the piston, and closed immediately behind it.|$|R
2500|$|The Watt {{steam engine}} (alternatively {{known as the}} Boulton and Watt steam engine) was the first type of steam engine {{to make use of}} a {{separate}} condenser. It was a vacuum or [...] "atmospheric" [...] engine using steam at a pressure just above atmospheric to create a partial <b>vacuum</b> beneath the <b>piston.</b> The difference between atmospheric pressure above the piston and the partial vacuum below drove the piston down the cylinder. James Watt avoided the use of high pressure steam because of safety concerns. Watt's design became synonymous with steam engines, due in no small part to his business partner, Matthew Boulton.|$|R
50|$|A major advance was the {{adoption}} of a vacuum braking system, in which flexible pipes were connected between all the vehicles of the train, and brakes on each vehicle could be controlled from the locomotive. The earliest scheme was a simple vacuum brake, in which vacuum was created by operation of a valve on the locomotive; the <b>vacuum</b> actuated brake <b>pistons</b> on each vehicle, and the degree of braking could be increased or decreased by the driver. Vacuum, rather than compressed air, was preferred because steam locomotives can be fitted with ejectors; venturi devices that create vacuum without moving parts.|$|R

5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the {{regulator}} valve V was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then {{closed and the}} water injection valve V briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial <b>vacuum</b> under the <b>piston.</b> Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and raising the pump gear.|$|R
40|$|This {{survey is}} {{concerned}} with instrumentation for measuring pressures from about 0. 001 to 50 mm of mercury (0. 13 to 6650 Nm- 2), described in publications during the years 1900 - 1968. U-tube micromanometers and diaphragm-capacitance gages are treated in considerable detail. Other instrumentation described includes gas column manometers; elastic element micromanometers with optical, inductance, resistance wire, strain gage, and <b>vacuum</b> tube transducers; <b>piston</b> gages; vane gages; and centrifugal micromanometers. The measurement of dynamic pressure, atmospheric pressure oscillations, low vapor pressure, and calibration techniques are discussed. Schematic diagrams of approximately 70 instruments are included. References to the sources of information and available performance data are given...|$|R
50|$|Dashpots are {{commonly}} used in dampers and shock absorbers. The hydraulic cylinder in an automobile shock absorber is a dashpot. They are also used on carburetors, where {{the return of the}} throttle lever is cushioned just before the throttle fully closes, then is allowed to fully close slowly to reduce emissions. The British SU carburettor's main piston carries a stepped needle. This needle is held in the fuel flow orifice. The manifold <b>vacuum</b> causes this <b>piston</b> to rise allowing more fuel into the airflow. The SU's dashpot has a fixed hydraulic piston, damping the main piston as it moves upward. A valve in the piston disables the damping as the main piston returns.|$|R
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis. By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary venturis of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a <b>vacuum</b> operated <b>piston</b> to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary throttle shaft to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture control solenoid that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The solenoid-controlled metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|R
5000|$|Variable-Venturi: {{in which}} the fuel jet opening is varied by the slide (which {{simultaneously}} alters air flow). In [...] "constant depression" [...] carburetors, this is done by a <b>vacuum</b> operated <b>piston</b> connected to a tapered needle which slides inside the fuel jet. A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. The most common variable Venturi (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers. The UK location of the SU and Zenith-Stromberg companies helped these carburetors rise {{to a position of}} domination in the UK car market, though such carburetors were also very widely used on Volvos and other non-UK makes. Other similar designs have been used on some European and a few Japanese automobiles. These carburetors are also referred to as [...] "constant velocity" [...] or [...] "constant vacuum" [...] carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford's VV (Variable Venturi) carburetor, which was essentially a fixed Venturi carburetor with one side of the Venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a wider throat at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, a {{full-scale}} operational {{replica of the}} 1712 Newcomen Steam Engine was completed at the Black Country Living Museum in Dudley. It is the only full-size working replica of the engine in existence. The 'fire engine' as it was known, is an impressive brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall. Rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps {{at the bottom of}} the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface. The engine itself is simple, with only a boiler, a cylinder and piston and operating valves. A coal fire heats the water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated then passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above the boiler. The cylinder is more than 2 metres long and 52 centimetres in diameter. The steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the <b>vacuum</b> beneath the <b>piston</b> pulls the inner end of the beam down and causes the pump to move.|$|R

5000|$|Louis Figuier in his monumental work gives a full {{quotation}} of Denis Papin's paper {{published in}} 1690 in Acta eruditorum at Leipzig, entitled [...] "Nouvelle mÃ©thode pour obtenir Ã  bas prix des forces considÃ©rables" [...] (A new method for cheaply obtaining considerable forces). It {{seems that the}} idea came to Papin whilst working with Robert Boyle at the Royal Society in London. Papin describes first pouring a small quantity of water {{into the bottom of}} a vertical cylinder, inserting a piston on a rod and after first evacuating the air below the piston, placing a fire beneath the cylinder to boil the water away and create enough steam pressure to raise the piston to the top end of the cylinder. The piston was then temporarily locked in the upper position by a spring catch engaging a notch in the rod. The fire was then removed, allowing the cylinder to cool, which condensed steam back into water, thus creating a <b>vacuum</b> beneath the <b>piston.</b> To the end of the piston rod was attached a cord passing over two pulleys and a weight hung down from the cord's end. Upon releasing the catch, the piston was sharply drawn {{down to the bottom of}} the cylinder by the pressure differential between the atmosphere and the created vacuum; enough force was thus generated to raise a 60 lb weight. Although the engine certainly worked as far as it went, it was devised merely to demonstrate the principle and having got thus far, Papin never developed it further, although in his paper he did write about the potential of boats driven by [...] "firetubes". Instead he allowed himself to be distracted into developing a variant of the Savery engine.|$|R
40|$|Materials {{known as}} Mn+ 1 AXn phases, where n is 1, 2, or 3, and M {{represents}} an early transition metal, A an A-group element, and X is either Carbon and/or Nitrogen [1], are fast becoming technologically important materials {{due to the}} interesting combination of unique properties. However, a lot of important information about the high temperature and high pressure behavior {{of many of these}} compounds is still missing, which needs to be determined systematically. ^ In this dissertation the synthesis of M 2 AC (M = Ti, V, Cr, Nb, Zr) and A = (Al, Sn, S) compounds by arc melting, <b>vacuum</b> sintering and <b>piston</b> cylinder synthesis is presented along with the synthesis of Zr 2 SC, which has been synthesized for first time in bulk form, by piston cylinder technique. The microstructural analysis by electron microscopy and phase analysis by x-ray diffraction is presented next. Finally, a critical analysis of the behavior of these compounds under the application of extreme pressure (as high as 50 GPa) and temperature (2 Ì† 6 ap; 1000 Â°C) is presented. ^ The high pressure studies, up to 50 GPa, showed that these compounds were structurally intact and their bulk moduli ranged from 140 to 190 GPa. The high temperature studies in the inert atmosphere showed that the M 2 SnC compounds were unstable above 650 Â°C and the expansion along the a-axis was higher than that along the c-axis, unlike the other phases. M 2 SC compounds on the other hand showed negligible difference in the thermal expansion along the two axes. The oxidation study revealed that Ti 2 AC (Al, S) compounds had highest resistance to oxidation while the M 2 SnC compounds had the least. Furthermore, from the oxidation study of these compounds, which were short time oxidation experiments, it was found that all of these compounds oxidized to their respective binary oxides. ...|$|R
