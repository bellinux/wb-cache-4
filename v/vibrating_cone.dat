40|$|BACKGROUND: Oscillatory {{positive}} {{expiratory pressure}} (PEP) with the Flutter device facilitates secretion removal. In the Flutter a steel ball <b>vibrates</b> inside a <b>cone,</b> causing air flow vibration. A new device, the Acapella, uses a counterweighted plug and magnet to create air flow oscillation. The Acapella comes in 2 models: one {{for patients with}} expiratory flow> 15 L/min and one for < 15 L/min. We hypothesized that the Acapella and Flutter would produce similar mean PEP, oscillatory pressure amplitude, and frequency over a clinically relevant range of flows. METHODS: We measured oscillatory amplitude, PEP, and frequency. Values for frequency, peak, trough, and mea...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{tailings}} in Da hongshan contains 14. 56 % iron, which {{mostly in}} form as hematite, and another iron in form as magnetite, maghemtite or siderite, this part just accounting 2. 96 %. The main gangue minerals in the tailings are 48. 47 % quartz and dolomite, 8. 31 % mica, 1. 05 % chlorite. According to particle size analysis, amount of iron size is enriched in + 0. 037 mm~- 0. 074 mm, + 0. 010 mm~- 0. 019 mm and- 0. 010 mm, it’s distribution is 24. 96 %, 14. 14 % and 36. 96 % respectively. This particle researched it’s mineralogy then discuss a feasible flow-sheet to recycle the iron in tailings by several mineral processing tests. Finally find that magnetic-gravity separation {{is a useful}} method. The test conditions are: magnetic field strength is 0. 90 T in roughing separation and 0. 97 T in scavenging separation. The hang and <b>vibrate</b> of <b>cone</b> concentrator is used for gravity separation, it’s vibration frequency is 385 rev/min with rotation period of the vibrate is 227. 5 sec/turn. The grade of obtained concentrating and middlings is 54. 15 %, 57. 13 % respectively, with recovery 28. 99 %, 1. 00 % respectively...|$|R
5000|$|The {{test was}} carried out at Harvard University's Jefferson laboratory. A solid sample {{containing}} iron (57Fe) emitting gamma rays {{was placed in the}} center of a loudspeaker cone which was placed near the roof of the building. Another sample containing 57Fe was placed in the basement. The distance between this source and absorber was 22.5 meters (73.8 ft). The gamma rays traveled through a Mylar bag filled with helium to minimize scattering of the gamma rays. A scintillation counter was placed below the receiving 57Fe sample to detect the gamma rays that were not absorbed by the receiving sample. By <b>vibrating</b> the speaker <b>cone</b> the gamma ray source moved with varying speed, thus creating varying Doppler shifts. When the Doppler shift canceled out the gravitational blueshift, the receiving sample absorbed gamma rays and the number of gamma rays detected by the scintillation counter dropped accordingly. The variation in absorption could be correlated with the phase of the speaker vibration, hence with the speed of the emitting sample and therefore the Doppler shift. To compensate for possible systematic errors, Pound and Rebka varied the speaker frequency between 10 Hz and 50 Hz, interchanged the source and absorber-detector, and used different speakers (ferroelectric and moving coil magnetic transducer). The reason for exchanging the positions of the absorber and the detector is doubling the effect. Pound subtracted two experimental results: ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a shearography instrument for the quantitative measurement of surface strain on dynamic test objects. Shearography is a non-contact, full-field interferometric speckle technique used for the measurement of displacement gradient. It is often used in industry for qualitative inspection of industrial components. To fully characterize the surface strain, a total of six components of displacement gradient are required. These can be measured using shearography instrumentation with at least three measurement channels. Phase measurements from each measurement channel are combined using a matrix transformation to produce the orthogonal displacement gradient measurements. The instrument presented in this thesis possesses four measurement channels consisting of four views of the object under investigation. Images from the four views are transported to the shearing interferometer using coherent fibre-optic imaging bundles. The signals from the four views are then spatially multiplexed onto the four quadrants of a CCD camera. The optical source is a frequency doubled, pulsed Nd:YAG laser which is used to effectively ‘freeze’ the motion of the dynamic object {{for the duration of the}} laser pulse. The optical phase difference between images recorded from two laser pulses is determined using the spatial carrier technique. This method involves introducing a carrier frequency into the recorded speckle pattern using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A Fourier transform is used to access the phase dependent spectral features, from which the phase distribution is calculated. The instrument is first validated through the measurement of two static test objects. The results of these measurements are compared with modelled data and with results from a multiple-illumination-direction shearography system using a continuous-wave laser. The instrument is then used to investigate two dynamic objects; a plate rotating at 610 rpm and a speaker <b>cone</b> <b>vibrating</b> at frequencies in the range of 1 – 5 kHz.
