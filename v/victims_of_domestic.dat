5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below).

There is a higher risk of experiencing adult lifetime partner violence among women with depressive disorders (OR 2. 77 (95 % CI 1. 96 - 3. 92), anxiety disorders (OR 4. 08 (95 % CI 2. 39 - 6. 97), and PTSD (OR 7. 34 95 % CI 4. 50 - 11. 98), compared to women without mental disorders.
