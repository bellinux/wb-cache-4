40|$|Using {{personnel}} and transaction {{data obtained from}} two auto dealerships located in a large city in Canada, we examine whether same or different ethnic matches between salespersons and customers affect the prices and quantities of transactions. First, compared with White-White matches, we find little evidence of price discrimination for different ethnicity matches (such as White <b>vs.</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East),</b> and we detect neither premium price setting nor discounting among same ethnicity matches (such as Asian vs. Asian) relative to different ethnicity matches. Regarding quantity, however, sales ratios to ethnically-same customers are substantially higher than {{is the case for}} ethnically dissimilar customers. For example, East Asian salespersons concluded more than 30 % of their sales with East Asian customers. Moreover, we find that high-performing salespersons skillfully utilize social networks to conclude transactions with customers of the same ethnicity, especially when business conditions are unfavorable. This finding suggests that social networks are important to understanding the nature of auto retail markets. ...|$|R
50|$|Changes {{regarding}} {{the importance and}} satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US <b>vs.</b> the <b>Middle</b> <b>East).</b> For the US citizens, {{there was only one}} level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.|$|R

50|$|Pehr Forsskål (1732-63) {{was born}} in Finland and became a student of Linnaeus when he was 18 years old. Forsskål {{was asked if he}} wanted to join a Danish expedition, {{commissioned}} by the Danish King Frederick <b>V,</b> to the <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> He consulted Linnaeus and was given permission to go. Although it was a Danish expedition, King Frederick V stated that the findings would not be placed in Copenhagen until several international botanists, including Linnaeus, had studied them. Forsskål and the expedition sailed in the winter of 1761. Their first stop was Alexandria, Egypt. Forsskål made many findings at Suez {{and was one of the}} first to describe the flora and fauna of the Red Sea. The expedition reached Yemen in April 1763 where Forsskål found a Commiphora which Linnaeus was particularity interested in. However, Forsskål died of malaria on 11 July 1763 before he could deliver Commiphora to Linnaeus. Forsskål worked on Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica and Descriptiones Animalis during the expedition. His works were published posthumously in 1775 by another expedition member. Carsten Niebuhr.|$|R
