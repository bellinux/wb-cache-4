5|$|Polarization {{of voting}} {{patterns}} based on religion {{was evident in}} the eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People's Representative Council. Likewise, Muslims were more likely to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the desire}} of silver delegates to {{nominate}} a candidate who shared their beliefs, and although several states instructed their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate, there was no overwhelming favorite for the nomination going into the convention. With a two-thirds vote of the delegates needed to nominate, almost every silver delegate would have to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same candidate to assure success, though any organized support from gold delegates would greatly damage a silver candidate's chances.|$|E
5|$|During her premiership {{support for}} Dunderdale, her {{government}} and the PC Party saw a steady decline. A Corporate Research Associates (CRA) poll released days after Dunderdale became premier, and conducted before she took office, showed that 90 per cent of the population {{were satisfied with the}} PC government. 75 per cent would <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Progressive Conservative Party in an election and 76 percent chose Williams as the best leader to be premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout February 2011, showed that support for Dunderdale, her {{government and the}} PC Party remained high. Satisfaction with government was at 82 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they would <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> PC Party in an election. 64 per cent of respondents stated Dunderdale was the best choice for premier, compared to 18 per cent for Liberal leader Yvonne Jones and 5 per cent for Lorraine Michael. An Angus Reid Public Opinion (Angus Reid) poll conducted around the same time listed Dunderdale as the second most popular premier in Canada with a 55 percent approval rating. 10 percent of respondents disapproved of her performance while 35 percent were not sure if they approved or disapproved of her performance.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether he had ever visited a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|House Republicans {{planned to}} hold a {{non-binding}} caucus vote on October 8, followed by the official floor vote on October 29. The winning candidate requires a 218-vote majority to win. Multiple ballots may be cast if {{the majority of the}} House cannot agree on a candidate. While McCarthy and Chaffetz both said they would <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winner of the caucus vote in the floor vote, Webster did not make the same promise.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody has put forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E

Larssen prevailed over Carlsen and Førre in the <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new subeditor.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 2008, {{there was no}} organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the violence that had marred 2008's election {{so as not to}} undermine its credibility, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> party.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E

50|$|The {{actual number}} of popular votes {{received}} by Kennedy and Nixon in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> 12 separate electors. The vote totals of 458,638 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> Kennedy and 274,472 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> Nixon reflect <b>the</b> number of <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Kennedy and Nixon electors who received {{the highest number of}} votes. However, the Republican and Democratic electors receiving the highest number of votes were outliers from the other 11 electors from their party. <b>The</b> average <b>vote</b> totals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 12 electors were 455,629 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Democratic electors and 273,110 <b>votes</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republican electors.

5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tenure of Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent.

Hayes continued to vote with {{the majority in the}} 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E

Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes.
