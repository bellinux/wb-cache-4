5|$|January 24, 2003: A {{plume of}} Arctic air {{produces}} widespread record low temperatures and light snow flurries {{along the eastern}} coastline. The snow is described as ocean-effect snow, identical to lake effect snow in that it occurs due to <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> air passing over relatively warm water temperatures. The snow reaches {{as far south as}} Fort Pierce.|$|E
5|$|Since rain only falls as liquid, in frozen temperatures, rain cannot fall. As a result, <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> climates {{see very}} little {{rainfall}} {{and are often}} known as polar deserts. A common biome {{in this area is}} the tundra which has a short summer thaw and a long frozen winter. Ice caps see no rain at all, making Antarctica the world's driest continent.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> temperature inversion present.|$|E

5|$|The {{east has}} a more {{continental}} climate: winters can be <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate {{over most of the}} country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{difficulties}} were {{exacerbated by}} prolonged problems in English agriculture, {{part of a}} wider phenomenon in northern Europe known as the Great Famine. It began with torrential rains in late 1314, followed by a <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> winter and heavy rains the following spring that killed many sheep and cattle. The bad weather continued, almost unabated, into 1321, resulting {{in a string of}} bad harvests. Revenues from the exports of wool plummeted and the price of food rose, despite attempts by Edward II's government to control prices. Edward called for hoarders to release food, and tried to encourage both internal trade and the importation of grain, but with little success. The requisitioning of provisions for the royal court during the famine years only added to tensions.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|In early July, shower {{activity}} {{increased in}} association with an area of disturbed weather. With surface pressures lower than normal for a tropical disturbance, deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six-E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores. Despite moderate wind shear, <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> cloud tops formed as the winds increased to , a moderate tropical storm. Moving westward, Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as a ragged eye formed.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans {{returned}} as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000–5,000BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland.|$|E

5|$|Cold fronts usually {{move from}} west to east, or from {{southwest}} to northeast, but rarely from the south. Because of this, these cold fronts do {{not result in}} the cold being intense since they are moderated as they pass over the surrounding oceans. In the rare cases when cold fronts move northwards from the south (Antarctica), the cold air masses are not moderated by the surrounding oceans, resulting in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> temperatures throughout the region. In general, the passage of cold fronts {{is more common in}} the south than in the north, and occurs more in winter than in summer. The movement of warm, subtropical air into the region occurs frequently in summer up to 46oS. When warm subtropical air arrives in the region, the air is dry, resulting in little precipitation, and causes temperatures to be higher than those observed in northeast Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

5|$|In New Jersey, {{increasing}} winds caused blowing and drifting of {{the snow}} and led to near-blizzard conditions. Behind the storm, <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> and gusty weather lingered. New Jersey Transit shut down bus service in northern portions of the state, and rail lines had 20-minute delays. Most injuries in the state were related to physical strain while shoveling, snow blower accidents or slips and falls. As the snowfall was of a light nature, few trees limbs and electrical wires were downed by the storm. GPU Energy reported only around 5,500 power outages. A countywide state of emergency was declared in Sussex County, as vehicles were sliding off roadways. Several other traffic accidents and delays were reported throughout the state, and in Somerset County, a few roads were closed due to the snow. A Red Cross shelter was opened for residents of a Spotswood trailer park.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex {{share similar}} {{behaviours}} with other Myrmeciinae relatives. Prionomyrmex may have foraged {{on the ground}} or onto trees and low vegetation, feeding on nectar and arthropods. Nothomyrmecia workers, however, drink hemolymph from the insects they capture, and the larvae are carnivorous. It is not known if the ants were active during the day or night, but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> nights. Both ants have large compound eyes, relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes. Due to their primitive and simplified social life, workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones, suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers. Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female stylopid parasites. Predators are unknown for both ants.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, at {{approximately}} 07:00, the independent HV armoured-mechanised unit advanced northwest along the Kupa, towards Gračanica. During the advance, {{one of the}} tanks was captured and its crew killed after the capture. Nearly simultaneously, the JNA commenced a tank and mortar attack against Stankovac and the river crossing at Šišinec. The HV armoured-mechanised unit and the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Brigade panicked, believing the crossing point was lost, and started to fall back to Šišinec in disarray, sustaining considerable casualties. Since {{there was no way}} to transport the remaining HV armour across the Kupa River, the tanks were destroyed by one of the force's own tanks. That tank was then destroyed with explosives to prevent its capture. As there were too few boats at the river crossing to allow a quick retreat, some of the troops swam across the river, causing several to drown in <b>very</b> <b>cold</b> water. The command post of the brigade fell back to Galdovo, while the troops started to retreat to Zagreb. The entire brigade was back in Zagreb by 15 December.|$|E
