40|$|Abstract Stress {{in daily}} life can lead to severe {{conditions}} as burn-out and depression and has {{a major impact on}} society. Being able to measure mental stress reliably opens up the ability to intervene in an early stage. We performed a large-scale study in which skin conductance, respiration and electrocardiogram were measured in semi-controlled conditions. Using Learning Vector Quantization techniques, we obtained up to 88 % accuracy in the classification task to separate stress from relaxation. Relevance learning was used to identify the most informative features, indicating that most information is embedded in the cardiac signals. In addition to commonly used features, we also explored various novel features, of which the <b>very-high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> of the power spectrum was found to be a very relevant addition...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive radio (CR) enables {{spectrum}} sharing by allowing new unlicensed services from secondary users {{to operate in}} pre-allocated bands in an opportunistic manner. TV white space (TVWS) is {{a portion of the}} spectrum in ultra-high <b>frequency</b> (UHF) and <b>very-high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> which is not utilised by primary users in specific time and location. It is envisaged that more spectrum will be available after digital switchover (DSO) TV transmission replaces the current analogue system. Recently, the regulators in the USA and in the UK have given approval for companies to operate new communication systems with the capability of utilising TVWS spectrum. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the CR technology and quantifies the TVWS status in Malaysia to expose the spectrum reuse opportunities for future secondary user deployment. Taking the 18 major cities in Malaysia into consideration, we find that all seven TV stations utilise from two to seven of the UHF channels. In our analysis, three usage scenarios were considered, where the utilisation of the 40 UHF channels is full, half and a third. For each case, it was discovered that TVWS was 82. 5 %, 65 % and 46. 1 %, which can be opportunistically utilised by CR users...|$|R

40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{owns and}} {{operates}} an array of Very-Low Frequency (VLF) sensors that measure the Radio-Frequency (RF) waveforms emitted by Cloud-to-Ground (CG) and InCloud (IC) lightning. This array, the Los Alamos Sferic Array (LASA), has approximately 15 sensors concentrated in the Great Plains and Florida, which detect electric field changes in a bandwidth from 200 Hz to 500 kHz (Smith et al., 2002). Recently, LANL has begun {{development of a new}} dual-band RF sensor array that includes the <b>Very-High</b> <b>Frequency</b> (VHF) <b>band</b> as well as the VLF. Whereas VLF lightning emissions can be used to deduce physical parameters such as lightning type and peak current, VHF emissions can be used to perform precise 3 d mapping of individual radiation sources, which can number in the thousands for a typical CG flash. These new dual-band sensors will be used to monitor lightning activity in hurricanes in an effort to better predict intensification cycles. Although the new LANL dual-band array is not yet operational, we have begun initial work utilizing both VLF and VHF lightning data to monitor hurricane evolution. In this paper, we present the temporal evolution of Rita's landfall using VLF and VHF lightning data, and also WSR- 88 D radar. At landfall, Rita's northern eyewall experienced strong updrafts and significant lightning activity that appear to mark a transition between oceanic hurricane dynamics and continental thunderstorm dynamics. In section 2, we give a brief overview of Hurricane Rita, including its development as a hurricane and its lightning history. In the following section, we present WSR- 88 D data of Rita's landfall, including reflectivity images and temporal variation. In section 4, we present both VHF and VLF lightning data, overplotted on radar reflectivity images. Finally, we discuss our observations, including a comparison to previous studies and a brief conclusion...|$|R

Materials with an index of refraction, n, greater than 1 {{can be used to}} effectively shrink these devices by a factor of 1 / n. In this thesis, magnetodielectric materials (MDM), where n ≥ 1, have been made to be used in additive manufacturing processes with strict particle size requirements and were developed using various methods, such as polyol reduction and conventional ceramic solid state processing. These materials were characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), to determine their crystalline, physical, and direct current (DC) magnetization properties. The techniques used to synthesize the MDM yielded particles that were chemically similar, but had drastically different physical properties which heavily influences their high-frequency electromagnetic properties. These materials were then uniformly dispersed into a non-conducting medium, such as a low-electrical loss polymer or resin, and formed into composite samples with variable volumetric loading. These composite samples were measured using several techniques to characterize the frequency-dependent electromagnetic (EM) properties, such as relative permeability, relative permittivity, and their respective losses. Finite element method (FEM) simulations were performed using these MDM-composites to design a spiral antenna to be used at approximately 585 MHzUniversity of Delaware, Department of Materials Science and EngineeringM.
