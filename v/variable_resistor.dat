They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the scram line, a Manila rope that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a <b>variable</b> <b>resistor,</b> controlling an electric motor that would [...] the clothesline wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would fail-safe and return to its zero position when released.|$|E
500|$|To improve {{confidence}} in the approach, the project made a prototype {{in the form of}} a counter-illuminated plywood silhouette of a Liberator at life size, suspended from towers [...] at a point where it could be seen from a point a little above sea level [...] away across Oyster Bay, Long Island, so that it was seen mainly over water as a sea search aircraft would be from a submarine's conning tower. It was fitted with sealed beam lamps made by General Electric. The lamps had reflectors to give them a narrow beam of 3 degrees horizontally, 6 degrees vertically, to minimise power consumption for the required brightness. The lamps' brightness was controllable with a <b>variable</b> <b>resistor.</b> During a test in the winter of 1943, selecting a day when the visibility was above 2 miles and the wind not so strong as to destroy the prototype, the observers could clearly see the [...] thick cables used to hold up the model, but the silhouette itself was [...] "completely invisible" [...] with the lamps correctly adjusted.|$|E

2500|$|A Bode network, {{as with a}} Zobel network, is a {{symmetrical}} bridge T network which {{meets the}} constant k condition. [...] It does not however meet the constant resistance condition, that is, the bridge is not in balance. [...] Any impedance network, Z, {{can be used in}} a Bode network, just as with a Zobel network, but the high pass section shown for correcting high-end frequencies is the most common. A Bode network terminated in a <b>variable</b> <b>resistor</b> can be used to produce a variable impedance at the input terminals of the network. [...] A useful property of this network is that the input impedance can be made to vary from a capacitive impedance through a purely resistive impedance to an inductive impedance all by adjusting the single load potentiometer, RL. [...] The bridging resistor, R0, is chosen to equal the nominal impedance so that in the special case when RL is set to R0 the network behaves as a Zobel network and Zin is also equal to R0.|$|E

40|$|A {{variable}} gain amplifier traditionally uses {{discrete component}} <b>variable</b> <b>resistors,</b> (e. g., potentiometer), on {{the output of}} a fixed gain operational amplifier circuit to control the gain. In class AB amplifiers the volume can be adjusted by varying this resistance, but due to the noise level in the output, {{the quality of the}} sound and efficiency of the amplifier is low. Chalcogenide based variable resistance devices are integrated circuit devices that have a wide variety of potential applications due to their low power consumption, ability to withstand radiation in harsh environments, high digital capacity, that is, the ability to retrieve data, and scaling. Due to these properties they have potential application in many consumer products (e. g., cell phones, computers, digital recorders), national defense, health and medicine, outer space, weather forecasting and so on. In our project, chalcogenide <b>variable</b> <b>resistors</b> (CVRs) are used to control the gain of a simple amplifier. These resistors are independently programmable.
