The aircraft, a Let L-410 Turbolet, was conducting a <b>VFR</b> <b>approach</b> to Macaé Airport with 17 passengers and 2 crew on board {{when it hit}} the top of Pico de Petra Bonica in Brazil. Everyone on board {{was killed in the}} crash. Brazilian investigative team CENIPA concluded that the <b>VFR</b> <b>approach</b> was inadequate, stating that the visibility at the time was not good enough for a <b>VFR</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E

40|$|General {{aviation}} and {{air taxi}} approach phase accidents, which occurred during VFR and IFR, respectively {{over the last}} 25 years, were analyzed. The data {{suggest that there is}} a 204 percent higher risk during the approach and landing phase of VFR flights, than during similar IFR operations (14. 82 vs 7. 27 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches). Alarmingly, the night single pilot IFR (SPIFR) accident rate is almost 8 times the rate of day IFR, 35. 43 vs 4. 47 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches, and {{two and a half times}} that of day <b>VFR</b> <b>approaches,</b> 35. 43 vs 14. 82 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches. Surprisingly, the overall SPIFR accident rates are not much higher than dual-pilot IFR (DPIFR), 7. 27 vs 6. 48 accidents/ 100, 000 approaches. The generally static ratio of the statistics for SPIFR/DPIFR accident rates may be accounted for by little or no change in general aviation cockpit technology during the last 25 years, and because IFR operational flight task management training has not kept pace...|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{flow in the}} Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities (TRACON) is a {{significant}} factor in determining airport throughput capacity and airline operational efficiency. In recent years the availability of high fidelity terminal area track data has made it possible to increase the granularity of airport and airspace performance analysis. This paper describes a methodology for airport arrival flow analysis using National Offload Program (NOP) track data. The analysis provides insight into track distances flown and track time for alternate terminal arrival flows (i. e. from the final waypoint in the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the runway threshold via a type of approach). The methodology is applied to 35 days of NOP track data for Chicago TRACON (C 90) for arrivals into MDW. Arrivals into MDW landing to the north-west on 31 C and to the north-east on 4 R exhibit the shortest average track distance (28. 42 NM and 29. 81 NM.). Arrivals landing to the south-east on 13 C exhibit the highest mean track distance of 38. 9 NM. Track distance/time is least for <b>VFR</b> <b>approaches</b> onto all runways. When IMC conditions exist, RNP approaches provide 6 - 10 % savings in track distance/time over ILS approaches. One unexpected result is that RNP approaches exhibit the same variance in track distance/time as ILS approaches. The variance in RNP approaches occurs on the downwind and turn-to-base, while the variance on the ILS approach occurs by “tromboning ” on the base leg and the turn to final...|$|R

5000|$|In 1986, Pan American World Airways {{announced}} {{its intention to}} buy Ransome Airlines, {{in order to use}} the carrier (with the tentative Ransome Express branding) as feeder for its Worldport hub at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Pan Am also recognized the ground breaking work done by Hank Ransome with regards to operating into Washington National Airport by utilizing the DHC-7s unique capabilities. The DHC-7 was the only transport category aircraft to be able to operate and conduct STOL (Short Takeoff and Land) operations into Washington National's airport {{because of the way the}} airport's runways all cross at the center like an asterisk. Until Hank Ransom's efforts were approved, only one runway was capable of being utilized at a time. When the FAA approved Ransom's plan, the DHC-7 was able to conduct Day and Night VFR [...] "STUB" [...] operations by landing on one of the crossing runways, proving to the FAA that the airplane was capable of landing and holding short of the active runway. The DHC-7 was also able to demonstrate that it was capable of making a <b>VFR</b> <b>approach</b> to the stub runway, losing one engine and then turning sharply away and exiting the area with only 3 engines operating, and never violating the active runway's protected airspace. The DHC-7 would, normally, land and hold short until crossing permission was received by ground control. This unique [...] "STUB" [...] operation was a valuable addition to Pan Am's route structure as it did not require a landing slot from ATC due to the aircraft's ability to operate on non-active crossing runways.When the acquisition was finalized in June 1987, Ransome was renamed Pan Am Express, though, operating a fleet of newly delivered ATR42s, as well Ransome's older Dash 7s. Henceforth, the airline codes PA and PXX were used.|$|E
40|$|Most speech {{processing}} algorithms analyze speech signals {{frame by frame}} with a fixed frame rate. Fixed-rate analysis is inconsistent with human speech perception and effectively assigns the same importance or ‘weight ’ to all equiduration frames. In [1], we proposed a variable frame rate (VFR) analysis technique {{that is based on}} a Euclidian distance measure. In this paper, we propose another approach for VFR based on the entropy of the signal. We compare entropy and Euclidian distance measures for VFR in ASR experiments using the Aurora 2 and TI 46 databases. Better performance is observed for the entropy-based VFR over our earlier <b>VFR</b> <b>approach</b> and over the fixed-rate system. 1...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Langley Research Center's {{effort to}} develop {{technology}} for VTOL operation in the air transportation system in the late 1980 's and beyond, {{research has been conducted}} aimed at developing digital controller design procedures. This paper describes the verification of one design procedure by the flight evaluation of an advanced digital control algorithm. The control algorithm, operating at 10 iterations per second, follows step guidance commands with zero steady state error and thus provides an autotrim capability for the nonlinear vehicle. Changes in vehicle dynamics are accounted for using a gain scheduling technique. This control algorithm is combined with sensor filters, a trajectory generator, and a closed loop guidance algorithm to form a VTOL autoland system. A CH- 47 tandem rotor helicopter which contains a set of sensors, onboard digital flight computers and electro-hydraulic actuators is used in the evaluation. All software, except input-output routines, is coded in FORTRAN using floating point arithmetic and executed in the flight computer. This autoland system is exercised by automatically flying straight-in descending decelerating trajectories typical of <b>VFR</b> manual <b>approaches</b> to a predetermined landing pad...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a four phase effort to {{evaluate}} the application of hinged plate spoilers/dive brakes to a small general aviation aircraft are presented. The test vehicle was a single engine light aircraft modified with an experimental set of upper surface spoilers and lower surface dive brakes similar to the type used on sailplanes. The lift, drag, stick free stability, trim, and dynamic response characteristics of four different spoiler/dive brake configurations were determined. Tests also were conducted, under {{a wide range of}} flight conditions and with pilots of various experience levels, to determine the most favorable methods of spoiler control and to evaluate how spoilers might best be used during the approach and landing task. The effects of approach path angle, approach airspeed, and pilot technique using throttle/spoiler integrated control were investigated for day, night, <b>VFR,</b> and IFR <b>approaches</b> and landings. The test results indicated that spoilers offered significant improvements in the vehicle's performance and flying qualities for all elements of the approach and landing task, provided a suitable method of control was available...|$|R
40|$|The Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) arrival flows are an {{important}} component of overall NAS efficiency and airline costs of operation. The efficiency of TRACON arrival flows {{is a function of the}} relative position of the final waypoint on the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the runway threshold, the type of approach (ILS, RNP, VFR), and the arrival vertical and longitudinal profile. A previous research established the presence of 16 unique arrival flows for the main runways (31 C, 4 R, 22 L and 13 C) at Midway International Airport (MDW), using 43 days of National Offload Program (NOP) radar track data. This paper uses an aerodynamic fuel burn model to estimate the fuel burn for these flows. The results of the analysis indicate that, during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), the RNP approach to 13 C uses an average of 14 % less fuel than the ILS approach on to 13 C. For narrow body aircrafts, this is equivalent to on an average a savings of $ 47 per flight per approach (at $ 3 a gallon). During Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) the least average fuel burn arrival flow for <b>VFR</b> <b>approach</b> procedures is to runways 4 R or 31 C (174. 9 kg) followed by 13 C (+ 11 %), and 22 L (+ 19 %).

40|$|Discriminate Analysis is {{an advance}} {{statistical}} procedure similar to {{multiple regression analysis}} for identifying the relationships between qualitative criterion variables and quantitative predictor variables. For the Synthetic Vision System Equivalent Safety Metric (ESM) development, discriminate analysis {{will be used to}} establish the weighting factors to be applied the Equivalent Safety Metric. Previous ESM development employed inputs from the evaluation pilots to establish weighting factors that worked well and reflected pilots ’ inputs towards safety, but were not a statistically rigorous method. Ultimately the weighting factors that would enable the ESM to indicate the largest differences between the various safety points in the data is desired. This effort will retain the 4 primary data elements of the previous ESM development work (i. e., workload, situation awareness (SA), readability and % time safety tunnel). The data used for the Discriminate Analysis, was collected from the piloted simulation research concluded in November 2004. These four data variables are considered discriminator variables. The identifier variables are the evaluation pilots with different display concepts, meteorological conditions, and maneuvers. Each “group ” or “test condition ” represents fundamentally different types of procedures and associated rates of accidents. The three major test conditions of focus are the VFR pilots flying the Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach using baseline round-dial (BRD) display concepts, which is considered unsafe, the IFR pilots flying the ILS approach using BRD, which is considered acceptably safe, and H-IFR pilots flying the <b>VFR</b> <b>approach</b> using BRD, which is considered very safe...|$|E
