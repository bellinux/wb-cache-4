50|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of getting to polling places because of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> displaced were allowed to vote electronically. Officials were not prepared for the 15 minutes that it took to validate each request, and <b>were</b> deluged by <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not displaced asking to vote electronically, so voting was extended until Friday, November 9, at 8 PM. Requests had to be submitted by 5 PM.|$|R

25|$|Many {{local offices}} (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) {{in the state}} are still held by Democrats. Many rural {{counties}} have <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Postal {{voting is}} open to <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in {{healthcare}} institutions, social care or guardianship because of their health condition or age, who perform mandatory military service, who perform active military service, civil service or work under contract in international military operations abroad, or who are in detention facilities. Postal voting is possible at specific post offices on a last Wednesday, Thursday or Friday before an election day.|$|E
25|$|Helping {{to remove}} {{obstacles}} to voting {{is an important}} part of Elections Canada’s work. <b>Voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not able to vote on polling day can vote at the advance polls. A mail-in special ballot is available for Canadians who are away from their ridings, traveling or temporarily resident overseas. Even Canadians in their own ridings during the election period may use the special ballot if they do not wish to go to a Polling Station. In special cases, electors with a disability may vote at home, in the presence of an election officer. Mobile polls serve voters living in certain institutions, such as nursing homes for people who are elderly or who have a disability.|$|E

2500|$|... (Note: <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> {{not willing}} to vote were {{primarily}} those opposed to independence and/or a referendum being held, so support for independence among those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> certain to vote {{was expected to be}} high.) ...|$|R
25|$|Also, the 21st century Missouri {{electorate}} is {{much less}} urbanized {{than that of the}} 20th century. In 1900, the combined population of St. Louis (575,238) and Kansas City (163,752) was 24% of the population of Missouri (3,106,665), while by 1950 the combined population of St. Louis (856,796) and Kansas City (456,622) had actually grown to 33% of the population of Missouri (3,954,653). But shortly thereafter the population of St. Louis began a sharp decline, while that of Kansas City remained nearly static, so that the state is now much more dominated by rural, suburban, and small-city <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> generally more conservative: by 2000 the combined populations of St. Louis (348,189) and Kansas City (441,545) had declined to 14% of the population of Missouri (5,595,211). This shift, however, is a direct product of the small geographic size of St. Louis City, which is nearly unique among major urban centers in having locked its boundaries in 1876. When the population of St. Louis County is included in these figures, Missouri's ratio of major metropolitan residents to rural residents closely matches the nation as a whole.|$|E
25|$|The MHP {{has been}} {{predicted}} {{to build on}} its success in the 2014 local elections and significantly improve its vote share, with support coming from former AKP nationalist <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> disillusioned with the Kurdish peace process. the MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli claimed {{that there was a}} very low possibility that such voters would return to the AKP, accusing the AKP of continuously changing ideologies from the Islamist National View to the more moderate Conservative democracy. The MHP has strongly targeted the AKP in their campaign, accusing the Supreme Electoral Council of severing no-one apart from Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and vowing to bring violations of the law to justice in the future. Such promises include the sending of Erdoğan to the Court of Cassation and turning the new presidential palace into a museum about Atatürk and the Republic. The MHP began its electoral rallies on 6 May in the north of the country, with Bahçeli also making stops at local cafes during his campaign to directly meet with voters. Bahçeli endorsed the new legal process that had begun against the Gülen Movement, though criticised the AKP due to their previous relations with the Movement.|$|E
500|$|A November 2005 {{report by}} the Auditor General of Canada stated that the data {{contained}} in the National Register of Electors as of May 2004 had [...] "coverage rates of more than 95 percent and currency rates of more than 81 percent", exceeding the stated goal of 92 percent for coverage (the proportion of eligible <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> included in the National Register of Electors) and 77 percent for currency (the proportion of all eligible voters whose address is correctly listed).|$|E

2500|$|Justice David Souter, {{joined by}} Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, filed a dissenting opinion, {{which would have}} {{declared}} the voter ID laws unconstitutional.

2500|$|Proposition 13 remains {{popular among}} California's likely <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> mostly homeowners. Among likely voters, 53% {{described}} Proposition 13 as [...] "mostly a good thing" [...] while 33% responded {{that it was}} [...] "mostly a bad thing" [...] in a 2006 Public Policy Institute of California survey. For adults who are not likely voters (mostly renters), Proposition 13 was unpopular — only 29% approval to 47% disapproval. Among California adults, overall approval was 47% approval to 38% disapproval. Periodic newspaper accounts report high voter approval.|$|E
2500|$|CBS News {{interviewed a}} nationally {{representative}} sample of 178 uncommitted debate-watchers.

Of the group 41 percent said Edwards won the debate, 28 said Cheney won, and 31 percent {{thought it was a}} tie. Both uncommitted men and uncommitted women preferred Edwards. A separate poll of 1000 likely voters found that 43 percent believed Cheney won while 37 percent felt Edwards did better.

Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.. Four non-partisan fact-checkers called her claim false. She then came under criticism for her comments on Washington Watch with Roland Martin, in which she said, [...] "You have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us {{all the way back to}} Jim Crow laws and literally—and very transparently—block access to the polls to <b>voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates".

2500|$|Unlike {{most other}} states, New Hampshire permits voters {{who have not}} {{declared}} their party affiliation to vote in a party's primary. A voter does have to officially join a specific political party before voting; however, the voter can change his or her affiliation back to [...] "Undeclared" [...] immediately after voting, and hence he or she only has {{to belong to a}} party for the few minutes it takes to fill out and cast a ballot. <b>Voters</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> already registered members of a political party cannot change their affiliation at the polling place; that can only be done before the checklist is closed several weeks prior to the election. New voters can, however, register at the polling place. All voting is done with paper ballots; however, most of the paper ballots are counted by machine.|$|E
6000|$|We deem {{the first}} of these {{measures}} far more tyrannical than the attempt of Great Britain to tax her colonies, which brought about the Revolution. It is of the same general character, that of unjust taxation: while it is attended by circumstances of aggravation that were altogether wanting in the policy of the mother country. This is not a tax for revenue, which is not needed; but a tax to [...] "choke off" [...] landlords, to use a common American phrase. It is clearly taxing nothing, or it is taxing the same property twice. It is done to conciliate three or four thousand <b>voters,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> now in the market, at the expense of three or four hundred who, it is known, are not to be bought. It is unjust in its motives, its means and its end. The measure is discreditable to civilization, and an outrage on liberty.|$|E
