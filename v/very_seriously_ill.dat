And the Emperor Justinian was taken <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>ill,</b> {{so that it was}} even reported that he had died. And this report was circulated by rumour and was carried as far as the Roman army. There some of the commanders began to say that, if the Romans should set up a second Justinian as Emperor over them in Byzantium, they would never tolerate it. But a little later it so fell out that the Emperor recovered, and the commanders of the Roman army began to slander one another. For Peter the General and John whom they called the Glutton declared that they had heard Belisarius and Bouzes say those things which I have just mentioned. The Empress Theodora, declaring that these slighting things which the men had said were directed against her, became quite out of patience. So she straightway summoned them all to Byzantium and made an investigation of the report." ...|$|E

50|$|Forensic psychiatrists often also do prison inreach work, {{in which}} they go into prisons and assess and treat people {{suspected}} of having mental disorders; much of the day-to-day work of these psychiatrists comprises care of <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> mentally <b>ill</b> patients , especially those suffering from schizophrenia. Some units also treat people with severe personality disorder or learning disabilities. The areas of assessment for courts are also somewhat different in Britain, because of differing mental health law. Fitness to plead and mental state {{at the time of}} the offence are indeed issues given consideration, but the mental state at the time of trial is also a major issue, and it is this assessment which most commonly leads to the use of mental health legislation to detain people in hospital, as opposed to their getting a prison sentence.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} socioeconomic status (SES) and outcomes for <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> patients. Design and setting: A retrospective cohort study {{based on data from}} an intensive care unit clinical database linked with data from the Western Australian hospital morbidity and mortality databases over a 16 -year period (1987 - 2002). Main outcome measures: In-hospital and long-term mortality. Results: Data on 15619 <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> patients were analysed.

40|$|Parents of <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> {{children}} {{are charged with}} making complicated medical decisions, {{and many of those}} decisions are made during their children’s hospitalizations. As medical staff seek to support parents, it is important for them to understand what resources parents are drawing upon for decision-making. This project explored parental decision-making by examining the following research questions: RQ 1 : What resources do parents draw upon to make medical decisions for their <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> children? RQ 2 : How do parents enact their spiritual or religious frameworks in clinical settings when faced with medical decisions for their <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> children? Methods of research included ethnographic observation of a pediatric palliative care team and semi-structured interviews with twenty parents and grandparents of <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> children. Analysis of the interview data brought out three main themes: the role of spirituality for parents of <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> children, the ways parents perceive spiritual conversations with hospital personnel, and the role of spirituality for parents making difficult decisions. A case study is presented as an exemplar of complex decision-making, and the author offers her personal narratives of parenting a <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> child. The author suggests new directions for practitioners based on a constitutive approach to communication in which practitioners and parents work together to build towards an understanding of the child’s illness. The findings from this study contribute to the current understanding of families with <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> children and should shape medical education {{in a way that will}} benefit the next generation of professional care providers as they seek to meet the needs of children and their families...|$|R

[...] But on her expressing an intention of sending instantly for a doctor, he stopped her, and said: [...] "No, he would go on with dinner, and go afterwards to London." [...] And then he made an effort to struggle against the fit that was fast coming on him, and talked, but incoherently, and soon very indistinctly. It being now evident that he was ill, and <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>ill,</b> his sister-in-law begged him to come to his own room before she sent off for medical help.

To his uncle’s dismay, he hinted that he might give away law and politics and dedicate his life to the church.

We heard it shortly afterwards, and I wish to take this opportunity of saying a few words of Mr Witt. Of his career at Eton and Cambridge I have no personal knowledge myself. But I have personal knowledge of Mr Witt during his career at the Bar. I am quite sure that every member of the Bar who knew him, and every member of the South-Eastern Circuit, to which Mr Witt belonged, looked upon him as a good friend and as a man who in every department of life, and particularly in his career as a barrister, was perfectly straight, perfectly to be trusted, and a good friend of every one of us.|$|E

50|$|Miramont Castle {{was built}} between 1895 and 1897 by Father Francolon, based upon {{architectural}} design elements that {{he picked up}} in his travels and ideas from his father, a diplomat. He hired brothers Archie and Angus Gillis to design the building, and {{was involved in the}} detailed planning meetings. The green sandstone used {{in the construction of the}} castle's walls was quarried nearby. It had electricity and indoor plumbing. Father Francolon invited the Sisters of Mercy to use his home for a tuberculosis treatment facility. Their first patient arrived in August 1895 and the next year they built the sanitarium. The offered good food, clean lodging, and care to patients who were not <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>ill</b> and by 1896 taught music lessons. From 1900 to 1904, Miramont was vacant. That sanitarium was burned down due to an electrical fire in 1907 and patients moved into the Miramont Castle building. It used about a dozen open-air TB huts until about 1923. One of the huts was donated to the museum in 1998 is located on the museum grounds. Between 1928 and 1946, the castle was used by the Sisters as a luxury boarding house, a retreat for clergy, and stood vacant. It is now a museum owned by the Manitou Springs Historical Society.|$|E
