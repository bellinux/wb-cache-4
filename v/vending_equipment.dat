Texas school district personnel were surveyed using a mailed questionnaire to determine the status of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs and the efficacy of conventional pest control practices. Of the 517 survey participants, 12. 4 % had procedures for IPM, and almost 28 % had official procedures for pesticide use (N= 1047). Over 75 % of Texas school districts contracted their general pest control activities to professionally licensed pest control firms. Specialty services such as termite control were contracted with licensed companies for almost 90 % of Texas districts. The principle in-house pest control practices (77. 3 %) were for weed control. A majority of districts (56. 3 %) were considered small (< three schools per district), and most (67. 8 %) budget $ 5000 or less for all pest control services. Present pest control practices were considered to be moderately to extremely effective by 87. 4 % of responding districts. The most important indoor pests, reported by the questionnaire responses, were cockroaches, ants, rodents, termites and head lice. Outdoor pests included fire ants (Solenopsis spp.), stinging (bees, wasps and hornets), flying (mosquitoes and gnats) and turfgrass insects (June beetles and mole crickets) and weeds. Control measures used by schools were categorized as non-chemical and chemical. Non-chemical pest control measures (mechanical and cultural controls) were used by at least 42 % of Texas schools. Results of the survey indicated that many different pesticides were used by school systems. When asked about specific pests and control measures, respondents frequently indicated that either the pest was not a problem or no chemicals were used for-their control. The most commonly selected insecticides by school district personnel were Dursban [chlorpyrifos], diazinon, and pyrethr-um products. Ten schools from different districts, representing all Texas regions and demographics, were selected for site visits and sticky trap sampling. The sampling program indicated that the most frequently encountered indoor pests, in order of importance, were German cockroaches [Blattella gerinanica (Linnaeus) ], Pharaoh [Monomotium pharaonis (L.) ] or crazy ants [Paratrechina longicomis (Latreille) ], followed by house crickets [Acheta domesticus (L.) ] and American cockroaches [Periplaneta atneiicana (L.) ]. High incidences of insects were detected in areas where food was stored and processed, such as food preparation <b>equipment,</b> <b>vending</b> machines, ovens and stoves...|$|R
50|$|Escrow {{is used in}} {{the field}} of {{automatic}} banking and <b>vending</b> <b>equipment.</b> One example is automated teller machines (ATMs), and is the function which allows the machine to hold the money deposited by the customer separately, and in case he or she challenges the counting result, the money is returned. Another example is a vending machine, where the customer's money is held in a separate escrow area pending successful completion of the transaction. If a problem occurs and the customer presses the refund button, the coins are returned from escrow; if no problem occurs, they fall into the coin vault of the machine.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years, from 1840 until 1850, all stamps were issued imperforate, {{and had to}} be cut from the sheet with {{scissors}} or knife. This was time-consuming and error-prone (as mangled stamps of the era attest).Once reliable separation equipment became available, nations switched rapidly. Imperforate stamps have been issued occasionally since then, either because separation equipment was temporarily unavailable (in newborn nations for instance), to makers of automatic stamp <b>vending</b> <b>equipment</b> (the United States did this in the 1900s and 1910s), as novelties for stamp collectors (particularly when stamps are issued in souvenir sheets), or as errors.|$|E
5000|$|Operation of bulk <b>vending</b> <b>equipment</b> {{is usually}} fairly {{straightforward}} for the consumer, involving placing the appropriate coin or coins {{in the machine}} and turning a knob or pulling a lever. If candy in a machine is low, however, and it appears unevenly distributed, the customer may wish to rock or whack the machine in order to knock some candy into the candy wheel, which {{is located in the}} bottom of the canister in the center. Depending on the design of the machine, though - which usually involves a wheel making a one-third turn with every vend - it may already be too late to ensure that the next vend bears fruit. A distinguishing feature of bulk vending is that the items are dispensed at random, so it is usually impossible to choose which item comes out of the machine next. A child trying to get a complete set of baseball cards, for instance, may end up with several duplicates; hence, the introduction of [...] "trading cards" [...] and similarly themed products, with the idea that consumers will trade the duplicates with one another.|$|E
40|$|Society is {{becoming}} quite dependent on computer-based systems. Today, computers {{are embedded in}} wristwatches, <b>vending</b> machines, factory <b>equipment,</b> automobiles and aircraft. A failure in a computer-based system that controls critical applications may lead to significant economic losses or even the loss of human lives. The causes of failures in computer-based systems are manifold: physical faults, maintenance errors, design and implementations mistakes resulting in hardware or software defects, and user or operator mistakes. These causes - faults - are all undesired circumstances that hinder the system from delivering the expected service. There are two complementary ways {{to ensure that a}} system delivers the expected service: fault prevention, i. e. avoid the introduction of faults; and fault tolerance, i. e. ensure that the system delivers its service despite the presence of faults. This thesis addresses fault tolerance. A fault-tolerant system should tolerate both hardware and software faults, as both categories can have a great impact on it. Furthermore, it is essential that confidence in a fault-tolerant system's ability is reached if it shall be deployed for critical applications. One attractive approach to reach confidence in a fault-tolerant system's capability is fault injection. Fault injection can be used for studying the effects of hardware and software faults. However, in both the academic community and industry, most fault injection studies have aimed at the effects of physical hardware faults. Only a few studies have been concerned with software faults, for the reason that knowledge of software faults experienced by systems in the field is limited. As a result, it is difficult to define realistic fault sets to inject. This is crucial if a fault injection experiment is intended to quantify a system's fault tolerance. Consequently, more research is needed in the fault injection area - especially studies targeting software faults and errors induced by them. This thesis contributes towards fulfilling this need by investigating models of software faults and models of errors induced by software faults. Techniques for emulating representative software faults were also implemented and evaluated. Specifically, an investigation of software faults experienced by a large IBM operating system product was carried out. In addition, general procedures that allow injection experiments to be based on field data were devised and put into practice to emulate software faults in an embedded real-time system. The novelty of the work of this thesis is the usage of general procedures to construct models of software faults and of software induced errors - on the basis of field data - in injection experiments. No such research has been carried out previously. The combined usage of the procedures and the injection techniques is the major contribution of this thesis. The use of these procedures and techniques is mainly in validation efforts aimed at predicting a fault-tolerant system,s ability to detect and process the effects of software faults...|$|R
50|$|Bulk vending {{dates back}} at least to the late 19th century. Vending {{machines}} were widely used in Europe before they became popular in the United States. In the early 1880s, the first commercial coin-operated vender was introduced in London and stocked with postcards. In 1888, the Thomas Adams Gum Co. introduced bulk venders to America, using the machines to sell Tutti frutti gum on elevated subway platforms in New York City. In 1897, the Pulver Manufacturing Company added animated figures to its gum machines. In 1907, the round, candy-coated gumball, a staple product in modern vending machines, was introduced http://www.gameroomantiques.com/HistoryGum.htm. In 1909, Emerson A. Bolen formed the Northwestern Novelty Company, selling the Yankee, a penny matchstick vending machine; Bolen's company {{is now one of the}} most prominent bulk vending machine manufacturers. In 1913, Ford Mason leased 102 machines and placed them in stores and shops of communities in western New York State; he would eventually found the Ford Gum & Machine Company, an empire of over 500,000 vending machines https://web.archive.org/web/20051113185502/http://www.fordgum.com/about_us.aspx. In 1948, Oak Manufacturing opened its doors; it would become one of the largest equipment manufacturers in the industry. In 1963, Josef Schwarzli founded Beaver Machine Corporation, designing and manufacturing his own equipment that is sold today into over 100 different countries worldwide. In 1949, Roger C. Folz purchased his first vending machine; Folz Vending was the largest operator of bulk <b>vending</b> <b>equipment</b> in the United States, owning and operating over 150,000 machines nationwide http://www.folzvending.com/index.cfm?npageid=6 at their peak.|$|E
40|$|On Forsyth Street in Chinatown, {{in what is}} {{certainly}} the busiest fruit and vegetable market in any low-income New York neighborhood, the city's police and health departments are undermining access to healthy food through strict enforcement of vending regulations and near-daily sweeps, resulting in ticketing, arrests, and the confiscation and destruction of fresh produce and <b>vending</b> <b>equipment.</b> Data recently released by the Environmental Control Board (ECB) reveal that 949 ECB summonses were issued to fruit and vegetable vendors at the street market on Forsyth Street between Canal and Division Streets in 2009 and 2010, an average of 1. 3 tickets per day. When criminal court, parking and sanitation summonses are added in, we estimate Forsyth Street Market vendors have received more than 2, 000 total tickets {{over the past two}} years. Our three-month investigation reveals that this aggressive enforcement has driven vendors out of business, diminished the market, and curbed access to healthy food for Chinatown residents...|$|E
40|$|The MIFARE MF 0 ICU 1 {{has been}} {{developed}} by NXP Semiconductors {{to be used in}} a contactless smart ticket or smart card in combination with a Proximity Coupling Devices (PCD) in accordance with ISO/IEC 14443 A (see Ref. 1). It is intended for use as single trip or limited use tickets in public transportation networks, loyalty cards or day passes for events as a replacement for conventional ticketing solutions such as paper tickets, magnetic stripe tickets or coins. As the usage of contactless proximity smart cards becomes more and more common, transport and event operators are switching to completely contactless solutions. The introduction of the MIFARE Ultralight for limited use tickets may lead to a reduction of system installation and maintenance costs. Terminals may be less vulnerable to damage and mechanical failures caused by ticket jams. MF 0 ICU 1 can easily be integrated into existing schemes and even standard paper ticket <b>vending</b> <b>equipment</b> can be upgraded. This solution for low cost tickets can help operators to reduce the circulation of cash within the system. The mechanical and electronical specifications of MIFARE Ultralight are tailored to meet the requirements of paper ticket manufacturers. 1. 1 Contactless energy and data transfer In the MIFARE system, the MF 0 ICU 1 is connected to a coil with a few turns. The MF 0 ICU 1 fits the TFC. 0 (Edmondson) and TFC. 1 (ISO) ticket formats as defined in BS EN 753 - 2. TFC. 1 format tickets are supported by the MF 0 ICU 10 chip which features a 17 pF on-chip resonance capacitor. The smaller TFC. 0 format tickets are supported by the MF 0 ICU 11 chip which features a 50 pF on-chip resonance capacitor. 1. 2 Anticollision An intelligent anticollision function enables simultaneous multicard operation. The anticollision algorithm individually selects each card and ensures correct execution of a transaction with the selected card without interference from another card in the field...|$|E
