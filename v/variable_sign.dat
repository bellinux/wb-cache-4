40|$|In view of {{the serious}} traffic {{congestion}} during peak hours in most metropolitan areas {{around the world and}} recent improvement of information technology, there is a growing aspiration to alleviate road congestion by applications of electronic information and communication technology. Providing drivers with dynamic travel time information such as estimated journey times on major routes should help drivers to select better routes and guide them to utilise existing expressway network. This can be regarded as one possible strategy for effective traffic management. This paper aims to investigate the effects and benefits of providing dynamic travel time information to drivers via <b>variable</b> message <b>signs</b> at the expressway network. In order to assess the effects of the dynamic driver information system with making use of the <b>variable</b> message <b>signs,</b> a time-dependent traffic assignment model is proposed.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectrum}} of a one-dimensional Dirac operator pencil, with a coupling constant {{in front of the}} potential considered as a spectral parameter. Motivated by recent investigations of graphene waveguides, we focus on the values of the coupling constant for which the kernel of the Dirac operator contains a square integrable function. In physics literature such a function is called a confined zero mode. Several results on the asymptotic distribution of coupling constants giving rise to zero modes are obtained. In particular, we show that the properties of this distribution depend in a subtle way on the sign variation and the presence of gaps in the potential. We also observe that <b>variable</b> <b>sign</b> potentials may produce complex eigenvalues of the operator pencil.

40|$|We present several {{solutions}} for the five dimensional gravity models {{in the presence of}} bulk ghosts and tachyons to argue that these "troublesome" fields can be a useful model-building tool. The ghost-like signature of the kinetic term for a bulk scalar creates a minimum in the scale factor, removing the necessity for a negative tension brane in models with the compactified fifth dimension. It is shown that the model with the positive tension branes and a ghost field in the bulk leads to the radion stabilization. The bulk scalar with the <b>variable</b> <b>sign</b> kinetic term can be used to model both positive and negative tension branes of a finite width in the compact dimension. Finally, we present several ghost and tachyon field configurations in the bulk that lead to the localization of gravity in four dimensions, including one solution with the Gaussian profile for the metric, g_μν(y) =η_μν-α y^ 2, which leads to a stronger localization of gravity than the Randall-Sundrum model.

40|$|Static, cylindrically {{symmetric}} {{solutions to}} nonlinear scalar-Einstein equations are considered. Regularity {{conditions on the}} symmetry axis and flat or string asymptotic conditions are formulated in order to select soliton-like solutions. Some non-existence theorems are proved, in particular, theorems asserting (i) the absence of black-hole and wormholelike cylindrically symmetric solutions for any static scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity and (ii) the absence of solutions with a regular axis for scalar fields with the Lagrangian L = F(I), I = ϕ α ϕα, for any function F(I) possessing a correct weak field limit. Exact solutions for scalar fields with an arbitrary potential function V (ϕ) are obtained by quadratures and are expressed in a parametric form in a few ways, where the parameter may be either the coordinate x, or the ϕ field itself, {{or one of the}} metric coefficients. It is shown that soliton-like solutions exist only with V (ϕ) having a <b>variable</b> <b>sign.</b> Some explicit examples of the solutions (including a soliton-like one) and their flat-space limit are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{processing}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of industrial systems, including semiconductor manufacture (deposition and etching) and accurate control of the impedance matching network is vital if repeatable quality is to be achieved at the manufacturing process output. Typically, impedance matching networks employ series (tune) and parallel (load) capacitors to drive the reflection coefficient on the load side of the network to zero. The reflection coefficient is normally represented by real and imaginary parts, giving two variables to be controlled using the load and tune capacitors. The resulting problem is therefore a nonlinear, multivariable control problem. Current industrial impedance matching units employ simple single-loop proportional controllers, which take no account of interaction between individual channels and, in many cases, may fail to tune altogether, if the starting point is far away from the matching point. A hierarchical feedback controller is developed which, at the upper level, performs a single-loop tuning, but with the important addition of a <b>variable</b> <b>sign</b> feedback gain. When convergence to a region in the neighbourhood of the matching point is achieved, a dual single-loop controller takes over, which gives fine tuning of the matching network...|$|E

To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio traffic information and <b>variable</b> message <b>sign</b> information. The results confirm earlier findings that women {{are less likely to be}} influenced by traffic information.

New studies on large samples will further document the existing relation between the described oral adverse effects and the implied pathophysiological mechanisms.

Certainly, the best hedged portfolio is the one that is built based on the model that takes into account both stochastic correlation and extended market price of risk.

Household size is if anything perhaps mildly positively associated with staying on at school or doing better in a literacy test, {{but it may be}} that those in larger households are more likely on average to still be living in their parental home. In several countries, having young children in the house is mildly negatively related to having a white-collar job, this effect being much more evident for women, and is positively associated {{with working in}} agriculture, again especially for women. But having young children in the household strongly negatively related to passing a literacy test and to staying on at school to the secondary level, again especially for women.
