40|$|Objective: This article {{examines}} the 1943 surrealistic painting Schizophrenia by Ivor Francis, the first major Australian art work depicting a mental disorder. Francis was influenced by Max Harris who encouraged him to read works on surrealism and psychoanalysis, but took his ideas from the book on schizophrenia by the radical Melbourne psychiatrist, Reg Ellery. Conclusion: Ivor Francis produced a riveting painting that stands as an enduring <b>visual</b> <b>beacon</b> in the cultural history of Antipodean psychiatry...|$|E
40|$|The {{protection}} of workers from chemical, biological, or radiological hazards {{requires the use of}} protective materials that can maintain their integrity during use. An accidental puncture in the protective material can result in a significant exposure to the worker. A five ply material has been developed that incorporates two layers of an electrically conductive polymer sandwiched between three layers of a nonconductive polymer. A normally open circuit that is connected between the conductive layers will be closed by puncturing the material with either a conductive or nonconductive object. This can be used to activate an audible alarm or <b>visual</b> <b>beacon</b> to warn the worker of a breach in the integrity of the material. The worker is not connected to the circuit, and the puncture can be detected in real-time, even when caused by a nonconductor...|$|E
30|$|In {{our first}} experiment, {{pedestrian}} navigation was simulated in a large-scale urban desktop virtual environment, with participants navigating point-to-point {{in the environment}} (e.g. first to the pet store, then to the laundromat, etc.). To ensure an uninformed search occurred, participants were completely unfamiliar with the environment, including its landmarks, road network, and structure. While wayfinding to each destination, participants could request a floating <b>visual</b> <b>beacon</b> overlaid onto the virtual environment, up to five times during each origin-to-destination trial, to help guide them in the correct direction. If wayfinders seek information to inform a decision before entering an intersection, navigation aid requests should occur in path segments, not in intersections; furthermore, requests should predict an approach to (rather than departure from) an intersection. Finally, if requesting a beacon facilitates a decision before entering an intersection, then executing a behavior (i.e. continuing straight or turning) in the intersection should be faster when a prior beacon was requested versus when it was not. These patterns of wayfinding behavior may be correlated with spatial abilities and strategies, for instance a higher spatial sense of direction {{might be related to}} higher path efficiency and perhaps lower beacon reliance overall.|$|E
50|$|Beacons {{help guide}} navigators to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include radar reflectors, radio <b>beacons,</b> sonic and <b>visual</b> signals. <b>Visual</b> <b>beacons</b> range from small, single-pile {{structures}} to large lighthouses or light stations {{and can be}} located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called lights; unlighted beacons are called daybeacons.|$|R
30|$|The LPS has {{two main}} functions; {{the first is}} to {{estimate}} in real-time the distance to the road lane marks {{on both sides of the}} vehicle using image processing algorithms. It uses two PAL cameras installed in the place of the front fog lamps to capture the lane marks. In a different working mode, the LPS can also perform image processing algorithms to detect predefined <b>visual</b> <b>beacons,</b> as required in some experiments.|$|R
5000|$|The game uses fractal {{technology}} {{to create the}} craggy mountains of an alien planet, where the visilibility was drastically reduced by the dense atmosphere. The player controls a fictional [...] "Valkyrie" [...] space fighter (converted for search and rescue duty) from a first-person view, attempting to land and pick up downed Ethercorps pilots. [...] Some of these mountains hold anti-aircraft guns, which have to be avoided or destroyed. Due to the varied terrain, the direction finder has {{to be used to}} locate the pilots, whose <b>visual</b> <b>beacons</b> are often masked by mountain ridges.|$|R
40|$|Rats, {{like other}} crepuscular animals, have {{excellent}} auditory capacities and they discriminate well between different sounds [Heffner HE, Heffner RS, Hearing in two cricetid rodents: wood rats (Neotoma floridana) and grasshopper mouse (Onychomys leucogaster). J Comp Psychol 1985; 99 (3) : 275 - 88]. However, most experimental literature concerning spatial orientation almost exclusively emphasizes {{the use of}} visual landmarks [Cressant A, Muller RU, Poucet B. Failure of centrally placed objects to control the firing fields of hippocampal place cells. J Neurosci 1997; 17 (7) : 2531 - 42; and Goodridge JP, Taube JS. Preferential use of the landmark navigational system by head direction cells in rats. Behav Neurosci 1995; 109 (1) : 49 - 61]. To address the important issue of whether rats are able to achieve a place navigation task relative to auditory beacons, we designed a place learning task in the water maze. We controlled cue availability by conducting the experiment in total darkness. Three auditory cues did not allow place navigation whereas three visual cues in the same positions did support place navigation. One auditory beacon directly associated with the goal location did not support taxon navigation (a beacon strategy allowing the animal to find the goal just by swimming toward the cue). Replacing the auditory beacons by one single <b>visual</b> <b>beacon</b> did support taxon navigation. A multimodal configuration of two auditory cues and one visual cue allowed correct place navigation. The deletion of the two auditory or of the one visual cue did disrupt the spatial performance. Thus rats can combine information from different sensory modalities to achieve a place navigation task. In particular, auditory cues support place navigation when associated with a visual one...|$|E
25|$|Simultaneous with Wilde Sau, Zahme Sau (Tame Boar) was introduced, {{in which}} the twin-engined night fighters in to the Himmelbett system using {{individual}} ground controlled interception were released. The fighters flew against the bomber stream in a co-ordinated operation over a wide area, guided by a running commentary derived from radar, ground observation, wireless interception and contact reports from aircraft tracking the bomber stream. Audio and <b>visual</b> <b>beacons</b> were used to assemble the fighters, which circled the beacons until the target was known and then intercepted the bombers, above a height beyond which the flak did not fire.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{demonstrate}} the e#ciency of Wavelet Multi-Resolution Analysis (W-MRA) applied to automated shape recognition in an automatic vehicle driving scheme. Di#erent types of shapes have to be recognized in this framework. They pertain to most of the objects entering the sensors field of a car. These objects can be road signs, lane separation lines, moving or static obstacles, other automotive vehicles, or <b>visual</b> <b>beacons.</b> The recognition process must be invariant to global, a#ne or not, transformations which are : rotation, translation, scaling and perspective (wide angle camera lenses).

40|$|Abstract For small robotic airships, it is {{required}} that the airship should be capable of following a predefined track. In this paper, computer vision-based navigation and optimal fuzzy control strategies for the robotic airship are proposed. Firstly, visual navigation based on natural landmarks of the environment is introduced. For example, when the airship is flying over a city, buildings {{can be used as}} <b>visual</b> <b>beacons</b> whose geometrical properties are known from the digital map or a geographical information system (GIS). Then a geometrical methodology is adopted to extract information about the orientation and position of the airship. In order to keep the airship on a predefined track, a fuzzy flight control system is designed, which uses those data as its input. And genetic algorithms (GAs), a general-purpose global optimization method, are utilized to optimize the membership functions of the fuzzy controller. Finally, the navigation and control strategies are validated. Key words Visual navigation, flight control, predefined track following, robotic airship. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} layout in the {{comprehension}} of design pattern roles in UML class diagrams is assessed. This work replicates and extends {{a previous study}} using questionnaires but uses an eye tracker to gather additional data. The purpose of the replication is to gather more insight into the eye gaze behavior not evident from questionnaire-based methods. Similarities and differences between the studies are presented. Four design patterns are examined in two layout schemes {{in the context of}} three open source systems. Fifteen participants answered a series of eight design pattern role detection questions. Results show a significant improvement in role detection accuracy and visual effort with a certain layout for the Strategy and Observer patterns and a significant improvement in role detection time for all four patterns. Eye gaze data indicates classes participating in a design pattern act like <b>visual</b> <b>beacons</b> when they are in close physical proximity and follow the canonical layout, even though they violate some general graph aesthetics.

5000|$|Airway beacons were {{constructed}} by the Post Office and the Department of Commerce between 1923 and 1933. The Low Frequency Radio Range system began to replace this visual system in 1929. The last <b>visual</b> airway <b>beacon</b> was supposedly shut down in 1973, but some airway beacons are still operating in Western Montana and are charted on the Great Falls sectional chart. [...] They are maintained by the Montana Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division.|$|R
30|$|The {{present results}} {{can be applied to}} the {{development}} of beacon-based navigation systems in three primary ways. First, we demonstrate that <b>visual</b> <b>beacons</b> can be used to guide efficient navigation through dense urban virtual environments, suggesting future potential for these systems (Brunyé et al., 2016 a; Loomis, Golledge, & Klatzky, 1998). Second, pedestrians seem to rely upon these systems during the approach to an intersection, suggesting that adaptive future systems would find value in portraying beacons before pedestrians arrive in an intersection, affording them the opportunity to plan maneuvers in advance. This suggestion is supported by Experiment 2 results, which further demonstrate that wayfinders move in ways that demonstrate anticipatory planning and behavior before entering an intersection. It is also supported by anticipatory driver behavior during approach to signalized intersections (Yang et al., 2014). Third, we demonstrate that the dynamics of wayfinding behavior and beacon system reliance are contingent on not only location relative to an intersection, but also interactions between the user’s characteristics (e.g. spatial skills) and environmental experience. This finding complicates the relationship between humans and navigation systems, suggesting that systems adaptive to not only location but also users and their relationship with environments might prove beneficial to guiding navigation (Fuchs & Schwarz, 2017). Our research thus reveals a layer of complexity motivating continuing research regarding human-systems interaction during wayfinding.|$|R
40|$|Some social {{signals are}} sexually {{selected}} both by female mating preferences and by male–male competition for mates. Studies of the behavioural mechanisms that mediate {{responses to these}} signals provide insight into how sexual selection operates. Courting male fiddler crabs, Uca terpsichores, sometimes build large sand structures called hoods at the openings to their burrows. Hoods attract females to males' burrows for mating because they elicit landmark orientation, a behaviour that is selected by predation. Males also orient visually to their own hoods when errors are introduced experimentally into their nonvisual mechanism for path integration. These errors occur naturally when males move far from their burrows to court females or fight neighbours. Here we explored whether courting males also use hoods as <b>visual</b> <b>beacons</b> {{to the location of}} their burrow. Crabs that rely on path integration to orient to their burrow keep their lateral axis closely aligned with the bearing home. We therefore measured and compared the distances males moved from their burrows and the maximum deviations between males' body axes and home bearings for males that did and did not build hoods, males that had their hood removed and males that had a hood added to their burrow. Males with hoods did not range further from their burrows than those without hoods, but they exhibited greater maximum deviations between their body axes and the bearings to their burrows. Hoods may facilitate courtship by allowing males to move more freely than when they rely on nonvisual path integration alone...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{complete}} control architecture for a mobile robot that will work in an indoor semi-structured environment. The goals the robot has to reach are a set of <b>visual</b> colored <b>beacons</b> attached to real world objects. The robot is able to detect and track these objects, compute the distance to them, and move towards them while coping with unexpected events that may occur in the environment. Our main goals have been to construct a complete control systems that (1) is able to react in real time to events and (2) accomplishes the steps of a plan provided by a user.

5000|$|The {{official}} town seal {{was created}} by Ward Cruea, a commercial artist from Dayton, Ohio. His original proposal featured the [...] "sleeping giant" [...] (the Blue Ridge Mountain ridgeline west of Amherst), but this was rejected since it represented an area outside the town's limits. According to town legend, while a group was in the Clerk's office in the town hall engaged in conversation on the topics of the day, and looking eastward along E. Court Street, {{it was suggested that}} the Amherst courthouse be used {{as a model for the}} official seal. During that era, a large letter [...] "A" [...] was attached to a radio antenna tower beside the telephone company building that was adjacent to the courthouse. This internally illuminated [...] "A" [...] was used as a <b>visual</b> navigation <b>beacon</b> by aircraft pilots. Approximately six months later Cruea returned to the town and delivered a framed original of a proposed seal. His proposal incorporated the courthouse, the [...] "A" [...] and the town's date of incorporation. Cruea's proposal was adopted soon thereafter and became Amherst's official seal. The original seal is located on the wall of the town council chambers.|$|R
5000|$|From early 1944, the Mosquito also {{operated}} in the bomber support role with Bomber Command's 100 Group, their task being to harass the Luftwaffe NachtJagd (night fighters) attacking the bomber streams over Germany. The Mosquito squadrons of 100 Group used several different marks of Mosquitos for different purposes: NF XIXs and NF 30s {{were used for}} dedicated night fighter operations providing escort for the bomber streams; F Mk IIs and FB Mk VIs were used for [...] "Flower" [...] (patrolling enemy airfields well ahead of the bomber stream and dropping bombs to keep enemy night fighters {{on the ground as}} well as attacking night fighters in the landing pattern) and [...] "Mahmoud" [...] operations. Mahmouds were mounted independently of Bomber Command activity whereby Mosquitos flew to known assembly points for German night fighters (usually <b>visual</b> or radio <b>beacons)</b> and attacked any in the area. B Mk IVs and PR Mk XVIs were used for Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) operations, using special equipment to detect and identify German radar and radio transmissions. Some 258 Luftwaffe night fighters were claimed destroyed by the Group, for the loss of some 70 Mosquitos. The omnipresence of the potent night fighter threat led to what the Luftwaffe crews dubbed [...] "Moskitoschreck" [...] (Mosquito terror), as the German aircrews were never sure when or where they might come under attack from the marauding 100 Group fighters, and indirectly led to a high proportion of aircraft and crew losses from crashes as night fighters hurried in to land to avoid the Mosquito threat, whether real or imagined.|$|R
