25|$|The Chartist movement's reformist goals, {{although}} not immediately and directly attained, were gradually achieved. In {{the same year}} as the People's Charter was created, the British Parliament instead responded by passing the 1842 Mining Act. Carefully <b>valving</b> the steam of the working-class movement, Parliament reduced the working day to ten hours in 1847.|$|E
25|$|Associated {{factors include}} inflammation, drugs, trauma and intraocular surgery, {{including}} cataract surgery and vitrectomy procedures. Gede Pardianto (2005) reported on four {{patients who had}} toxic glaucoma. One of them underwent phacoemulsification with small particle nucleus drops. Some cases can be resolved with some medication, vitrectomy procedures or trabeculectomy. <b>Valving</b> procedures can give some relief, but further research is required.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{outside of}} the engine were less extreme, but with a {{distinction}} between the third and fourth generation, with changes of the engine hood. The Tremec T56 transmission was replaced with a new Tremec TR6060 with triple first-gear synchronizers and doubles for higher gears. The Dana M44-4 rear axle from the 2003–2006 model now has a GKN ViscoLok speed-sensing limited-slip differential that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under acceleration. Another performance upgrade was the removal of run-flat tires; the new Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension (springs, anti-roll bars, and shock <b>valving),</b> made the Viper more neutral in cornering.|$|E

25|$|The 1998 model {{had a few}} minor {{refinement}} {{changes to}} the brakes, suspension, steering and emissions controls. A new front control arm design with front hydraulic bushing and rear cross axis ball joint for enhanced ride smoothness and better isolation from road noise and vibration. Internal rebound springs added to front struts for improved body motion control and to minimize crash-through. Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual durometer cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium <b>valving</b> and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation. New steering calibration for more on-center feel and reduced parking effort.|$|E

50|$|The main {{processing}} method for controlling the fluid under this technology platform {{is the use}} of small mechanical valves. Mechanical <b>valving</b> is similar to a complex plumbing system because the microfabricated fluidic channels act as the plumbing pipes while the various controllable valves direct the fluid. Mechanical <b>valving</b> is also considered to be the most robust solution to the disadvantages of the electrokinetic manipulation and vesicle encapsulation, since the mechanical valves operate completely independent from the fluid's physical and chemical properties. Because the physical properties that make up the microfabricated fluidic channels and mechanical valves are difficult to process due to the system's extremely small scale, this technique has a disadvantage of creating an integrated nanoliter system with mechanical <b>valving</b> to the nanoliter scale.|$|E

50|$|Aortic <b>valve</b> {{replacement}} is {{a surgical}} procedure {{in which a}} patient's aortic <b>valve</b> {{is replaced by a}} different <b>valve.</b> The aortic <b>valve</b> can be affected by a range of diseases and require aortic <b>valve</b> replacement. The <b>valve</b> can become either leaky (regurgitant or insufficient) or stuck partially shut (stenotic). Aortic <b>valve</b> replacement traditionally required open heart surgery. A new alternative is transcatheter aortic <b>valve</b> replacement (TAVR), which delivers a mechanical <b>valve</b> {{to the site of the}} diseased <b>valve</b> through a catheter. There are two basic types of artificial heart <b>valve,</b> mechanical <b>valves</b> and tissue <b>valves.</b> Tissue heart <b>valves</b> are usually made from animal tissues, either animal heart <b>valve</b> tissue or animal pericardial tissue. The tissue is pretreated by removing antigens to prevent rejection and to prevent calcification.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>valve</b> seen for <b>valve</b> {{attachments}} is the rotary <b>valve.</b> Some trombones have piston <b>valves</b> used instead of rotary <b>valves</b> for <b>valve</b> attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary <b>valve</b> have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer <b>valve</b> or axial-flow <b>Valve,</b> the Hagmann <b>valve,</b> the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary <b>valve</b> would allow.

50|$|The {{improved}} <b>valving</b> {{mechanism of}} the Corliss steam engine (Patented. 1849) was better able to adjust speed with varying load and increased efficiency by about 30%. The Corliss engine had separate valves and headers for the inlet and exhaust steam so the hot feed steam never contacted the cooler exhaust ports and <b>valving.</b> The valves were quick acting, which reduced the amount of throttling of the steam and resulted in faster response. Instead of operating a throttling valve, the governor was used to adjust the valve timing to give a variable steam cut off. The variable cut off was responsible for {{a major portion of}} the efficiency increase of the Corliss engine.|$|E
