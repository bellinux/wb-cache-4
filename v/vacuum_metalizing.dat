He developed an improved silvering method, which would become the standard for coating first surface mirrors (known as the [...] "Brashear Process") until <b>vacuum</b> <b>metalizing</b> began replacing it in 1932.|$|E
40|$|A {{transparent}} polymer based {{solar cell}} {{was designed and}} fabricated to utilize the solar energy when exposed to sunlight. The transparent solar cell for window module was composed of a polymeric material PPV (Polyphenylene vinylene), ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) and electrode (Al, Mg, Ca). The polymeric sheet of this cell is by casting process, and elec-trode is applied on it by CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process. The solar energy collected by this window {{can be used to}} power up small household electrical appliances. Recently, polymeric solar cell is made by a roll-to-roll process without using indium-tin oxide (ITO). A commercially available kapton (Polyimide) foil with an over layer of copper was used as the substrate. Sputtering of titanium metal on to the kapton/copper in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>metalizing</b> process gave the monolithic substrate and back electrode for the devices. The active layer was slot-die coated on to the kapton/Cu/Ti foil followed by slot-die coating of a layer of PET, PC or PEN...|$|E

40|$|Selectively {{functionalized}} polyolefine {{surfaces are}} essential for many applications in adhesion, chemistry, medicine and biotechnology. To provide polymer surfaces with special functionalities {{it is necessary to}} treat them with according precursors in plasma. In this work polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were exposed to bromine containing (bromoform, allylbromide, tert-butylbromide) plasmas. Surpisingly, the bromination appeared as high selective and formed high dense C-Br groups at the polyolefin surface. Halogen containing plasmas like tetrafluormethane, fluoroform, chloroform, bromoform and diiodinemethane were compared with regard to their selectivity, yield as well as ionisation potential and electron temperature of the corresponding plasma. It was also analysed if the halogens are bonded as C-X or C-CXn-fragments onto the surface. Moreover, the post-plasma oxidation stability was also investigated. Subsequently the brominated polyolefine surfaces were allowed to react with different organic compounds. The aim was to demonstrate the universality of the C-Br group for attaching of any OH and NH 2 functional group containing molecule. Terminal alcohol, glycols and amines are used. Especially, flexibilizing spacers within the metal-polymer interface of different length, stiffness and functionality were introduced. Besides grafting of spacers it was also shown {{that it is possible to}} change the functionality of the surface. Concentrated or liquid ammonia should produce primary amino groups through a simple substitution. Hydroxyl groups were formed by hydrolsis using potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide in different solvents. The different grafted polypropylene surfaces were brought into <b>vacuum</b> and were <b>metalized</b> with copper or aluminium. The thus produced metal-polymer composite was then tested on the peel strengths of the evaporated metal film...|$|R
