The museum is home to over three million objects and specimens and houses the Moody Planetarium, art galleries, a sculpture court, and a natural science research laboratory. The museum also operates the Val Verde County research site and the Lubbock Lake Landmark, an archaeological site and natural history preserve in the city of Lubbock. The site has evidence of 12,000years of use by ancient cultures on the Llano Estacado (Southern High Plains), and allows visitors to watch active archaeological digs. <b>Visiting</b> <b>scientists</b> and tourists may also participate in the discovery process. Lubbock Lake Landmark is a National Historic Landmark, which lists it on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a designated State Archaeological Landmark. Texas Tech is also the location of the Southwest Collection of historical archives and the sponsoring institution of the West Texas Historical Association.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{the town}} might cease to officially exist, but the {{physical}} infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities {{that had to}} be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room school house. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of Weston, Illinois, that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing <b>visiting</b> <b>scientists</b> and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off {{at the edges of the}} property, with gatehouses or simply barricades to prevent unsupervised access.|$|E

Ehlers had been suggested by Ludwig Biermann, the institute's director at the time. When Ehlers joined the institute in 1971, he also became an adjunct professor at Munich's Ludwig Maximilian University. In March 1991, the institute split into the Max Planck Institute for Physics and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, where Ehlers' department found a home.

2500|$|From April 1st to December 1st 1951, Caltech was {{the host}} of a federal {{classified}} study, Project Vista. The selection of Caltech as host for the project was based on the university’s expertise in rocketry and nuclear physics. In response to the war in Korea and the pressure from the Soviet Union, the project was Caltech’s way of assisting the federal government in its effort to increase national security. The project was created to study new ways of improving the relationship between tactical air support and ground troops. [...] The Army, Air Force, and Navy sponsored the project, however it was under contract with the Army. The study was named after the hotel, Vista del Arroyo Hotel, which housed the study. The study operated under a committee with the supervision of President Lee A. DuBridge. William A. Fowler, a professor at Caltech, was selected as research director. More than a fourth of Caltech’s faculty and a group of outside scientists staffed the project. Moreover, the number increases if one takes into account <b>visiting</b> <b>scientists,</b> military liaisons, secretarial, and security staff. In compensation for its participation, the university received about $750,000.|$|E
