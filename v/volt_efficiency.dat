40|$|The {{object of}} this study is {{evaluation}} of cadmium removal from industrial wastewater by electrochemical precipitation method. This study is a Laboratory experimental study which was done in pilot plant form. A glass tank in 1. 45 L volume with four plate electrode was used to do experiments. The electrodes made of aluminum and zinc and connect to the positive and negative pole of DC power supply, respectively (monopolar mode). The tank was filled with synthetic wastewater that was containing cadmium ion in concentration 50 and 250 mg L - 1 and then it was started up. The amount of cadmium ion removal was measured at pH 4, 6 and 10 and in electric potential range of 10 to 25 volts. When the initial concentration of cadmium ion was 50 mg L - 1, the highest amount of cadmium removal was 40 min after starting the process and when the initial concentration was 250 mg L - 1, the highest amount of removal was obtained 70 min after starting at 10, 20 and 25 <b>volts.</b> <b>Efficiency</b> of this process was more than 99 %. The results show that in pH range from 4 to 10, this process is applicable. In initial stages of the process, with initial pH of 4 to 6, pH has increased but in initial pH of 10, in both concentrations pH has decreased. In the initial concentration 50 and 250 mg L - 1 of cadmium, SVI was 33. 4 - 129. 9 and 72. 1 - 292. 9 min. In electrochemical precipitation, the initial concentration was effective, so if the initial concentration increases, the time of process should increase too. In this process, the use of different electrical potentials can provide a wide range of pH for doing this process...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} at JPL {{have demonstrated}} that high conversion efficiencies are found with GaAs metal semiconductor solar cells when a particular heat treatment processing step is used to introduce an interfacial layer between the metal and the semiconductor.

40|$|During the {{previous}} year, grant activity research focused on demonstrating high thrust/power operation of Hall thrusters. Performance {{of a low}} power and a high power Hall thruster was experimentally investigated at discharge voltages from 100 to 150 <b>volts.</b> Discharge <b>efficiencies</b> dropped significantly as discharge voltage was decreased over this range. Reductions in discharge efficiency with decreasing discharge voltage were attributed to reductions in ionization efficiency and/or ion acceleration through a potential less that the applied discharge voltage relative {{to the performance of}} state-of-art Hall thrusters operating at discharge voltages of 300 Volts and above. The low power Hall thruster exhibited a more pronounced reduction in discharge efficiency with decreasing discharge voltage. This was attributed to increased electron leakage related to the axial distribution of the radial magnetic field. These data demonstrated that the thrust benefit of operating at discharge voltages below 130 Volts was offset by a corresponding decrease in discharge efficiency for a given input power. Additional activities included continued support of on-going Hall thruster propulsion research within the On-Board Propulsion Branch at NASA Glenn Research Center...|$|R
50|$|Electrogenic {{microorganisms}} consuming {{an energy}} source (such as acetic acid) release electrons and protons, creating an electrical potential {{of up to}} 0.3 volts. In a conventional MFC, this voltage is used to generate electrical power. In a MEC, an additional voltage is supplied to the cell from an outside source. The combined voltage is sufficient to reduce protons, producing hydrogen gas. As part of the energy for this reduction is derived from bacterial activity, the total electrical energy {{that has to be}} supplied is less than for electrolysis of water in the absence of microbes. Hydrogen production has reached up to 3.12 m3H2/m3d with an input voltage of 0.8 <b>volts.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of hydrogen production depends on which organic substances are used. Lactic and acetic acid achieve 82% efficiency, while the values for unpretreated cellulose or glucose are close to 63%.The efficiency of normal water electrolysis is 60 to 70 percent. As MEC’s convert unusable biomass into usable hydrogen, they can produce 144% more usable energy than they consume as electrical energy. Depending on the organisms present at the cathode, MEC’s can also produce methane by a related mechanism.|$|R
50|$|From a {{physical}} electronic viewpoint, thermionic energy conversion is the direct production of electric power from heat by thermionic electron emission. From a thermodynamic viewpoint, {{it is the}} use of electron vapor as the working fluid in a power-producing cycle. A thermionic converter consists of a hot emitter electrode from which electrons are vaporized by thermionic emission and a colder collector electrode into which they are condensed after conduction through the interelectrode plasma. The resulting current, typically several amperes per square centimetre of emitter surface, delivers electrical power to a load at a typical potential difference of 0.5 - 1 <b>volt</b> and thermal <b>efficiency</b> of 5 - 20%, depending on the emitter temperature (1500 - 2000 K) and mode of operation.|$|R
40|$|With a tube {{of simple}} design, {{positive}} ions of potassium are driven by controllable accelerating potentials up to 750 volts into neon and argon at various pressures. Small collecting potentials are adjusted {{in such a way}} as to eliminate practically all secondary effects due to the ions, enabling the collection of any electrons liberated by ionization in the gases. Pressure ranges between 0. 05 and 1 mm give definite variation of ionization with pressure. Curves are given showing the variation of ionization with pressure and the number of new ions formed per positive ion per cm path reduced to 1 mm pressure. Ionization by this process does not offer a sharp initial point, but a measurable amount is present in neon at 100 volts, and in argon between 100 and 150 <b>volts.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of the effect is decidedly less than for electron bombardment in these gases; it is several fold greater in argon than in neon. In neither gas has the efficiency reached a maximum at 750 volts, although there is evidence in the case of argon that the maximum efficiency may be found at a slightly higher accelerating potential. The pressure range within which the ionization effect shows itself is higher than should be expected from kinetic theory, which seems to indicate the presence of long mean free paths for the positive ions in accord with results of other observers using magnetic analysis apparatus...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in {{organic solar cell}} design is the trade-off between oxidative stability and work function of the metal cathode. We found that in single-junction polymer solar cells, this problem can be surmounted by solution-based incorporation of fulleropyrrolidines with amine (C 60 -N) or zwitterionic (C 60 -SB) substituents as cathode-independent buffer layers. Specifically, {{a thin layer of}} C 60 -N reduced the effective work function of Ag, Cu, and Au electrodes to 3. 65 electron <b>volts.</b> Power conversion <b>efficiency</b> values exceeding 8. 5 % were obtained for organic photovoltaics independent of the cathode selection (Al, Ag, Cu, or Au).

40|$|The {{high cost}} of {{production}} of solar panels has prevented the widespread adoption of solar energy. A possible solution is to pursue solution-based solar cell technologies, since they can enable a low-cost and high-throughput manufacturing process. Both organic semiconductors and inorganic nanocrystals have emerged as promising solution-processable materials for solar cells. In this dissertation, I present my work on the investigation of both classes of materials for solar cell applications. Organic photovoltaics consist of donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. The mechanism of charge transfer between the donor poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and acceptor C 60 was studied by incorporating an inter-layer into the bilayer solar cell. Charge transfer was shown {{to take place in}} a two-step process whereby energy transfer of the photo-generated excitons in P 3 HT to C 60 is followed by a backward charge transfer step to P 3 HT. Novel ways to process these materials are also investigated. Solar cells from P 3 HT and a fullerene derivative, phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were fabricated by spray-deposition. Good power conversion efficiencies above 2 % were demonstrated, indicating the viability of spray deposition as a fabrication method. In a separate effort, a novel fluorinated resorcinarene photoresist was used to photolithographically pattern solar cells based on a blend of P 3 HT and PCBM for highvoltage applications. A 15 mm array of 300 solar cells connected in series achieved an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 90 volts. Three new classes of materials for organic solar cell acceptors are presented, namely pentacenes, hexacenes, and anthradithiophenes. Solar cells based on P 3 HT and pentacenes gave efficiencies as high as 1. 2 %. The hexacenes have the lowest bandgap, enabling hexacene-based solar cells to have photocurrent response up to 800 nm. The anthradithiophene-based solar cells achieved the highest VOC approaching 1. 1 <b>Volts,</b> and decent <b>efficiencies</b> of around 0. 8 %. Finally, a facile alcothermal method for the synthesis of dispersible CuO and Cu 2 O nanocrystals is presented. A bilayer CuO / PCBM solar cell demonstrated an efficiency of 0. 04 %, indicating the potential of these materials for light harvesting applications...|$|R
