40|$|This {{study is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the relationship between morphology and properties of non polar polymers {{in the presence of}} polar additives of different nature. The addi- tion of the physical gel dibenzylidene sorbitol (DBS) in a polyethylene (PE) blend has shown to act as a nucleation site on the polymer. Electron microscopy was used to reveal the fibrillar network formed by the DBS and its interaction with the PE. Moreover, the nucleation density in each material was obtained {{as a function of the}} crystallization temperature, which showed an increase in the number of nuclei in the clarified system compared to the unclarified one. However, this was found to be temperature dependent. The nucleation of PE on DBS was also studied through the induction time, which revealed a reduced surface energy of the polymer nucleus in the presence of the DBS. Space charge measurements were taken {{to investigate the}} charge transport in PE/DBS blends and the space charge at low concentration of the gelator was found to improve the space charge distribution. The same polyethylene blend has then been studied also upon addition of relatively polar ethylene/ <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>copolymers</b> (EVA), with a VA content varying from 9 % to 40 %. Morphology studies showed that three main factors control the phase separation, namely the the time the blend is kept in the melt, the PE:EVA ratio and also the EVA molecular weight. However, breakdown testing demonstrated that the polarity of EVA decreased the breakdown strength of the blends, independently on the morphology. Finally, a preliminary study was conducted with EVA based nanocomposites to determine the effect of filler on the dielectric properties of the nanocomposite. Two relatively polar copolymers, EVA 9 and EVA 18, were processed by solution blending together with 5 % of o-MMT (I 30 P and I 44 PA), and the time of solution blending was varied from 10 min to 100 min. X-ray scattering data showed intercalation in the case of EVA 9 based anocomposites and potential exfoliation for EVA 18 based nanocomposites. However, X-ray results suggest that the solution blending could extract a fraction of the organo-modified ions from in between the MMT galleries, leading to shrinkage of the clay spacing. The nanocomposite was also analysed from the point of view of its breakdown properties, which were shown to be unaffected by the presence of fillers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the problem of}} paraffin deposition during production, transportation and processing of crude oil and gas condensate. The troublesome paraffin stands for normal hydrocarbons ranging from approximately C 18 -C 38, mixed with small amounts of branched paraffin, monocyclic paraffin, polycyclic paraffin, and aromatics. The amount of paraffin found in crude oils {{as described in the}} literature, varies from less than 1 to more than 50 percent. The solubility of paraffin depends on chemical composition, temperature and pressure. Paraffin precipitates at an equilibrium temperature and pressure defined as the cloud point. The paraffin deposits often begin on surfaces cooler than the liquid. The viscosity is increased by the presence of paraffin crystals and if the temperature is reduced sufficiently, the crude oil/gas condensate will become very viscous(pour point). The crude oil/gas condensate viscosity behaves in a Newtonian manner until wax crystals begin to form and, after lowering the temperature, behaves in a non-Newtonian manner. Many options are available to counter the problems caused by paraffin wax deposition. These include various mechanical, thermal and chemical means (for example, steam heating, blending with lighter cutter stocks and treating with chemical additives). A preferred option would be to use wax modifier additives, commonly known as pour point depressants. Crystal modifiers are copolymers from these groups: copolymers of ethylene vinyl acetate, poly alpha-olefins, alkyl fumarate- <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>copolymers</b> of C 18 -through C 22 methacrylates and copolymers of maleic anhydride esters.

30|$|Lubricating oils {{play a very}} {{important}} role in automobile industry. It keeps the moving parts lubricated and protects them against rust and corrosion. Lubricating oils alone cannot satisfy all the requirements of modern engines. Some additives are to be blended with lube oil to improve the overall performance of the lubricant [1]. The role of additives in lubricant is very significant. They optimize the performance of lubricant and generally fall into two major categories viz. surface active additive and performance enhancing additive [2]. The first one protects the metal surfaces of the engine from corrosion, such as antiwear, anti-rust and extreme pressure additives [3]. The second type reinforces the base stock performance, such as viscosity index improver (VII) [4, 5], pour point depressant (PPD) [6, 7], antioxidant [8], and detergent–dispersant [9]. Generally, in the formulation of a high performance lubricant, different types of additives at different percentages are blended with the base stocks. This increases the overall cost of the furnished lubricant. The addition of additives having multifunctional character to the base fluid may lead to formulate a cost effective as well as better performing lubricant. Therefore, research in this area has attracted much attention. In this work we have synthesized multifunctional additives which showed excellent VII and PPD performances. Lot of works in this direction has carried out so far. Kamal and his group [10] in their work have shown the application of copolymers of vinyl acetate (VA) and esters of acrylic acid as viscosity index improver for lubricating oil. They also studied the rheological properties of lube oil with and without polymeric additives. Al-Sabagh and his group [11] have mentioned the application of copolymers of VA with n-alkyl itaconate as pour point depressants in lubricating oil. The rheological properties were also studied by the same research team. Abdel-Azim et al. [12] has synthesized the copolymers of dialkyl fumarate with vinyl acetate and recognized that the copolymer of didodecyl fumarate with VA is the most effective as PPD for lubricating oil. In 2008, Nassar [13] had prepared six polymers at different molar ratios of 2 -ethylhexyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate and studied the VI property of the lubricants. He reported that most efficient VI property is obtained when the ratio of acrylate and vinyl acetate is 1 : 0.2. The potential application of copolymer of vinyl acetate (VA) as pour point depressant for crude oil is also well documented. VA—α olefin copolymers [14] and VA—methacrylate copolymers [15] were used as pour point depressant for crude oil. The copolymers of vinyl acetate, styrene and n-butyl acrylate having different monomer ratios were used to study the rheological behaviours of Mexican crude oil [16]. Borthakur and his group [17] have shown the application of alkyl fumarate and vinyl acetate copolymer in combination with alkyl acrylate as a flow improver for high waxy Borholla crude oil. Machado et al. [18] studied the influence of ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>copolymers</b> on viscosity and pour point of a Brazilian crude oil. Al-Shafy and Ismail prepared an ester of polyethylene acrylic acid with 1 -docosanol and finally it was grafted with vinyl acetate to produce graft ester. The grafted product was used as flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oils [19].|$|E

40|$|An {{ethylene}} <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>copolymer</b> {{is widely}} used in photovoltaic industry as a pottant for crystalline solar cells. During solar module manufacturing the material undergoes a peroxide curing process which leads to elastomer like material properties. In this work, we applied a dielectric method using comb measuring electrodes for determination of EVA progress of cure. At first, we showed the direct correlation of calorimetric measurements, analyzing the consumption of peroxide cross linking agent, with dynamic viscosimetric measurements at different cure temperatures. In a second step, isothermal dielectric measurements have been chosen as a possible tool for direct cure monitoring in vacuum lamination processes. It was found that all methods show the same correlation and are powerful tools for cure monitoring. As we show in a final practical test, course of dielectric parameters can be monitored during a lamination procedure...|$|R
