2500|$|A weaver {{who earned}} his {{livelihood}} from commercial weaving, {{as opposed to}} domestic weaving, {{had to have a}} ready supply of yarn and often it was only mill-spun yarn bought in from the mainland of Scotland could give him that supply. The great danger of using machine-spun yarn from a mainland mill was that nobody could guarantee that the yarn which came back had been made from the island wool which had been sent to the mill, or even that the yarn was made from 100% pure <b>virgin</b> <b>wool</b> as was tradition.

5000|$|The {{creation}} of Harris Tweed begins with fleeces of pure <b>virgin</b> <b>wools</b> which are sheared from Cheviot and Scottish Blackface sheep. Although {{most of the}} wool is grown principally on the Scottish and UK mainland, in the early summer the island communities still join together to round up and shear the local sheep {{to add to the}} mix.

40|$|Conventional growth curves, {{such as the}} {{logistic}} and Gompertz, {{though both}} useful and successful as descriptive measures, lack economic substance. Where a new product is developed expressly to compete with an existing close substitute, any economist might reasonably expect the relative prices of the two goods to be relevant to {{the rate at which}} the innovation is adopted. Yet growth curves of the class mentioned above are functions of time only. In this paper we attempt to allow for the influence of price. The logistic law of growth remains basic to the pattern of adoption in our model. However, it is assumed that relative prices can both accelerate the rate of adoption, and affect the long-run share of the market enjoyed by the new product. (We shall use the term price-accelerated trend to designate this type of model.) Such a model is fitted to U. S. quarterly mill consumption of synthetic staples and <b>virgin</b> raw <b>wool</b> for the period 1954 - 1962, with some surprising results.

30|$|Both <b>virgin</b> {{and waste}} <b>wool</b> and {{textiles}} {{can be converted}} into building insulation products, {{and there have been}} a number of attempts to set up businesses in Scotland supplying this as a product. Notable examples include Thermobond from Kraft Architecture (280 High Street, Glasgow G 4 OQT, UK) and Earthwool® from Knauf Insulation (PO Box 10, Stafford Road, St Helens, Merseyside, WA 10, UK). Generally sustainable insulation products fail to compete on price with mineral wool, which is also principally derived from waste materials, and fail to compete on performance with engineered insulation materials. The resulting market is very small and tends to be limited to applications like historic property restoration where technical and commercial factors are less important than heritage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Many {{factors such}} as {{production}} methods fibre quality and structural parameters have distinctive influence on the quality and performance of a hand woven carpet. Because the most common fiber used for producing handmade carpet is wool this experiment was aimed to identify <b>virgin</b> and pulled <b>wool</b> characteristics of Tunisian sheep breeds. A total of 84 sheep and 15 samples of commercial pulled wool were used in this study. Samples of fiber were analyzed using standard objective measurements for staple length SL mean fiber diameter MFD coefficient of variation of fiber diameter FDCV fine fiber contain FC Breaking strength and Elongation. Results showed that Tunisian wool {{can be considered as}} medium wool. By conducting well-planned sorting Fine Queue of west sheep breed can supply the wool needed for textile industries. The wool of other sheep breeds can be used in handmade carpets. Also staple strength as one of the important wool characteristic affected significantly by alkali treatment during chemical unhairing process compared with wool collected by shearing process. Great attention must be paid to know the real characteristics of pulled wool before using it in handmade carpet industry...|$|R

50|$|While the {{techniques}} used are that of Oriental rugs, the designs used are indigenous to Mexico. Most are Otomi but designs {{from other cultures}} such as those from Chiapas, Nayarit and Guanajuato are also used. Common themes include birds, flowers, geometric figures, elements from natures, as well as magical and religious signs. Approximately one hundred colors are used in forty four basic designs which have 145 variations.The rugs are all hand knotted, mostly by women, using <b>virgin</b> <b>wool</b> which is brought into the municipality from other places. Each square meter takes about forty days to complete. The rugs are knotted on wooden frames which have been strung with heavy duty cotton string {{to serve as the}} base.

5000|$|Two {{states that}} {{continue}} to have significant handcrafted textile production are Oaxaca and Mexico State. Oaxaca {{is known for its}} variety of handcrafted textiles including rugs, rebozos, tablecloths and traditional clothing such as huipils. These are made backstrap looms or foot pedal looms. In Mexico State craft pieces are mostly produced in Jiquipilco, Tejupilco de Hidalgo, Temascaltepec de González, Temoaya, Valle de Bravo, Zacazonapan, Toluca and Tenancingo producing napkins, tablecloths, sheets, kitchen items, clothing, bathroom items, rebozos and rugs.Both states also are significant producers of rugs. The making of knotted rugs by the Otomi in Mexico State is relatively recent. It began in 1969 when Ernesto Fernández Hurtado of the Bank of Mexico decided to promote a pilot center in Temoaya for the study and manufacture of this type of rug using traditional Otomi designs. Today, these rugs are a distinctive feature in Mexico State crafts. The rugs are made with 100% <b>virgin</b> <b>wool</b> and have an average knot density of 140,000 m2. There are about 21 different designs offered with 250 variations in colors and size. [...] Most are sold in upper-class neighborhoods of Mexico City, but due to the problem of cheap imitations, some vendors only sell from their workshops.|$|E
40|$|Allergenic {{building}} materials are in-creasingly problematic. This is true {{not only in}} occupational health, but can also be {{the reason for the}} increasing preva-lence of indoor allergies. Particularly in-dividuals with family heredity of in-creased sensitizing potential are in need of special protection and practical crite-ria for the assessment of allergens in {{building materials}}. This article attempts to present a point scale scoring the aller-genic potential of e. g. wooden chipboard containing formaldehyde, fixed <b>virgin</b> <b>wool</b> fitted carpet and/or loamy plaster containing nickel. Four easily understandable scores that are practical for patients as well as building experts are suggested: No or low- relevant- increased- and highly increased allergenic potential. “Direct allergens ” have to be differenti-ated from the “indirect allergens”. Direct allergens are defined as (pseudo-) aller-genic compounds, which are emitted from building materials into the indoor air. “Indirect allergens ” are defined as spores from moulds, excrements from house dust mites and animal epithelia. These allergens are induced by building defects like increased humidity and an-thropogenic facilities. Structure-response-analytical knowledge and oc-cupational hazard management serves as basic data for the assessment of indoor air allergenic potential...|$|E
40|$|The {{impregnation}} of AV 17, AB 90, AR 1 and DR 80 dyes on {{wool and}} on cotton AV 17 and DR 80 {{was carried out}} at optimized conditions of shaking time and pH for the maximum uptake of the dyes by the fibers. The effects of the dyes impregnation on thermal oxidation of wool and cotton fibers were studied by employing thermogravimetric analysis. The {{results show that the}} weight loss of wool fiber was in a single step and the impregnation of AR 1 on wool fiber results in a significant decrease in the decomposition temperature. The impregnation of AV 17 and DR 80 on wool fiber changes the nature of the thermogravimetric pattern and two steps weight losses were observed as compared to the single step weight loss observed in <b>virgin</b> <b>wool</b> fiber. The impregnation of AV 17 and DR 80 dyes on cotton fiber does not change the nature of the thermogravimetric behavior of the fiber and two stage weight loss were observed for both virgin and impregnated cotton fiber. It has been found out that impregnation only affects the weight loss in both the steps. These results are important in relation to the dyeing of wool and cotton fibers...|$|E
