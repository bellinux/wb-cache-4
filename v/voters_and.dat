5|$|In addition, {{to ensure}} that the number of SMCs kept pace with the {{increase}} in <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> hence the number of MPs, the EBRC's terms of reference would state that there should be at least 12 SMCs. The rationale given for these changes was that the GRC scheme would work better and the link between <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> their MPs would be strengthened. In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.|$|E
5|$|On March 1 ("Super Tuesday"), Clinton {{won seven}} of eleven contests, {{including}} {{a string of}} dominating victories across the South buoyed, as in South Carolina, by African-American <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over Sanders. She maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests during the primary season, with a consistent pattern throughout being that Sanders did better among younger, whiter, more rural and more liberal <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> in states that held caucuses or where eligibility was open to independents, while Clinton did better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that held primaries or where eligibility was restricted to registered Democrats.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Taylor was {{attacked}} by Democratic opponents because of his party's support from black <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> its ties to big business, including the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.

5|$|At the time, {{according}} to German sociologist , Vizzini {{could easily have}} had himself elected as a parliamentary deputy. Nevertheless, he preferred {{to remain in the}} background and instead advise <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> elected officials, playing the role of benevolent benefactor, strengthening his clientele and prestige. He was present at a dinner in July 1922 with the future ruler of Italy, Benito Mussolini, in Milan and supported the March on Rome by Mussolini in October 1922, financing the column that marched from Sicily.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> teaching women what to do when they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E
5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.|$|E
5|$|McKinley's good {{standing}} with labor became useful that year as he campaigned for the Republican nomination for Ohio's 17th congressional district. Delegates {{to the county}} conventions thought he could attract blue-collar <b>voters,</b> <b>and</b> in August 1876, McKinley was nominated. By that time, Hayes had been nominated for president, and McKinley campaigned for him while running his own congressional campaign. Both were successful. McKinley, campaigning mostly on his support for a protective tariff, defeated the Democratic nominee, Levi L. Lamborn, by 3,300 votes, while Hayes won a hotly disputed election to reach the presidency. McKinley's victory came at a personal cost: his income as a congressman would be half of what he earned as a lawyer.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Republican convention, the Lincoln {{campaign}} began cultivating {{a nationwide}} teen and young adult organization, the Wide Awakes, which {{it used to}} generate popular support for Lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives, knowing that new <b>voters</b> <b>and</b> young voters tend to embrace new and young parties.

People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln because of his ideas of anti-slavery and took action to rally supporters for Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young <b>voters,</b> <b>and</b> began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E

Drew made large numbers of promises to the <b>voters,</b> <b>and</b> attempted to exploit a Defence Ministry scandal which had broken earlier in the year (at the Petawawa, Ontario army base, an investigation had found frauds which included placing horses on the payroll), but the Liberals were not seriously challenged. The Liberals lost 20 seats from their 1949 high-water mark, but still constituted almost two-thirds of the House of Commons, and no minister was defeated.
