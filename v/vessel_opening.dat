50|$|Vascular and neural {{diseases}} {{are closely related}} and intertwined. Blood vessels depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depend on adequate blood flow. The first pathological change in the small blood vessels is narrowing of the blood vessels. As the disease progresses, neuronal dysfunction correlates closely {{with the development of}} blood vessel abnormalities, such as capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished oxygen tension and hypoxia. Neuronal ischemia is a well-established characteristic of diabetic neuropathy. Blood <b>vessel</b> <b>opening</b> agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors, α1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow, with corresponding improvements in nerve conduction velocities. Thus, small blood vessel dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{multichannel}} seismic (MCS) data, used {{to obtain}} structural reflection images of the Earth’s subsurface, {{can also be used}} in physical oceanography exploration. This method provides vertical and lateral resolutions of 10 to 100 m, to full ocean depth, along profiles that can be hundreds of kms in length, covering the existing observational gap in oceanic exploration. All MCS data used so far in physical oceanography studies have been acquired using conventional seismic instrumentation originally designed for geological exploration. In this work we present the proof of concept of an alternative MCS system that is better adapted to physical oceanography and has two goals: (1) to have an environmentally low impact acoustic source to minimize any potential disturbance to marine life, and (2) to be light and portable. The synthetic experiments simulate the main variables of the source, shooting and streamer that compose the proposed MCS system. The proposed system utilizes a 5 s long exponential chirp source of 208 dB re 1 micro Pa @ 1 m with a frequency content of 20 - 100 Hz, and a relatively short 500 -m long streamer with 100 channels. We exemplify through numerical simulations that the 5 s long chirp source can reduce the peak of the pressure signal by 26 dB with respect to equivalent airgun-based sources by spreading the energy in time, greatly reducing the impact to marine life.

40|$|Rapid onset {{vasodilation}} (ROV) occurs {{immediately in}} response to skeletal muscle contraction and initiates a prompt increase in blood flow and oxygen delivery that facilitate the transition to exercise. Muscle blood flow is attenuated during aging which limits physical activity. Understanding the mechanisms that attenuate ROV requires invasive measurements that cannot be performed in human subjects. Published studies indicate {{that the effects of}} aging on muscle blood flow are similar in mice and in humans. Using our established mouse model to study the actual blood vessels that control blood flow in living skeletal muscle, the focus of my research is to understand where and how aging affects ROV in light of enhanced sympathetic nerve activity and endothelium dysfunction. A mouse was anesthetized and a skeletal muscle was prepared for studying individual microvessels using a microscope. The muscle was stimulated to contract with the amount and speed of <b>vessel</b> <b>opening</b> (vasodilation) recorded. I used selective interventions to modulate sympathetic or endothelial function and compared ROV for each vessel branch between Young (4 months) and Old (24 months) mice to resolve the effects of aging. I found that sympathetic activation attenuates ROV and that endothelium is integral to ROV. Thus, enhanced sympathetic nerve activity and endothelium dysfunction with aging attenuates ROV. These effects are greater effects in larger upstream vessels, which can restrict blood flow into active muscles. My research provides new insight for improving muscle blood flow, thereby promoting physical activity {{to improve the quality of}} life for aging individuals...|$|E

40|$|Erythrocytes are {{reservoirs}} {{of important}} epoxide-containing lipid signaling molecules, including epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). EETs function as vasodilators and anti-inflammatory modulators in the bloodstream. Bioactive EETs are hydrolyzed to less active diols (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids) by epoxide hydrolases (EHs). The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum infects host {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) and exports hundreds of proteins into the RBC compartment. In this study, we show that two parasite epoxide hydrolases, P falciparum epoxide hydrolases 1 (PfEH 1) and 2 (PfEH 2), both with noncanonical serine nucleophiles, are exported to the periphery of infected RBCs. PfEH 1 and PfEH 2 were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli, and they hydrolyzed physiologically relevant erythrocyte EETs. Mutations in active site residues of PfEH 1 ablated {{the ability of the}} enzyme to hydrolyze an epoxide substrate. Overexpression of PfEH 1 or PfEH 2 in parasite-infected RBCs resulted in a significant alteration in the epoxide fatty acids stored in RBC phospholipids. We hypothesize that the parasite disruption of epoxide-containing signaling lipids leads to perturbed vascular function, creating favorable conditions for binding and sequestration of infected RBCs to the microvascular endothelium. IMPORTANCE: The malaria parasite exports hundreds of proteins into the erythrocyte compartment. However, for most of these proteins, their physiological function is unknown. In this study, we investigate two "hypothetical" proteins of the α/β-hydrolase fold family that share sequence similarity with epoxide hydrolases (EHs) -enzymes that destroy bioactive epoxides. Altering EH expression in parasite-infected erythrocytes resulted in a significant change in the epoxide fatty acids stored in the host cell. We propose that these EH enzymes may help the parasite to manipulate host blood <b>vessel</b> <b>opening</b> and inflame the vessel walls as they pass through the circulation system.

In top-blowing Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS), i. e. in the LD process, an emulsion consisting of liquid slag, dispersed metal droplets and solid particles will, together with process gases, form an expanding foam. Extensive research has defined the parameters that govern the foaming characteristics of BOS slag emulsions. It is a well known fact that certain process conditions will lead to an excessive foam growth, forcing the foam out through the <b>vessel</b> <b>opening</b> (mouth). This process event {{is commonly known as}} slopping. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage, lost production time and pollution. A literature survey covering the slopping phenomena has been carried out, as well as a deeper investigation into the causes behind slopping on the BOS vessels, type LD/LBE, at SSAB EMEA Metallurgy Luleå, equipped with an automatic system for slopping registration using image analysis. Good slag formation and foam-growth control in order to avoid slopping is primarily accomplished by taking preventive "static" measures. Improved slopping control has been achieved by developing a new oxygen lance control scheme, featuring adjustment of the distance between the lance tip and the metal bath according to scrap quality and ore additions. If "static" measures cannot be effectuated, in-blow control measures are needed. For such "dynamic" measures to be effective, it is necessary to have a system for slopping prediction. In the early- 1980 s a system for foam level and slopping control, based on BOS vessel vibration, was temporarily installed and tested on one of the vessels in Luleå. Based on the experiences from these tests it was decided to re-investigate the vessel vibration measurement technique. Trials on industrial scale BOS vessels of type LD/LBE have been carried out. FFT spectrum analysis has been applied in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to an estimated foam height. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height which can be used for dynamic foam level and slopping control. The vessel vibration results have been tested against perhaps the most common implemented technique for dynamic foam height estimation and slopping control, the audiometric system. Parallel vibration and audio measurements have been carried out on a 130 -tonne as well as on 300 -tonne BOS vessels. The results show that during stable process conditions there is good agreement between the two methods with regard to foam height estimation and that combining the two methods will provide a powerful slopping prediction and control system.

40|$|Slag {{formation}} plays {{a decisive}} {{role in all}} steelmaking processes. In top-blowing Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS) i. e., in the LD process, an emulsion consisting of liquid slag, dispersed metal droplets, undissolved particles and solid precipitates will, together with process gases, form an expanding foam. Extensive research has defined the parameters that govern the foaming characteristics of BOS slag-metal emulsions. It is a well-known fact that certain process conditions in the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) will lead to excessive foam growth, forcing foam out through the <b>vessel</b> <b>opening</b> (mouth). This process event {{is commonly known as}} slopping. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage, lost production time, unsafe work environment and pollution. A literature survey covering the slopping phenomena has been carried out, as well as a deeper investigation into the causes behind slopping on the BOF type LD/LBE at SSAB Europe, Luleå, equipped with an automatic system for slopping registration using image analysis Good slag formation and foam-growth control in order to avoid slopping is primarily accomplished by taking preventive “static” measures. The most common pre-blowing operational conditions favouring foam growth and, hence, slopping were found to be linked to oxygen lance positioning, hot metal Si and Mn contents, scrap quality and large additions of iron oxide bearing materials. Improved slopping control may be achieved by developing oxygen lance control schemes with automatic adjustment of the distance between the lance tip and the metal bath (i. e., the lance gap) according to scrap quality and ore additions. If “static” measures cannot be effectuated, a set of in-blow slopping preventive measures is needed. For such “dynamic” measures to be effective, it is necessary to have a system for slopping prediction. Trials with vessel vibration measurements for indirect foam height estimation in industrial scale BOFs, type LD/LBE, have been carried out. FFT spectrum analysis was applied in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to an estimated foam height. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height which can be used for dynamic foam level and slopping control, and this during the entire blow. The vessel vibration results have been tested against what is the perhaps most commonly implemented technique for dynamic foam height estimation and slopping control, the audiometric system. Parallel vibration and audio measurements have been carried out on 130 -tonne as well as on 300 -tonne BOFs. The results show that during stable process conditions there is good agreement between the two methods in regard to foam height estimation and that combining the two methods will provide a powerful slopping prediction and control system. A feasibility study has been carried out with the aim to describe the possibilities and limitations of multivariate data analysis, including batch analysis, for dynamic BOS process control, mainly in regard to slopping prevention. Two principal modelling approaches were tested. A central part of this PhD work is the performed emulsion characterisation and the subsequent investigation into the influence of emulsion mineralogy and morphology on slopping in the LD process. The results are based on the study of emulsion samples from trial heats conducted in a 6 -tonne pilot plant LD vessel. The main emulsion slag phase mineral species identified were di-calcium silicate, monoxides (mainly FeO, MnO and MgO), calcium ferrites and late-appearing tri-calcium silicate. The study also show that the iron oxidation state has a large influence on the emulsion mineralogy and morphology, as a higher Fe 3 + content facilitates the precipitation of calcium ferrites, raising the emulsion apparent viscosity and, hence, the foam index. The same effect is caused by higher MgO contents (i. e., at saturation), resulting in the precipitation of monoxide phase. However, large volume fractions of emulsion precipitates will not always lead to slopping in the LD process. A second “requirement” for excessive foam growth is a simultaneously high gas generation rate. Vice versa; an LD heat may very well slop at low volume fractions of 2 ndphase particles in the emulsion if the gas generation rate is sufficiently high. It is an indisputable fact that excessive foaming {{is one of the main}} features of the LD process, due to the practice of top-lance oxygen blowing, creating a highly oxidised slag, and heavy batch additions of basic slag formers, causing an initial formation of large quantities of precipitates. Therefore, preventing slopping is primarily a matter of tight process control, most importantly, control of the oxygen lance gap in order to reach a state of sufficiently high liquid MeO phase to minimise the emulsion apparent viscosity, but low enough to avoid over-oxidising and a high gas generation rate.

MethodsA blood transfusion bag filled with the patients' arterialised blood {{was connected to the}} flap artery and set under rhythmic compression to ensure continuous blood supply to the flap. The returning venous blood was collected but not reinfused. Extracorporeal circulation was sustained for 10 – 13 days until flaps had become independent from the external blood supply.

ResultsSuccessful bony reconstructions were achieved in all three consecutive patients substantiated by MRI-, CT-scan or bone scintigraphy.

40|$|Pyrazinamide, the {{pyrazine}} analogue of nicotinamide, {{has been}} evaluated {{for its ability}} to modify the radiation response of hypoxic cells both in vivo and in vitro. Results obtained with three different murine tumour systems EMT 6, LLC and SCCVII showed that pyrazinamide at a dose of 0. 5 mg g- 1 i. p. resulted in enhanced radiation response. Dose modification factors of between 1. 3 and 1. 6 were observed using in vivo/in vitro clonogenic assays. This enhancement was greater than that obtained in mouse intestine using crypt cell survival as an endpoint (DMF 1. 1). In contrast to the tumour data in vivo, the in vitro results indicate that pyrazinamide displays little radiosensitising or toxic properties towards hypoxic CHO cells in culture. These results suggest that pyrazinamide exerts its effects in vivo either by directly perturbing tumour physiology or by being converted to an active metabolite. Blood flow studies performed using laser Doppler flowmetry indicate that pyrazinamide produces a small (32 %) increase in overall tumour blood flow in the SCCVII tumour.

Attempts to secure widespread support in the government failed, so Enver decided conflict {{would have to be}} instigated. With the help of the Ottoman naval minister and German Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, Enver arranged for the Ottoman fleet to go out to sea on 29 October supposedly to perform maneuvers. They were to provoke Russian <b>vessels</b> into <b>opening</b> fire and then accuse them of inciting war. Instead, Souchon raided the Russian coast in a flagrant display of hostility, causing little lasting damage but enraging the Russians.|$|R
50|$|Water filling {{algorithm}} {{is a general}} name given to the ideas in communication systems design and practice for equalisation strategies on communications channels. As the name suggests, just as water finds its level even when filled {{in one part of}} a <b>vessel</b> with multiple <b>openings,</b> as a consequence of Pascal's law, the amplifier systems in communications network repeaters, or receivers amplify each channel up to the required power level compensating for the channel impairments. See, for example, channel power allocation in MIMO systems.|$|R
25|$|Poor weather {{delayed the}} driving of the piles, which took from March to July 1821. The pier was {{decorated}} with flags for its opening ceremony on 14 August. Steamboats fired salutes from alongside the pier. Three hundred people walked from the Trinity Hotel to the pier, and boarded a steamboat for a brief excursion, while a band played from a second <b>vessel.</b> The <b>opening</b> was attended by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, the local magistrates, as well as Crichton, Ramsay, Scott, Stevenson, and the other proprietors of the company. Admiral Robert Otway (commander-in-chief of naval forces at Leith), General Duff, Sir George Mackenzie, George Baird (the Principal of Edinburgh University), Robert Jameson, John Leslie, William Wallace, and Brown the designer were also present. When they returned they took refreshment in a tent {{at the head of}} the pier.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} combusting a {{combustible}} fuel includes providing a <b>vessel</b> having an <b>opening</b> near a proximate end and a closed distal end defining a combustion chamber. A combustible reactants mixture is presented into the combustion chamber. The combustible reactants mixture is ignited creating a flame and combustion products. The closed {{end of the}} combustion chamber is utilized for directing combustion products toward {{the opening of the}} combustion chamber creating a reverse flow of combustion products within the combustion chamber. The reverse flow of combustion products is intermixed with combustible reactants mixture to maintain the flame. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
