The cheese-making milk was produced on the “Agroklek” Dairy Farm, and Trapist cheese was manufactured using Trapist technology. In the trials {{two types of}} mesophilic starter culture and two types of rennet (animal and microbial) were used. The obtained cheese underwent two different ripening processes: with applied protective coating, and in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil.</b> The cheese chemical composition was analysed after 60 and 90 days of ripening. After that its sensory characteristics were also evaluated. The cheese analysis established that dry matter content - fat, ash, protein, total nitrogen, soluble and insoluble nitrogen, pH value, and coefficient of ripening in cheese with protective coating were higher {{when compared with the}} cheese packed in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil</b> during ripening. The analysis also established that the content of fat in dry matter in cheese, and the contents of water in fat-free matter, sodium-chloride, calcium, and acid based titration for the cheese with the applied protective coating were lower when compared with the relevant contents in cheeses in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil</b> during ripening. Trapist cheese manufactured using the FD-DVS CH-N 11 (CHR HANSEN, Denmark) starter culture, and Caglificio Clerici (Italy) animal rennet, achieved the highest quality grade.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of radioisotope-fueled circulatory support systems {{depends on the}} ability of the body to dissipate the reject heat from the power source driving the blood pump as well as to tolerate chronic intracorporeal radiation. Our studies have focused {{on the use of the}} circulating blood as a heat sink. Initial in vivo heat transfer studies utilized straight tube heat exchangers (electrically and radioisotope energized) to replace a segment of the descending aorta. More recent studies have used a left ventricular assist pump as a blood-cooled heat exchanger. This approach minimizes trauma, does not increase the area of prosthetic interface with the blood, and minimizes system volume. Heat rejected from the thermal engine (vapor or gas cycle) is transported from the nuclear power source in the abdomen to the pump in the thoracic cavity via hydraulic lines. Adjacent tissue is protected from the fuel capsule temperature (900 to 1200 °F) by <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil</b> insulation and polyurethane foam. The in vivo thermal management problems have been studied using a simulated thermal system (STS) which approximates the heat rejection and thermal transport mechanisms of the nuclear circulatory support systems under development by NHLI. Electric heaters simulate the reject heat from the thermal engines. These studies have been essential in establishing the location, suspension, surgical procedures, and postoperative care for implanting prototype nuclear heart assist systems in calves. The pump has a thermal impedance of 0. 12 °C/watt. Analysis of the STS data in terms of an electrical analog model implies a heat transfer coefficient of 4. 7 × 10 − 3 watt/cm 2 °C in the abdomen compared to a value of 14. 9 × 10 − 3 watt/cm 2 °C from the heat exchanger plenum into the diaphragm...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The TR- 24 is {{relatively}} new to the cyclotron market and its advantages over lower energy PET cyclotrons {{have not yet been}} fully realized. A new high current [18 F] fluoride production target that takes advantage of the higher energy and current afforded by the TR- 24 has been developed. Material and Methods The TR- 24 cyclotron presents challenges of producing conventional PET isotopes even with its variable energy capability (18 – 25 MeV). Simultaneous irradiation of two targets that require different proton energies is possible only using beam energy degrader. Due to the relatively wide energy window, the degrader design is not trivial, especially for the high current operation. For example, reduction of beam energy from 24 to 18 MeV would require the use of an approximately 1. 5 mm thick aluminum degrader. At 100 μA this degrader would have to be capable of dissipating 700 W of beam power, which would be challenging to achieve with no cooling or using a conventional helium cooling window. However, cooling water used as a beam energy degrader can dissipate several kilowatts of beam energy and provide additional cooling for target material and window foils. FIGURE 1 demonstrates the concept of the water cooled target window. A standard 18 F- water target with a 2. 5 mL fill volume and a 30 degree beam incident angle was modified to accept the new water window. A 1 mm thick region of circulating cooling water was inserted between the vacuum and the product foil. The combined beam energy degradation caused by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil</b> (0. 00012 “ Havar), the cooling water (1 mm) and the target foil (0. 00012 “ Havar) was approximately 7 MeV for a 24 MeV incident proton energy. The target was installed on a target selector mounted directly on the TR- 24 cyclotron. No additional beam focusing or steering devices were used to defocus or correct beam shape. A small recirculation water system was setup to supply cooling water for the degrader. A mixed bed ion exchange column was installed on the return line to trap N- 13 and radioactive metal ions that could possibly be etched from the Havar foils. The water in the degrader was continually circulated in a closed loop providing cooling to the <b>vacuum</b> and target <b>foils.</b> An 800 mL/min water flow through the degrader was generated by a low pressure water pump. Results Several tests were performed with O- 16 water to establish current – pressure curve and to determine “burn through” current (FIGURE 2). Conclusion Initial tests demonstrated that the new F- 18 target with a 1 mm water degrader is capable of accepting power levels in excess of 3. 6 kW, operating at 150 μA. More testing is under way, including testing with H 218 O to determine the F- 18 production capacity of this target. We will look into adapting this concept to all ACSI PET targets, including the high current F- 18 produc-tion target which can potentially reach an operational current of 200 μA...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Irradiation of {{gold with}} protons {{provides}} access to no-carrier-added 197 mHg and 197 Hg. Interests in these radionuclides were awakened by the unique chemical and physical properties of mercury and its compounds combined with convenient nuclear properties like suitable half life (197 mHg: T 1 / 2 = 23. 8 h, 197 Hg: T 1 / 2 = 64. 14 h), low energy gamma radiations for imaging, Auger – and conversion electrons for therapy. The high thermal conductivity of gold enables high current irradiations and the monoisotopic natural abundance of 197 Au supersedes expensive enrichment of the target material. The 197 Au(p,n) 197 (m) Hg reaction was applied until now only for beam monitoring 1, stacked foil meas-urements 2 or very small scale tracer production. Material and Methods The irradiations were performed at a Cyclone 18 / 9 (IBA, Louvain la Neuve, Belgium). Its beam-line was sealed with a 1. 0 mm <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil</b> (high purity aluminum, 99. 999 %) from Goodfellow (Huntingdon, England). High purity gold disks (23 mm diameter, 2 mm thickness, 99. 999 % pure, 1 ppm Cu) as target material were purchased from ESPI (Ashland, USA). Gold foils as alternative gold targets (12. 5 × 12. 5 mm, 0. 25 mm thickness, 99. 99 + %, 1 ppm Cu) between an aluminum disk (22 mm diameter, 1 mm thickness, 99. 0 %, hard) and an aluminum lid (23 mm diameter, 99. 0 %, hard) were purchased from Goodfellow (Huntingdon, England). Hydrochloric acid (30 %) and nitric acid (65 %) were purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) in Rotipuran® Ultra quality. Deionized water with > 18 MΩcm resistivity was prepared by a Milli-Q® system (Millipore, Molsheim, France). For separation of target material and side products a liquid-liquid extraction method (Gold was extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) from 2 M HCl target solution) and an ion exchange method (cation exchange resin (Dowex 50 W-x 8, 100 – 200 mesh, H+ form) were applied. Results and Conclusion No-carrier-added 197 (m) Hg was produced from gold via the 197 Au(p,n) 197 (m) Hg reaction at proton energies of 10 MeV in sufficient quantity and quality for imaging studies. Two different methods were studied for the separation of Hg radionuclides generated from Au targets. The results demonstrate the possibility to produce 197 (m) Hg from gold at low proton energies.

40|$|Under {{operations}} in hot regions and flights at low heights {{the temperature in}} the fighter cockpit may rise to high levels causing heat stress on pilot. Reducing cockpit glass light permeability or increasing cockpit ventilation reduce heat load. The measures should not affect pilots’ performance. This study investigated if clothing material with reflective properties has an effect on heat gain in pilot, specifically, under solar radiation. Two materials, conventional pilot suit material (Old) and material coated with coldblack® (New, Schoeller Technologies AG, Switzerland) were tested over the underwear layer. Additional test involved a bubble plastic layer to simulate layers and air gaps of the pilot clothing system. A hot plate was used to measure textile combinations’ insulation. Under the solar radiation simulation with a Thorn lamp a water cooled plate was utilized. In the cooled plate water was circulated with a peristaltic pump, and inlet and outlet temperatures were recorded. From flow and temperature gradient the heat gain was calculated. In addition, a cockpit scenario was simulated in a box. The cooled plate was placed {{on the bottom of the}} box, covered with the textile materials as described above, and box was closed by a piece of cockpit glass. The areas by the side of the glass were covered with aluminium <b>foil.</b> <b>Box</b> ventilation was or was not applied. Solar lamp was positioned at 90 ° angel 2. 5 m from the material surface providing a load of 841 W/m 2 on the plate. The insulation of New was slightly lower than in Old. New showed about 10 % lower heat transmission under solar radiation than Old. Textile surface temperature in New was several degrees lower than in Old. At “skin” the temperatures did not reach over 40 °C in any case. Bubble plastic did minimize the differences while New still stayed lower. When placed in the box the heat transmission difference reduced to about 1 %. The use of the bubble plastic as additional insulation reversed this difference. Adding ventilation equalized heat transmission. The new material has ability to reduce the heat load considerably in the open space that is exposed to solar radiation. In closed space the advantage disappears. In heat under solar load New would help, while in cold it might be a disadvantage. Thus, two different outer layers for warm respective cold may be recommended. However, the effect of the outer layer in cockpit scenario is marginal...|$|R

Material and Methods For the target design, we selected the following criteria: minimizing activation of target components; efficient cooling system allowing higher beam currents; easy handling; high life-time of the target chamber (low impact of the irradiation and radionuclide separation process on the target chamber surface and 83 Rb recovery). The target consists of three parts: 1. 	Water cooled aluminium (alloy EN 6082) mechanical interface for easy connection of the target to the beam line. It {{also serves as a}} beam collimator (diameter 9 mm). 2. 	Holder of He-cooled <b>foils</b> (<b>vacuum</b> separation <b>foil</b> – Havar 0. 025 mm, target body window – Ti 0. 1 mm). 3. 	Aluminium (alloy EN 6082) water cooled target body with 150 mm long cone-shaped target chamber of the volume 27. 1 ml. Internal surface of the chamber is nickel-coated. The target filled with natural Kr of purity 0. 9999 and absolute pressure 13 bar was irradiated on the external beam of the isochronous cyclotron U- 120 M of the NPI AS CR. The proton beam energy was set so that it is decreased after deg-radation in the separation foils to 25. 6 MeV. Beam energy loss in the natural Kr gas filling is 9. 6 MeV. The target was tested up to 25 µA beam current. After irradiation, the target is left for a week to let the short-lived activation products to decay. Then, 83 Rb is washed out from the target walls by two portions of freshly prepared de-ionized water, target is rinsed by high-purity ethanol and dried. The two portions of 83 Rb aqueous solution are then connected and activity and radionuclidic purity of the product is determined via γ-spectrometry (HPGe detector). Large-distance sample-detector measurements of the target prior and after the separation are used in order to determine recovery of 83 Rb. Results and Conclusion The new gas target for routine production of 83 Rb was successfully designed, tested and im-plemented for regular 83 Rb production. Six-hour irradiation with 15 µA proton beam resulted repeatedly in ca 300 MBq of 83 Rb (EOB). Besides 83 Rb, we identified in the separated product also 84 Rb (T½ = 32. 82 d) at levels ca 31 % of the 83 Rb activity (EOB) and 86 Rb (T½ = 18. 631 d) at levels ca 8 % of the 83 Rb activity (EOB). Both radionuclidic impurities do not disturb the use of 83 Rb, since none of them emanates any radioactive krypton isotope. Moreover, their relative content decreases in time. Rubidium isotopes are recovered from the target almost quantitatively (98 – 99 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Using {{vacuum in}} {{medicine}} {{has been known}} from long ago, however, {{it has not been}} used for the treatment of wounds. The first experiments in this field were performed by Wagner Fleischmann, University of Ulm, Ulm, West Germany, in 1993. The aim {{of this study was to}} present our clinical experience with the treatment of surgical wounds complications in vascular patients by the use of controled vacuum. Method. In a period October 2006 - December 2009 a total of 18 patients with infection and surgical wound dehiscence were treated by the use of vacuum. Vacuum was applied to wounds by placing a polyurethane sponge on them and by fixing a polyurethane foil and a sponge to the surrounding healthy skin so to completely airtight wounds. Over a <b>foil</b> <b>vacuum</b> of - 150 mmHg was applied for a 5 -day period, and on the day 6 a foil and a sponge were removed. Results. In all the 18 wounds treated by the use of vacuum secondary wound closing was achieved with no complications and with a significantly shortened time period treatment. Wound infections were healed using this method and only in 2 patients antibiotics were used at the same time. Conclusion. The use of vacuum in the treatment of operative wounds complications is an easy and reliable method contributing significantly to wounds better healing...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to find materials with microstructures which minimize the formation of blisters. A promising class of materials appears to be sintered metal powder with small average grain sizes and low atomic number Z. Studies of the surface erosion of sintered aluminum powder (SAP 895) and of aluminum held at 400 $sup 0 $C due to blistering by 100 keV helium ions {{have been conducted}} {{and the results are}} compared to those obtained earlier for room temperature irradiation. A significant reduction of the erosion rate in SAP 895 in comparison to annealed aluminum and SAP 930 is observed. In addition results on the blistering of sintered beryllium powder (type I) irradiated at room temperature and 600 $sup 0 $C by 100 keV helium ions are given. These results will be compared with those reported recently for <b>vacuum</b> cast beryllium <b>foil</b> and a foil of sintered beryllium powder (type II) which was fabricated differently, than type I. For room temperature irradiation only a few blisters could be observed in sintered beryllium powder type I and type II and they are smaller in size and in number than in vacuum cast beryllium. For irradiation at 600 $sup 0 $C large scale exfoliation of blisters was observed for vacuum cast beryllium but much less exfoliation was seen for sintered beryllium powder, type I, and type II. The results show a reduction in erosion rate cast beryllium, for both room temperature and 600 $sup 0 $C...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of industrial {{products in the}} fields of traffic technology, mechanical engineering, etc. requires higher efficiency of materials and structures. Thus, lightweight design has become very important, mainly for reducing the effects of accelerated mass. New materials like high-performance fiber composites not only find application in aerospace technology, but are also gaining importance in terrestrial areas. Considering the excellent properties of weight, Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) offer a variety of advantages in comparison with usual materials like steel, titan, or aluminum. On the other hand there are problems concerning the vibrational sensitivity due to low mass, tendency to buckling, and susceptibility to damage. A promising way to solve these problems is the integration of multifunctional materials such as piezoelectrics, Shape Memory Alloys (SMA), etc. Arising deformations, accelerations, or other physical measurements can be detected by sensors, technically processed, and eliminated with suitable real-time controlled actuators. To handle multifunctional material in different applications statements regarding the compatibility, the degree of efficiency and the overall electromechanical behavior of the material are important. Composite materials offer the unique chance to integrate multifunctional elements during the manufacturing process. The multifunctional elements {{become a part of the}} material itself. Besides the load-carrying function the integration of sensors and actuators within the composites forms a material which is able to detect and specifically influence its own loads, vibrations, or deformations. Because of some excellent properties (low energy consumption in quasi static applications, high efficiency, fast response, etc.) piezoelectric materials are in the center of interest. Usually thin monolithic piezoceramic wafers are used as structural actuators for active composites. To improve the mechanical and electrical performance it is often advantageous to pre-encapsulate the piezoceramic (e. g. in a polymer matrix). With this additional step the piezoceramic can be provided with a mechanical pre-compression, electrical insulation and mechanical stabilization. More recently active composites with piezoceramic fibers came into focus. These fibers (Æ 10 - 30 µm) are processed in form of patches with uniaxially aligned piezoceramic fibers embedded in a polymer matrix excited by interdigitated surface electrodes. With the use of the longitudinal piezoelectric effect and their excellent suitability for integration in curved structures piezoceramic fibers offer a number of advantages. Unfortunately these fibers are not yet available on a large scale. As there has been extensive work in the field of integration of thin lead zirconate-titanate piezo-ceramic (PZT) wafers (50 x 30 x 0. 2 mm) into CFRP at the Institute of Structural Mechanics, DLR-Braunschweig, this will be focused on in the following. Provided with uniformly electroded surfaces these wafers operating in the lateral, d 31, mode. Fig. 1 shows the principle design of some active composites. In Fig. 1 a the ceramic wafer is embedded between thin non-conductive fiber material (e. g. glass- or polyester fiber) which serve asinsulation. The load carrying CFRP-layers above and below the ceramic are used to electrically contact the piezoceramic, therefore the insulation layers are required to avoid short circuits. As the usual disturbing wires are not needed, the manufacture of the active composite has become easier and there is no additional weakening of the structure. In case of a break the piezoceramic will still work, as the broken pieces stay in the electrical field where they can be controlled. The tube in fig 1. b has the same lay-up with piezoceramic elements in each side of the tube. This structure is able to compensate deformations under thermal loads. In structures with arbitrary distributed ceramics carbon fiber bundles are used as a structural conformable way to contact the piezoceramic. Fig 1. c shows a beam structure with two piezo-ceramics. Each electrode in the active beam is contacted separately. In this way it can be used as strain actuator as well as a bimorph. Fig. 2 shows the operating diagram of the beam structure for both cases. Significant differences between mechanical and thermal properties of the ceramic plates as well as the extreme brittleness of the piezoceramic material demand sophisticated manufacturing techniques. Several manufacturing techniques have been used at the DLR including hand-lay-up and filament winding technique. Very good experience has been made with a sophisticated RTM technology, the so-called DP-RTM (Differential Pressure  Resin Transfer Moulding). This guarantees an extreme high quality and reproducibility of the components. The fiber material is laid out in dry state which facilitates the positioning of the electric cables and ceramics. The DP-RTM procedure becomes especially interesting as it is not necessary to provide massive moulds since the clamping forces in the autoclave are created by the differential pressure. Thus, a simple sheet plate can serve as sub mould while a <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil</b> is applied for the upper mould. Fiber volume content and fluid rate can directly be controlled by adjusting differential pressure during the stages of injection. In order to minimize the weight of the active fiber composite a high fiber volume content is required. This can be achieved by increasing the differential pressure. Simultaneously, the increasing mechanical load on the ceramics has to be considered since it might result in mechanical damage of the brittle actuators. The different process parameters like autoclave pressure, autoclave temperature and differential pressure have been optimized during several test procedures. The new materials and material systems that can be used as multifunctional actuators and sensors with new real-time control concepts and adaptive signal processing, have helped to establish a new class of structures called adaptive structures. The results of recent investigations indicate that these concepts contain very promising potentials for future structural and acoustic purposes. With the research progress and the realization of functional demonstrators as described above by some examples, the intention is now to make this technology available for common industrial applications. To achieve this aim an inter-disciplinary development process (fig. 3) has been established. LEITPROJEKT ADAPTRONIK is the title of a German national model project that will be conducted under the auspices of the Braunschweig-based Institute of Structural Mechanics. A consortium of seven major industry partners comprising five branches and seven medium and small-sized companies as well as further research partners was established as a center for the development of technologies within the model project. Besides many other research topics, the integration and development of piezoceramic plates and new piezoceramic fibers are of major importance within this project...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{increasing}} demand for [18 F]FDG for clinical PET-CT and the efficiencies associated with large production runs have encouraged endeavors {{to increase the}} amount of 18 F− produced by cyclotrons in a single run. The amount of 18 F− is determined by the saturation yield of the nuclear reaction, the irradiation time and the beam current striking the target. The saturation yield is a function of beam energy (typically fixed for PET cyclotrons), the enrichment of the H 218 O (typically > 97 %) and the efficiency of the target design. Target design has already been optimized on current systems. Diminishing gains in activity are achieved by extending the irradiation time much beyond 3 hrs, so the main focus has been to increase beam current onto the targets. Increasing the beam current requires: i) a cyclotron capable of producing the increased beam current; ii) targets that tolerate the beam current without appreciable loss in saturation yield; iii) sufficient shielding of the cyclotron and hot cells to accommodate the proportionally larger radiation dose rates during higher current irradiation and from the larger activities delivered to the hot cells. We reported [1] that the self-shielded targets fitted to our cyclotron can accommodate 100 µA currents without appreciable loss in saturation yield. We also identified the potential of routine production at 200 A (100 A per target in dual target irradiation mode), but had not establish its long-term viability in routine use. We present our experience in using 200 µA for routine production of 18 F- since September 2012. Material and Methods Our PETtrace cyclotron was installed in 2002 and has been used for routine production of various 18 F and 11 C tracers since January 2003. It has been upgraded incrementally so that it is now equivalent to a current generation PETtrace 880 cyclotron, which is specified at a total beam current of 130 µA. The only components on our cyclotron currently not part of the standard PETtrace 880 cyclotron configuration are the self-shielded targets and a license which allows total target beam current of 200 µA. The self-shielded targets utilize a W/Cu alloy for the main body of the target surrounding the Havar foil to provide shielding from the Havar foil by a factor of about 10 and shielding of any remnant 18 F- activity in the targets by a factor of about 100 [1]. The niobium target chamber is the same size as used in the standard GE Nb 25 targets. However, it dispenses with the He cooling and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>foil.</b> Only the water foil is used, which is directly exposed to the vacuum in the chamber. Foil cooling is through the water in the target chamber. One of the issues that we previously identified [1] is beam stripping by gas molecules in the vacuum tank. The amount of beam that is stripped and which impacts on components in the cyclotron is proportional to the beam current. At high currents, this can result in a runaway condition, where the effects of the stripped beam deteriorate vacuum; this then results in more beam stripping and more severe effects. The effect of diffusion pump maintenance on vacuum system performance and on the reduction of beam stripping was investigated as part of this study. We have previously found that running the ion source gas at a low flow rate (2 sccm) when cyclotron is not used greatly reduces deterioration of ion source performance over time and with use [1]. This gas flow also appears to have a beneficial effect on the vacuum. Ion source gas flow when cyclotron is off has been employed throughout the evaluation period. [18 F]FDG was produced with TRACERlab MXFDG modules or FASTlab modules using both Phosphate and Citrate cassettes. Stability studies of [18 F]FDG were performed to ensure it met specifications over the specified expiry time. Our current stabilization regime did not have to be adjusted for the higher activities produced with the higher beam currents. [18 F]FDG yields were calculated using input activity estimates from saturation yield and beam time and current and the non-decay corrected [18 F]FDG activity measured at the end of synthesis. Thus yield calculations include target yield variations and losses in the transfer lines and not just synthesis yield. Results and Conclusion The flip-in probe to extraction foil transmissions as a function of ion source gas flow are given in TABLE 1. Transmission decreases with increasing ion source gas flow, as expected for a system with an internal ion source. In addition, diffusion pump maintenance had a positive impact on the transmission and this is of particular benefit at the higher beam currents where minimising beam stripping becomes more critical. The ion source output, however, decreases with decreasing ion source gas flow; hence ion source gas flow is a compromise between ion source output and probe to foil transmission. We currently use a gas flow of 5. 5 sccm for our 200 µA runs. Over the period from 1 st September 2012 to end of March 2014, a total of 419 [18 F]FDG produc-tions were performed at total target beam currents ranging from 160 µA to 200 µA, with 227 production runs being performed at 200 µA. Beam times were typically 90 to 120 min, with some productions up to 180 min. The [18 F]FDG yields are summarized in TABLE 2. The yields for the FASTlab phosphate and citrate cassettes have been listed separately in TABLE 2 as they are known to be different [2, 3]. The yields obtained with the TRACERlab MXFDG are also shown. The yields at 200 µA total target current are not appreciably different from those at 120 µAh, respectively. As more experience has been gained with the self-shielded targets, service interval is actually being extended from about 10, 000 µAh to 20, 000 µAh, despite the higher beam currents. Diffusion pump maintenance is currently recommended every 5 years, but a 2 year maintenance interval may be advantageous for 200 µA, given the observed deterioration over a 5 year period and the improvement in performance post service (Table 1). The more frequent service is associated with the additional costs of diffusion pump oil and an extra day of scheduled down-time. Typically, vacuum is sufficiently well established 24 h after opening of the vacuum tank to run 200 µA beams with the vacuum and beam conditioning that we employ. The targets generally have coped well with the 100 µA per target current (200 µA total beam current for dual target irradiation) over this 18 month period. However, currents of 80 µA to µ 100 A per target in dual target irradiation mode reduce the tolerance to sudden increases in one of the target currents. There were 4 occasions (2 test beams and 2 production beams) when there were sudden increases of target current from 90 µA and 100 µA to about 150 µA. The rapid increase in heat deposited on the foil and target chamber and the resultant rapid pressure rise in the target chamber could not be withstood by the foil and target foil rupture ensued. This compared to 1 target foil issue over a similar period of time (18 months) at lower beam currents on the standard Nb 25 target. Three separate causes were identified for these overshoots in target current: 1) behavior of control system when beam is allowed to continue past the set time; 2) large changes of set current of one of the two targets irradiated during a dual irradiation test beam and 3) an issue with DEE voltage regulation caused by the mechanical flap controls. These issues have been addressed by procedural changes (issues 1 and 2) and by fitting an available upgrade of the mechanical flap control mechanism (issue 3). The two target foil ruptures during production did not cause cancellation or delays to patient scanning, as the demand could be met by multi-ple productions and deliveries from the unaf-fected target. No unscheduled down-days occurred during the evaluation period. We have been able to achieve routine operation at 200 µA beam current through careful optimization of the critical components and parameters and a maintenance regime that we have detailed previously [1]. This maintenance scheme has not changed for the routine 200 µA operation. The safety margin, however, is reduced and so careful monitoring of the system is required to ensure that issues in one of the subsystems do not cause major events such as target foil ruptures. Our [18 F]FDG yields have been maintained at the higher current and 200 µA allows large quantities of [18 F]FDG to be produced routinely in a single run with relatively short beam times...|$|R
