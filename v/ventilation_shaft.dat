5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof outlet for a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|During an {{inspection}} by Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner lures Bart, Jimbo, Kearney, Dolph and Nelson into a utility basement {{with the promise}} of free mountain bikes and locks the door. Bart escapes through a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> and takes Groundskeeper Willie's tractor for a joyride, crashing into Superintendent Chalmers. Rather than giving him detention, Principal Skinner instead expels Bart. After Bart is quickly expelled from a new private Christian school, Marge decides to homeschool Bart.|$|E
5|$|Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn {{investigate}} a mysterious black ice cave, fearing that Finn and Jake {{may have been}} captured by the Ice King on a routine expedition. Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a wall, and the two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft.</b> Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered with eyes. As Bubblegum and Lady approach the room's exit, the eyes activate and shoot laser at the duo, incapacitating Lady.|$|E

50|$|The Monier <b>Ventilation</b> <b>Shafts</b> {{are thought}} to have been {{constructed}} , as part of a system of <b>ventilation</b> <b>shafts</b> (either concrete or steel/iron) located at intervals along some of Brisbane's inner city arterial stormwater drains. Three concrete shafts survive (of at least five erected) and may be the first pre-cast reinforced concrete structures in Queensland.|$|R
5|$|The two {{tubes of}} the 53rd Street Tunnel under the East River began {{construction}} in spring 1927, and were fully excavated between Queens and Manhattan in January 1929, with a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> built on Welfare Island (today's Roosevelt Island). On October 4, 1928, the Board of Estimate approved {{the construction of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. During the line's construction, several intersections of Queens Boulevard with major roads were grade separated, in a similar manner to Grand Concourse in the Bronx during the building of the IND Concourse Line around that same time. At adjacent intersections with Woodhaven Boulevard and Horace Harding Boulevard (now the Long Island Expressway) in Elmhurst, Queens Boulevard's main road was depressed into underpasses. In Kew Gardens, Union Turnpike and the Interboro Parkway (now the Jackie Robinson Parkway) were depressed below Queens Boulevard {{at the level of the}} Union Turnpike station's mezzanine. The subway from Long Island City to Roosevelt Avenue and 74th Street was completed by April 1932.|$|E

It is then revealed that the city is entirely underground, and that THX has escaped onto the surface where he then witnesses the Sun setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{scene was}} in the Tai Lam Tunnel {{southbound}} track, about 2km from Tsuen Wan West Station. Around 650 passengers had to evacuate through the dark tunnel to the station, and around 340 people returned to the ground through a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> at Chai Wan Kok. 11 passengers {{were sent to the}} hospital.

It is a Corinthian column of Portland stone {{topped by a}} gold leaf covered flaming copper urn, which is illuminated by fibre-optic lighting at night. The column was designed by the architects Whitfield Partners and {{also serves as a}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> for a service road that runs beneath the square.

25|$|During the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich, {{testified that}} {{he had planned to}} kill Adolf Hitler in early 1945 by {{introducing}} tabun into the FÃ¼hrerbunker <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft.</b> He said his efforts were frustrated by the impracticality of tabun and his lack of ready access to a replacement nerve agent, and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach.|$|E
25|$|Rescuers {{attempted}} {{to bypass the}} rockfall at the main entryway through alternative passages but found each route blocked by fallen rock or threatened by ongoing rock movement. After a second collapse on 7 August, rescuers were forced to use heavy machinery while trying to gain access via a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft.</b> Concerns that additional attempts to pursue this route would cause further geological movement halted attempts to reach the trapped miners through previously existing shafts and other means to find the men were sought.|$|E

25|$|A {{radiation}} level of 10 sieverts per hour is read at a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> between reactors 1 and 2. The area is subsequently sealed. The reading of 10 Sv is the maximum for many Geiger counters, including those used for these readings. One official {{states that it}} is entirely possible that the radiation readings were higher since the counter was reading its maximum. Radiation has been impeding attempts to replace cooling systems. These are the highest readings logged indoors since the initial March 2011 explosions.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{deferred}} maintenance, {{the condition}} of the subway system reached dangerous conditions in the early 1980s; new construction was, by then, considered ludicrous. Even as the only new construction {{was going on in the}} 63rd Street Line, Manhattan residents at the vicinity of York Avenue and East 63rd Street protested over the MTA's intention to build a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> for the line. During the early 1980s, work on the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue lines continued, although the MTA considered stopping work on these projects in October 1980, and spending the money instead on maintaining the existing system.|$|E
25|$|The through {{platforms}} {{have been}} extended along Blackfriars Railway Bridge over the River Thames, and the platform layout altered {{to avoid the}} need for trains between City Thameslink and London Bridge to cross the lines giving access to the terminus platforms. The new station houses a new shared National Rail/LUL ticket hall and LUL <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> together with new escalators and lifts between a mezzanine level for National Rail services and the sub-surface level for London Underground services. A new station entrance has been created on Bankside, with a second ticket hall. It opened on 5 December 2011.|$|E

40|$|Naturally {{ventilated}} buildings {{can significantly}} reduce the required energy for cool-ing and ventilating buildings by drawing in outdoor air using non-mechanical forces. Buoyancy-driven systems are common in naturally ventilated commercial buildings because of their reliable performance in multi-story buildings. Such systems rely on atria or <b>ventilation</b> <b>shafts</b> to provide a pathway for air to rise through the building. Although numerous modeling techniques are used to simulate naturally ventilated buildings, airflow network tools (AFNs) are most commonly used for annual simula-tions. These AFNs, however, assume minimal momentum within each zone, which is a reasonable approximation in large atria, but is inappropriate in smaller <b>ventilation</b> <b>shafts.</b> This thesis improves AFNs by accounting for momentum effects within <b>ventilation</b> <b>shafts.</b> These improvements are validated by Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models that haven been validated by small scale and full scale experiments. The full scale experiment provides a detailed data set of an actual atrium that can be use...|$|R

25|$|The {{entirety}} of the 4.7 mile-long Route 132-A {{was to be}} constructed underground through tunneling and cut-and-cover. Station mezzanines; the line north of 92nd Street, where the rock profile drops away sharply; and the area around 48th Street, {{where there is a}} crevice in the rock profile, would be constructed using cut-and-cover. The temporary decking of Second Avenue was required for this construction to take place and to allow for traffic aboveground to proceed. The remaining portions of the line were to be built through tunneling. Only one business relocation was planned for the construction of the line. A gas station at the southeast corner of 63rd Street and Second Avenue was to be relocated as the site needed to be used for a construction and <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft,</b> in addition to being used for a permanent ventilation superstructure. Underground easements were to be required under thirteen properties in the vicinity of 63rd Street. Compared to other subway lines, the Second Avenue line was going to be much quieter.|$|E

500|$|Midden closets were, therefore, {{generally}} insanitary {{and were}} also difficult to empty and clean. [...] Later improvements, {{such as a}} midden closet built in Nottingham, used a brick-raised seat above a concave receptacle to direct excreta toward {{the centre of the}} pitâwhich was lined with cement to prevent leakage into the surrounding soil. [...] This closet was also designed with a special opening through which deodorising material could be scattered {{over the top of the}} pit. [...] A special <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> was also installed. [...] The design offered a significant improvement over the less advanced midden privy, but the problems of emptying and cleaning such pits remained and thus the pail system, with its easily removable container, became more popular.|$|E

500|$|Back at camp, after Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) {{disappears into}} the hatch, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) descends as well, and finds her {{unconscious}} in the computer room. An armed Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick) walks up behind them, and asks Locke if he is [...] "him". Locke at first {{claims to be the}} person whom Desmond is seeking, but fails to correctly answer a riddle he poses. This failure prompts Desmond to round up the two and orders Kate to tie up Locke. However, Locke convinces Desmond that Kate be tied up instead. Desmond agrees, and Locke slides her a knife before locking her in a dark room. Kate frees herself and finds she is in a large pantry filled with foodstuffs, all in boxes bearing a strange marking. Kate then climbs into a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
500|$|An {{observer}} at the trial, {{journalist and}} author William L. Shirer, wrote that, compared to his codefendants, Speer [...] "made the most straightforward impression of all and... during the long trial spoke honestly and with no attempt to shirk his responsibility and his guilt". Speer claimed that {{he had planned to}} kill Hitler in early 1945 by introducing tabun poison gas into the FÃ¼hrerbunker <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft.</b> He said his efforts were frustrated by the impracticability of tabun and his lack of ready access to a replacement nerve agent, and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach. Speer stated his motive was despair at realising that Hitler intended to take the German people down with him. Speer's supposed assassination plan subsequently met with some skepticism, with Speer's architectural rival Hermann Giesler sneering, [...] "the second most powerful man in the state did not have a ladder." ...|$|E
500|$|Coming {{after two}} episodes {{focused on the}} series' [...] "mythology", or fictional history, [...] "Squeeze" [...] helped {{establish}} that the show could cover other paranormal subjects, {{and was the first}} [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episode of The X-Files. Series creator Chris Carter thought that the show could not sustain its momentum unless it branched out from the previously UFO-centered plots. Co-writers Glen Morgan and James Wong were inspired to write the episode when they looked at a <b>ventilation</b> <b>shaft</b> outside of their office and thought about whether someone could crawl inside it. Although the episode has parallels with the second [...] film, The Night Strangler (1973), which featured a man who commits murders every 21 years, Morgan and Wong have stated they were inspired by the serial killers Jack the Ripper and Richard Ramirez. After eating foie gras during a trip to France, Carter proposed the idea that the villain should consume human livers. Morgan noted that the writers settled on the liver because it was [...] "funnier" [...] than any other organ. The idea to have Tooms use a nest for hibernation came from Morgan and Wong; they liked that if the agents were unable to catch Tooms, he could return after weeks of dormancy.|$|E
