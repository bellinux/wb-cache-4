40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{summarise}} {{the current}} status of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) vaccine development and provide a discussion of the potential benefits and limitations of genital herpes vaccines. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: Genital herpes simplex virus infection has a complex pathogenesis that has contributed to it becoming a serious worldwide problem. In an attempt to control the problem five different types of genital herpes vaccines have been developed. These include inactivated virion derived vaccines, adjuvanted subunit vaccines, vectored vaccines, replication limited live <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines,</b> genetically attenuated live <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and nucleic acid vaccines. While available commercially {{in some parts of the}} world, inactivated virion derived vaccines have not been proved effective. Of the others, adjuvanted subunit vaccines, replication limited live <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines,</b> and nucleic acid vaccines are currently in clinical trials and vectored vaccines and genetically attenuated live <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines</b> are in preclinical development. CONCLUSION: With regard to HSV vaccines in general, it is reasonable to expect that the newer vaccines may protect the individual from developing symptomatic genital herpes but may not protect against asymptomatic viral infection. With widespread use HSV vaccines might help to prevent the spread of genital herpes. ...|$|R

5000|$|Several {{groups have}} {{attempted}} to design vaccines for HIV and hepatitis C based on induction of cytotoxic (CTL) responses. The finding that CTL may be biased by original antigenic sin, may help to explain the limited effectiveness of these vaccines. Viruses like HIV are highly variable and undergo mutation frequently, and thus, due to original antigenic sin, HIV infection induced by viruses that express slightly different epitopes (than those in a <b>viral</b> <b>vaccine)</b> would fail {{to be controlled by}} the vaccine.

Vaccination is only used where the virus is widespread in the domestic pig population and/or in wild or feral pigs. In the latter case, a slaughter policy alone is usually impracticable. Instead, countries within the EU have implemented hunting restrictions designed to limit the movement of infected boars, as well as using marker and emergency vaccines to inhibit the spread of infection. Possible sources for maintaining and introducing infection include the wide transport of pigs and pork products, as well as endemic CSF within wild boar and feral pig populations.|$|E

3000|$|... iCELLis Nano {{is a novel}} {{scalable}} fixed-bed disposable bioreactor {{system for}} the optimal growth of cells. It {{is believed to be}} an efficient system for high yield production of various veterinary and human <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines.</b> In fact, Drugmand et al. ([2009]) have shown that iCELLis Nano is a scale-down version of larger production units and it is a right tool to benchmark with traditional cell culture systems. Viral diseases such as Rabies, Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya are widely prevalent in most of the developing countries (Bourhy et al. [2010], Franco et al. [2012], Edelman et al. [2000]; Sreekumar et al. [2010]). Therefore, increased productivity of these <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines</b> is warranted to have low cost and affordable vaccines (Whitford and Fairbank [2011]). The latest generation of packed bed bioreactors used in bioprocess applications are expected to achieve very high cell densities leading to outstandingly high volumetric productivity. Moreover, viral replication is the real evidence to implement the process in the new platform technology. Therefore, here we have evaluated the feasibility of using the novel iCELLis Nano disposable bioreactor system for the production of some <b>viral</b> <b>vaccines</b> such as Rabies, Hepatitis-A and Chikungunya vaccine in Vero and MRC- 5 cells. One of the commercially available packed bed bioreactor system and Roller bottle systems have also been included in this study for the comparative analysis.|$|R

The acidic pH treated <b>viral</b> <b>vaccine</b> showed high susceptibility to proteolytic cleavage and low hemagglutination activity indicating conformational changes. Immunization of mice with low pH treated <b>viral</b> <b>vaccine</b> induced lower levels of homologous or heterologous virus-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies compared to the untreated vaccine. Also, low pH treated influenza viral antigen showed lower antigenicity compared to the untreated influenza viral antigen. Lower efficacy of cross-protection against heterosubtypic virus was observed in the low-pH treated vaccine group. The results provide evidence that there is a correlation between protective efficacy and the stability of vaccines...|$|E
