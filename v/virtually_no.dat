5|$|In {{southern}} Scott Township, Hull Creek is {{flanked by}} native trees and understory. However, further downstream, in Blakely, there is <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> riparian buffer. Beyond this reach, the creek's riparian buffer again contains native trees and understory.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no state}} roads and <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> {{township}} {{roads in the}} watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. Industrial activities such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> such activity there. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the stream throughout its entire length. Most of the creek has a substantial riparian buffer.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there are}} 26 letters (2×13) {{in the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} is applied, so the same action {{can be used for}} encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.|$|E

5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> heavy weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{penultimate}} {{panel of}} the book, as Tintin, Haddock and Calculus's flight back home departs from the newly named Alcazaropolis, it flies over a slum that was seen earlier when they flew into the country.

5|$|The railway {{left the}} Cuckoo Line at Hellingly Station. Although the railway joined the Cuckoo Line {{at both the}} {{northern}} and southern ends of the platform, <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> through trains ran.

5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} hydroelectricity complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate.

5|$|Def Jam's distributor, Columbia Records, {{refused to}} release the album due to the song Angel of Death which {{detailed}} Holocaust concentration camps and the human experiments conducted by Nazi physician Josef Mengele. The album was distributed by Geffen Records on October 7, 1986. However, due to the controversy, Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records' release schedule. Although the album received <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> radio airplay, it became the band's first to enter the Billboard 200, debuting at number 94, and the band's first album certified gold in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult blue whales have <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine {{of a blue}} whale being attacked by orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a blue whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the blue whale's tail fluke. The blue whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the blue whale's side. The blue whale fled and escaped. Orcas have <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> chance against an adult blue whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the blue whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E

5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), the reagent {{is referred}} to as a stabilized ylide. These, similarly to sulfoxonium reagents, react much slower and are typically easier to prepare. These are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish: examples involving amides are widespread, with many fewer involving esters and <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> examples involving other EWG's. For these, the related Darzens reaction is typically more appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{is known}} for a {{politically}} active citizenry, and populism has been a longstanding force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout (due in part to its liberal voter registration laws) with <b>virtually</b> <b>no</b> evidence of unlawful voting. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2 percent of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus {{the national average of}} 61.2 percent.
