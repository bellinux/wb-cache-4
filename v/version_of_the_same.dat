5|$|The twin Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} in 1977, each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source. Over 30 years later, each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft. An earlier <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> technology powered five Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, starting with Apollo 12 in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{versions}} of the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors {{in the early to}} mid-1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard designed {{to be used in the}} home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> technology. It was popularised by Patrick Moraz.|$|E
5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, without exception, from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection {{similar to the one}} previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E

40|$|With <b>the</b> {{evolution}} <b>of</b> Internet to heterogeneous networks both {{in terms}} of processing power and network bandwidth, different users demand <b>the</b> different <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> content.

25|$|This {{means that}} {{construction}} grammarians argue, for instance, that active and passive <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proposition are not derived from an underlying structure, but are instances {{of two different}} constructions. As constructions are pairings of form and meaning, active and passive <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> proposition are not synonymous, but display differences in content: {{in this case the}} pragmatic content.|$|R
5|$|The {{position}} of Balaur {{relative to other}} bird-like dinosaurs and early birds {{has been difficult to}} determine. The initial phylogenetic analysis placed Balaur bondoc closest to the Asiatic mainland dromaeosaurid species Velociraptor mongoliensis. A 2013 study by Brusatte and colleagues, using a modified <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> data, found it in an unresolved close relationship with the dromaeosaurids Deinonychus and Adasaurus, with some possible alternative trees suggesting it branched off before the common ancestor of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, while others maintained it as the closest relative of Velociraptor, with Adasaurus as their next closest relative.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully hear, and {{promptly}} investigate, a story about an alien abduction of two teenagers. Each witness provides a different <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> facts. Within the episode, a thriller novelist, Jose Chung, writes {{a book about the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E

5|$|Platform A6 {{encloses}} {{the western}} extreme of the Group A plaza. The platform has two levels, the upper {{of which has}} a vertical cornice. The platform faces east onto the plaza; access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades terminating in vertical cornices. Platform A6 was built over an older <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> building; this earlier construction phase was smaller and its stairways were destroyed {{in order to build}} the stairways of the final version. During restoration work carried out by archaeologists the back wall and a section of the facade were left exposed. Four funerary urns were found associated with the platform, mostly interred under the front of the building.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Battalion, The Rhodesian Light Infantry, {{commonly}} the Rhodesian Light Infantry (1RLI or RLI), {{served in}} the Rhodesian Bush War {{as part of the}} Rhodesian Security Forces between 1964 and 1979, under the unrecognised government of Rhodesia following its 1965 Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain. During the second half of 1979 it fought for Zimbabwe Rhodesia, a black majority-ruled <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> state which also failed to win international recognition. After an interim period under British control from December 1979 to April 1980, the RLI briefly remained active within the armed forces of Zimbabwe, but did not see action under this government. It disbanded on 31 October 1980.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} slated to feature {{as part of}} the film Bean (1997), under the registration C607 EUW, in which as part of a sequence, it was driven through Harrods Department Store by Mr. Bean. Although the sequence was filmed, it {{was not included in the}} final cut. The car eventually had its debut on the big-screen when it featured in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday, with the registration YGL 572T. The film featured a second <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> car, with exactly the same colour scheme, but with left-hand drive, driven by a character befriended by Bean.|$|E

5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs {{as well as how}} longer they think it will take to prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} re-released in 1985 and 2002, earning another $60 million and $68 million respectively, for a {{worldwide}} total of $792 million with North America accounting for $435 million. It held the global record {{until it was}} surpassed by Jurassic Park—another Spielberg-directed film—in 1993, although it managed {{to hold on to}} the domestic record for a further four years, where a Star Wars reissue reclaimed it. It was eventually released on VHS and laserdisc on October 27, 1988; to combat piracy, the tapeguards and tape hubs on the videocassettes were colored green, the tape itself was affixed with a small, holographic sticker of the 1963 Universal logo (much like the holograms on a credit card), and encoded with Macrovision. In North America alone, VHS sales came to $75 million. In 1991, Sears began selling E.T. videocassettes exclusively at their stores as part of a holiday promotion. It was reissued on VHS and Laserdisc again in 1996. The Laserdisc included a 90-minute documentary. Produced and directed by Laurent Bouzereau, it included interviews with Spielberg, producer Kathleen Kennedy, composer John Williams and other cast and crew members. It also included two theatrical trailers, an isolated music score, deleted scenes, and still galleries. The VHS included a 10-minute <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> documentary from the Laserdisc.|$|E

25|$|Some sources {{suggest that}} a naval version of Green Mace was planned as a new dual purpose gun for the Royal Navy's destroyers, and a twin <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> gun {{intended}} for cruisers reached the design stage, but neither went any further, and they were cancelled outright in 1957.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} {{characterize}} <b>the</b> singing community <b>of</b> a nineteenth century Scottish village {{and to identify}} two distinct voices from the village repertoire. By closely analyzing two <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ballad story recorded from two women on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> day in 1825, an attempt is made to demonstrate how the two singers manage to produce two distinct <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> ballad by employing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> traditional narrative techniques in slightly differing ways, thus allowing us a glimpse into <b>the</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> stability and variation in the ballad genre...|$|R
