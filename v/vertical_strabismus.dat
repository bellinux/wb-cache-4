40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} fixation preference (FP) and amblyopia in strabismic patients. Methods: This study includes 50 patients with horizontal, <b>vertical</b> or mixed <b>strabismus</b> of at least 10 prism diopters. Best-corrected monocular visual acuity (VA) was measured using Snellen E-chart {{and the presence of}} amblyopia was determined accordingly; FP was evaluated and graded from 0 to 3. Results: Of 50 patients, including 27 female and 23 male subjects, 29 (58 %) patients had FP but 18 (36 %) subjects were truly amblyopic. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of FP for detection of amblyopia was 88. 9 % and 59. 4 % respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 55. 2 % and 90. 5 % respectively. Sensitivity, PPV and NPV were significantly higher in esotropic as compared to exotropic patients. Strong monocular FP was correlated with more than 3 lines of interocular difference (IOD) in visual acuity (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: Although FP is not an ideal method for diagnosis of strabismic amblyopia, it has high sensitivity, PPV and NPV in esotropic patients and in subjects with more than 3 lines of IOD in VA...|$|R
40|$|Aims. To report {{outcomes}} of the simultaneous surgical correction of vertical rectus paralysis combined with moderate-to-large angle horizontal strabismus. Methods. If a preoperative forced duction test was positive, antagonist muscle weakening surgery was performed, and then augmented partial rectus muscle transposition (APRMT) + partial horizontal rectus recession-resection was performed 2 months later. If a preoperative forced duction test was negative, APRMT + partial horizontal rectus recession-resection was performed. Antagonistic muscle weakening surgery and/or conventional recession-resection of the horizontal and/or vertical muscles of the contralateral eye was performed 2 months later, as needed. Results. Ten patients {{with a mean age}} of 22. 3 ± 13. 0 years were included and mean follow-up was 7. 1 months. The mean vertical deviation that APRMT corrected was 21. 4 ± 3. 7 PD (prism diopter). The absolute deviation in horizontal significantly decreased from a preoperative value of 48. 5 ± 27. 4 PD to a value of 3. 0 ± 2. 3 PD 6 months postoperatively. The movement score decreased from a value of − 5 ± 0 preoperatively to a value of − 2. 7 ± 0. 8 at 6 months postoperatively. Conclusion.

50|$|The Maddox rod {{test can}} be used to subjectively detect and measure a latent, manifest, {{horizontal}} or <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> for near and distance. The test is based on the principle of diplopic projection. Dissociation of the deviation is brought about by presenting a red line image to one eye and a white light to the other, while prisms are used to superimpose these and effectively measure the angle of deviation (horizontal and vertical). The strength of the prism is increased until the streak of the light passes through the centre of the prism, as the strength of the prism indicates the amount of deviation present. The Maddox rod is a handheld instrument composed of red parallel plano convex cylinder lens, which refracts light rays so that a point source of light is seen as a line or streak of light. Due to the optical properties, the streak of light is seen perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Superior oblique palsy (SOP) is {{the most}} common cause of paralytic strabismus. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the frequency, {{etiology}} and outcome of surgical approaches in SOP with other <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus.</b> Methods: This is a cross sectional study that was performed on 303 medical files of patients who referred to Yazd eye clinic from 1999 - 2012 with at least 6 months post operative follow up. The study instrument involved a questionnaire containing 11 questions that was used for data gathering. Results: In this study, within 303 patients, 50 cases (16 / 5 %) suffered from SOP (group A) and 253 cases from other <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> (group B). The most frequent causes of either group were congenital and trauma. The mean age of patients with congenital cause was 16 / 82 in group A and 12 / 81 years in group B while the mean age with traumatic cause was 24 / 63 in group A and 23 / 26 years in group B. Sixty percent (60 %) of operated patients in group A underwent one set of surgery while in group B mostly had two sets of the surgery. The most common surgical approach in either group was IO Recession. The rate of strabismus correction was 71 / 5 % in group A and 77 / 8 % in group B.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Binocular {{vertical}} {{rectus muscle}} recession {{has not been}} formally evaluated in the correction of comitant <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus.</b> METHODS: Eight patients with stable comitant <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> for at least 6 months were included. All underwent recession of the superior rectus muscle of the hypertropic eye combined with an equal or nearly equal recession of the inferior rectus muscle in the hypotropic eye. On the day before surgery, {{on one of the}} first three postoperative days, and at one year postoperatively, ocular alignment in vertical and horizontal gaze directions were measured with simultaneous and alternate cover test at a viewing distance of 5 meters, and with the two dimensional Hess screen test. The field of single binocular vision was determined with a Goldmann perimeter. The Lang stereopsis chart was presented at the last follow-up visit. RESULTS: All patients were orthotropic at the last postoperative follow-up visit. In primary gaze, the degree of vertical and horizontal phoria diminished significantly. Normal alignment was achieved in nearly all gaze directions and stereopsis was reestablished. The field of single binocular vision enlarged after the surgery.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} extraocular muscle (EOM) volume and cross-sectional area using computed tomography (CT), and to determine the relationship between EOM size and the vertical angle of deviation in thyroid eye disease (TED). Twenty-nine TED patients (58 orbits) with <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination including prism, alternate cover, and Krimsky tests. Orbital CT scans were also performed on each patient. Digital image analysis was used to quantify superior rectus (SR) and inferior rectus (IR) muscle cross-sectional areas and volumes. Measurements were compared with those of controls. The correlation between muscle size and degree of vertical angle deviation was evaluated. The mean vertical angle of deviation was 26. 2 ± 4. 1 prism diopters. The TED group had a greater maximum cross-sectional area and EOM volume in the SR and IR than the control group (all p< 0. 001). Area and volume of the IR were correlated with the angle of deviation, but the SR alone did not show a significant correlation. The maximum cross-sectional area and volume of [Right IR + Left SR - Right SR - Left IR] was strongly correlated with the vertical angle of deviation (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction. Strabismus is the  deviation  of one  eye from  a  common  {{fixation}} point, associated  with impaired  of binocular  vision. The eye’s {{position in}} {{horizontal and vertical}} directions looking straight determines the t ype of strabismus. Despite  numerous reports of surgical  interventions on the  vertical action  muscles, there is no a differentiated approach to the  treatment of patients with this pathology. The search for the optimal methods and principles of surgical  treatment of <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> caused by hyperfunction  of the inferior oblique muscle, testifies to the relevance of developing new approaches to eliminate hypertropia  depending  on its severit y. The purpose — to  develop  a  method  of dosing  the  degree of anterior transposition of the  inferior  oblique muscle  in the  surgical treatment of vertical  strabismus caused by hyperfunction  of the  inferior oblique muscle  depending  on severit y,  and  to  evaluate  its clinical efficacy. Patients And Methods. In the  period  from January 2013 to October  2015 60 children  (96   eyes) aged  from 3 to 17 years  with a <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> caused by hyperfunction  of the inferior oblique muscle  were  followed-up. All patients underwent a complete pre  — and postoperative examinations. All patients received  surgical  treatment — weakening  of the inferior oblique muscle through  its anterior dosed  transposition. Results. There  were  no intraoperative complications and  specific complications t ypical for weakening  surgeries on the  inferior oblique muscle. Overcorrection  wasn’t  registered neither  in the  case of surgical  treatment of large vertical angles  of strabismus, no small vertical deviations.   Restriction of mobilit y of the eyeballs wasn’t recorded throughout the observation period  in any patient. Residual  hyperfunction  of the  inferior oblique muscle  was  in 3 patients (5 %). It did not exceed  the value of the  vertical,  with the  fusion and  did not  require  additional surgical  treatment. Conclusion. The technology  will significantly improve  the  efficiency and  safet y  of treatment, reduce the  risk  of complications and  the  duration  of surgery and  anesthesia, the number of surgical treatment stages, to create optimal conditions  for the rehabilitation  of visual functions  in children. </p...|$|E

The results of weaking of inferior oblique muscle are very changeable. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate binocular vision using sensory tests before and one and six months after the surgery. Methods. A total of 79 children were divided in two groups: the first, with inferior oblique muscle of overaction (n = 52), and the second with dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), and primary inferior oblique muscle overaction (n = 27). We tested them by polaroid mirror test (PMT), Worth test at distance and near, fusion amplitudes on sinoptofore, Lang I stereo test and Wirt-Titmus stereo test. We examined our patients before and two times after the surgery for <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus.</b> Results. Foveal suppression in the group I was found in 60. 5 % of the patients before, and in 56. 4 % after the surgery. In group II Foveal suppression was detected in 64. 7 % of the patients before, but in 55. 6 % 6 months after the surgery with PMT. Worth test revealed suppression in 23. 5 % of the patients before, and in 40. 7 % after the vertical muscle surgery. Parafoveal fussion persisted in about 1 / 3 of the patients before the surgery, and their amplitudes were a little larger after the surgery in the group I patients. Lang I stereo test was negative in 53. 9 % before and 51. 9 % after the surgery in the group I, and in 48. 2 % of the patients before and after the surgery in the group II patients. Wirt-Titmus stereo test was negative in 74. 5 % of the patients before and in 72. 9 % after the surgery in the group I, but in the group II it was negative in 70. 8 % before and in 68. 0 % of the patients 6 months after the surgery.

40|$|Objective: The static ocular counterroll (OCR) reflex generates {{partially}} compensatory torsional eye movements during head roll. It {{is mediated}} by the utricle in the inner ear. Skew deviation is a <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> thought {{to be caused by}} imbalance in the utriculo-ocular pathway. We hypoth-esized that if skew deviation is indeed caused by damage to this reflex pathway, patients with skew deviation would show abnormal OCR. Methods: Eighteen patients with skew deviation caused by brainstem or cerebellar lesions and 18 normal participants viewed a target at 1 m. Ocular responses to static passive head roll-tilts of approximately 20 ° were recorded using search coils. Static OCR gain was calculated as the change in torsional eye position divided by the change in head position during sustained head roll. Perception of the subjective visual vertical (SVV) was also measured. Results: Group mean OCR gain was reduced by 45 % in patients. At an individual level, OCR gains were asymmetric between eyes and between torsional directions in 90 % of patients.

All cases underwent bilateral lateral rectus recession for exotropia and bilateral medial recession for esotropia; there were no cases of combined <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus.</b> There was no history of any ocular trauma or previous strabismus surgery. Preoperative angle of deviation, AxL (IOL Master), and postoperative angle of deviation at 6 months were recorded; effect of recession was calculated in all cases. Results The mean AxL for all cases was 23. 39 ± 1. 73. The patients were divided into two groups: exotropia group (n= 52) and esotropia group (n= 42). Each group was subdivided into two subgroups: subgroup I (AxL< 23. 39) and subgroup II (AxL≥ 23. 39). The effect of recession in exotropic group was 2. 27 ± 0. 29; in short AxL subgroup, it was 2. 42 ± 0. 17, and in long AxL subgroup, it was 1. 98 ± 0. 25.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the clinical features {{and evaluate the}} surgical effect for sensory strabismus. METHODS: Clinical data of 178 patients with sensory strabismus that we treated from January 2012 to June 2013 were collected, including type of strabismus, cause of vision loss, degree distribution of strabismus. The ocular alignments and diplopia after surgery were observed. RESULTS: Among the 178 patients with sensory strabismus, 123 cases(69. 1 %) had sensory exotropia and 55 (30. 9 %) had sensory esotropia, 109 patients had anisometropic amblyopia. The mean preoperative exotropia deviation of the 123 patients with sensory exotropia was 69. 32 △. In the 123 patients, 78 were complicated with vertical deviation. The mean preoperative esotropia deviation of the 55 patients with sensory esotropia was 56. 45 △. In the 55 patients, 26 were complicated with vertical deviation. Six patients suffered from diplopia but diplopia disappeared within 2 wk after surgeries. The operation was designed to overcorrect the sensory exotropia and undercorrect the esotropia both about 10 △. The postoperative ocular position was considered alignment if the position was ± 10 △. All patients were performed surgeries. For patients with large-angle of sensory strabismus over 60 △, super maximal rectus resection and rectus recession operation were chosen. The follow-up time was 1 a. The operations were successful in 138 patients in the all 178 patient who experienced surgeries.

METHODS: Eighty patients with hyperfunction who were treated in our hospital from January 2014 to December 2015 were randomly selected and treated with anterior transposition of inferior oblique muscle. Patients were followed up for 1 to 30 mo. We compared the vertical incline at the original incline from far(5 m), near(33 cm) distance and IOOA degree before and after operations, and the correlation between the two. We also compared the vertical incline at the original incline from far(5 m), near(33 cm) distance and IOOA degree before and after operations in 30 eyes(20 patients) with bilateral asymmetry DVD and IOOA who received unequal inferior oblique transposition. The incidence of antielevation syndrome(AES) was observed after operations. RESULTS: The mean prism diopters(PD) at 5 m before operations was 19. 5 ± 0. 15, the average PD after operations was 3. 5 ± 0. 18, at 5 m the original incline was 16 ± 0. 21 PD.

40|$|AIM: To {{understand}} the common conditions {{of visual impairment}} in cerebral palsy children, and to {{provide the basis for}} early screening of eyes, early diagnosis and treatment, and promote the visual rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy. METHODS:Two hundred and twenty-three children with cerebral palsy underwent routine ophthalmologic examination, including the position of eye and eyeball movement, indirect ophthalmoscopy or Retcam II fundus examination, mydriasis optometry check and flash-visual evoked potential(F-VEP) examination, and the results were recorded and analyzed. RESULTS: Strabismus,ametropia and changes of F-VEP were the mainly impairments in 223 children with cerebral palsy, and some children also were associated with ocular fundus disease. There were 174 children with different types of strabismus, including 121 children with esotropia, 36 children with exotropia, 15 children with <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus,</b> and 2 children with nystagmus. There were 129 children(247 eyes) with refractive errors, including 118 eyes with compound hyperopic astigmatism, 51 eyes with simple hyperopia, 33 eyes with mixed astigmatism, 19 eyes with compound myopic astigmatism, 21 eyes with simple hyperopia astigmatism, 4 eyes with simple myopia astigmatism, only 1 eye with simple myopia. The F-VEP of 194 children(381 eyes) were abnormal, and performed as delayed latency and reduced amplitude of P 2 wave. In addition, there were 51 children with different types of ocular fundus changes, in which optic nerve atrophy and retinal hemorrhage were the most common.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} a novel single-armed suture placement technique during rectus muscle {{recession in the}} management of horizontal strabismus. Methods: Forty consecutive patients were included in this retrospective study. Forty-three muscles, 23 medial recti and 17 lateral recti, of 20 patients affected by esotropia or exotropia were sutured with this novel technique, which involved the use of a single armed 6 - 0 polyglactin 910 (Ethicon Vicryl ®) suture to attach the rectus muscle to sclera. Twenty patients affected as well by esotropia or exotropia were used as control group (22 medial recti and 16 lateral recti). All cases were performed by the same surgeon. Measurements of ocular alignment were taken before and after the operation and the difference, in prism dioptres at cover test for distance (6 m) and near (30 cm), was reported. Mean and standard deviation of the differences between pre- and post-operative measurements were obtained and studied using the student t-test. A P value of more than 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Mean difference between before and after surgery at cover test for distance was 31. 1 ± 20. 90 dioptres in the study group and 23. 7 ± 13. 83 in the control group (P= 0. 188644). Difference for near was 31. 4 ± 19. 25 in the study group and 26. 1 ± 13. 17 in the control group (P= 0. 218981) In two cases it was necessary to include an additional central suture to correct the central sagging of the tendon. In no cases did we observe the dissolution of the suture knots or of slipping back of the muscle. Conclusions: The results obtained with this new suture technique, in terms of correction of the deviation are comparable to those obtained by the same surgeon suturing with the more widely used double-armed technique. The advantages of this technique are its speed and ease of execution. It can be easily taught to trainees and can improve operating times in horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> surgery...|$|E
40|$|Background. The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} whether the surgery on vertical muscles of the eye influenced the change in refraction and visual acuity. Methods. This prospective study included testing of 79 children with infantile esotropia who suffered from the <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> after the surgery on horizontal muscles. Patients were divided into two groups: the first group of 52 children (the test group) had only vertical component (overaction of m. obliqui inferior) and the second group (the control group) had two vertical components (dissociated vertical deviation - DVD and overaction of m. obliqui inferior). Refraction and visual acuity were tested before the surgery on the vertical muscles and one month and six months after the surgery. There {{was no significant difference between}} the results of the objective refraction in those three different periods of time. Results. In both groups mild hypermetria (according to Costenbander) occurred in 40 - 48 % of the examinees of both groups, while moderately-expressed hypermetropia occurred in 40 - 50 % of the examinees. There was neither statistically significant difference between the results of the three observed measurings among every group, nor between the observed groups of patients (p> 0, 05). By the analysis of the results of visual acuity it could be concluded that it was significantly improved 6 months after the surgery on cyclovertical muscles. This change was more significant in the sample group of patients (p< 0, 01) than in the children from the control group (p< 0, 05), who were much older. Conclusion. Objective refraction in patients was in the range of low values of hypermetropia (+ 2. 00 Dsph - t 3. 00 Dsph). Significant improvement of visual acuity occurred 6 months after the surgery performed on vertical muscles of the eye.

On initial exam-ination, the patient was unresponsive to verbal command but responded appro-priately to painful stimulation of all extremities. Neurological examination otherwise was unremarkable. Labora-tory studies on admission showed a slight elevation of glutamine in the CSF. An electroencephalogram showed changes compatible with a severe meta-bolic encephalopathy. On the third hospital day, the patient was found to be entirely unresponsive to verbal or painful stimuli. The right eye was maintained in primary position but the left eye was moderately hypertrophic as compared to the right. Oculocephalic and oculovestibular reflexes were intact both horizontally and vertically. Pupils were 3 mm diameter, equal, round, and reactive. The rest of the neurological examination remained unremarkable. The patient was treated with lactulose and sedative medication was discon-tinued. Within two days, he responded to pain and the ocular skew deviation was no longer present. Five days after initiation of therapy, the patient was alert and responded to verbal commands with full ocular movements. At that time, he specifically denied any prior history of <b>vertical</b> <b>strabismus</b> or symp-tomatology suggestive of a poster circu-lation cerebral vascular accident. Transient ocular motor disturbances have been observed in patients with hepatic encephalopathy (usually associ-ated with structural lesion of the brain-stem) such as: ocular bobbing, 2 dyscon-jugate gaze 3 and absent horizontal re-sponsiveness to oculovestibular testing. 4 This appears to be the first report of a patient with ocular skew deviation in hepatic coma. Transient focal neuro-logical deficits such as those described above and others are an infrequent but well recognised complications of meta-bolic disorders. They are usually seen with structural lesions, are presumed to occur on the basis of selective vulner-ability to metabolic insult of regions o...|$|E
