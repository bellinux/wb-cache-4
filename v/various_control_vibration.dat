40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Mechanical {{structures}} encounter vibration {{in response}} to environmental conditions and dynamic loads. In most circumstances, vibration contributes to mechanical fatigue which can eventually lead to catastrophic failure. Consequently, <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> is a necessity for prolonging the operational life of structures. Piezoelectric and electromagnetic transducers {{have been used for}} <b>control</b> of <b>vibration</b> for many years. They normally sense mechanical vibration and generate an opposing vibration through another piezoelectric and electromagnetic transducer. This is usually referred to as active feedback <b>vibration</b> <b>control.</b> Another <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> strategy senses and actuates simultaneously through an appropriately designed electrical impedance which is connected to the terminals of a single transducer. This technique requires no additional sensor, has improved robustness and stability, and a similar feedback structure compared to active feedback <b>vibration</b> <b>control.</b> The objective of this thesis is to develop new <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> techniques by expanding on both the previously mentioned strategies. The first part of this thesis considers connecting an electrical impedance to a piezoelectric transducer to <b>control</b> <b>vibration.</b> This part reinforces that this <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> strategy can be modelled as a variation of active feedback <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> whereby the impedance parameterises the effective controller. A series of new vibration controllers are then presented. Applying the knowledge gained {{in the first part of}} this thesis, the second part considers replacing the piezoelectric transducer with an electromagnetic transducer. Although the underlying dynamics and physical properties of the transducers are different, the feedback structures are remarkably similar to that of active feedback <b>vibration</b> <b>control.</b> A number of new <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> strategies are proposed for a variety of mechanical systems.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} method for <b>controlling</b> <b>vibration</b> using {{compliant}}-based actuators. The compliant actuator combines a conventional actuator with elastic elements in a series configuration. The benefits of compliant actuators for <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> applications, demonstrated in this work, are twofold: (i) vibration reduction over a wide frequency bandwidth by passive control means; (ii) improvement of <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance when active control is applied using the compliant actuator. The <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance is compared with the control performance achieved using the well-known vibration absorber and conventional rigid actuator systems. The performance comparison showed that the compliant actuator provided a better flexibility in achieving <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> over a certain frequency bandwidth. The passive and active control characteristics of the compliant actuator are investigated, which shows that the control performance is highly dependent on the compliant stiffness parameter. The active control characteristics are analyzed by using the Proportional and Derivative (PD) control strategy which demonstrated the capability of effectively changing the respective effective stiffness and damping of the system. These attractive dual passive-active control characteristics are therefore advantageous for achieving an effective <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> system, particularly for <b>controlling</b> the <b>vibration</b> over a specific wide frequency bandwidth...|$|R

When robotic manipulator with base flexibility contacts environment under impedance <b>control,</b> <b>vibration</b> occurs at transient and contact moments. Vibration causes position and force inaccuracy, instability and servicing requirements of equipment. Previous active <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> {{is based on}} <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> elements {{on the base of}} manipulator. As new method, control element on the manipulator’s End Effector was proposed for <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> and <b>vibration</b> damping on the mechanism.

Active Vibration Controller on the End Effector (AVEE) was simulated for two models. First model is a simple FBMM composed of a 2 DOFs planar manipulator and a single DOF moving base with flexibility in between. Second model is an advanced 10 DOF’s FBMM. Combined Impedance/AVEE controller provides desired position/force control with satisfactory damped vibration especially at the point of contact.

The compliant actuator combines a conventional actuator with elastic elements in a series configuration, such as passive springs, {{with the aim of}} <b>controlling</b> the <b>vibration</b> at important low frequencies. In contrast to the rigid actuator, a compliant actuator provides better accuracy and robustness for force control. At high frequencies, the actuator behaves like a passive spring with low impedance, providing lower output impedance and better shock resistance to the actuator than the stiff actuator. The benefits of compliant actuators for <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> applications, demonstrated in this work, are twofold: (i) vibration reduction over a wide frequency bandwidth by passive control means; (ii) improvement of <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance when active control is applied using the compliant actuator. The <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance is compared with the control performance achieved using the well-known vibration absorber and conventional rigid actuator systems. The performance comparison showed that the compliant actuator provided a better flexibility in achieving <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> over a certain frequency bandwidth. The investigation on passive and active control characteristics of the compliant actuator are conducted in relation to the compliant stiffness and damping parameters, which reveal a strong influence of the parameters to the overall passive-active vibration suppression performance. The active control characteristics are analyzed by using the Proportional and Derivative (PD) control strategy which demonstrated the capability of effectively changing the respective effective stiffness and damping of the system. These attractive dual passive-active control characteristics are therefore advantageous for achieving an effective <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> system, particularly for <b>controlling</b> the <b>vibration</b> over a specific wide frequency bandwidth. The optimization strategy for determining the parameters of a compliant actuator to achieve effective <b>control</b> of <b>vibration</b> transmissibility is also investigated. An optimization strategy for the compliant actuator system is proposed by minimizing the H 2 norm of the transfer function associated with the force transmissibility of the system, while the active control performance is investigated by using the derivative-type controller. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy is demonstrated by comparison of various compliant actuator systems and the conventional rigid actuator system. It is shown that the overall passive-active <b>control</b> <b>vibration</b> performance can be improved satisfactorily. The investigation on control stability performance of the compliant actuator is also performed. The results show that the compliant actuator with varying compliant stiffness offers promising robustness and control stability for <b>controlling</b> <b>vibration</b> for the given control gain used in the system. The development of a vehicle <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> system by integrating a compliant actuator in the existing vehicle suspension system. The compliant actuator is attached to the vehicle body and consists of a servo motor, a compliant element and a set of pinion-rack. A vehicle ride model is developed for the <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance analysis, combining the vehicle suspension system with the compliant actuator model. The investigation results show that the compliant actuator can provide beneficial passive and active <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> characteristics, particularly at low frequency region around the vehicle body resonance. The operational bandwidth of compliant actuator can be adjusted according to the selected compliant stiffness and it has the benefits of protecting the actuator against potential shocks received during vehicle ride. These benefits offer an attractive alternative for the actuator used in vehicle suspension system, compared to the conventional rigid actuator. The active <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> results using an output feedback control demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in reducing the vehicle body acceleration at important low frequencies. The last part of the thesis presents a case study of the proposed compliant actuator. Here, a new design of the compliant mechanism is proposed. Hence, the characteristics of a compliant mechanism are initially investigated using a flexible beam structure, which is deployed in various angle configurations. The co-rotational finite element method is used to model and simulate the dynamics behavior of the compliant mechanism.
