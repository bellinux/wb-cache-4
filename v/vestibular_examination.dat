40|$|Balance {{and spatial}} {{orientation}} complaints are very frequent in the elderly. The aetiology of these complaints {{may be related}} to specific peripheral or central vestibular disorders or to an extravestibular dizziness resulting from impairment or disease in multiple systems. A preliminary diagnostic orientation, permitting the patient to be referred to the most appropriate specialist (otologist, neurologist, consultant in internal medicine, psychiatrist, physical therapist) would be very useful. We examined 163 patients, referred for balance and spatial orientation complaints to the otoneurological outpatient services of 6 university hospital centres in the northern and central Italy, by a detailed questionnaire about characteristics, frequency, duration of any dizziness symptom and by a bedside <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination.</b> The questions were designed to determine whether the patients suffered from true vertigo, considered to be an expression of a vestibular disorder, or of an aspecific dizziness of multifactorial origin. Comparison of the conclusions of the <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> and the diagnostic hypotheses deduced from the clinical history showed a high degree of concordance (Cohen Index 70. 5 %). To the patient, vertigo and dizziness are synonymous. By asking appropriate questions, a clearer picture should begin to emerge from the patient complaints so that distinction between psychogenic, nonvestibular and vestibular causes can be made. The importance of obtaining a good history cannot be overemphasized. A correct and rigorous approach by the general practitioner could be of great utility both for the health of the patient and for the efficiency of the national health service. The <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> proved that about half the patients (80 / 163) suffered from vestibular disorders, mainly of peripheral origin (BPV, Menière's disease, vestibular neuritis) ...|$|E
40|$|Fishing, one of {{the oldest}} {{productive}} activities, is an important sector of the Brazilian economy as well as the world economy. To evaluate the vestibular behavior in population of fishermen. It was realized as a retrospective and cross-sectional study. Thirty fishermen [mean age 49. 5 (± 8. 5) years] whose age ranged from 33 years to 67 years were submitted to anamnesis, otorhinolaryngological evaluation, and <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> through the electronystagmography (ENG). The most evident otoneurological symptoms were: Tinnitus (66. 7 %), dizziness (63. 3 %), and hearing loss (53. 3 %). The most evident clinical symptoms were: Fatigue (36. 7 %), anxiety (23. 3 %), and depression (16. 7 %). There were alterations in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> of 13 (43. 3 %) fishermen in the caloric test. There was a prevalence of alteration in the peripheral vestibular system and there was a major frequency of the peripheral vestibular irritative syndrome (30. 0 %). Conclusion: The otoneurological complaints were frequent in the population studied that verifies the importance of allowing labyrinth examinations and the need for adopting preventive measures related to noise exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), since they can cause and/enhance various manifestations of labyrinthine vestibular impairment that can affect {{the quality of life of}} these workers...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recently, OTOG and OTOGL were {{identified}} as human deafness genes. Currently, only four families {{are known to have}} autosomal recessive hearing loss based on mutations in these genes. Because the two genes code for proteins (otogelin and otogelin-like) that are strikingly similar in structure and localization in the inner ear, this study is focused on characterizing and comparing the hearing loss caused by mutations in these genes. DESIGN: To evaluate this type of hearing, an extensive set of audiometric and <b>vestibular</b> <b>examinations</b> was performed in the 13 patients from four families. RESULTS: All families show a flat to downsloping configuration of the audiogram with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Speech recognition scores remain good (> 90 %). Hearing loss is not significantly different in the four families and the psychophysical test results also do not differ among the families. <b>Vestibular</b> <b>examinations</b> show evidence for vestibular hyporeflexia. CONCLUSION: Because otogelin and otogelin-like are localized in the tectorial membrane, one could expect a cochlear conductive hearing loss, as was previously shown in DFNA 13 (COL 11 A 2) and DFNA 8 / 12 (TECTA) patients. Results of psychophysical examinations, however, do not support this. Furthermore, the authors conclude that there are no phenotypic differences between hearing loss based on mutations in OTOG or OTOGL. This phenotype description will facilitate counseling of hearing loss caused by defects in either of these two genes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Currently, six {{genes are}} known to be {{associated}} with Usher syndrome type I, and mutations in most of these genes can also cause nonsyndromic hearing loss. The one exception is USH 1 G, which is currently only known to be involved in Usher syndrome type I and atypical Usher syndrome. DESIGN: A Dutch family with autosomal recessively inherited hearing loss was examined. Audiometric, ophthalmic, and vestibular evaluations were performed besides the genetic analysis. RESULTS: The hearing loss had an early onset with a downsloping audiogram configuration. Slight progression of the hearing loss was seen in both affected individuals. Compound heterozygous mutations in USH 1 G were found to segregate with the hearing loss in this family, a missense (c. 310 A>G, p. Met 104 Val) and a frameshift mutation (c. 780 insGCAC, p. Tyr 261 Alafs* 96). Extensive ophthalmic and <b>vestibular</b> <b>examinations</b> demonstrated no abnormalities that are usually associated with Usher syndrome type I. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first family presented with nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by mutations in USH 1 G. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of mutations in USH 1 G...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{analyzed}} the phenotype in a 5 -generation DFNA 20 / 26 {{family with a}} novel missense mutation in the ACTG 1 gene (c. 151 G>A) and compared the findings to previous reports on DFNA 20 / 26 families. METHODS: Audiometric {{data were collected from}} the family members of a Dutch kindred with the novel ACTG 1 mutation. Cross-sectional and/or longitudinal analyses were performed on pure tone and speech audiometry data of the mutation carriers. Age-related typical audiograms were constructed. <b>Vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> was performed in all mutation carriers. RESULTS: Overall, high-frequency hearing impairment, most prominent at ages over 30 years, was observed with a progression rate of 1. 1 to 2. 1 dB/y, increasing with frequency. It ultimately resulted in residual hearing. Speech recognition scores remained good at given pure tone average (1, 2, and 4 kHz) levels, but were slightly poorer than those at similar levels in a group of patients with presbycusis. <b>Vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> did not reveal any consistent, statistically significant abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The audiometric phenotype of the Dutch DFNA 20 / 26 family with a novel mutation in ACTG 1 was largely consistent with previous reports on DFNA 20 / 26.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Causes of benign episodic vertigo in {{paediatric}} age include benign paroxysmal vertigo {{of childhood}} (BPV) and {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV). OBJECTIVE: The {{aim is to}} review the clinical, audiological and vestibular findings in a cohort of children with BPV and in a group of children with BPPV and to highlight the differences useful to formulating a differential diagnosis. METHODS: Eighteen children, aged 4 - 9 years, consecutively examined for paroxysmal attacks of dizziness and/or vertigo attacks between January 2002 and December 2002 entered our study. The clinical characteristics of vertigo, presence of triggering factors, family history of migraine, presence of motion sickness, migraine and other accompanying symptoms were considered. Neurological, ophthalmologic, vestibular and auditory functions were assessed. RESULTS: Eight children suffered from BPPV and ten children from BPV. In the BPPV group, the <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> was normal except for the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Liberatory maneuvers were immediately effective in all patients and all remained symptom-free during the follow-up. In the BPV group, the <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> was positive in 3 patients but none had positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver. All patients with BPV have a positive family history of migraine and seven had a history of motion sickness. In all, migraine was present one year before the vertigo symptoms, with a frequency of at least two migraine episodes a month. CONCLUSION: BPV differs from BPPV in terms of family history, clinical symptoms, otoneurological signs, therapy and clinical evolution. BPPV is characterized by specific otoneurological signs, and must be treated with liberatory maneuvers: neither medical therapy nor strict follow-up is needed...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the long-term stability of intratympanic steroids and investigate the ‘real’ impact of sudden {{sensorineural hearing loss}} on patients. Method: A total of 14 patients treated with intratympanic steroids were evaluated by audiometric and <b>vestibular</b> <b>examinations.</b> The modified Glasgow Benefit Inventory {{was used to evaluate}} quality of life changes after intratympanic steroid treatment. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} pure tone average post-intratympanic steroids and at follow up. The general Glasgow Benefit Inventory score was not significantly associated with the presence of tinnitus or dizziness, or with patient age. The change in pure tone average after intratympanic steroid treatment did not correlate with social or physical scores, but correlated strongly with the general Glasgow Benefit Inventory score (p = 0. 0023). Intratympanic steroid administration led to a stable improvement in hearing. Quality of life assessment showed that patients can feel satisfaction regardless of the hearing outcome. Patients who regained a social hearing level expressed greater satisfaction than patients without serviceable hearing. Overall, quality of life improvement was not related to hearing improvement. Conclusion: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss is devastating. Considering the audiological effects alone ignores the ‘human’ perspective. Audiological success can correlate with poor quality of life outcome...|$|R

Study Design Prospective cohort study. Setting National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Kennedy Space Center and Johnson Space Center. Subjects and Methods Fourteen crewmembers of 3 Space Shuttle missions that lasted about 1 week and 18 crewmembers of 8 International Space Station missions that lasted about 6 months were given brief <b>vestibular</b> <b>examinations</b> 1 to 5 hours after landing. These examinations focused on the presence of vestibular and motor coordination difficulties, as well as motion sickness and motion sensations. Standardized tests included the observation of abnormal eye movements, finger-to-nose pointing, standing up from a seated position, postural stability, and tandem gait. Results Unsteady walking and postural instabilities were observed after short- and long-duration missions. Motion sickness symptoms were observed after long-duration missions but not after short-duration missions. The symptom most frequently reported by the astronauts was an exaggerated perceived motion associated with sudden head movements during reentry and after landing. Conclusion The severity of the observed abnormalities would limit the ability of crewmembers during the first 5 hours after landing and increase the time required to leave the spacecraft during this period...|$|R
40|$|Vestibular disorders, by {{inducing}} significant posturo-locomotor {{and cognitive}} disorders, can significantly impair {{the most basic}} tasks of everyday life. Their precise diagnosis is essential to implement appropriate therapeutic countermeasures. Monitoring their evolution is also very important to validate or, on the contrary, to adapt the undertaken therapeutic actions. To date, the diagnosis methods of posturo-locomotor impairments are restricted to examinations that most often lack sensitivity and precision. In the present work we studied the alterations of the dynamic weight distribution in a rodent model of sudden and complete unilateral vestibular loss. We used a system of force sensors connected to a data analysis system to quantify in real time and in an automated way the weight bearing of the animal on the ground. We show here that sudden, unilateral, complete and permanent loss of the vestibular inputs causes a severe alteration of the dynamic ground weight distribution of vestibulo lesioned rodents. Characteristics of alterations in the dynamic weight distribution vary over time and follow the sequence of appearance and disappearance of the various symptoms that compose the vestibular syndrome. This study reveals {{for the first time}} that dynamic weight bearing is a very sensitive parameter for evaluating posturo-locomotor function impairment. Associated with more classical <b>vestibular</b> <b>examinations,</b> this paradigm can considerably enrich the methods for assessing and monitoring vestibular disorders. Systematic application of this type of evaluation to the dizzy or unstable patient could improve the detection of vestibular deficits and allow predicting better their impact on posture and walk.

40|$|Balance {{and spatial}} {{orientation}} complaints, generically defined as "dizziness", are frequent in the elderly. They {{can cause a}} greater or lesser degree of handicap, and be associated with {{a greater or lesser}} degree of cognitive impairment and anxiety-depression symptoms. We examined 163 patients, referred for these complaints to the otoneurological outpatient services of 6 university hospital centres of the northern and central Italy, performing a bedside <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination.</b> The test allowed to distinguish between subjects with specific vestibular disorders (mainly BVP, Menière's disease and vestibular neuritis) and subjects in who the <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> was not significant, and whose dizziness probably resulted from impairment or disease in multiple systems. The evaluation of the degree of handicap, using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, showed that in the former group the physical parameters were significantly impaired with respect of a group of 81 age matched healthy controls, whereas the functional and emotional parameters were not. The evaluation of the degree of anxiety-depression, using the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, showed that all elderly people with balance and spatial orientation complaints present a degree of anxiety, but not of depression, greater than the controls, irrespective of the vestibular or extravestibular origin of the symptoms. The evaluation of the cognitive level, using the Mini Mental Test, showed that it is similar to the cognitive level in the controls when, according to the results of the otoneurological examination, the balance and spatial orientation complaints are due to vestibular disorders, but it is impaired when these symptoms are related to a dizziness of multifactorial aetiology. The presence of comorbidities is also higher in these patients. It is likely that in the elderly balance and spatial orientation complaints not caused by specific vestibular disorders are due to a dizziness of multifactorial origin, both organic and psychic, that can be classified as a geriatric syndrome...|$|E

The study population comprised 20 patients (11 males, 9 females) aged 15 - 69 years (mean 39. 7). Patients underwent a complete clinical and instrumental evaluation before starting and during enzyme replacement therapy. Median follow-up was 51. 5 months (range 25 - 73). Nine patients (45 %) complained of hearing symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus); for six of them the onset and/or progression of the hearing loss were sudden. Vertigo or dizziness was reported by 6 patients (30 %). Audiological evaluation showed a sensorineural hearing loss in 18 ears (45 %; 10 in male patients, 8 in females). The hearing thresholds for 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz frequencies ranged from 10 to 65 dB HL. Hearing loss was unilateral in 8 cases (40 %; 4 in male patients, 4 in females). Also high frequency hearing loss for 4 and 8 kHz was evaluated. No signs of retro-cochlear lesions were observed by means of otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem response. <b>Vestibular</b> <b>examinations</b> showed a functional impairment in 7 ears (17. 5 %, all male patients). During enzyme replacement therapy the auditory function showed some degrees of worsening but no significant changes were observed at statistical analysis. In conclusion involvement of the inner ear is common in men and women with Fabry disease. In this study, a high incidence of cochlear hearing loss was found, which was typically unilateral and showed onset and/or progression by sudden episodes. Vascular or hydropic mechanisms could be hypothesized to explain audiological findings. Vestibular involvement showed a lower incidence and different pattern, thus suggesting that several patho-physiological mechanisms could play a role in determining inner ear damage in Fabry disease. Results obtained show that enzyme replacement therapy may stabilize hearing function; however, further studies on the physiopathology of the inner ear damage are needed...|$|R

40|$|In {{vestibular}} examinations anomalies in the saccade {{and smooth}} pursuit tests {{as well as}} the fixation suppression after caloric stimulation might indicate central lesions in the vestibular system. Additionally, a high gain in the torsion test is suspicious of cerebellar dysfunction. In this study, 141 patients out of 973 had {{at least one of these}} anomalies. For 125 patients we were able to compare the initial findings in the <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination</b> with the final diagnosis by otologists, neurologists and general practitioners. The complaints of 37. 6 % of the patients with these electronystagmographic (ENG) anomalies appeared to be of central origin. Abnormal saccades, an abnormal smooth pursuit, and an elevated gain in the torsion test were not independently diagnostic for central vestibular disease. The fixation suppression index appeared to be lower for subjects with peripheral vestibular disease. Otologists more often referred their patients to a neurologist if the fixation index was elevated.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the nature and prevalence of audiovestibular disturbances in mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC), 32 consecutive MC patients were studied by a wide audiological and <b>vestibular</b> <b>examination.</b> Pure tone audiometry, impedance audiometry, brainstem response audiometry and vestibular function were performed. Patients with a previous history of ear damage due to other well-known agents {{were excluded from the}} study. In MC patients we found a rather frequent audiovestibular involvement (34. 3 %). Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was found in seven MC patients (22 %) and altered vestibular function test values in other seven subjects (22 %). Moreover, anamnestic and clinical data revealed a high incidence of benign positional paroxysmal vertigo in our MC series. We can suppose that immune complex-mediated microvascular involvement of the labyrinthine vessels may be responsible for inner ear damage in MC. Thus, audiovestibular disturbances may be included among various organ involvement of the MC. KEY WORDS: Mixed cryoglobulinaemia, Hepatitis C virus, Audiovestibular disturbances, Cupulolithiasis. THE presence in the serum of one or more immuno-globulins which precipitate at a temperature below 37 °C and redissolve on re-warming is called cryo-globulinaemia [1].

De modo mais especÃfico analisa-se a partir das entrevistas com os presidentes e vice-presidente da ComissÃo Coordenadora do Vestibular (CCV) as explicaÃÃes para as diversas modificaÃÃes implantadas por cada um ao seu tempo e ao seu modo. AtravÃs da fala dos professores elaboradores de provas de Biologia revela-se o impacto causado pelas provas do vestibular e sua repercussÃo nos conteÃdos abordados no Ensino MÃdio. Esta pesquisa, confirma a historicidade do processo de mudanÃas fazendo uso dos documentos do Conselho de Ensino, Pesquisa e ExtensÃo (CEPE) e dos editais de convocaÃÃo dos vestibulares compreendidos entre 1978 e 2007. A pesquisa de abordagem qualitativa adota como instrumento de levantamento de dados a entrevista semi-estruturada e anÃlise de documentos concentrando-se especialmente: nas falas dos presidentes e vice-presidentes da CCV relacionadas com as mudanÃas ocorridas nos vestibulares da UFC no perÃodo de 1978 a 2007; nas contribuiÃÃes dos professores elaboradores de provas de Biologia do vestibular da UFC; na anÃlise documental das provas de Biologia do vestibular da UFC; e na apreciaÃÃo dos documentos oficiais. Destaca-se no texto a capacidade de adaptaÃÃo das escolas particulares Ãs inovaÃÃes propostas pela CCV, e se notifica a pouca visibilidade de iniciativas tomadas {{nesse sentido}} pela escola pÃblica. Chega-se Ã conclusÃo que o sistema de acesso Ã universidade tem uma influÃncia inegÃvel no Ensino MÃdio, tanto no conteÃdo como no seu enfoque epistemolÃgico; entretanto essa ascendÃncia pode ser positiva desde que haja convergÃncia entre o sistema de acesso ao Ensino Superior e os objetivos do prÃprio Ensino MÃdio. Evidencia-se a necessidade da UFC repensar os critÃrios utilizados no processo de seleÃÃo, redimensionando os conteÃdos exigidos e centralizando sua preocupaÃÃo na construÃÃo de uma proposta educativa que forme sujeitos capazes de pensar propor e realizar mudanÃa que transformem o curso dessa histÃria.

This study intends to investigate changes brought {{about in the}} College Entrance <b>Examinations</b> (<b>Vestibular)</b> of the Universidade Federal do CearÃ (UFC) in the last 26 years and its effects in the Brazilian Secondary Education. Specifically, the explanations for several modifications established - each at a different time and manner - are analyzed {{based on interviews with}} presidents and vice-presidents of the Examinationâs Coordination Committee (CCV). Through the speech of the teachers responsible for the elaboration of the Biology tests, the impact of the vestibular exams are revealed as well as the effects in the subjects dealt with in Secondary School. This investigation confirms the historicity of the change process by utilizing documents from the Education, Research and Community Service Council (CEPE) and the Call for Exams Publications from 1978 to 2007. This qualitative research chose a semi-structured interview and document analysis as tools for data survey, focusing especially on the sayings of the presidents and vice-presidents of the CCV related to the changes that took place in UFCâs <b>Vestibular</b> <b>examinations</b> from 1978 to 2007; the sayings of teachers who developed the Biology tests in he UFC Vestibular; as well as on documental analysis of these Biology tests and official documents. In the text, the ability of private schools to adapt to the innovations proposed by the CCV is highlighted and the lack of visibility of these actions by public schools is noticed. It is concluded that the access system to the university has an indisputable influence in Secondary School, both in content and in its epistemological approach, however this influence can only be positive if there is a convergence between the access system to Higher Education and the objectives in Secondary School itself. It is shown that UFC needs to review its selection criteria, resize the contents required and invert the way it contributes with the evaluation process, centralizing its concerns in the construction of an educational proposal that may shape individuals capable of thinking, proposing and making changes that can transform the course of history. ...|$|R
