Many {{methods of}} glottic reconstruc-tion have been {{described}} for patients undergoing <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> to reestablish the glottic integrity. Methods. Fifteen patients with T 2 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis were included in this prospective clinical trial. All patients were treated by <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> with laryn-geal reconstruction by platysma myofascial flap. The surgical procedure and flap design were described. Vocal function was assessed by videolaryngostroboscopy and subjective and ob-jective voice analysis before and after surgery. Results. Complete neoglottic closure and acceptable voice quality were obtained by platysma myofascial flap in all cases. No statistically {{significant difference was found}} between the preoperative and postoperative acoustic parameters. Conclusions. Platysma myofascial flap provides the basic requirements for laryngeal reconstruction with its own favor-able characteristics and also allows complete glottic closure without interfering with respiration and deglutition.

40|$|SUMMARY- Posterior subglottic {{extension}} of glottic carcinoma {{has been a}} contraindi-cation for partial laryngectomy because of {{the proximity of the}} cricoid cartilage. Resection of the upper portion of the posterior aspect of the cricoid is necessary for adequate tumor resec-tion but is complicated by persistent aspiration. This paper presents a method of reconstruction following partial posterior cricoid resection. <b>Vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> is an accepted procedure for glottic cancers that have extended beyond the confines of the membranous portion of the vocal cord. The limiting factor in the decision to perform a partial laryngectomy is often not related to the inability to en-compass the tumor, but to the inability to reconstruct the residual larynx which will maintain respiratory and sphinc-teric functions. The inability to preserve the sphincteric function is frequently the major factor in deciding against a partial laryngectomy. As surgical tech-niques evolve that preserve sphincteric function, fewer total laryngectomies will be required. Vocal cord carcinoma with subglottic extension limited to 1 em and occurring anteriorly, or anterolaterally has been adequately resected by <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> without sacrificing tumor control or functions of the larynx. " Pos-terior subglottic {{extension of}} more than 3 - 4 mm has been a contraindication to partial laryngectomy because of the proximity of the tumor to the cricoid cartilage. Adequate resection would re-quire removal of the underlying cricoid cartilage. Resection of the lateral and posterior aspects of the cricoid cartilage results in persistent aspiration. There-fore, total laryngectomy is required for the avoidance of aspiration rather than for adequate tumor resection. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to pre-sent the results of five patients under-going partial laryngectomy for glottic carcinoma with posterior subglottic ex-tension...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPartial {{laryngectomy}} {{is used in}} {{the treatment}} of laryngeal cancer. Structural alterations of the upper airway arising from partial laryngectomy can cause obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). ObjectiveTo compare the prevalence and severity of OSA in patients submitted to horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> and assess the role of spirometry for these patients. MethodCross-sectional clinical study with individuals offered partial laryngectomy. The included patients were assessed through interview, upper airway endoscopy, polysomnography, and spirometry. ResultsFourteen patients were evaluated and 92. 3 % were found to have OSA. The apnea-hypopnea index was significantly higher among patients submitted to vertical laryngectomy (mean = 36. 9) when compared to subjects offered horizontal laryngectomy (mean = 11. 2). The mean minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation was 85. 9 in the horizontal laryngectomy group and 84. 3 in the vertical laryngectomy group. Spirometry identified extrathoracic upper airway obstruction in all patients with OSA. ConclusionThe studied population had a high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea. OSA was more severe in patients offered vertical laryngectomy than in the individuals submitted to horizontal laryngectomy. Spirometry seems to be useful in the detection of cases of suspected OSA, as it suggests the presence of extrathoracic upper airway obstruction...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. After {{external}} partial laryngectomias, videostroborscopy is very usefull in {{evaluation of}} postoperative phonatory mehanisms showing the “slow motion” of the vibrations {{of the remaining}} laryngeal structures. The aim {{of this paper was}} to compare the videostroboscopic characteristics of the vibration and to establish the differences in the phonation mechanisms {{depending on the type of}} external <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> performed. Methods. This prospective study was conducted during the period 2003 - 2009 at the Ear, Nose and Throat Clinic, Clinical Center of Vojvodina, Novi Sad, including 99 patients with laryngeal carcinoma, treated with open surgical approach using different types of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Videostroboscopy was used to analyse vibrations of the remaining laryngeal structures. Results. The dominant vibration structure after <b>partial</b> horizontal <b>laryngectomy,</b> chordectomy, frontolateral laryngectomy and three quarter laryngectomy was the remaining vocal fold, after hemilaryngectomy it was the false vocal fold and after subtotal and near total laryngectomy it was the arythenoid. In patients with supracricoid hemilaryngopharyngectomy performed, many different structures were involved in the vibration. After most of the <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomies,</b> vibrations can be found in the reconstructed part of the defect. In both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> movements of the larynx during phonation were mostly medial, while in cricohyoidoglottopexies they were anterior-posterior. Most of the operated patients (72. 7 %) had insufficient occlusion of the neoglottis during the phonation. Conclusion. Videostroboscopy is a useful method in examining the phonation mechanisms of reconstructed laryngeal structures after <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> as well as in planning postoperative voice therapy...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Laryngeal {{reconstruction}} {{is needed}} to preserve laryngeal function in patients who have undergone extensive <b>vertical</b> or frontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> However, the procedure remains a difficult challenge. Several reconstruction techniques have been described, but these techniques pose risks of complications such as laryngeal stenosis. This study aimed to evaluate the postoperative course and functional outcomes of a new technique that combined a muscle-pedicle hyoid bone and a thyrohyoid flap during laryngeal reconstruction after tumor resection. Methods: Four patients underwent extensive <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> or frontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for cancer. After tumor resection, laryngeal reconstruction was performed using the proposed technique. Postoperative recovery time, complications, and oncologic results were evaluated. Results: The four patients were successfully treated with the proposed technique. No dyspnea, dysphagia, or death occurred during the postoperative course. Decannulation was performed after a median of 3 days. The average postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. Short-term postoperative functional recovery was normal. No laryngeal stenosis or tumor recurrence was observed {{in any of the}} four patients after a follow-up period of more than 24 months. Conclusion: The combination of the muscle-pedicle hyoid bone and the thyrohyoid flap is a reliable procedure for laryngeal reconstruction after extensive <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> or frontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{goal of this}} {{longitudinal}} study in substitution voice after <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was i) to analyse perceptual and acoustic characteristics related to specific surgery, ii) to determine relevant acoustic measurements to classify voice quality. 30 male patients were recorded at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and 15 male controls. Two perceptual scales (GRB & IINFVo) were compared for relevance mean. Vowel [a, e, i, o, u] identification test was compared to acoustic analysis of the vocalic triangle {{to better understand the}} confusions. Long Term Average Spectrum (LTAS) could measure energy distribution in noisy voices. The first six months can be considered as an adaptation period for voicing features and improvement of breathy voice quality. Overlapping formant frequencies could explain the vocalic perceptual confusions. Voice and speech are better preserved with at least one vocal fold and the remaining of 2 arytenoids for neoglottic closure efficiency...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{surgical}} treatment of {{head and neck}} cancer, primarily laryngeal cancer, causes sequelae and can change the patient's quality of life. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the impact of laryngectomy on the quality of life regarding the functional, physical, psychological, and social aspects. METHODS: Fourteen patients underwent total laryngectomy and 16 underwent <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> The Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C 30) and Head and Neck (H&N 35) questionnaire from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) were used for quality of life evaluation, while the Beck Depression Inventory questionnaire was used for the depression screen. RESULTS: In the total laryngectomy group, reported adverse effects were worsened, social and emotional function (21. 3 %), olfaction and taste changes (85. 6 %), cough (71. 3 %), speech difficulty (100 %), and dysphagia (64. 3 %). Most of the patients (85. 5 %) judged their quality of life to be reasonable. In the partial laryngectomy group, reported adverse effects were worsened, emotional function (71. 4 %), speech difficulty (100 %), and dysphagia (31. 3 %).

40|$|SummaryThe gold {{standard}} {{for the management of}} laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in a previously irradiated patient is “salvage” total laryngectomy, but surgical management by <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> can sometimes be proposed in selected patients. ObjectivesThis study was designed to review the functional and oncological outcomes of patients treated by open <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for recurrent squamous cell carcinoma after failure of radiotherapy or involving previously irradiated tissues and to define prognostic criteria for the selection of patients eligible for this treatment strategy. Materials and methodsIn this retrospective study, 20 patients underwent <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> between 2000 and 2011 for recurrence or second primary stage I or II laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in an irradiated territory (11 <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> laryngectomies; 9 horizontal <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomies).</b> ResultsThe 3 -year overall survival rate in patients with negative resection margins was 66 %, with higher survival rates for tumours confined to the glottis, and the 2 -year local control rate was 67 %. Positive resection margins requiring total laryngectomy were observed in 20 % of cases. The 3 -year overall survival rate was 56 % in these patients. Exclusive oral feeding was restored in 75 % of patients after an average of 32 days. The tracheotomy tube was removed after an average of 18 days in 90 % of patients. The disease-free functional larynx preservation rate was 45 %.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{retrospective}} controlled study was to analyse and compare risk factors for tracheocutaneous fistula in patients who received tracheostomy after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> with those who received tracheostomy for other causes. We enrolled 39 patients with tracheocutaneous fistulas who {{were divided into two}} groups. The first received temporary tracheostomy for supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomies</b> (n = 21), while the control group consisted of patients who received temporary tracheostomy for other causes (n = 18). Risk factors believed {{to play a role in}} the pathogenesis of tracheocutaneous fistula were examined including advanced age, cardiopathy, local infections, radiotherapy, elevated body mass index, malnutrition, decannulation time and aspiration grade. The Leipzig and Pearson scale score was significantly higher in the supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> group (p = 0. 006 and 0. 031 for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively). The penetration/aspiration scale score was significantly higher in the supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> group as determined by univariate analysis (p = 0. 014). The decannulation time was significantly lower in the supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> group (p = 0. 004 and 0. 0004 for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively). The number of surgical closures for tracheocutaneous fistula was significantly higher in the supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> group by univariate analysis (p = 0. 027).

40|$|Objective: The {{therapeutic}} effect of middle frontal {{horizontal partial laryngectomy}} (MFHPL) in treating stage T 1 b squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx involving anterior vocal commissure (AVC) was {{compared with that of}} the anterior frontolateral <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> (AFVPL). The feasibility and practical significance of MFHPL in clinical application was discussed in the present study. Methods: From January 1996 to January 2010, a total of 65 patients diagnosed with stage T 1 bN 0 M 0 glottic laryngeal cancer were treated with MFHPL or AFVPL. The postoperative complications, glottic reconstruction, recurrence rate, voice quality and survival rates were evaluated and compared between two treatments. Results: AFVPL and MFHPL were performed in 34 and 31 patients, respectively. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed that in the MFHPL-treated patients the reconstructed glottis was spacious and symmetric. In contrast, AFVPL treatment resulted in irregular glottic area with poor symmetry and tubular glottis. The incidence of postoperative laryngeal stenosis significantly differed between the MFHPL- and AFVPL-treated groups (P = 0. 025). No significant difference was detected in the 3 - and 5 -year overall- or tumor-free survival rates between two treatments. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and maximum phonation time (MPT) after surgery were 51. 0612. 99 and 12. 4263. 44 sec in the AFVPL-treated group; while in the MFHPL-treated patients they were 31. 8167. 48 and 7. 6561. 98 sec, respectively.

40|$|Persistence or {{recurrent}} {{cancer in the}} anterior commissure (AC) after primary radiotherapy may remain localized to its pretreatment anatomical site. If so, endoscopic CO 2 laser excision, in experienced hands, may achieve complete tumor excision and result in cure for many patients. Occasionally, second and third recurrences may be similarly salvaged by further endoscopic surgery. The use of the vertical hemilaryngectomy is an alternative treatment for similar localized lesions, with a higher first time surgical tumor eradication rate, but with a more protracted hospitalization and a less satisfactory voice and swallowing outcome. In both types of such surgical salvage, CT scanning must demonstrate no evidence of cartilage invasion or destruction. When {{there is evidence of}} minimal thyroid cartilage invasion, then the supracricoid partial laryngectomy is an alternative conservation option, and is likely to result in a cure, with the retention of a voicing larynx without a stoma. When the tumor has increased in size from the original pretreatment dimension and/or site, then imaging must be used to identify possible cartilage invasion, in which case the likelihood of tumor eradication by endoscopic or external <b>vertical</b> <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> is highly unlikely. The indications for the routine use of total laryngectomy for the treatment of recurrent or persistent cancer involving the AC must be reviewed; there is current evidence that cure can be achieved by a less radical procedure.

40|$|Surgery is the {{preferred}} modality for curative treatment of recurrent laryngeal cancer after failure of nonsurgical treatments. Patients with initial early-stage cancer experiencing recurrence following radiotherapy often have more advanced-stage tumors {{by the time the}} recurrence is recognized. About one third of such recurrent cancers are suitable for conservation surgery. Endoscopic resection with the CO(2) laser or open <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> (<b>partial</b> <b>vertical,</b> supracricoid, or supraglottic laryngectomies) have been used. The outcomes of conservation surgery appear better than those after total laryngectomy, because of selection bias. Transoral laser surgery is currently used more frequently than open <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for treatment of early-stage recurrence, with outcomes equivalent to open surgery but with less associated morbidity. Laser surgery has also been employed for selective cases of advanced recurrent disease, but patient selection and expertise are required for application of this modality to rT 3 tumors.

The robotic system allowed for celerity and accuracy secondary to findings specific to the surgical ap-proach, including excellent hemostasis, superb visu-alization of the operative field with expeditious iden-tification of laryngeal submucosal soft tissue and skeletal landmarks, and multiplanar transection of tissues. In addition, {{the use of the}} robotic system also was found to have technical advantages inherent in robotic surgery, including the use of “wristed ” instru-mentation, tremor abolition, motion scaling, and three-dimensional vision. Conclusions: The da Vinci Surgical Robot allowed for successful robotic trans-oral supraglottic <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> in the canine model.

40|$|Objective: Sporadic {{episodes of}} {{aspiration}} may occur after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> To prevent risks of pulmonary consequences, {{a limitation of}} oral intake of food or a "nothing by mouth" regimen has been suggested. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the long-term swallowing and pulmonary status of patients after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy.</b> Study Design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Tertiary University Hospital Policlinico "Umberto I" and Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy. Subjects and Methods: The swallowing status of a selected group of 116 patients who recovered functional deglutition after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> was analyzed during follow-up consultation. Swallowing evaluation included clinical observation, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, and a videofluoroscopy. When aspiration was confirmed by videofluoroscopy, a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed in order to assess the radiological manifestations of aspiration. A group of 45 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and normal deglutition was used as a control. Results: Seventy-nine patients out of 116 showed a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing suggestive for aspiration; only 45 patients had aspiration confirmed by videofluoroscopy. No significant differences in radiological findings were noted in the patients affected by postoperative chronic aspiration compared to the control group. Conclusion: Patients with functional deglutition after supracricoid <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> show a mild and well-tolerated degree of chronic aspiration and do not require a limitation of oral intake of food. © 2010 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation...|$|R

The authors {{report their}} first results on 63 {{patients}} who underwent a <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> for glottic carcinoma from 1980 to 1986. The global three years survival rate is 70 %. The selected operations are the cordectomy, the fronto-lateral laryngectomy according to Leroux-Robert, the reconstructive near total laryngectomy according to Tucker, the reconstructive subtotal laryngectomy according to Majer-Piquet and Labayle. On {{the occasion of}} this paper, a scale is presented for the appreciation of the obtained functional results as for the three laryngeal functions: the breathing, the swallowing and the phonation. The mean time before the tracheal tube removal indicating the recovery of these three functions ranges from 5 days for the cordectomy which is the simplest operation to 38 days for the reconstructive subtotal laryngectomy according to Labayle which is the heaviest. Only one serious post-operative complication is noted for the 63 patients. It is a death following a coma after laryngeal oedema. A <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> is possible after radiotherapy provided the rules according to Biller and Croll were respected...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the effects of the vocal therapy by manual compression of the larynx on dysphonia due to a <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> and compare them with the effects of the standard vocal therapy. The prospective study included 66 patients submitted to any <b>partial</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> type. The patients were randomly classified into two groups: Group I (33) receiving the standard vocal therapy, and Group II (33) submitted to larynx compression vocal therapy. The 6 -week vocal treatment was performed. The treatment effects were evaluated by subjective and objective voice analysis methods. The subjective and objective acoustic voice analysis revealed a significant influence (p< 0. 05) of either of the two vocal therapy modes on initial dysphonia. The larynx compression vocal therapy had better effects on the acoustic parameters: habitual fundamental frequency, mean fundamental frequency, standard deviation of fundamental frequency, maximal fundamental frequency, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{measurement of}} the anterior commissure synechia (S) is a crucial factor worsening voice quality and the perceptual analysis score has a strong correlation to the synechia's impact. {{the aim of this}} study is to correlate the laryngeal configuration regarding the anterior commissure synechia and its relationship with the acoustic vocal parameters. Fifteen male patients underwent frontolateral <b>partial</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>laryngectomy</b> and reconstruction with bipedicle sternohyoid muscle flap for the treatment of T 1 b/T 2 glottic cancer. the patients were free of disease, and the evaluation was performed after a minimum postoperative period of 12 months. Measurements of the anterior commissure synechia and the free border of both the preserved and the reconstructed vocal folds were simultaneously performed with the acoustic analysis of the voice. We calculated the mathematical proportion between the midsagital dimension of the synechia of the anterior commissure and the {{measurement of the}} free border of the intermembranous region of each vocal fold the preserved one and that reconstructed with the bipedicle sternohyoid muscle flap. the acoustic evaluation showed an important increase in the fundamental frequency, and the values of all parameters were changed regardless of the anterior commissure synechia findings. These results suggest that the acoustic voice parameters are always changed because of the aperiodic pattern regardless of the anterior commissure synechia findings.
