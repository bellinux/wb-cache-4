40|$|THE {{introduction}} of new methods for production and {{distribution of electrical energy}} has increased the attention related to problems with power quality and the presence of time-varying frequencies. It has been reported several cases with such problems in isolated electrical systems such as isolated microgrids for incorporation of renewable energy sources and marine <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> systems. The sources and loads in such systems are usually interfaced with power electronic equipment, meaning that there is low or no inertia. The low inertia and the stochastic nature of the generation and loads results in systems that are prone to nonlinear distortions and variations in the fundamental frequency. The hitherto used measurement- and monitoring equipment have mostly been based on average value calculation. The aforementioned problems in isolated electrical systems have made the need of measurement of instantaneous values instead of average values apparent, in order to have monitoring- and control systems with satisfying performance and accuracy. This thesis studies the use of several types of Kalman filters (KF), Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and the proposed method of merging empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and KF for the purpose of tracking instantaneous values of voltage- and current waveforms in isolated microgrids with the aforementioned challenges. Both synthetic signals and real measurements from a marine <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> system were used to validate the methods. The algorithms and methods were implemented in Matlab and Simulink. In varying degrees, the methods did all prove to be viable options for tracking of the fundamental frequency on the marine vessel. The proposed method turned out to be particularly powerful to decompose multicomponent signals consisting of several time-varying monocomponents, and track their instantaneous amplitude and frequency...|$|E
40|$|A new {{controller}} {{to reduce}} the load fluctuations generated by consumers operating in marine power systems is proposed. The controller redistributes the power from consumers that generate load fluctuations to thrusters that compensate for fluctuations. This provides a cancellation of load disturbances sensed by generators. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through simulation studies on a supply <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> plant, using the SIMULINK/MATLAB software package. The simulation {{results show that the}} controller contributes significantly toward improving the network stability and the dynamic behavior of the system under a wide range of operating and weather conditions. This results in increased operational safety of the vessel, extended equipment life, and reduced fuel consumption, exhaust gas emissions, and maintenance costs on the engines...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{current levels}} in {{electrical}} systems are rising due to natural growth in demand, the increasing presence of distributed generation (DG), and increased network interconnection. This rising trend {{is expected to}} continue in the future. Marine <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> systems are highly power-dense and are often safety-critical. Power system protection is increasingly challenging in these systems. Superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs) offer an attractive solution to many of the issues faced. This thesis establishes and reviews {{the state of the art}} in resistive SFCL technology and application knowledge, and provides crucial research-based guidance for the adoption of resistive SFCLs in future power systems. The issues associated with the application of resistive SFCLs [...] -including location, resistance rating, the recovery period, and interaction with protection systems [...] -are demonstrated. The relationship between several resistive SFCL design parameters is established using a generic analytical approach, hence providing a framework for validating SFCL designs. In particular, it is shown that a particular SFCL resistance rating leads to a peak in the superconductor energy dissipation, which generally should be avoided. It is proven that resistive SFCLs have an inverse current-time characteristic, i. e., they will operate in a time that inversely depends upon the initial fault current magnitude. This knowledge is critical for underpinning the operation of a novel protection scheme using multiple resistive SFCLs. The scheme offers several advantages: very fast-acting operation in response to faults anywhere on the system under study; maximum prospective fault currents are prevented from occurring, reducing the duty on circuit breakers; inherent, fast-acting backup; and communications is not required. It is shown that the scheme is suited to highly-interconnected systems with a high presence of DG. The scheme is readily applicable to the design of future utility and marine <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|A PMS (Power Management System) {{controls}} <b>vessel's</b> <b>power</b> {{systems to}} improve the system efficiency and to protect a blackout condition. The PMS should be developed with considering the type and {{the capacity of the}} <b>vessel’s</b> <b>power</b> system. It is necessary to test the PMS functions developed for vessel’s safe operations under various sailing situations. Therefore, the function tests in cooperation with practical power systems are required in the PMS development. In this paper, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator is developed {{for the purposes of the}} PMS function tests. The HIL simulator can be more cost-effective, more time-saved, easier to reproduce, and safer beyond the normal operating range than conventional off-line simulators, especially at early stages in development processes or during fault tests. <b>Vessel's</b> <b>power</b> system model is developed by using a MATLAB/SIMULINK software and by communicating between an OPAL-RT’s OP 5600 simulator.

40|$|Presently, as {{a result}} of the {{technical}} progress, more and more complicated machines are being used in our everyday life.

In this paper we present the diagnostic systems elaborated to support the exploitation of the <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> plant with gas turbines. During engine assembly, the rotating components are mounted with great attention in order to minimise shaft unbalance. However, even while applying the highest standards, factors such as machines’ imperfection or differential thermal expansion cause a small residual unbalance of the gas turbine rotor.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} composition (commercialized catch and corresponding discard) of trawl catches, in seven ports of the western Mediterranean. Discards are defined here as the fraction of the catch from the haul that is returned to the sea by the fishermen, {{because it does not}} have commercial value. A sampling programme on board commercial was performed from June 1995 to June 1996. The hauls were sampled for the collection of the total catch in weight, by species, for the commercial and discarded fractions separately. The factors of stratification considered were in all the ports, depth, with three strata, stratum A (350 m), to which factor for two types of gear in the Porto Santo Stefano or two classes of <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> in Vilanova were added. The results obtained have allowed to characterize the commercial and discards fractions. The discarded biomass always constituted an important fraction of the total catch.

40|$|Harmonic {{distortion}} {{is often}} a challenge in marine <b>vessel</b> <b>power</b> systems due {{to the presence of}} large motor drives containing diode or thyristor rectifiers. Governing standards impose requirements on bus voltage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) which can be demanding to fulfil. An attractive measure to reduce THD is to use 12 -pulse rectifiers, as they are known to cancel the 5 th and the 7 th harmonic. However, the added cost and space of this solution compared with standard 6 -pulse rectifiers is significant. This paper proposes to base propulsion motor drives on 6 -pulse rectifiers, and mitigate harmonic problems by means of power electronic based active filters. A detailed numeric simulation model is developed for evaluating the performance of the topology. A case study system is defined consisting of two propulsion motor drives and two synchronous generators. The active filter greatly improves the bus voltage THD in all defined simulation cases. The performance is also better than a corresponding system using 12 -pulse rectifiers and no active filte...|$|E

We present liquid sodium convection experiments in a spherical vessel, designed to model the convective state of Earth's outer core.
