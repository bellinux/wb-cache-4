25|$|The {{government}} {{expected that}} {{in exchange for}} land the railroad companies would ultimately build a national rail system, providing the capital with its long-sought access to the Caribbean. The banana companies, however, had other ideas in mind. They used the railroads to open up new banana lands, rather than to reach existing cities. Through the resultant land subsidies, they soon came to control the overwhelming share of the best land along the Caribbean coast. Coastal cities such as La Ceiba, Tela, and Trujillo and towns further inland such as El Progreso and La Lima became <b>virtual</b> <b>company</b> towns, {{and the power of}} the companies often exceeded the authority wielded in the region by local governments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Virtual</b> <b>companies</b> (i. e. {{a company}} {{that does not have}} a {{physical}} footprint and exists only on-line) have introduced new elements of risk and trust criteria for Internet users, and consumer concerns surrounding this medium have not been fully investigated to date. This paper examines the privacy concerns that the consumer has when providing personal details when transacting with <b>virtual</b> <b>companies.</b> The paper goes on to explore consumer awareness of <b>virtual</b> <b>company’s</b> privacy policies and seal programmes that were designed to address these concerns. The key objective is to: identify and analyse the concerns of the Irish population in relation to data privacy when purchasing from virtual firms. The researchers have taken a quantitative approach to the research, having developed a survey questionnaire for the purposes of eliciting consumer views relating to privacy concerns when purchasing from virtual firms in the Irish context. A literature review preceded the research instrument development, which consisted of a pilot study and expert advice. The main survey was conducted throughout Ireland’s South East region, in selected cities, and small towns. Results suggest that privacy concerns are high, but conversely, that there is little awareness of privacy policies or seal programmes among Irish consumers. Notably, consumers are unlikely to have read a virtual organisation’s privacy policy despite identified concerns, and this finding is consistent among survey participants. Statistical analysis of the survey findings has given meaning to the results...|$|R
