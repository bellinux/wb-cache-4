40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental measurement of ac 50 Hz flashover <b>voltage</b> (<b>kV)</b> of hydrophobic polymer insulators. Hundred thirty five different testing conditions {{were used to}} evaluate the electrical performance of hydrophobic surfaces of composite polymer insulators. The study of flashover voltages depend on the silicone rubber (SiR) content (%) in Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber, water conductivity (µS/cm), volume of water droplet (ml) and number of water droplets on the surface of polymer insulators. Artificial neural network (ANN) is used successfully to model nonlinear functions which are difficult to model using classical methods. ANN can estimate the values of flashover <b>voltage</b> (<b>kV)</b> for different polymer insulators. The proposed network is trained using different environmental wet condition such as; water conductivity, volume of water droplet and number of water droplets on the surfaces of composite different polymer. After training, the network can estimate the flashover voltage for different inputs. A comparison between the laboratory measurements of flashover voltages and computational results of ANN were convergent. The results obtained from applying ANN show that {{it can be used to}} model the data with accuracy of 96 %. These results prove that ANN can be considered a successful model to evaluate the electrical performance of hydrophobic polymer insulators and predicts the best hydrophobic composite surface that withstands higher flashover voltage under wet contaminated weather condition...|$|E

The applying of radiography machine is intended to diagnoses of disease, which is needed by patient for detecting their sickness. There were measured the X-ray radiations using a simulator computed tomography Scanner (CT scan). The CT scan is the radiology checkup to describe internal body structure by multislice CT scan (MSCT scan). It was observed the influence of expose variations such as X-ray tube <b>voltage</b> (<b>kV),</b> and X-ray current tube (mA) toward Volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) value for investigating using head and body of Polymethyl Methacrylic (PPMA) phantom. Diameters of head and body phantom are 16 and 32 cm, respectively. Radiation output was observed by using a set of CT Dose profiler. Utilization of voltage variations between 80 - 135 kV and tube current between 50 - 200 mA. For the head phantom obtained, the value of CTDI 100 and CTDIVol are 7 - 43 mGy, and 10 - 32 mGy, respectively. This value is greater than CTDI 100 value of 0. 9 - 4. 8 mGy and CTDIVol 0. 9 - 4 mGy by current variations. As for the body phantom, the CTDI values of the voltage variation were also obtained greater than with the current. The high difference indicates that the value of the CTDI estimation using the voltage would be appropriate for an object or solid organs such as bone, while the variation of the current tube is more suitable for object softer organs.

40|$|The {{influence}} of tube <b>voltage</b> (<b>kV)</b> and current (mA) on the resulting relationship of computed tomography number to electron density (CT-ED) was investigated for a wide-bore GE scanner. The {{influence of}} kV and mA scan settings {{were examined in}} combination with a 16 -bit image reconstruction algorithm made available via the scanner software and which allowed resolution of CT numbers for high density materials.

The scanner is also equipped with automatic tubecurrent modulation capabilities. The influence of automatic tube-current modulation on CT number was investigated for a range of materials in a phantom geometry. It was found that tube current modulation has negligible effect on CT number, though the changing dimension of the phantom did influence CT number of an aluminium insert for scans undertaken with both fixed and modulated tube currents. In light of evidence from other studies examining the influence of CT number on dose calculation, it is recommended that scanner settings and specific CT-ED look-up tables be considered when calculations will be required with high-density materials present...|$|E
