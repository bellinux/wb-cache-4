In pure superfluid in the zero temperature limit, three distinct critical velocities were observed with both tuning forks. We discuss the signicance of all critical velocities and associate the third critical velocity reported {{here for the first}} time with the development of large vortical structures in the flow, which thus starts to mimic turbulence in classical fluids.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the interaction between}} superfluid ^ 3 He-B and a micro-machined goalpost-shaped device at temperatures below 0. 2 T_c. The measured damping follows well the theory developed for <b>vibrating</b> <b>wires,</b> in which the Andreev reflection of quasiparticles in the flow field around the moving structure leads to a nonlinear frictional force. At low velocities the damping force is proportional to velocity while it tends to saturate for larger excitations. Above a velocity of 2. 6 mms^- 1 the damping abruptly increases, which is interpreted in terms of Cooper-pair breaking. Interestingly, this critical velocity is significantly lower than reported with other mechanical probes immersed in superfluid ^ 3 He. Furthermore, we report on a nonlinear resonance shape for large motion amplitudes that we interpret as an inertial effect due to quasiparticle friction, but other mechanisms could possibly be invoked as well.

40|$|Immersed {{mechanical}} resonators {{are well}} suited for probing the properties of fluids, since the surrounding environment influences the resonant characteristics of such oscillators in several ways. Quartz tuning forks have gained much popularity {{in recent years as}} the resonators of choice for studies of liquid helium. They have many superior properties when compared to other oscillating bodies conventionally used for this purpose, such as <b>vibrating</b> <b>wires.</b> However, the intricate geometry of a tuning fork represents a challenge for analyzing their behavior in a fluid environment - analytical approaches do not carry very far. In this article the characteristics of immersed quartz tuning fork resonators are studied by numerical simulations. We account for the compressibility of the medium, that is acoustic phenomena, and neglect viscosity, with the aim to realisticallymodel the oscillator response in superfluid helium. The significance of different tuning fork shapes is studied. Acoustic emission in infinite medium and acoustic resonances in confined volumes are investigated. The results can aid in choosing a quartz tuning fork with suitable properties for experiments, as well as interpreting measured data. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
30|$|Pressure sensor {{units for}} oceanographic {{applications}} have been employed {{since the late}} 1960 ’s (e.g., Munk and Zetler, 1967). Various types of pressure transducers have been investigated for obtaining high-quality ocean bottom pressure (OBP) records. These include <b>vibrating</b> <b>wires,</b> strain gauges, capacitance plates, and quartz-crystal resonators. The quartz-crystal resonator transducer is most commonly used at present because of its high sensitivity to pressure, high resolution, and long-term stability (Eble et al., 1989; Joseph, 2011). Devices incorporating the quartz resonator manufactured by Paroscientific, Inc. (hereafter Paros), and by Hewlett-Packard, Inc. (hereafter HP), are currently used as water-depth sensors. In general, the physical pressure measurement is obtained from the vibrational frequency of the transducer, which changes with ambient pressure and temperature. Therefore, thermal effects must be accurately corrected to obtain a meaningful physical pressure value. A built-in thermometer is needed to accurately measure {{the temperature of the}} transducer. The manufacturers provide conversion equations, and tables of calibration coefficients, to calculate an accurate physical pressure value, with a thermal correction, from the vibrational frequency, for the respective sensors. The procedures to obtain the physical pressure value with a pressure-measurement system were introduced by Eble et al. (1989) for the Paros sensors, and by Takahashi (1981 a) for the HP sensors.|$|R
