5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français church for the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E
5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to fill a vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking {{to be admitted to}} Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of a}} Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Monck {{remained}} aloof from the political manoeuvring in London {{that led to the}} brief establishment of a regime under the protector's son Richard Cromwell and after its fall the subsequent contest for power between the army leaders. When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army. After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed {{at the beginning of the}} civil wars. This body, having received some assurances from Charles II, <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> restoration of the monarchy in England and then dissolved itself. This created a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland, but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country. Scottish notables were in a weak position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bill that would reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and {{was signed into law}} by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> UN {{resolution}} condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia {{was involved in the}} UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E

50|$|It {{can also}} be argued that power is more evenly spread out in {{parliamentary}} government. The prime minister is seldom as important as a ruling president, and there {{tends to be a}} higher focus on <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> party and its political ideas than <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> actual person.|$|R

50|$|In Alabama, voters <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> electors {{individually}} {{instead of}} as a slate, {{as in the}} other 49 states. There were 22 electors on the ballot, 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats. Voters could <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> up to eleven candidates.

40|$|It {{is often}} found that {{religious}} people are underrepresented among the radical right electorate, despite radical right parties' claim of being {{defenders of the}} Judeo-Christian society. This study investigates this paradoxical finding and examines to what extent two dimensions of religion - practice and belief - play <b>a</b> role in <b>voting</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> radical right party across seven West European countries. Using the European Values Study from 2008, {{it was found that}} religiously active people are indeed less likely to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> radical right party, because they tend to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Christian party. However, the study challenges the common wisdom that religion alone is a restraint on radical right voting and shows that orthodox believers in three countries - Belgium, Norway and Switzerland - feel more threatened by the presence of immigrants and therefore are more likely than their mainstream counterparts to <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> radical right party...|$|R
25|$|The Republican margin {{began to}} narrow in the 1990s and 2000s {{as the state}} trended Democratic, and in 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county with a majority.
