40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a concept of}} an innovative medical application with augmented-reality support. This work {{is based on a}} cooperation between the Div. Medical and Biological Informatics at Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), and the Department of Photogrammetry and Cartography of the Technical University Berlin. Augmented Reality (AR) is a growing area in virtual reality research. An augmented reality system generates a composite view for the user. It is a combination of the real scene viewed by the user and a virtual scene generated by the computer that augments the scene with additional information. The wide scope of application domains reveals that the augmentation can assume a number of different forms. Therefore, we compare different technologies for augmented reality visualisation with the focus on video seethrough head-mounted displays, optical see-through head-mounted <b>displays</b> and <b>virtual</b> <b>retinal</b> <b>displays.</b> In a further step, we analyse the state-of-the-art of medical applications in augmented reality visualisation. New technologies and methods implemented in DKFZ’s ARION ™ software will enable image-guided liver surgery. It is shown that many tools for preoperative planning of surgical interventions in hepatobiliary and pancreatic (HBP) surgery are available in the clinical environment, while the surgical procedures itself still lack computer assistance. On this basis, Div. Medical and Biological Informatics at DKFZ, the Depts. of Surgery and Radiology at the University Clinics Heidelberg and the research group “AR-work” of Technical University Berlin derived strategies for AR-support of open liver surgery. A technique will be developed in order to superimpose virtual computer-generated information with real patient image data using a see-through technology. The data from th...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{available}} {{screen and}} <b>retinal</b> head mounted <b>displays</b> have insufficient {{field of view}} to fully exploit many {{virtual and augmented reality}} applications. Screen based displays suffer from weight and size restrictions as the image sources, electronics, and viewing optics need to be head mounted. <b>Retinal</b> <b>displays</b> need only the scanning and optical delivery components to be head mounted, but current <b>retinal</b> <b>displays</b> suffer from a small field of view. This paper proposes a novel, non-linear, non-paraxial optical design that enables an ultra-wide field of view display using existing small scan angle MOEMS scanners. A model of the design and estimated specifications is presented. The <b>retinal</b> <b>display</b> has an estimated 100 °H by 90 °V field of view at the pupil of each eye.

40|$|The sequenced genome of the poly-extremophile Exiguobacterium sp. S 17, {{isolated}} from modern stromatolites at Laguna Socompa (3, 570 m), a High-Altitude Andean Lake (HAAL) in Argentinean Puna revealed a putative proteorhodopsin-encoding gene. The HAAL area {{is exposed to}} the highest UV irradiation on Earth, making the microbial community living in the stromatolites test cases for survival strategies under extreme conditions. The heterologous expressed protein E 17 R from Exiguobacterium (248 amino acids, 85 % sequence identity to its ortholog ESR from E. sibiricum) was assembled with <b>retinal</b> <b>displaying</b> an absorbance maximum at 524 nm, {{which makes it a}} member of the green-absorbing PR-subfamily. Titration down to low pH values (eventually causing partial protein denaturation) indicated a pK value between two and three. Global fitting of data from laser flash-induced absorption changes gave evidence for an early red-shifted intermediate (its formation being below the experimental resolution) that decayed (τ 1 = 3. 5 μs) into another red-shifted intermediate. This species decayed in a two-step process (τ 2 = 84 μs, τ 3 = 11 ms), to which the initial state of E 17 -PR was reformed with a kinetics of 2 ms. Proton transport capability of the HAAL protein was determined by BLM measurements. Additional blue light irradiation reduced the proton current, clearly identifying a blue light absorbing, M-like intermediate. The apparent absence of this intermediate is explained by closely matching formation and decay kinetics...|$|R

50|$|A {{projector}} or {{image projector}} is an optical device that projects an image (or moving images) onto a surface, commonly a projection screen.

We demonstrated a dual MLA based EPE that: produced excellent exit pupil uniformity and better than 90 % diffraction efficiency for all three wavelengths in a color display system.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) actuation {{technique is}} developed for <b>retinal</b> scanning <b>display</b> and imaging applications allowing effective drive of a two-axes scanning mirror to wide angles at high frequency.

5000|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>retinal</b> <b>display</b> (VRD), {{also known}} as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal {{projector}} (RP), {{not to be confused with}} a [...] "Retina Display", is a display technology that draws a raster image (like a television picture) directly onto the retina of the eye. The user sees what appears to be a conventional display floating in space in front of them. For true stereoscopy, each eye must be provided with its own discrete display. To produce a virtual display that occupies a usefully large visual angle but does not involve the use of relatively large lenses or mirrors, the light source must be very close to the eye. A contact lens incorporating one or more semiconductor light sources is the form most commonly proposed. As of 2013, the inclusion of suitable light-beam-scanning means in a contact lens is still very problematic, as is the alternative of embedding a reasonably transparent array of hundreds of thousands (or millions, for HD resolution) of accurately aligned sources of collimated light.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in rd 1 and rd 10 models of {{photoreceptor}} degeneration (PD) that inner <b>retinal</b> neurons <b>display</b> spontaneous and rhythmic activities. Furthermore, the rhythmic activity {{has been shown}} to require the gap junction protein connexin 36, which is likely located in AII amacrine cells (AII-ACs). In the present study, an autosomal dominant PD model called rho 1 CTA, whose rods overexpress a C-terminally truncated mutant rhodopsin and degenerate with a rate similar to that of rd 1, was used to investigate the generality and mechanisms of heightened inner retinal activity following PD. To fluorescently identify cholinergic starburst amacrine cells (SACs), the rho∆CTA mouse was introduced into a combined ChAT-IRES-Cre and Ai 9 background. In this mouse, we observed excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) oscillation and non-rhythmic inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) in both ON- and OFF-SACs.

Third, the retina contains imperfections like any natural system and a significant number of <b>retinal</b> neurons <b>display</b> aberrant morphologies or make aberrant connections that are not typical of the population as a whole. Many types of retinal ganglion cells show diverse patterns of tracer coupling, with the simplest pattern represented by the homologous coupling shown by On-Off direction-selective (DS) ganglion cells in the rabbit retina.

An oncogenic protein known to bind to the retinoblastoma gene product (p 105 -Rb) is specifically expressed within retinal cells in this model. All animals that carry this genetic alteration develop multifocal retinal tumors. Midbrain tumors are observed in 15 % of ocular tumor-bearing animals, and these arise ventral to the cerebral aqueduct {{at the level of the}} pineal gland. Both ocular and central nervous system neoplasms are heritable in heterozygous offspring through 10 sequential generations of breeding. <b>Retinal</b> tumors <b>display</b> the gross appearance, invasive properties, light and electron microscopic features, and immunohistochemical staining characteristics of human retinoblastoma.
