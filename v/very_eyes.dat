25|$|All {{this went}} on before the <b>very</b> <b>eyes</b> of the Sikhs which had sent shock waves across Punjab. The issue was {{effectively}} raised in The Akali (Punjabi), published from Lahore by Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri (q.v.), father of the Akali movement and Shiromani Akali Dal. Lyallpuri belonged to Bohoru village close to Nankana Sahib and he personally preached against the supposed debauchery of the Mahant in the nearby villages and also continued to organize the Sikhs for a movement to bring reforms into the Gurdwaras.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} in Hobyo shocked Italian policymakers in Rome. It was the Adwa fiasco of the First Italo–Ethiopian War all over again, and Italy's plans for East Africa were unraveling before their <b>very</b> <b>eyes.</b> Blame soon fell on Governor De Vecchi, whose perceived incompetence was blamed for Omar's rise. Rome instructed De Vecchi {{that he was}} to receive the reinforcement from Eritrea, but that the commander of the Eritrean battalions was to assume the military command and De Vecchi was confined to Mogadishu and limited to an administrative role. The commander was to report directly to Rome, bypassing De Vecchi entirely.|$|E

25|$|In 1328, the {{population}} of the city was about 200,000, which made it the most populous city in Europe. With the growth in population came growing social tensions; the first riots took place in December 1306 against the Provost of the Merchants, who was accused of raising rents. The houses of many merchants were burned, and twenty-eight rioters were hanged. In January 1357, Étienne Marcel, the Provost of Paris, led a merchants' revolt using violence (such as the killing of the councillors of the dauphin before his <b>very</b> <b>eyes)</b> in a bid to curb the power of the monarchy and obtain privileges for the city and the Estates General, which had {{met for the first time}} in Paris in 1347. After initial concessions by the Crown, the city was retaken by royalist forces in 1358. Marcel was killed and his followers dispersed (a number of which were later put to death).|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the <b>very</b> <b>eyes</b> of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. It is a sad fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E
25|$|Thus Fairfax in {{his turn}} {{was free to}} move, thanks to the insubordination of Goring, who would neither relieve Oxford nor join the King for {{an attack on the}} New Model. The Parliamentary general moved from Oxford towards Northampton so as to cover the Eastern Association. On 12 June the two armies were only a few miles apart, Fairfax at Kislingbury, Charles at Daventry, and, though the Royalists turned northward again on the 13th to resume the Yorkshire project under the <b>very</b> <b>eyes</b> of the enemy, Fairfax {{followed}} close. On the night of the 13th Charles slept at Lubenham, Fairfax at Guilsborough. Cromwell, just appointed lieutenant-general of the New Model, had ridden into camp {{on the morning of the}} 13th with fresh cavalry from the eastern counties, Colonel Rossiter came up with more from Lincolnshire on the morning of the battle, and it was with an incontestable superiority of numbers and an overwhelming moral advantage that Fairfax fought at Naseby on 14 June. The result of the battle, this time a decisive battle, was the annihilation of the Royal army. Part of the cavalry escaped, a small fraction of it in tolerable order, but the guns and the baggage train were taken, and, above all, the splendid Royal infantry were killed or taken prisoners to a man.|$|E

25|$|But Lillinonah {{refused to}} eat or drink. Her once lovely face turned sallow {{and she began to}} shrink before the <b>very</b> <b>eyes</b> of her distraught father. As summer waned, the once {{beautiful}} daughter of Waramaug became a pale shadow of her former self, so great was her pain and powerful her will. Finally, although he still regarded marriage between his daughter and a white man as a burden almost too heavy to bear, Waramaug relented. Reluctantly, he consented to the marriage of his beloved Lillinonah to the man she had found lost in the woods on that long ago winter's day. Before the marriage could take place, the betrothed couple agreed, the fair young man should return to his own people, {{to let them know that}} he was still alive and well, and to tell them of his plans to wed Lillinonah and live for the rest of his life in the company of the Pootatucks. Both lovers realized that his people would urge him not to go back to his lovely Indian princess. They would remind him that there were plenty of young English women in the colonies just looking for a husband as attractive as he was. What right had he to wed a dusky maid from a foreign and inferior race? But he promised Lillinonah that no argument would ever persuade him to break their vow to marry. After one final winter with his own people, he would return to Lillinonah -- in the early spring. Sadly, he took his leave.|$|E
500|$|The {{competition}} between 50 Cent and West, {{when the two}} released their studio albums on the same day, was penultimate {{in a series of}} articles that lists fifty key events in the history of R and hip-hop music, written by Rosie Swash of The Guardian. Swash wrote that it [...] "highlighted the diverging facets of hip-hop in the last decade; the former was gangsta rap for the noughties, while West was the thinking man's alternative." [...] Similarly, according to DJBooth, while Graduation is far from being West's best studio album, it nevertheless is a pretty good piece of work while the outcome of its competition with 50 Cent stands as a historical moment in hip-hop culture: [...] "Graduation isn’t Kanye's best, it's very few people's favorite, but it’s still an okay body of work. He’s literally transitioning into stardom right before our <b>very</b> <b>eyes</b> and attempting to embody that moment in time. Kanye's victory over 50 is the bookmark for when rap changed, it was no longer ran by the gangsters, the doors opened for Drake, Kid Cudi and J. Cole. Graduation is a monument, a hip-hop treasure, a Kanye classic." ...|$|E
