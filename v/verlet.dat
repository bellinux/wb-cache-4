40|$|Typical Hamiltonian liquids display {{exponential}} "Lyapunov instability", {{also called}} "sensitive dependence on initial conditions". Although Hamilton's equations are thoroughly time-reversible, the {{forward and backward}} Lyapunov instabilities can differ, qualitatively. In numerical work, the expected forward/backward pairing of Lyapunov exponents is also occasionally violated. To illustrate, we consider many-body inelastic collisions in two space dimensions. Two mirror-image colliding crystallites can either bounce, or not, giving rise to a single liquid drop, or to several smaller droplets, depending upon the initial kinetic energy and the interparticle forces. The difference between the forward and backward evolutionary instabilities of these problems can be correlated with dissipation and with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Accordingly, these asymmetric stabilities of Hamilton's equations can provide an "Arrow of Time". We illustrate these facts for two small crystallites colliding {{so as to make}} a warm liquid. We use a specially-symmetrized form of Levesque and <b>Verlet's</b> bit-reversible Leapfrog integrator. We analyze trajectories over millions of collisions with several equally-spaced time reversals.

40|$|Strong shockwaves {{generate}} entropy {{quickly and}} locally. The Newton-Hamilton equations of motion, which underly the dynamics, are perfectly time-reversible. How do they generate the irreversible shock entropy? What are {{the symptoms of}} this irreversibility? We investigate these questions using Levesque and <b>Verlet's</b> bit-reversible algorithm. In this way we can generate an entirely imaginary past consistent with the irreversibility observed in the present. We use Runge-Kutta integration to analyze the local Lyapunov instability of the forward and backward processes so as to identify those particles most intimately connected with the irreversibility described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Despite the perfect time symmetry of the particle trajectories, the fully-converged vectors associated with the largest Lyapunov exponents, forward and backward in time, are qualitatively different. The vectors display a time-symmetry breaking equivalent to Time's Arrow. That is, in autonomous Hamiltonian shockwaves the largest local Lyapunov exponents, forward and backward in time, are quite different.

40|$|Hamiltonian trajectories are {{strictly}} time-reversible. Any time series of Hamiltonian coordinates {q} satisfying Hamilton's motion equations will likewise satisfy them when played "backwards", with the corresponding momenta changing signs : {+p} [...] > {-p}. Here we adopt Levesque and <b>Verlet's</b> precisely bit-reversible motion algorithm {{to ensure that}} the trajectory reversibility is exact, with the forward and backward sets of coordinates identical. Nevertheless, the associated instantaneous Lyapunov instability, or "sensitive dependence on initial conditions" of "chaotic" (or "Lyapunov unstable") bit-reversible coordinate trajectories can still exhibit an exponentially growing time-symmetry-breaking irreversibility. Surprisingly, the positive and negative exponents, as well as the forward and backward Lyapunov spectra, are usually not closely related, and so give four differing topological measures of "local" chaos. We have demonstrated this symmetry breaking for fluid shockwaves, for free expansions, and for chaotic molecular collisions. Here we illustrate and discuss this time-symmetry breaking for three statistical-mechanical systems, [1] a minimal (but still chaotic) one-body "cell model" with a four-dimensional phase space; [2] relatively small colliding crystallites, for which the whole Lyapunov spectrum is accessible; [3] a near-continuum inelastic collision of two larger 400 -particle balls. In the last two of these pedagogical problems the two colliding bodies coalesce. The particles most prone to Lyapunov instability are dramatically different in the two time directions. Thus this Lyapunov-based symmetry breaking furnishes an interesting Arrow of Time. Comment: 23 pages with 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|Deposition and {{annealing}} of Ni and Cr on a NiO(100) {{single crystal}} was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MD) {{for the case}} of Ni and using XPS and Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (ISS) for the case of Cr. Depositions were carried out near room temperature in ultra high vacuum with base pressure of 2 x 10 - 10 mbar using Ni and Cr thermal evaporation sources. Both XP and IS spectra were taken while the sample was kept at an elevated temperature between 550 K and 680 K {{in order to avoid}} differential substrate charging. Annealing of up to 2 monolayers (ML) Ni deposited on NiO(100) has been reported to result in the gradual elimination of metallic Ni, attributed to oxidation via the substrate. Since the necessary quantity of oxygen is far greater than any possibly available surface oxygen (e. g. adsorbed hydroxyl species) and {{there is no evidence of}} non stoichiometric oxygen within the NiO(100) single crystal, it was decided to investigate the origin of the oxygen species involved. To that purpose, three successive depositions of Ni 0 on NiO(100) were conducted, 1. 6 ML 3. 8 ML and 7. 5 ML. After each deposition and before the next one, the sample was annealed up to 940 K resulting in the complete oxidation of the deposited Nio, with the exception of the final deposition of 7. 5 ML whereby the oxidation was not completed within the time frame of the experiment. Simple kinetic modelling of the oxidation is consistent with oxygen originating from a constant concentration source within the substrate. Modelling of the XPS photoelectron intensities based on particulate films covering part of the substrate surface indicates that annealing leads initially to sintering and then to oxidation of the Ni 0 particles, whereby they are covered by NiO as oxidation proceeds toward the metallic core. Since the experiment cannot provide any more information with respect to the origin of the oxygen, MD simulations where performed in order to investigate the ability of the perfect crystal to provide lattice oxygen to its surface. The Molecular Dynamics simulations were carried out in the constant temperature canonical ensemble using the Nose scheme, with a slab geometry consisting of 1728 ions and applying periodic boundary conditions. The equations of motion were integrated by means of <b>Verlet’s</b> algorithm and with a time step of 2 x 10 - 15 s, whereas a rigid ion potential was adopted for the atomic interactions and the Coulombic contributions were evaluated with the use of the Ewald summation. viii Results are presented for depositions of 8 Ni (0. 06 ML), 16 Ni (0. 11 ML) and 32 Ni (0. 22 ML) ad-cations. The evolution of these systems was followed for up to 300000 time steps at a temperature corresponding to 0. 37 Tm, while the oxygen ions local density distribution function was recorded every 2000 time steps during each simulation run. The simulations show that the perfect crystal can successively form up to 10 % of oxygen vacancies in each layer, which can explain the experimental results whereby 8 ML of Ni 0 where oxidized, without affecting the equivalent concentration of the available oxygen in the substrate and without having to assume any non stoichiometric oxygen inside the NiO(100) single crystal. In order to study the interaction of Cr with NiO(100), which has not been studied systematically so far in the nanometric film thickness range, four quantities of Cr 0, 10 nm, 0, 12 nm, 0, 05 nm and 0, 30 nm, were deposited. Deposition at room temperature resulted in complete coverage of the NiO(100) surface, while annealing at 550 K caused sintering and oxidation of Cr as well as reduction of NiO to Ni 0 while farther annealing at higher temperatures caused the re-oxidation of the reduced Ni. Modelling of the XPS photoelectron intensities based on particulate films, indicated that Cr 0 particles are oxidized from the bottom and finally cover the Ni 0 film produced by reduction of the NiO(100) substrate, however the possibility that metallic Cr mixes with metallic Ni forming surface alloy during the process cannot be excluded. ...|$|R
