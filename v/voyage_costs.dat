40|$|While bigger vessels help {{carriers}} to reduce <b>voyage</b> <b>cost,</b> these savings are increasingly outweighed by higher port and landside costs. Capacity increase only at ports facilities {{to meet the}} demand for bigger vessels, without improvements in ports’ inland access, is not enough for the entire container transport chain to function properly since sea flow generates almost proportional inland flow. Many container ports around the world are involved in development of dry ports to improve their inland access by increased use of rail in order to be more competitive. However, container ports on the east coast of Florida; Port Miami, Port Everglades and Port of Jacksonville, show increase of their container volumes without apparent engagement in development of rail inland access or hinterland expansion. Therefore, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the functionality of these seaports considering their lack of collaboration with inland ports. Interviews with the seaport mangers were conducted to analyse and compare the seaports’ inland access current state and development plans. Competition requires seaports to focus on their inland access but between container ports on the east coast of Florida there is no hard competition; they deal with different markets in hinterland and foreland; all three are heavily in cruise business, and they have no particular capacity issues at their terminals or congestion at the port gates so far. Many seaports tend to expand their hinterland and increase competitive advantage through collaboration with inland ports based on a higher level of functional integration. However, the seaports in the study show functionality without involvement in development of their inland access as long as they don’t face congestion or competition issues...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I have {{assessed}} the impact free competition {{has on the}} productivity, costs and environmental footprint of the chemical tanker freight market. My impression is, after an extensive dialogue with participants of this market, {{that there is a}} general belief that a consolidation between operators in the market, would allow for a more sensible allocation of cargo, and therefore a more productive use of vessels, as well as a reduced environmental footprint. By comparing the current market situation under free competition with a simulated regulated market under a central planner, using the same input data in the two scenarios, I was able to complete a comparative study examining productivity measures (utilization of vessels and port congestion), changes in cost, and changes in CO 2 emissions. Thus, I could ascribe the observed differences to the incorporation of market regulation, as this was the single factor differentiating the two. The simulation of a central planner and the following observations were that utilization of vessels increased, and port congestion, <b>voyage</b> <b>costs</b> and overall environmental footprint decreased under market regulation. In other words, free competition did in fact, based on this assessment, contribute to neither optimal use of vessels nor the lowest possible environmental footprint. However, when that is said, I also shortly evaluated who the beneficiaries of market regulation would be, and examined crucial challenges of implementing a central planner. Though the challenges are many and certainly cause for further research, the most predominant and vital challenge is that of setting the correct freight rate in a non-competitive setting. Assuming that it is possible in an efficient manner to achieve a correct price under market regulation, both ship operator and customers would reap benefits, as free competition in this case, does not cause for the optimal use of vessels and the lowest environmental footprint...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} four main {{areas of interest}} in the functioning of different markets in the dry bulk shipping sector using recent econometric and time series techniques. These areas include; seasonality patterns in freight markets, the efficient market hypothesis and the existence of time-varying risk premia in freight rate and ship price formation, the dynamic interrelationships between freight rate levels and spillover effects in freight rate volatilities, between sub-markets of the dry bulk sector. The seasonal behaviour of' dry bulk freight rates is measured and compared across vessel sizes, contract duration and under different market conditions. Seasonality is deterministic rather than stochastic and it varies across vessel sizes, contract durations and market conditions. In particular, freight rates for larger vessels show higher seasonal variations than smaller ones. Seasonality in spot rates is higher than timecharter rates across the size. Also, seasonal fluctuations are found to be stronger during market expansions compared to market down turns. The validity of the expectations hypothesis of the term structure (EHTS) in the formation of both one and three-year time-charter rates is strongly rejected for all size carriers. Failure of the EHTS is attributed to shipowners' perceptions of risk regarding their decision to operate in spot or time-charter markets. Time-varying risk premia in the formation of period rates is found to be negative; shipowners are prepared to accept lower rates for the relative security of longer contracts. The higher risk involved in contracts with shorter term to maturity are thought to emanate from higher freight rate volatilities, relocation costs, risk of unemployment in spot markets as well as fluctuations in <b>voyage</b> <b>costs.</b> Investigating the dynamic interrelationships between freight rates for different size vessels and spillover effects between volatilities in spot and period markets reveal that the interaction between freight rates in the spot market is higher than in the period markets. It is also found that there is a unidirectional transmission of volatility from larger to smaller size vessels in both spot and period markets. Finally, results strongly reject the EMH in the market for newbuilding and secondhand dry bulk vessels. Failure of the present value model and price efficiency is attributed to the risk associated with holding these assets. Results of Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity in Mean (GARCH-M) models suggest that there is a positive relationship between time-varying risk and return on shipping investments, a result which is consistent with asset pricing theories in the financial economics literature...|$|E

40|$|With the ice cap {{diminishing}} rapidly on the Arctic Sea, {{the opportunity}} of using the Northern Sea Route (NSR) increases correspondingly. However, the climate and presence of ice on the NSR sets additional requirements, which represent an additional investment cost for the ship owner who s potentially willing to use the NSR. These additional investment costs, mainly represented by the ice classification, may be up to 12 % higher on total ship cost, depending on ice class, see Polach, Janardanan, and Ehlers (2012). These estimates are however uncertain, as are many other specifics of operating on the NSR; the degree of ice presence, the future fee cost on the NSR, insurance and additional maintenance cost together with varying operational time on the NSR. Numerous of assessments to determine the potential cost advantage of using the NSR as a transit route have been conducted throughout the recent years. These are, however conflicting in their conclusions and a final {{answer to the question}} is therefore lacking. Therefore, this thesis presents a decision support model (DSM) {{that can be used to}} support and assess the question of using the NSR or not based on own costs and available information. The DSM takes into account amongst others; ice conditions, the vessels parameters and its performance in ice, the operational window on the NSR, the initial investment cost of the vessel, and finally the operational and <b>voyage</b> <b>costs.</b> All these variables are changeable, and therefore the potential user of the DSM can alter them and see its effect on the calculated output, which are, amongst others: the ship merit factor (SMF), the life cycle cost (LCC) and the required freight rate (RFR). In addition to the developed DSM, a scenario where investing in a new ice classed vessel for use on the NSR in the summer season when there is less ice, and navigating the Suez Canal Route (SCR) the remaining annual operational time is presented. Through a brief assessment on the cargo flow between East-Asia and Europe, it was decided to implement the DSM for container shipping, as this is the main traffic on the route which could benefit from the shorter distance provided by the NSR. Based on this decision, how to combine the fixed schedule of liner shipping with the uncertainty of the NSR has been discussed. Here it has been concluded that the best way to combine the two routes for liner shipping is to slow steam the NSR when the ice conditions are favourable. Furthermore, the design requirements for ships navigating on the NSR have been reviewed in addition to the limiting parameters and constraints of the route. These and other special requirements for NSR navigation have been summarized and compared versus the open water requirements of the SCR. In order to implement performance in ice and open water into the DSM, prediction methods for brash ice resistance, net thrust and open water resistance have been studied. These formulas, in addition to schedule, fuel, operational and <b>voyage</b> <b>costs,</b> cargo amounts and other calculations have been implemented in the DSM. With the DSM developed, it has been evaluated through sensitivity calculations to ensure that it behaves reasonable when input parameters are altered. Moreover, two case studies have been conducted, both using the established scenario of using the NSR in addition to the SCR. In the first case study, the performance of a SCR vessel fitted with an ice class and the other requirements needed is assessed for the different ice classes of the Finnish Swedish Ice Class Rules (FISCR). In the second case study, the possibility of optimizing the design of the first case study to fit the schedule and route better, and thus yield more profit, is investigated through the DSM. Under the given assumptions and input used, all the FSICR classed vessels are found to be more profitable using the NSR in the summer season than the same vessel without ice class navigating only the SCR. However, with the profitability declining as the ice extent and thickness grows, the dictating element on NSR profitability is the ice conditions. The 1 A ice classed vessel have been found to be the best alternative of the FSICR vessels, when also taking into consideration the ice capabilities of the 1 A ice class with respect to ice thickness. Results of the second case study show that having an optimized vessel for the specific route and schedule is important in order to maximize profit as the optimized 1 A ice classed vessel show better performance in all calculated results and ice scenarios. The economic advantage of using the NSR under the given scenario is however marginal. And the potential user of the NSR must therefore take into account the additional risk and uncertainty in terms of ice navigation and unforeseen expenses of using the NSR, before making the final decision. With increasing traffic over the recent years, it is well established that using the NSR is technically feasible. Nevertheless, in order to have shipping on the NSR on a regular basis, one must first and foremost have ice conditions that permit safe, economic and consistent navigation. Secondly, there must be a consistent fee system, which does not take away the benefit of the shorter distance in addition to shorter lead-time for booking NSR assistance. With these prerequisites in place, use of the NSR can be beneficial financially and in terms of reduced emissions...|$|E

The examination indicated the fixed costs are US$ 424 per TEU in 2010, with 63. 1 % attributable to bunker costs and 24. 04 % to containership costs. The validation shows the peak of charter hire in 2006, the fixed costs were estimated US$ 637 per TEU, with 63. 92 % attributable to containership costs and 27. 53 % attributable to bunker costs. (for ship of a capacity of 1, 100 TEUs and 28 round trip days). The results proof the proposed equations can represent cost and are helpful for container carriers to maintain market competition...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library Collection for reasons not now known. It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS. Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. A closed, dynamic, mathematical model is used to study scheduling in a two-port system. The model will predict on a daily basis: the amount of cargo waiting at each port for shipment; the status of each dock [...] empty or occupied and if occupied, by which ship; the destination, estimated-time-of-arrival, amount of cargo on board, number of days in port and at sea, and the daily speed for each individual ship. Upon completion of a test case, the model will predict, by ship: the total time at sea and the cost thereof; the total time spent in port including time lost waiting for a vacant dock; the overall <b>voyage</b> <b>cost</b> and the average-daily-cost of each ship. Additionally, the model will predict the total amount of cargo generated for shipment at each port and the maximum quantity it builds up to at any time. The model will predict the cost of warehouse space needed to store freight awaiting shipment by the system. The model will accept any combination of ship size and speeds desired. If required, the model will alter automatically a shjp's established ETA to insure that upon arrival at its destination a vacant dock with cargo waiting to be put on board will be available. The model has the following restrictions: It is limited to two ports. It assumes sufficient stevedore gangs and equipment to permit simultaneous loading and unloading of different vessels in the same port on a 24 -hour basis. There is no distinction between different cargo classes. The model does not provide for cargo delays. The model considers its ships always in service with no time lost for maintenance. The model uses the same fuel-used vs. speed curve in calculating daily fuel consumption for all ships [...] regardless of their size, shape, or type of propulsion. The model uses the same average-daily-operating-cost-figure for all ships. Numerous test cases are studied to determine: (a) the effects of vessel size and speed on scheduling; (b) the benefits of altering a ship's speed to coincide with a vacant dock and c) the advantages of sailing a partially loaded ship to provide a vacant dock for an inbound ship.

40|$|This {{study has}} been made {{with the purpose of}} trying to attain the {{competitiveness}} between container carriers and specialised reefers in offering door-door services for perishable cargo. In order to achieve a full scale picture of the investigated cost chains a number of different analyses and calculations have been performed regarding the door-door cost chain. Two key trades where the NLC group is currently operating have been chosen as basis for this comparison. Still, the intention in this {{study has been}} to find the general benefits/disadvantages regard the chosen mode of transportation, which can be applicable to any trade using a certain mode. A model has therefore been constructed based on earlier studies conducted within the NLC group, relevant shipping theory and new information gathered during interviews and questionnaires. This model computes a comparison between the shipper and carrier looking at the total door-door cost. An indication on the competition in the trade is hereby attained. However most importantly is that the comparison generates an overview of the economical conditions in the trade, i. e. are the trades theoretically making money. The results from this study show that there is a margin in most trades between the cost to produce the service, i. e. carrier cost and the shipper cost. This is only natural however the troubles come from comparing the margins between the container and specialised reefer vessel. These result shows that the container margin in certain trades is almost {{three times the size of}} the specialised reefers looking at competing trades. This does not only indicate bigger revenue but also makes for a buffer towards market fluctuations. Results from the study also show the importance in taking full control of the entire cost chain and not to be governed by strong importers controlling the end of the chain. This is especially true looking at pallets transported under deck where the haulage activity plays a critical scale of balance role, with the possibility of breaking the entire cost chain. A backhaul cost model has also been constructed in order to find the possible effects which backhaul can play on the total round <b>voyage</b> <b>cost.</b> These results show that all investigated backhaul cargo covers the additional cost for the backhaul operation, hence giving contribution to container and ship repositioning. However only live cargo shipped in operating 40 `RHC can pay the full cost for the round voyage. Looking at the general competitiveness between the different transport modes this study does not produce any final conclusions. A tendency can however be noticed towards container lines under the right circumstances tend to produce the door-door service at a lower cost compared to the specialised reefer...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs the United States Navy operating agency for ocean transportation, the Military Sealift Command (MSC) operates {{a fleet of}} tankers to supply the military petroleum needs of Defense Department units around the world. To fulfill Defense requirements, MSC maintains a controlled fleet of approximately thirty tankers that are either owned by the government or are chartered on a long term basis from commercial shipping companies. This thesis attempts to analyze those market forces and cost {{factors that contribute to}} the charter rate structure that has such a significant impact on MSC operating costs. The market forces analyzed are the worldwide demand for oil, the location of refineries, advancing technology, and legislation.
