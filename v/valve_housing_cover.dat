50|$|Owned by the Canal & River Trust, the {{reservoir}} was constructed around 1833 {{to feed the}} Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, which {{became part of the}} Shropshire Union Canal in 1846. Work began on it in 1832, and the canal opened in early 1835. Traffic levels were high, and the company had to buy 2,000 lockfulls of water in the first year, for which they paid £800 to the Wyrley and Essington Canal. In 1836, there was still pressure on the water supply, and the engineer William Cubitt was instructed to enlarge {{the reservoir}} in May. In order to finance the improvements, the Commissioners agreed {{that they would not be}} paid until £20,000 had been spent on the improvements. The enlarged reservoir was completed in 1842. The valve gear which controls the flow of water from the reservoir to the canal is believed to be original. It is housed in a circular gear house which stands in front of a concave brick retaining wall. Both were designed by Thomas Telford, and are Grade II* listed structures. The structure has a cast iron dome, and is a rare example of an original <b>valve</b> <b>house.</b> The reservoir <b>covers</b> an area of 180 acre when water levels are at their highest, but levels fluctuate as water is used for the canal, and the surface area is around half of this figure when the water level is 12 ft lower. The reservoir is fed by a tributary of the River Penk.|$|R

50|$|Clifton Park <b>Valve</b> <b>House,</b> {{also known}} as the Lake Clifton Gate House or Lake Clifton <b>Valve</b> <b>House,</b> is a {{historic}} building located in a northeast area known as Clifton Park of Baltimore, Maryland. It is a massive octagonal stone gatehouse featuring large Romanesque archways that alternate with Gothic style windows that once contained stained glass. It was constructed in 1887 by the Baltimore City Water Department. It also features a turret, atop an intricate tile roof supported by a complicated system of iron trusses.|$|R

The main aim of this thesis work was to analyse the effect of autofrettage on the <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> of the cutting head assembly of a water jet cutting machine. As the stepping stone, a thick pipe, as a typical example of pressure vessels, was employed in order to study autofrettage process and its effects.

5000|$|Clifton Park <b>Valve</b> <b>House.</b> Built in 1887-1888, it {{was used}} to build {{machinery}} used in the operation of Lake Clifton, once {{a major part of the}} city's water supply and was connected to Lake Montebello to the north by a 108-inch underground pipe. Lake Clifton began to be filled and developed in 1962, and the <b>Valve</b> <b>House</b> was no longer needed and eventually abandoned. By 1971, the building was in a serious state of disrepair. Baltimore City owns the building, and recent plans for private restoration have failed.|$|R
50|$|In 1883, the Cincinnati Water Works {{wanted to}} extend its {{efficient}} water supply main tunnel (which had remained incomplete for several years) 185 feet to the line at Gilbert Avenue. This efficient main started at the reservoir in Eden Park. To control {{the flow of water}} {{at the base of the}} steep hill, a <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> was needed. Because the Water Works wanted to enhance the landscape of the park, plus they wanted a structure that would also serve as a new entrance to the park, they felt that the <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> needed to have a special design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the exhaust valve component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of exhaust valve component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> under different preload force, the deformation of exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN. This indicates that the exhaust valve seal well. The sealing and deformation of the exhaust valve component meets the desgin requirement...|$|R

50|$|Balmain {{reservoir}} {{was built}} in 1915 by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, Sydney, and was originally supplied with water by gravity from Potts Hill. The restoration of Gladstone Park and the erection of a bandstand was made a condition of construction of the reservoir. The facility was made redundant by the commissioning of Petersham Reservoir in 1965 and has remained disused ever since. The neighbouring <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> was constructed in 1917 on the Booth Street frontage {{of the park and}} this, together with the footings of the bandstand, can still be seen today. Restoration work on the <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> earned a National Trust of Australia Heritage Award in 2006.|$|R

50|$|Watauga's {{powerhouse}} {{is located}} nearly a mile downstream from the dam, and {{is connected to}} the reservoir intake by a 3700 ft tunnel. Just above the powerhouse, the tunnel splits into two steel conduits that carry the water to a <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> just above the turbines.|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} a bileaflet {{mechanical}} heart valve depends on the absence of persistent flow stases that may cause thrombus formation. Within the <b>valve</b> <b>housing,</b> the only obstruction to blood flow is the leaflets. The leaflet faces are repeatedly washed by blood as the valve opens and closes, but persistent flow stasis can occur at the leaflet pivot due to its size, location and design, as evidenced by recent thrombus-related failure (1 - 3). Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} char-acterize pivot flow of any bileaflet mechanical heart valve design prior to its clinical use (4). Pivot flow analysis is complicated by the geometry of the valve and its pivots. In general, a bileaflet mechanical heart valve typically comprises a rigid annular <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> and a pair of rotatable leaflets (5 - 9) (Fig. 1). Each leaflet has a pair of ears that pro-trude from the leaflet and mate with the pivot recesses in the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> The leaflet is retained inside the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> by the pivots, which control the range of the leaflet movement as the leaflets respond passively to local blood flow pressure gradients. Pivot flow analysis is challenging because the rotating leaflet obstructs visibility, and the complexity and motion of the pivot region result in complex flow that is difficult to measure or simulate. The present study outlines a systematic, detailed method for characterizing pivot flow of the Medtronic ADVANTAGE (ADV) bileaflet mechanical heart valve. This method, which was used during the design process of the ADV, combines both a macroscopic hydrodynamic performance assessment and a micro-scopic flow analysis. The St. Jude Medical (SJM) bileaflet mechanical valve was used as the control in these studies. Address for correspondence...|$|R

25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|R
40|$|The Main {{requirement}} for hydro-electric power plant is {{the availability of}} water in huge quantity at sufficient head and this requirement can be met by constructing a dam across a river. A storage reservoir is formed by constructing a dam across Krishna River. Near {{the bottom of the}} dam, there is a water intake. Trash Racks of 38 meteis long are provided at the water intake to prevent the ingress of floating and other materials to the turbine. A Power tunnel of 720 m long and diameter of 50 feet is taken off from the reservoir to the <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> at the start of Penstock. From the reservoir the water is carried to <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> through power tunnel and from <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> to the water Turbine through pipes of large diameter 6. 10 m made of steel or reinforced concrete, called the Penstock. The shaft from the turbine goes up into the 3 -phase Alternator of capacity 122000 KVA, which produces the power. The water after having done its useful work in the turbine is discharged to the tail race which may lead it to the river. The Srisailam Power plant has the capacity of 7 × 110 MW. To control the water flow so the other alternative governor is Electro Hydraulic Governor - 100. Electro Hydraulic Governor - 100 can operate very efficiently...|$|R
