25|$|Australia was 151 {{for seven}} – {{and the man}} wreaking the havoc was F. R. Brown! That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown.|$|E

6000|$|What profits it to {{the human}} Prometheus that he has stolen the fire of heaven to be his servant, and that {{the spirits of the}} earth and of the air obey him, if the vulture of pauperism is {{eternally}} to tear his <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> and keep him on the brink of destruction? ...|$|R

2500|$|Gavin Semple hailed The Azoëtia as [...] "a very {{different}} type of book; a genuine Grimoire, likely {{the only one to}} be published in modern times; [...] The Azoëtia is a work of breathtaking power and passion, in whose pages magic is restored to its position as the Sacred Art, the Sabbatic Craft is revealed as a living and <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> tradition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Independent Theatre Pakistan {{theatrical}} workshops use the art {{of acting}} and storytelling {{as a model for}} creative thinking in general. [...] The company's director, Azeem Hamid in a radio interview to Fifi Haroon from BBC Urdu said, [...] "Teaching creative expressions like theatre {{play an important role in}} building confidence skills, enhancing leadership qualities and empowering empathy to children. Storytelling methods and techniques are <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> to teach a subject much more creatively to a student." [...] The group have collaborated extensively with leading private as well as public educational institutions such as Lahore Grammar School, The City School, Beaconhouse School System, Beaconhouse National University, Institute of Business Administration, Karachi and non-for-profit organizations like Rabtt to promote theatre and literature in Pakistan.|$|E

60|$|Then {{when the}} Worm felt that dreadful terrible stroke driven thus into its <b>very</b> <b>vitals,</b> it roared like a bull in its torments, and it {{straightway}} rolled over upon the ground writhing and lashing {{the entire length}} of its body, bellowing so that those who heard it felt the marrow in their bones melt for terror.|$|R

60|$|The second {{cause of}} our miserable {{state is the}} folly, the vanity, and ingratitude of those vast numbers, who think {{themselves}} too good {{to live in the}} country which gave them birth, and still gives them bread; and rather choose to pass their days, and consume their wealth, and draw out the <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of their mother kingdom, among those who heartily despise them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dora is too good," [...] said Anne. [...] "She'd behave {{just as well}} {{if there}} wasn't a soul {{to tell her what}} to do. She was born already brought up, so she doesn't need us; and I think," [...] {{concluded}} Anne, hitting on a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> truth, [...] "that we always love best the people who need us. Davy needs us badly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes, sir,” {{returned}} other, elevating {{his little}} head {{with an air}} of importance. “I had a small job up at the Judge’s in that way; it was, however, but a trifle to what it might have been, had it gone through the body. The shoulder is not a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> part; and I think the young man will soon be well. But I did not know that the patient was a son of Leather-Stocking; it is news to me to hear that Natty had a wife.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, [...] "but after the {{questions}} I put to him I have no doubt he suspected it. I made many inquiries of him regarding you, your family, habits, and disposition, for this was a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> matter to me, sir, and I am happy {{to inform you that}} he said nothing of you that was not good, so I urged him to keep the matter to himself. I determined, however, that if you continued your morning visits I should take an early opportunity of accosting you and asking an explanation." ...|$|E
5000|$|In The Channel Islands of California (1910), Charles Frederick Holder says of Anacapa: Arid appearing, desolate, wind-swept, Anacapa is withal a {{valuable}} possession to its owner, {{and one of}} the picturesque islands of the entire group. Its strange rocks, moving, passing, intermingling, made a strong impression on my mind, an impression of warring nature, conflicts of wind and rock, of seas eating into its <b>very</b> <b>vitals,</b> of caves that undermine it, and of the old rock fighting for its very life against the sea.|$|R
6000|$|This was a stab {{into the}} <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of one {{under such a}} burthen as I was oppressed with before, and I could not speak to him a word, good or bad, for a great while; but at last I burst out into tears, and said to him, 'Lord! Mr. ----, what must I do?' 'Do!' says he, 'send for the ordinary; send for a {{minister}} and talk with him; for, indeed, Mrs. Flanders, unless you have very good friends, you are no woman for this world.' ...|$|R
60|$|First, the Christians are to gird their loins--to {{cover the}} lower part of their body, which is the most defenceless. That the Roman soldier did with a kilt, much like that which the Highlanders wear now. And that garment was to be Truth. Truthfulness, honesty, that was to be the first defence of a Christian man, instead of being, as too many {{so-called}} Christians make it, the very last. Honesty, before all other virtues, was to gird his very loins, was to protect his <b>very</b> <b>vitals.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you say is}} {{all very}} well {{so far as it}} goes," [...] she told him. [...] "I admit that a life of scheming and {{adventure}} attracts me. I love power. I can think of nothing more wonderful than to feel the machinery of the world--the political world--roar or die away, according to the touch of one's fingers. Oh, yes, we're alike so far as that is concerned! But there is a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> difference. You are only an American by accident. I am one by descent. For me there doesn't exist any other country. For you Germany comes first." ...|$|E
60|$|Either similarity, {{or great}} dissimilarity, is {{generally}} needful for mutual liking. Our soldiers appear {{to get on}} very well with Russians. But only exceptional natures in either country could expect {{to understand each other}} thoroughly. The two peoples are as the halves of a whole; different as chalk from cheese; can supplement, intermingle, but never replace each other. Both in so different ways are <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> types of mankind, very deep sunk in their own atmospheres and natures, very insulated against all that is not Russian, or is not English; deeply unchangeable and impermeable. It is almost impossible to de-Anglicise an Englishman; as difficult to de-Russianise a Russian.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that {{is another}} matter. I fancy {{that in the future}} we have our own very {{definite}} plans about England, and that your information will be <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> to us. It is to-day or to-morrow with Mr. John Bull. If he prefers to-day we are perfectly ready. If it is to-morrow we shall be more ready still. I should think they would be wiser to fight with allies than without them, but that is their own affair. This week is their week of destiny. But you were speaking of your papers." [...] He sat in the armchair with the light shining upon his broad bald head, while he puffed sedately at his cigar.|$|E
60|$|Graddy {{shook his}} head, and, admitting {{that the thing}} {{was out of the}} question, went silently forward. It was all that Frank himself could do to refrain from {{drinking}} the little that remained, for his <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> seemed on fire. Indeed, in this respect, he suffered more than some of his companions, for while those of them who had not charge of the water-kegs and bottles experienced the pain of suffering and hopeless longing, he himself had the additional misery of having to resist temptation, for at any moment he could have obtained temporary relief by gratifying his desires at the expense of his companions.|$|R
60|$|Very heart-breaking are the {{statistics}} now to hand from America about {{the increase in}} smoking. That this fatal habit is also growing in favor in this country every man who uses his eyes must see. What will {{be the end of}} it we shudder to think, but we warn those in high places that if tobacco smoking is not checked, it will sap the <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of this country. Why is it that nearly every young man one meets in the streets is haggard and pale? No one will deny that it is due to tobacco. As for the miserable wretch himself, his troubles will soon be over.|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} the plain they {{observed that the}} heat had opened cracks and fissures in the earth, which omitted a fiery heat. At intervals pyramids of sand arose, which were borne with great velocity through the air, sometimes appearing {{in the shape of}} columns sixty feet high, which moved majestically over the plain. Ere long some of these clouds of sand enveloped them, and they were accompanied by hot winds, which seemed to shrivel up, not only the skin, but the <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of the travellers. The pores of their skin closed, producing feverish heat in the blood and terrible thirst, while their eyes became inflamed by the dazzling glare of the sun on the white sand.|$|R
60|$|Seriously, {{the history}} of modern {{civilisation}} shows that, while we can only trust individualism to make discoveries, we cannot at all trust it to apply discovery without some sort of State check {{in the interests of}} health, beauty, and happiness. Officialdom is on all our nerves. But this is a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> matter, and the suggestion of a Board of Scientific Control is not so fantastic as it seems. Certain results of inventions and discoveries cannot, of course, be foreseen, but able and impartial brains could foresee a good many and save mankind from the most rampant results of raw and unconsidered exploitation. The public is a child; and the child who suddenly discovers {{that there is such a}} thing as candy, if left alone, can only be relied on to make itself sick.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{then got}} in touch with our dead, we proceed, naturally, to ask them how it is with them, and under what {{conditions}} they exist. It is a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> question, since what has befallen them yesterday will surely befall us to-morrow. But the answer is tidings of great joy. Of the new vital message to humanity nothing is more important than that. It rolls away all those horrible man-bred fears and fancies, founded upon morbid imaginations and the wild phrases of the oriental. We come upon what is sane, what is moderate, what is reasonable, what is consistent with gradual evolution and with the benevolence of God. Were there ever any conscious blasphemers upon earth who have insulted the Deity so deeply as those extremists, be they Calvinist, Roman Catholic, Anglican, or Jew, who pictured with their distorted minds an implacable torturer as the Ruler of the Universe! ...|$|E
60|$|For {{such a man}} to be {{harassed by}} a {{mortgage}} upon his homestead was a steady wear and drain upon his vitality. There were times when a positive horror of darkness came down upon him--when his wife's untroubled, patient hopefulness seemed to him like recklessness, when the smallest item of expense was an intolerable burden, and the very daily bread of life was full of bitterness; and when these paroxysms were upon him, one of the heaviest of his burdens was the support of his son in college. It was true that he was proud of his son's talents and sympathized with his love for learning--he had to the full that sense of the value of education which is the <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> force of the New England mind--and in an hour when things looked brighter to him he had given his consent to the scheme of a college education freely.|$|E
6000|$|I {{watched the}} little spurts of flame jet out {{from between the}} writhing pages of my manuscript, watched the sheets coil up in their fiery anguish and start one from another. I helped the fire to the <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of the mass by poking the brittle heap, and at last the {{sacrifice}} was over, the flames turned from pink to blue and died out, the red glow gave place to black, little luminous red streaks coiled across the charred sheets and vanished at the margins, and only the ashes of my inspiration remained. The ink was a lustrous black on the dull blackness of the burnt paper. I could still read this much of my indiscretion remaining, [...] "He smiled at them all and said nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|DEAR COLVIN,--About Keats--well yes, I wonder; I see {{all your}} {{difficulties}} and yet, I have the strongest {{kind of feeling}} that critical biography is your real vein. The Landor was one nail; another, I think, {{would be good for}} you and the public. Indeed I would do the Keats. He is worth doing; it is a brave and a sad little story, and the critical part lies deep in the <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of art. All summed, I would do him; remember it is but a small order alongside of Landor; and £100, and kudos, and a good word for the poor, great lad, who will otherwise fall among the molluscs. Up, heart! give me a John Keats! Houghton, though he has done it with grace, has scarce done it with grip.|$|R
60|$|Tiger fell forward insensible {{from the}} severe scalp-wound inflicted. Next instant the jaguar rose, grasped {{the edge of}} the canoe, and almost {{overturned}} it as it strove to climb in; and {{there is no doubt that}} in another moment it would have succeeded, for the attack was so sudden that Quashy sat paralysed, while Lawrence forgot his pistols, and his gun lay in the bottom of the canoe! Happily, however, he recovered enough of presence of mind to use the lance in his hands. Turning the point of the weapon to the jaguar's mouth, he thrust it in with such tremendous force that it passed right down its throat and into its <b>very</b> <b>vitals.</b> With a gasping snarl the monster fell back into the stream, and was quickly drowned as well as impaled.|$|R
60|$|Thus when in {{the year}} 1821 Don Diego Salvador bethought him that if it paid the heretics in England to import the bark of his cork oaks, it would pay him also to found a factory by which the corks might be cut and sent out ready made, surely at first sight no <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> human {{interests}} {{would appear to be}} affected. Yet there were poor folk who would suffer, and suffer acutely--women who would weep, and men who would become sallow and hungry-looking and dangerous in places of which the Don had never heard, and all on account of that one idea which had flashed across him as he strutted, cigarettiferous, beneath the grateful shadow of his limes. So crowded is this old globe of ours, and so interlaced our interests, that one cannot think a new thought without some poor devil being the better or the worse for it.|$|E
6000|$|Morton {{was glad}} of the interruption, {{for he was}} eager to have his {{understanding}} with Viola before the mother could bring any adverse influence to bear upon her. As they went out into the dining-room, side by side, he found her nearness sweeter and more concerning than ever before; and with a realization of having in a <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> way staked his immediate future upon her word, he was unusually gay, masking his persistent, deep-hid doubt in jocose remarks. Lambert seconded him with quiet humor, and together they caused even the mother's face to relax its troubled lines, while Viola, yielding to a sense of freedom and of youth, shook off all constraint, responding to Morton's unspoken suggestion, thinking only of him and of the secure, bright world in which he dwelt (and in which he seemed so large and so handsome a figure), and in this confidence and comfort they came to the mixing of the salad, which Kate slangily explained to be Morton's [...] "particular stunt." [...] He had fully assembled his ingredients, and was about to approach the actual, delicate blending when the maid appeared at his elbow {{to say that he was}} wanted at the telephone.|$|E
6000|$|My Lords, {{you have}} here also the lights of our religion, you have the bishops of England. My Lords, you have that true image of the {{primitive}} Church, in its ancient form, in its ancient ordinances, purified from the superstitions and the vices which a long succession of ages will bring upon the best institutions. You have the representatives of that religion which says that their God is love, that the <b>very</b> <b>vital</b> spirit of their institution is charity,--a religion which so much hates oppression, that, when the God whom we adore appeared in human form, He did not appear in a form of greatness and majesty, but in sympathy with the lowest of the people, and thereby made it a firm and ruling principle that their welfare was the object of all government, since the Person who was the Master of Nature chose to appear Himself in a subordinate situation. These are the considerations which influence them, which animate them, and will animate them, against all oppression,--knowing that He who is called first among them, and first among us all, both of the flock that is fed and of those who feed it, made Himself [...] "the servant of all." ...|$|E
60|$|It was now {{the middle}} of November, and the rainy season, which extends over {{six months of the}} year, was in full play. Language is {{scarcely}} capable of conveying, to those who have not seen it, an adequate idea of how it rained at this period of the year. It did not pour--there were no drops--it roared a cataract of never-ending ramrods, as thick as your finger, straight down from the black sky right through to the <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> of the earth. It struck the tents like shot, and spirted through the tightest canvas in the form of Scotch-mist. It swept down cabin chimneys, and put out the fires; it roared through every crevice, and rent and seam of the hills in mad cataracts, and swelled up the Little Creek into a mighty surging river.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe though, {{there are}} not so <b>very</b> many <b>vital</b> {{differences}} between 'midgets' and people of the common size; no more, perhaps, than there are between them and 'the Great.' Even then {{it is possible that}} after reading my small, endless story you may be very thankful that you are not a Midget too.|$|R
6000|$|There is {{something}} exceedingly sublime and melancholy in the spectacle which the present crisis {{of our history}} presents. An illustrious and venerable little city--the metropolis of a vast extent of uninhabited country--garrisoned by a doughty host of orators, chairmen, committee-men, burgomasters, schepens, and old women--governed by a determined and strong-headed warrior, and fortified by mud batteries, palisadoes, and resolutions--blockaded by sea, beleaguered by land, and threatened with direful desolation from without; while its <b>very</b> <b>vitals</b> are torn with internal faction and commotion! Never did historic pen record a page of more complicated distress, unless it be the strife that distracted the Israelites during the siege of Jerusalem, where discordant parties were cutting each other's throats {{at the moment when}} the victorious legions of Titus had toppled down their bulwarks, and were carrying fire and sword into the very sanctum sanctorum of the temple! ...|$|R
