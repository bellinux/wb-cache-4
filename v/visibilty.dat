40|$|Abstract. We analyze a {{frequency}} degenerate two-arm seeded downconversion {{process in which}} the seed fields are spatially multimode chaotic fields. We prove that the output state exhibits a transition from entanglement to separability as far as the intensities of the seeds increase, whereas it is suitable for a ghost imaging experiment irrespective of its entanglement properties. Furthermore we present two experiments of ghost imaging with good <b>visibilty</b> based on parametric down-conversion seeded on a single arm. ...|$|E

We {{find that the}} Slonczewski-Weiss-McClure tight-binding model and the Kubo formula reproduce the gate voltage-modulated reflectivity spectra very accurately. This allows us to determine the charge densities and the potentials of the π-band electrons on all graphene layers separately and to extract the interlayer permittivity due to higher energy bands.

We present an algorithm that can estimate the visibility of a high resolution scene from a low resolution 3 D representation. An octree based voxel representation provides a dataset that is easy to process. Voxel occupancy properties ensure a good approximation of <b>visibilty</b> at high resolution. Our system is capable of producing a reasonable solution to the viewpoint placement issue of the Art gallery problem. authorsversio...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} to compute a topologically and geometrically accurate triangulation of an implicit surface. Our approach uses spatial subdivision techniques to decompose a manifold implicit surface into star-shaped patches and computes a <b>visibilty</b> map for each patch. Based on these maps, we compute a homeomorphic and watertight triangulation {{as well as}} a parameterization of the implicit surface. Our algorithm is general and makes no assumption about the smoothness of the implicit surface. It can be easily implemented using linear programming, interval arithmetic, and ray shooting techniques. We highlight its application to many complex implicit models and boundary evaluation of CSG primitives...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} area requirements for drawing s-t hierarchically planar graphs by straight-lines. Two drawing standards will be discussed: 1) each vertex {{is represented by}} a point and 2) grid <b>visibilty</b> representation (that is, a line segment is allowed to represent a vertex). For the first drawing standard, we show an exponential area lower bound needed for drawing hierarchically planar graphs. The lower bound holds even for hierarchical graphs without transitive arcs, {{in contrast to the}} results for upward planar drawing. Applications of some existing algorithms from upward drawing can guarantee the quadratic drawing area for grid visibility representation but do not necessarily guarantee the minimum drawing area. Motivated by this, we will present another grid visibility drawing algorithm which is efficient and guarantees the minimum drawing area...|$|E

40|$|In an {{electromechanical}} which-path device electrons travelling {{through an}} Aharonov-Bohm ring with a quantum dot {{in one of}} the arms are dephased by an interaction with the fundamental flexural mode of a radio-frequency cantilever, leading to a reduction in the <b>visibilty</b> of the interference fringes. However, at finite temperatures time-averaged measurement of the current leads to a fringe visibility which is reduced partly by dephasing of the electrons and partly by a thermal smearing effect. The balance between thermal smearing and dephasing predicted by a calculation depends very strongly on the choice of cantilever basis states used. The interaction between the cantilever and its environment is expected to select the coherent state basis for the cantilever and hence lead to a dephasing rate which is substantially lower than that which would arise if instead the Fock states were selected.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mobile Mapping Systems (MMSs) are {{powerful}} tools for rapidly and massively collecting data in various environments (e. g., rural, semi-urban, urban). Nowadays, ground-based acquisitions are exploited to complement aerial acquisitions for extending GIS databases. Such data are {{of great interest}} for studying environment morphogenesis over the time. For this reason, we present a prototype of outdoor vision system designed for our van-based MMS (StratAG MMS). This system is composed of a mast with stereo-cameras {{as well as with}} frontal, rear and lateral stereo-cameras for providing high scene <b>visibilty.</b> The variety of collected images can then contribute to broaden and diversify many activities in mobile mapping (e. g., road surface analysis, 3 D city modeling [1 - 3], scene visualization, autonomous navigation, social and behavorial analysis). Furthermore, we present experimental results obtained by processing images acquired from windshield-mounted stereo-vision cameras. These results show potential processing that could be improved by using better quality images collected by the future outdoor visio...|$|E

40|$|Computing global {{illumination}} in {{a moderate}} time for complex environments and walking through them {{is one of the}} challenges in computer graphics. To meet this goal, a preprocessing is necessary. This preprocessing consists in partitioning the environment into cells and determining visibility between these cells. Most of the existing partitioning methods rely on the Binary Space Partitioning technique (BSP) which can be easily applied to axial environments. But for non axial scenes the BSP has an important complexity of O(n 3) in time to construct a tree of size at worst O(n 2), n beeing the total number of input polygons. Moreover this technique entails a too important number of cells which do not necessarily fit with the topology of the environment. We propose in this paper a model-based partitioning method which can be applied to non axial buildings. It results in a few number of cells fitting at best with the environment topology.

40|$|The {{successfully}} {{usage of}} spaceborne GPS receivers for orbit- and attitude determination {{has in the}} past mainly been applied for spacecraft in near-circular Low Earth Orbits (LEO), e. g. TOPEX/POSEIDON, RADCAL. However, no experience exists of using GPS signals for Spacecraft navigation in altitudes above the GPS (20. 000 km), such as the Geostationary Orbit (GTO). In this context, EQUATOR-S with it`s highly ellipitcal orbit offers a unique possibility in order to increases significantly the experience concerning GPS visibility, signal reception and GPS based navigation. The application of GPS based spacecraft navigation in GEO`s and GEO`s will bring advantages in many aspects. Besides orbit/attitude determination, GPS offers a potential for increasing command capabilities and decreasing ground station support. This will lead to a reduction of mission cost especially for LEOP phase of geostationary satellites. This paper describes first experiences in operating a GPS receiver in a highly elliptical orbit and presents first results of GPS <b>visibilty</b> and signal reception conditions within this orbit...|$|E

The ring orbit studies for Uranus have been particularly fruitful because researchers have been able, through occultations, to obtain data of high spatial resolution (approximately 2 km) {{at the rate of}} 1 to 2 times per year. THe occultation program at M. I. T. involves: (1) identifying the scientific questions that can be answered by occultation events, (2) predicting the zone of <b>visibilty</b> for the useful events, (3) maintaining and improving a set of portable high-speed photometric systems, (4) obtaining the observations, and (5) reducing the data and interpreting the results.
