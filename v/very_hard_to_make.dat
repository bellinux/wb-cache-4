5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting in a financial crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E

Stunt performer Shane Rangi, wearing a motion capture suit, stood on stilts while filming as the Silver Samurai. Rangi's performance was then used to animate the digital character. Hill said the main challenge was creating the Silver Samurai's highly reflective surface, [...] "He's pretty much chrome.

500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made really on home equipment. But it was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E

[...] "What’s happening is, as China holds its currency down, their currencies are moving up and they’re having to work <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure they’re not at an unfair disadvantage with China." [...] Bloomberg pointed out at that countries such as Brazil, South Korea and Thailand sold their respective currencies in the weeks preceding the report to curb gains and support export.

In other words, the Riemann hypothesis is in some sense equivalent to saying that μ(x) behaves like a random sequence of coin tosses. When μ(x) is non-zero its sign gives the parity of the number of prime factors of x, so informally the Riemann hypothesis says that the parity of the number of prime factors of an integer behaves randomly. Such probabilistic arguments in number theory often give the right answer, but tend to be <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> rigorous, and occasionally give the wrong answer for some results, such as Maier's theorem.|$|E

Trump responded, [...] "Few people take Ron Paul seriously and many of his views and presentation make him a clown-like candidate.

[...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going to love it, It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for."

In a few months, my latest album will be released, and it will showcase a new, yet familiar Nina, which I hope everyone will appreciate." [...] In May, the label's head Kathleen Dy-Go stated that Nina has not yet finished recording the album, which may result the release date to be pushed back to July or August. On May 31, Nina confirmed that [...] "Hagkan" [...] will be included in the album. On July 15, she confirmed that the album will be released by the end of month, and that they were just finishing up three songs. She further stated that her commitment to the album was the reason behind her constant absence in ASAP. On August 5, 2011, Jay R tweeted that he was working on a collaboration song between Nina and Jimmy Muna. On August 16, Nina tweeted her first publicized picture from the album's photo shoot. In September 2011, she confirmed that the album will finally be released by the last week of the month, proudly expressing the time and effort she exerted for it. She also stated that she did not pressure herself during its production, saying that her main goal is to create a different kind of music for her fans and that she does not expect for it to be a huge hit.

2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO.
