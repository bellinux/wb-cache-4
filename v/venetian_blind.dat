5|$|Wilkinson was {{a member}} of the {{freshman}} basketball team at Liberty High School. Using profits from his early business ventures, he purchased a business wardrobe that earned him the title of best dressed member of his senior class. He graduated from high school in 1959, but the poor curriculum there left him without the credits he needed to gain admission to the University of Kentucky's engineering program. He began selling livestock feed in Scottsville, Kentucky, and also worked at a <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> factory while taking classes at Campbellsville College to earn the credits he needed. In 1962, he moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and enrolled at the University of Kentucky. While in college, he worked at Kennedy Book Store in Lexington. Later, he and two friends borrowed money to open the Kentucky Paperback Gallery in Lexington; Wilkinson left school later that year to attend to the business full-time. At the time, Kentucky high school students were required to purchase their own textbooks, but there was no marketplace for buying and selling used books; Wilkinson's business catered to this market and was highly successful.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that the Shang people also wrote with brush and ink, as brush-written graphs have been found on {{a small number of}} pottery, shell and bone, and jade and other stone items, and there is {{evidence}} that they also wrote on bamboo (or wooden) books just like those found from the late Zhou to Hàn periods, because the graphs for a writing brush (聿 yù, depicting a hand holding a writing brush) and bamboo book (冊 cè, a book of thin vertical slats or slips with horizontal string binding, like a <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> turned 90 degrees) are present in the oracle bone script. Since the ease of writing with a brush is even greater than that of writing with a stylus in wet clay, it is assumed that the style and structure of Shang graphs on bamboo were similar to those on bronzes, and also that the majority of writing occurred with a brush on such books. Additional support for this notion includes the reorientation of some graphs, by turning them 90 degrees as if to better fit on tall, narrow slats; this style must have developed on bamboo or wood slat books and then carried over to the oracle bone script.|$|E
500|$|Recruiting animators for Toy Story was brisk; {{the magnet}} for talent {{was not the}} pay, {{generally}} mediocre, but rather the allure of {{taking part in the}} first computer-animated feature. Lasseter said that on the challenges of the computer animation in the film [...] "We had to make things look more organic. Every leaf and blade of grass had to be created. We had to give the world a sense of history. So the doors are banged up, the floors have scuffs." [...] The film began with animated storyboards to guide the animators in developing the characters. 27 animators worked on the film, using 400 computer models to animate the characters. Each character was either created out of clay or was first modeled off of a computer-drawn diagram before reaching the computer animated design. Once the animators had a model, articulation and motion controls were coded; this would allow each character to move in a variety of ways, such as talking, walking, or jumping. Out of all the characters, Woody was the most complex, as he required 723 motion controls, including 212 for his face and 58 for his mouth. The first piece of animation, a 30-second test, was delivered to Disney in June 1992, when the company requested a sample of what the film would look like. Lasseter wanted to impress Disney with a number of things in the test that could not be done in traditional, hand-drawn animation, such as Woody's yellow plaid shirt with red stripes, the reflections in Buzz's helmet and the decals on his space suit, or <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> shadows falling across Andy's room.|$|E

2500|$|Anjelica's decomposing {{body was}} {{discovered}} on July 23, 1991, inside a navy blue cooler along the Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan, New York. The body was so decomposed that identification was at first impossible, as her face was not recognizableshe soon {{came to be known}} as [...] "Baby Hope". She was naked and had been bound with both rope and a <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> cord. She was placed in a fetal position with her hands pressed together. The body was then wrapped in a garbage bag and placed inside the cooler, which was filled with unopened soda cans and water (which was presumably ice at one time). Examiners concluded that [...] "Baby Hope" [...] was possibly Hispanic, had dark, wavy hair in a ponytail, was malnourished, weighing only , was a victim of sexual abuse, and had died on-or-about July 18. She was initially estimated to have been between three and five years old.|$|E

60|$|On {{the second}} day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the attack of a Sperm-Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit, which, {{adhering}} to the fringing fibres of that wondrous <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lips.|$|E
60|$|The bedroom opens {{out of the}} sitting-room; {{and almost}} every bedroom has its bathroom--that all-important adjunct in the East--attached to it.

Each window has its <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind,</b> which answers all purposes of a door, and yet permits the air to pass freely.|$|E
6000|$|The {{only light}} visible, along the whole {{length of the}} building, glimmered through the <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> of the window-entrance to Francine's sitting-room.

40|$|Forty-three {{subjects}} {{worked in}} a private office with switchable electrochromic windows, manually-operated <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds,</b> and dimmable fluorescent lights. The electrochromic window had a visible transmittance range of approximately 3 - 60 %. Analysis of subject responses and physical data collected during the work sessions showed that the electrochromic windows reduced the incidence of glare compared to working under a fixed transmittance (60 %) condition. Subjects used the <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> less often and preferred the variable transmittance condition, but used slightly more electric lighting with it than they did when window transmittance was fixed...|$|R
60|$|This {{luminous}} and mutilated {{vision was}} so ghastly physically that Mr Verloc started {{away from the}} window, letting down the <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> with a great rattle. Discomposed and speechless with the apprehension of more such visions, he beheld his wife re-enter the room and get into bed in a calm business-like manner which made him feel hopelessly lonely in the world. Mrs Verloc expressed her surprise at seeing him up yet.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of the <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind.</b> The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down {{to the foot of}} the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed the}} house twice, and noted with gloom the already {{neglected}} appearance of her front window. The <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind,</b> half drawn up, was five or six inches higher one side than the other, and a vase of faded flowers added to the forlornness of the picture. In his present state of mind the faded blooms seemed particularly appropriate, and suddenly determining to possess them, he walked {{up the steps and}} knocked at the door, trembling like a young housebreaker over his first job.|$|E

60|$|He {{generally}} {{opened his}} shop {{for an hour}} or two every morning and evening. There was a <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> in the upper part of the door, which he threw up when inside so as to admit a little air. And there you would see him, with a green shade over his eyes, seated on a stool, and pounding his pestle in a great iron mortar that looked like a howitzer, mixing some jallapy compound. A smoky lamp shed a flickering, yellow-fever tinge upon his pallid face and the closely-packed regiments of gallipots.|$|E
60|$|Mr Verloc {{deposited}} the cash-box on {{the night}} table, and began the operation of undressing by flinging his overcoat on to a distant chair. His coat and waistcoat followed. He walked about the room in his stockinged feet, and his burly figure, with the hands worrying nervously at his throat, passed and repassed across the long strip of looking-glass {{in the door of}} his wife’s wardrobe. Then after slipping his braces off his shoulders he pulled up violently the <b>venetian</b> <b>blind,</b> and leaned his forehead against the cold window-pane—a fragile film of glass stretched between him and the enormity of cold, black, wet, muddy, inhospitable accumulation of bricks, slates, and stones, things in themselves unlovely and unfriendly to man.|$|E
60|$|The blinds {{were drawn}} {{down and the}} chamber was very dark. A pungent whiff of {{disinfectants}} issued from it, mingled with the dank, heavy smell of disease. The bed was in a far corner. Without seeing him, Girdlestone could hear the fast laboured breathing of the invalid. A trimly dressed nurse who had been sitting by the bedside rose, and, recognizing the visitor, whispered {{a few words to}} him and left the room. He pulled the cord of the <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> so as to admit a few rays of daylight. The great chamber looked dreary and bare, as carpet and hangings had been removed to lessen the chance of future infection. John Girdlestone stepped softly across to the bedside and sat down by his dying friend.|$|E
50|$|Seating was 2+1 armchair-type round {{tables with}} a table lamp and with steward call button. The saloons were {{protected}} from track noise by extra insulation in the bodywork and double-glazed windows with <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> between the panes.|$|R
50|$|The finish work below decks {{was quite}} fancy, with rosewood, mahogany, carvings, gold ornamentation, and paneled mirrors. Some of the cabins had {{stained glass windows}} with <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds.</b> The figurehead was a Native American warrior giving chase.|$|R

60|$|They both {{burst out}} {{laughing}} as gaily as a couple of children. I declare I wished myself one of the party! But no. I had my duty {{to do as a}} respectable woman. My duty was to steal a little nearer, and see if any familiarities were passing between these two merry young people. One half of the open window was sheltered, on the outer side, by a <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind.</b> I stood behind the blind, and peeped in. (Duty! oh, dear me, painful, but necessary duty!) Dubourg was sitting {{with his back to the}} window. Lucilla faced me opposite to him. Her cheeks were flushed with pleasure. She held in her lap a pretty little golden vase. Her clever fingers were passing over it rapidly, exactly as they had passed, the previous evening, over my face.|$|E
60|$|Albinia {{hailed the}} event as a fertile source of {{conjecture}} which might stave off dangerous {{subjects in the}} Sunday call, {{but there was no}} opportunity for any discussion, for Maria was popping about, settling and unsettling everything and everybody, in a state of greater confusion than ever, inextricably entangling her inquiries for Sophy with her explanations about the rheumatism which had kept grandmamma from church, and jumping up to pull down the <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind,</b> which descended awry, and went up worse. The lines got into such a hopeless complication, that Albinia came to help her, while Mr. Kendal stood dutifully by the fire, in the sentry-like manner in which he always passed that hour, bending now and then to listen and respond to some meek remark of old Mrs. Meadows, and now and then originating one. As to assisting Maria in any pother, he well knew that would be a vain act of chivalry, and he generally contrived to be insensible to her turmoils.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this mysterious}} {{sentence}} Mrs. Petty lifted her hands, and muttering the word [...] "Ravin'!" [...] hastened from the room. No sooner had she gone, however, than Blink, whose memory was perfect, rose, {{and going to}} the window placed her forepaws on the sill. Seeing her bone shining on the lawn below, with that disregard of worldly consequence which she shared with all fine characters, she leaped through. The rattle of the <b>Venetian</b> <b>blind</b> disturbed Mr. Lavender from the lethargy to which he had reverted. [...] "Mr. John Lavender passed a good night," [...] he thought, [...] "but his condition is still critical." [...] And in his disordered imagination he seemed to see people outside Tube stations, standing stock-still {{in the middle of the}} traffic, reading that bulletin in the evening papers. [...] "Let me see," [...] he mused, [...] "how will they run?" [...] To-morrow I shall be better, but not yet able to leave my bed; the day after to-morrow I shall have a slight relapse, and my condition will still give cause for anxiety; on the day following--What is that noise. For a sound like the whiffling of a wind through dry sticks combined with the creaking of a saw had, impinged on his senses. It was succeeded by scratching. [...] "Blink!" [...] said Mr. Lavender. A heartrending whine came from outside the door. Mr. Lavender rose and opened it. His dog came in carrying her bone, and putting it down by the bed divided her attention between it and her master's legs, revealed by the nightshirt which, in deference to the great Disraeli, he had never abandoned in favour of pyjamas. Having achieved so erect a posture Mr. Lavender, whose heated imagination had now carried him to the convalescent stage of his indisposition, felt that a change of air would do him good, {{and going to the}} window, leaned out above a lilac-tree.|$|E
40|$|<b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> {{are widely}} used to {{properly}} adjust the amount of incoming daylight for energy savings in lighting and cooling {{and to deal with}} glare for visual comfort. Two computer tools, Radlink in Adeline and DOE 2, have been popularly used for long-term daylighting simulation with <b>venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> because they are computationally efficient and relatively convenient for use. Unlike Radiance, DOE 2 and Radlink simplify the simulation by adopting some assumptions for high computational efficiency. However, the two tools and the assumptions adopted by them for the simulation of <b>venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> have not been fully validated until now. Therefore, indoor illuminances with and without <b>venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> were measured in a full-scale classroom under variant sky conditions, and were used to examine them. Experimental and simulated results show that without blinds, both DOE 2 and Adeline with Radiance can accurately predict indoor daylight distribution, except that DOE 2 gives relatively large errors near and far away from windows. With blinds, the root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured illuminances and those computed by Radlink and DOE 2 are 80 % and 48 % under overcast sky, respectively, and 68 % and 75 % under clear sky. Analysis of the results shows that it is the assumptions used in Radlink and DOE 2 that result in large simulation errors and unrealistic indoor illuminance distribution. It also reveals that any assumption that {{does not take into account}} the different features of daylight passing through blinds in their optical transfer process could result in significant computation errors.
