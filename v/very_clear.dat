5|$|Sirius can be {{observed}} in daylight with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low down on the horizon. These observing conditions are more easily met in the southern hemisphere, due to the southerly declination of Sirius.|$|E
5|$|While {{there may}} have been the {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> recognisable and obviously different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, but is also very popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E

60|$|And {{yet there}} was {{something}} about her which seemed to justify the soubriquet of duchess, which the girls had given to her. She had a certain grandeur about her cap, and a majestical set about the skirt of her dress, and a rigour in the lines of her mouth, which indicated a habit of command, and a confidence in her own dignity, which might be supposed to be the <b>very</b> <b>clearest</b> attribute of duchessdom.|$|R
5|$|Hibiki is the 18-year-old {{protagonist of}} the series. He is granted {{the ability to}} summon demons from Nicaea after {{experiencing}} a train accident {{on his way home}} from taking mock exams. With this newfound power he finds himself intertwined in a battle of survival against the Septentriones who seek to destroy the world. Kamiya did not express any opinions on Hibiki's character. However he was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to point out that despite the series being called Devil Survivor 2, it is not a sequel to a previous series but rather an independent story all its own.|$|E
5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E

5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Service {{forecast}} office in Gray, Maine, operates NOAA Weather Radio station KZZ41 on 162.5MHz {{from the summit}} of Mount Washington. Due to its point as the highest elevation in the Northeast and the frequency range NWR broadcasts on, the station can be heard at very far distances. It has been heard in northwest Vermont (at Vergennes), much of western Maine, and northern Massachusetts (at Dracut and Salisbury, the latter of which had clear reception). Based on the official NWS coverage area map, it can be heard clearly throughout most of New Hampshire, western Maine, northeast Vermont, and portions of southern Canada. During <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> conditions, KZZ41 {{has the potential to}} reach the majority of northern Massachusetts (including some northern areas of Greater Boston and much of the North Shore) as well as the majority of Vermont and Maine.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|We made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> we {{were not}} doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like {{they really wanted to}} know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
50|$|On August 5, Vasco da Gama drew 0-0 with Corinthians in São Januário, Rio de Janeiro. Like {{the first}} match between them for Copa Libertadores, {{the game was}} very truncated, and <b>very</b> few <b>clear</b> opportunities, which {{resulted}} in a goalless score.|$|R
50|$|Today, archaeological and ethnographic {{studies have}} led most {{scholars}} {{to accept the}} view that the pre-colonial population of the Canaries shared common origins with North African Berber tribes from the Atlas Mountains region who began to arrive in the Canaries by sea around 1000 BCE or earlier. However, there is no archaeological or historical evidence to prove that either the Berber tribes of the Atlas Mountains or the Canarian pre-colonial population had knowledge or made use of navigation techniques. The peak of Tenerife is visible from the African coast on the <b>very</b> <b>clearest</b> of days, but the currents around the islands tend to lead the boats southwest and west, past the archipelago and into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R

5|$|Out of the {{hundreds}} of known Psittacosaurus specimens, only one has been described to possess any sort of pathology. The specimen in question, consisting of a complete adult skeleton and tentatively assigned to P. mongoliensis, was found in the lower beds of the Yixian Formation. There is no sign of a bone fracture, but <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> signs of an infection can be seen near the midpoint of the right fibula. The bone exhibits a large round pit, evidence of necrosis {{due to a lack of}} blood supply to the region. The pit is surrounded by a massive amount of swelling along the lower third of the bone. This large amount of bone deposited around the injury indicates that the animal survived for quite a while despite the injury and subsequent infection. As psittacosaurids were bipedal animals, a similar injury to a weight bearing bone in the leg would most likely have been fatal. Unlike the femur and tibia, the fibula is not a weight-bearing bone, so this animal would still have been able to walk to some extent. The source of the injury remains unknown.|$|E

6000|$|If {{ever there}} was an epoch-marking book it was surely Henry Demarest Lloyd's [...] "Wealth against Commonwealth." [...] It marks an epoch {{not so much by}} what it says as by what it silently abandons.

It must be admitted that Lloyd never followed up the implications of this repudiation. He made his statements {{in the language of the}} tradition he assailed, and foreshadowed the replacement of chaos by order in quite chaotic and mystical appeals. Here, for instance, is a typical passage from [...] "Man, the Social Creator".|$|R
