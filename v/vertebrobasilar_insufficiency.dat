50|$|A {{drop attack}} is a sudden fall without loss of consciousness. Drop attacks stem from diverse mechanisms, {{including}} orthopedic causes (for example, leg weakness and knee instability), hemodynamic causes (for example, transient <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> {{a type of}} interruption of {{blood flow to the}} brain), and neurologic causes (such as epileptic seizures or unstable vestibular function), among other reasons.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Cervical {{myelopathy}} {{has become}} commonly {{recognized as a}} complication of rheumatoid atlantoaxial subluxation. A small group of patients with atlantoaxial subluxation may have inter-mittent symptoms associated with change of head position and which are due to vertebral artery compression. Two such cases are reported, one with necropsy findings of infarction in the area supplied by the vertebrobasilar system. The pathogenesis of the symptomatology and infarction is discussed. There are two important neurological syndromes that can arise from rheumatoid atlantoaxial subluxation (AAS). One is a compression myelopathy (Stevens et al., 1971; Smith et al., 1972) which can uncommonly be complicated by acute compression with tetraplegia or death (Davis and Markley, 1951). The other less common syndrome is that of ischaemic symptoms related to <b>vertebrobasilar</b> artery <b>insufficiency.</b> We have recently encountered two cases of this latter syndrome, one of which came to postmortem examination. Pathological re-ports are rare but a comparable case was reported by Webb et al. (1968). This was a 53 year old female with AAS and vertebral artery throm-bosis whose symptoms were intermittent. CASE 1 Mrs. M. H. is a 45 year old lady with a 15 year history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Six months before admission she had one week of confused amnestic behaviour of uncertain aetiology. Since then, she has had repeated bouts of vertigo, as interpreted by a neurologist, without other symptoms associated with neck flexion or head rotation. On the day of admission she fell unconscious and had bilateral clonic movements. In the emergency roo...|$|R
50|$|<b>Vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (VBI) or vertebral-basilar ischemia, {{also called}} beauty parlour {{syndrome}} (BPS), {{is a temporary}} set of symptoms due to decreased blood flow (ischemia) in the posterior circulation of the brain. The posterior circulation supplies blood to the medulla, cerebellum, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and occipital cortex (responsible for vision). Therefore, the symptoms due to VBI vary according to which portions of the brain experience significantly decreased blood flow (see image of brain http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/images/446/brainside.gif). In the United States, 25% of strokes and transient ischemic attacks occur in the vertebrobasilar distribution. These must be separated from strokes arising from the anterior circulation, which involves the carotid arteries.|$|E
50|$|Muscle energy {{techniques}} address somatic dysfunction through {{stretching and}} muscle contraction. For example, {{if a person}} is unable to fully abduct her arm, the treating physician raises the patient's arm {{near the end of the}} patient's range of motion, also called the edge of the restrictive barrier. The patient then tries to lower her arm, while the physician provides resistance. This resistance against the patient's motion allows for isometric contraction of the patient's muscle. Once the patient relaxes, her range of motion increases slightly. The repetition of alternating cycles of contraction and subsequent relaxation help the treated muscle improve its range of motion. Muscle energy techniques are contraindicated in patients with fractures, crush injuries, dislocations, joint instability, severe muscle spasms or strains, severe osteoporosis, severe whiplash injury, <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> severe illness, and recent surgery.|$|E
50|$|A {{persistent}} trigeminal artery {{is associated}} with an increased risk of aneurysm, though some studies have suggested that this finding may be an effect of selection bias, as most individuals do not undergo the tests necessary to identify the condition. Persistent trigeminal artery has been identified as a rare cause of trigeminal neuralgia, with 2.2% prevalence of persistent trigeminal artery among trigeminal neuralgia patients. Surgery to move the persistent trigeminal artery away from the trigeminal nerve has been successful in treating the trigeminal neuralgia in some cases. In some cases, presence of a persistent trigeminal artery concurs with hypoplasia of the basilar artery, in which case the internal carotid artery is responsible for most blood flow to the upper pons, cerebellum, midbrain, and parts of the temporal and occipital lobes, meaning that anything disrupting blood flow in the internal carotid artery could lead to ischemia in these regions. In addition, persistent trigeminal artery has been associated with <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> brainstem ischemia, and carotid cavernous fistulae.|$|E

Fourteen of the lesions were located in the left side; 15 patients had a subclavian steal syndrome. The indications for treatment were <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (n = 7); arm claudication (n = 5); <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and upper-limb ischemia (n = 3); protection of a left internal mammary artery coronary bypass (n = 1); and an isolated subclavian steal syndrome (n = 1). A total of 23 stents were implanted in 17 patients; in 1 patient, 2 stents migrated during deployment, resulting in a 94 % procedural success rate. One case of axillary thrombosis was successfully treated with local thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty. There were no postprocedural neurologic complications or deaths.

40|$|The subclavian steal {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by a}} subclavian artery stenosis located proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery. In this case, the subclavian artery steals reverse-flow blood from the vertebrobasilar artery circulation to supply the arm during exertion, resulting in <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> As the vertebrobasilar arterial system feeds both the peripheral and central auditory and vestibular systems, in subclavian {{steal syndrome}}, neurotological symptoms are expected because of the <b>vertebrobasilar</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> In this report, we describe three patients suffering from {{subclavian steal syndrome}}, who presented with isolated dizziness, recurrent vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. In two of the three cases, a positional nystagmus was detected, which was vertical in two. Abnormal saccades were documented in one, and the auditory brainstem responses were pathological in all three patients; the caloric response was reduced in only one case. Upon magnetic resonance imaging, ischaemic lesions were observed in two patients, in the brainstem and in the hemispheres, respectively. These findings suggest that the central auditory and vestibular system {{is more likely to be}} involved in the pathogenesis of neurotological symptoms in subclavian steal syndrome.
