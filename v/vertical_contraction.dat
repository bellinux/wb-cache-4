Lordosis contractions, consisting of an elongation of the dams body, are observed beginning several hours prior to neonate births, whereas <b>vertical</b> <b>contractions,</b> repeated rapid lifts of the abdomen, occur immediately preceding {{the birth of}} each neonate. We analyzed underlying changes in intrauterine pressure (IUP) using a telemetric sensor that we modified for use in freely-moving rats.

A small telemetric blood pressure sensor was fitted within a fluid-filled balloon, similar in size to a full term rat fetus. On Gestational day 19 of the rats' 22 -day pregnancy, a unit was surgically implanted within the uterus. The dams were simultaneously videotaped, enabling us to directly correlate IUP signals with behavioral expressions of labor contractions.

For a class of planar self-affine sets we show that if the horizontal contraction lies in a certain parameter space and the <b>vertical</b> <b>contractions</b> are sufficiently close to 1, then every nontrivial vertical fibre contains an interval.

40|$|We {{carried out}} {{three-dimensional}} global resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the cooling instability in optically thin hot black hole accretion flows by assuming bremsstrahlung cooling. General relativistic effects are simulated {{by using the}} pseudo-Newtonian potential. Cooling instability grows when {{the density of the}} accretion disk becomes sufficiently large. We found that as the instability grows the accretion flow changes from an optically thin, hot, gas pressure-supported state (low/hard state) to a cooler, magnetically supported, quasi-steady state. During this transition, magnetic pressure exceeds the gas pressure because the disk shrinks in the vertical direction almost conserving the toroidal magnetic flux. Since further <b>vertical</b> <b>contraction</b> of the disk is suppressed by magnetic pressure, the cool disk stays in an optically thin, spectrally hard state. In the magnetically supported disk, the heating rate balances with the radiative cooling rate. The magnetically supported disk exists for time scale – 2 – much longer than the thermal time scale and comparable to the accretion time scale. We examined the stability of the magnetically supported disk analytically, assuming that the toroidal magnetic flux is conserved, and found it thermally and secularly stable.

Three stages can be distinguished in breach flows. Stage 1 initiates when the embankment starts to overflow and is characterized by flows over the embankment crest and down the landside slope. Stage 2 initiates when the landside slope has retreated towards the waterside slope. The hydraulic head increases rapidly and the flow contracts both horizontally and vertically resulting in a fully 3 -dimensional flow.

This idea fundamentally challenges established ways of financing and organising delivery of elder care services in Sweden.

40|$|For highly non-planar {{lifting systems}} like the box wing, induced drag {{predictions}} based on common potential-flow methods can have limited accuracy. This is primarily {{related to the}} linear, fixed-wake surrogate models, which neglect the correlation of the effective height-to-span ratio and system angle of attack or insufficiently account for free-wake deformations such as deflection and roll-up effects. Dependent on the vertical and horizontal wing arrangement of simplified box wing and biplane configurations and the system angle of attack, the present research analyses the unknown impact of wake model effects, investigates the accuracy of potential-flow induced drag predictions against an Euler-flow reference and explores the influence of higher-order wake effects. The computational expense of considered methodologies is assessed to evaluate their applicability within an aerodynamic design and optimization methodology for highly non-planar lifting systems. Under certain conditions, higher-order wake and wake surrogate effects are confirmed to impact on the induced drag prediction. The body-fixed wake model is found generally inappropriate for induced drag estimation of present lifting systems, whereas the freestream-fixed wake model provides consistent results. Positive-staggered systems at positive angels of attack are found particularly prone to higher-order wake effects, due to the <b>vertical</b> <b>contraction</b> of wake trajectories, which leads to smaller effective height-to-span ratios than compared with negative stagger and thus closer interactions between trailing wakes and lifting surfaces.

40|$|A {{bridge over}} the Middle Fork Feather River in {{northern}} California has avulsed from a channel realignment project constructed {{at the time the}} bridge was built and has readopted its historic streambed and flow path. As a result, the flow now enters the bridge at a strong angle and causes excessive backwater and deep scour at one of the piers. The bridge was determined to be scour critical based on the resulting combination of <b>vertical</b> <b>contraction</b> scour and the local pier scour. To mitigate this scour critical condition, a rock mattress consisting of 1 Ton rock over filter fabric was placed around one of the piers in 2011. However, design of the rock mattress did not consider the increase in flow velocity and shear stress under the structure caused by the flow separation below the superstructure from the <b>vertical</b> <b>contraction</b> of the flow. Current design methodologies and scour evaluation procedures do not provide a clear means to analyze when the rocks might become displaced and, hence, further advanced computational mechanics techniques are required to assess the rock stability and, thereby, ascertain the current scour vulnerability of the bridge. From the computational mechanics point of view the analysis of riprap stability can be considered a Fluid Structure interaction (FSI) problem. FSI problems involve solving for the fluid flow force on a solid surface, the response of that solid to the load, and subsequently the change of the flow conditions caused by displacement of the solid. Historically computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software used for solving fluid flows and computational structural mechanics (CSM) software used for solving the deformations and stresses in solid bodies were developing independently. In the recent years the developers of both of these types of software groups have been developing additional solvers needed for FSI problems. However, at the moment there is no integrated software package with both highly robust CSM and CFD solvers needed for general purpose FSI software. The current best practice is to couple highly reliable independent CFD and CSM software in an iterative analysis that requires exchange of the data on the common interfaces between the fluid and the solid structure in small time intervals. That way the best features out of two groups of software can be utilized for FSI purposes. The presentation will cover a methodology for coupling CD-adapco’s STAR-CCM+ CFD software and LSTC’s LS-DYNA CSM software applied to stability analysis of riprap rocks used for armoring a pier at Middle Fork Feather River. STAR-CCM+ is capable of solving flow problems in domains containing solid objects with complex, irregular geometry in relative motion along arbitrary paths through the fluid domain. Mesh motion and mesh morphing techniques were implemented in it for handling arbitrary motions of the objects. LS-DYNA software is a general purpose finite element program capable of simulating highly non-linear real world problems in structural mechanics including changing boundary conditions (such as contact forces between rocks that change over time), large displacements, large deformations, and non-linear material property relations. The bathymetry of the Middle Fork Feather River was obtained from a sonar scan of the bridge site. It was numerically enhanced and transformed to CAD format and imported to CFD software as the initial geometry of the numerical model. A rock shape has been laser scanned to represent the real riprap elements. Several coupled simulations have been performed with varying flow conditions to identify failure conditions for the riprap.

40|$|Extreme {{rainfall}} events {{associated with}} global warming {{are likely to}} produce {{an increasing number of}} flooding scenarios. A large magnitude of hydrologic events can often result in submerged orifice flow (also called pressure flow) or embankment and bridge overtopping flow, in which the foundation of a bridge is subjected to severe scour at the sediment bed. This phenomenon can cause bridge failure during large floods. However, current laboratory studies have focused on only cases of free-surface flow conditions, and they do not take bridge submergence into account. In this study, abutment scour experiments were carried out in a compound channel to investigate the characteristics of abutment scour in free-surface flow, submerged orifice flow, and overtopping flow cases. Detailed bed contours and three components of velocities and turbulent intensities were measured by acoustic Doppler velocimeters. The results show that the contracted flow around an abutment because of lateral and/or <b>vertical</b> <b>contraction</b> and local turbulent structures at the downstream region of the bridge are the main features of the flow responsible for the maximum scour depth around an abutment. The effects of local turbulent structures on abutment scour are discussed in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles measured {{in a wide range of}} flow contraction ratios. The experimental results showed that maximum abutment scour can be predicted by a suggested single relationship even in different flow types (i. e., free, submerged orifice, and overtopping flow) if the turbulent kinetic energy and discharge under the bridge can be accurately measured.

We have {{obtained}} supplementary observations of HC 18 O+(1 - 0), HC 17 O+(1 - 0), and D 13 CO+(2 - 1). Many {{of the observed}} maps show a general correlation with the distribution of dust continuum emission in contrast to C 18 O(1 - 0) and C 17 O(1 - 0) which give clear evidence for depletion of CO at positions close to the continuum peak. In particular N 2 D+(2 - 1) and (3 - 2) {{and to a lesser}} extent N 2 H+(1 - 0) appear to be excellent tracers of the dust continuum. We find that the tracers of high density gas (in particular N 2 D+) show a velocity gradient along the minor axis of the L 1544 core and that there is evidence for larger linewidths close to the dust emission peak. We interpret this using the model of the L 1544 proposed by Ciolek & Basu (2000) and by comparing the observed velocities with those expected on the basis of their model. The results show reasonable agreement between observations and model in that the velocity gradient along the minor axis and the line broadening toward the center of L 1544 are predicted by the model. This is evidence in favour of the idea that amipolar diffusion across field lines is one of the basic processes leading to gravitational collapse. However, line widths are significantly narrower than observed and are better reproduced by the Myers & Zweibel (2001) model which considers the quasistatic <b>vertical</b> <b>contraction</b> of a layer due to dissipation of its Alfvenic turbulence, indicating the importance of this process for cores in the verge of forming a star.

40|$|The dual-channel {{differential}} latency hypothesis (Ögmen et al. 2004) successfully {{accounts for}} {{many aspects of}} the flash-lag effect (FLE). Here, we use the dual-channel differential latency hypothesis to explain an illusion of perceived line length which can be viewed as one component of an illusion reported by Cai & Schlag (2001). In the phenomenon studied here, a flash is presented collinear with a moving line that is simultaneously changing in length. The moving line is perceived to be misaligned with the flash (the FLE) and the length of the moving line is perceived to differ from its physical length at the instant of the flash. We designate this phenomenon the Cai line-Length Effect (CLE). Our analysis treats a horizontally moving line that also changes its vertical length as composed of two simultaneous motion components: (1) horizontal motion and (2) <b>vertical</b> expansion or <b>contraction.</b> We measured perceived position misalignment and length misperception in the CLE paradigm, as well as separately for stimuli with the individual motion components of the CLE, as a function of target luminance. Perceived position misalignment and length misperception varied similarly with target luminance, both in the CLE paradigm and when the individual motion components were tested separately. The misperception of stimulus position and length in the CLE reflects an additional processing delay that may be caused by an interaction between the motion components in two directions. We conclude that the dual-channe...|$|R
