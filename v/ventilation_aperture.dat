40|$|Maximising {{the natural}} {{ventilation}} {{of a building}} can be beneficial in terms of comfort and reduced reliance on air-conditioning. However, in urban areas this can conflict {{with the need to}} reduce the ingress of external noise. In this paper a method is presented to quantify the interaction of building noise exposure with natural ventilation potential. Finite element models of <b>ventilation</b> <b>aperture</b> sound reduction index were used to determine façade sound insulation values for naturally ventilated buildings in two locations. Road traffic noise levels at the building façade were obtained from a calculated noise map of Manchester (UK). Window openings were adjusted in the thermal simulation package and modelled with mixed mode cooling ventilation strategies (both natural and mechanical). This enabled noise considerations to be quantified in terms of building ventilation and energy use for cooling at the whole building level. For a tolerated internal road noise ingress of 34 dB(A) cooling energy consumption for the example buildings in the quieter noise locations was found to decrease by 22 %– 45 % compared to the noisier locations. Most importantly, the introduction of noise reduction measures equal to 10 dB(A) resulted in reductions in cooling energy consumption that varied from 28 % to 45 % of the original cooling energy consumption. This study illustrates the importance of an integrated approach to both noise exposure and ventilation performance in urban buildings...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{interaction}} of building energy use, ventilation performance and urban noise under future climate scenarios, comparing in particular the noise and climatic influences on non-domestic natural ventilation cooling. The main objective {{is to determine the}} level of climate change temperature increase that a noise reduction measure would mitigate. This involves quantifying the tension between maximising natural ventilation and maintaining good acoustic conditions. Methods are linked that are appropriate to a number of scales: <b>ventilation</b> <b>aperture,</b> whole-building, urban area, and the climate scale. Using the Finite Element Method (FEM), {{it was found that the}} sound transmission of ventilation apertures varied by up to 8 dB across the frequencies considered. Noise mapping and whole building thermal performance were used to quantify natural ventilation potential and the impact of noise reduction measures. Three future climate data sets were compared and it was found that all sets provided acceptable information about future natural ventilation performance. The difficulty of adopting natural ventilation with the warming present in all the data sets was clear from the high levels of future overheating. Using these methods and a representative future weather data set, a number of design implications were illustrated, such as the reduction in sensible cooling per unit of ventilation airflow with higher summer temperatures. The main comparison of acoustic and climatic environmental influences showed that a 10 dB noise reduction measure affecting natural ventilation could mitigate a summer temperature increase due to climate change of between 2. 0 °C and 3. 4 °C...|$|E

40|$|NOVELTY - The wall element (1) has {{at least}} one heat {{exchange}} plate (2). The heat exchange plate has a number of <b>ventilation</b> <b>apertures</b> (3). Air is passed over one side of it, some of which passes through the apertures, to which a filter (4) is fitted. At least two such elements with at least two air inputs (5) are combined to enable the air input of one element to be independent of that of the other so that the temperature of each workplace can be controlled individually.

40|$|In the Azores Archipelago, Portugal, pineapples are {{cultivated}} on the Island of São Miguel, existing around 60 ha of glasshouses {{dedicated to}} this crop, {{being a very}} important sector for the local economy. The main goal of this work is to characterise the Azores pineapple glasshouse climate {{and to develop a}} model that allows predicting its internal air temperature. Climate data were recorded in two meteorological stations, one located inside the greenhouse and the other outside. Greenhouse climate data showed a more favourable inside air temperature after middle of March, but reaching frequently very high values during the day in all the months analysed, which is a result of traditional greenhouse management and deficient ventilation. In these greenhouses external conditions such as external air temperature, global radiation and day length greatly influenced the climate inside the greenhouses and as a consequence the duration of the different crop phases and fruit quality. A climate model to simulate inside air temperature was developed based on glasshouse characteristics and external climate conditions such as air temperature, solar radiation, ventilation openings and wind velocity. Since most of the time <b>ventilation</b> <b>apertures</b> were closed it was considered an infiltration rate (varying between 1 and 3 air renovation) per hour, {{as a function of the}} wind velocity. Validation of the model was performed after calibration and showed good agreement...|$|R
50|$|The {{general design}} was distantly {{reminiscent}} of the Stahlhelm, but with some considerable alterations. The general structure and depth were similar, but the brim was shortened, opened wider and more gradually turned. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>apertures</b> were retained, but set in smaller rounded fittings. The angles of the side and upper surfaces were conically increased {{with the aim of}} causing hits of over 90° angle to ricochet. From mid-front to mid-rear a well-pronounced projecting rib was shaped. As a result the helmet received a very distinctive outline with only a distant likeness to the Stahlhelm. It was made of steel with only a small quantity of the first model made of lighter laminated iron, exclusively as officers' dress gear. The edges of the shell were rolled over in the earliest type known as A, while on the later type known as B these were straight cut. In 1939 a new redesigned version with shallowed shell and shortened brim, known as type C, was brought into service. An estimated 70% of all production was of this third model. Factory-issued helmets were initially dark greyish-green in colour with a small shield in Bulgarian flag colours on the right. Later new brighter pea-green shade was introduced. The leather suspension, or liner, were produced in several different variants. The M36 helmet design became lighter, more compact, and more comfortable than the First World War-era designs and provided excellent protection.|$|R

Aperture design is very {{important}} in the design process of rainwear, as garment aperture {{is one of the main}} pathways for air exchange between clothing microclimate and the environment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of aperture design on whole and local ventilations of rainwear. Ventilation was measured by a tester developed based on the steady-state method. A rainwear suit with top and bottom was chosen as the basic ensemble. Apertures were added at the arm, chest, back and knee separately. Local ventilation of the arm, chest, back and whole ventilation of the top and bottom in different walking and wind conditions were measured. Local and whole <b>ventilations</b> at five <b>aperture</b> conditions for the top and four for the bottom were studied. The results indicated that local ventilation value of the chest was the biggest and the arm was the smallest. Whole ventilation of the suit was the biggest when walking at 5. 6 km/h, with all the designed <b>apertures</b> opened. Local <b>ventilation</b> value was bigger when opening arm aperture than that of opening chest or back <b>aperture.</b> The bottom <b>ventilation</b> was the highest when both front and back apertures were opened...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{electromagnetic}} interference regulation, the radiated emission from {{device under test}} such as electronic devices must be carefully manipulated and accurately characterized. Instead of resorting to the direct far-field measurement, in this paper, a novel approach is proposed to model the radiated emission from electronic devices placed in shielding enclosures by using the near electric field only. Based on the Schelkkunoff’s equivalence principle and Raleigh–Carson reciprocity theorem, only the tangential components of the electric field over the <b>ventilation</b> slots and <b>apertures</b> of the shielding enclosure are sufficient to obtain the radiated emissions outside the shielding box if {{the inside of the}} shielding enclosure was filled with perfectly electric conductor (PEC). In order to efficiently model wideband emission, the time-domain sampling scheme is employed. Due to the lack of analytical Green’s function for arbitrary PEC boxes, the radiated emission must be obtained via the full-wave numerical methods by considering the total radiated emission as the superposition between the direct radiation from the equivalent magnetic currents in free space and the scattered field generated by the PEC shielding box. In this study, the state-of-the-art discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) method is utilized, which has the flexibility to model irregular geometries, keep high-order accuracy, and more importantly involves only local operations. For open-region problems, a hybridized DGTD and time-domain boundary integration method applied to rigorously truncate the computational domain. To validate the proposed approach, several representative examples are presented and compared with both analytical and numerical results...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} model {{was developed to}} predict the air distribution pattern and thus to design perforated ventilation ducts equipped with a fan. The analysis of the air distribution pattern of such systems requires accurate measurement procedures. Several experimental methods were tested and compared. Accordingly, the piezometric flush taps and thermo-anemometer were selected to measure respectively the duct air pressure and the outlet air flow. Based on the equations of energy and momentum conservation, a model was formulated to predict the air flow performance of perforated ventilation ducts and to evaluate the outlet discharge angle and the duct regain coefficients without evaluating frictional losses. The basic assumptions of the model were validated by experimentally proving the equivalence of the friction losses expressed in the 2 cited equations. When compared to experimental results measured from four wooden perforated <b>ventilation</b> ducts with <b>aperture</b> ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0, the model predicted the outlet air flow along {{the full length of}} perforated duct operated under turbulent flow conditions with a maximum error of 9 %. The regain coefficient and the energy correction factor were equal to one, and the value of the discharge coefficient remained constant at 0. 65, along the full length of the perforated duct. The outlet air jet discharge angle varied along the entire duct length, and was not influenced by friction losses for turbulent flow. Assuming a common effective outlet area, the model was extended to match the performance of the fan and the perforated duct and to determine their balance operating point...|$|R

Room’s dimensions (6 m x 6 m in plant and 4 m height) and lighting from above are compatible with uses as show-room of art gallery or museum, class room and lecture room. The device includes an heliostat with variable geometry, that can exploits direct or sky diffuse solar radiation as function of season and weather conditions. During the cold season the direct radiation, if present, is re-directed inside the room on diffusing ceiling. During the warm season the device modifies its configuration and allows to enter only to the fraction of sky diffuse radiation that is required for daylighting. This radiation comes from the North side of the sky-dome. The direct radiation impinging on the South side of the device is used to create in its interior a solar stack effect, that contribute to air extraction and natural <b>ventilation.</b> Dimensions of <b>aperture</b> on ceiling, device’s geometry and its control logic have been optimised by means of computer simulations, with the aim to minimise the total annual energy demand for climatisation and illumination.

40|$|Abstract Botrytis cinerea Pers. : Fr. is {{the causal}} agent of grey mould disease {{and is one}} of the most {{important}} diseases affecting tomato crops in unheated greenhouses. Ventilation is the technique used for environmental control in Mediterranean unheated greenhouses. Many growers tend to restrict nocturnal ventilation in order to increase air temperature, forgetting that humidity is a very important factor affecting plant development and most of all that high humidity is favourable to fungal disease development. Growers usually apply large quantities of chemical fungicides with disadvantages such as commercialization problems due to chemical residues on tomato fruits, high production costs, risk of fungicide resistance and negative environmental impacts. Nocturnal (or permanent) ventilation is an effective way to reduce high relative humidity inside greenhouses and could be a useful tool to minimise chemical use in unheated greenhouses. The main purpose of this research was to study the effect of nocturnal ventilation on B. cinerea occurrence in unheated tomato greenhouses and to develop a disease predictive model. Experiments were carried out at the Instituto Superior de Agronomia in Lisbon in two identical adjacent double-span greenhouses. The structural material was galvanized steel and the covering material was a three layer co-extruded film. Each greenhouse had a floor area of 182 m 2, eaves height of 2. 8 m and ridge height of 4. 1 m; the orientation was north-south. The climate was controlled by natural <b>ventilation,</b> using continuous <b>apertures</b> located on the roof and side walls over the entire length of the greenhouses. Two different natural ventilation treatments were randomly assigned to the greenhouses. One treatment was permanent ventilation (PV), with the vents open during the day and night, while the other was classical ventilation (CV), in which the vents were open during the day and closed during the night. A spring tomato crop (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller), cultivar Zapata was grown directly in the soil between the end of February and the end of July in both 1998 and 2000. The growing technique was the usual for greenhouse tomatoes in Portugal. Trickle ferti-irrigation tubes were located between each two rows of plants. Climatic data were measured with three meteorological stations, one located in the centre of each greenhouse and one outside. Air dry and wet bulb temperatures were measured using a ventilated psychrometer. Soil temperatures were recorded using thermistors, the leaf temperature was measured using infrared temperature thermometers and the cover temperature was measured using a thermocouple attached directly to the inner film surface. Global and photosynthetically active (PAR) radiations, wind speed, soil moisture content and water draining from the lysimeter were also recorded. All data were averaged and recorded on an hourly basis using two data logger systems from Delta - T Devices. Data on the evolution of the crop, such as plant growth, leaf area, flower production, fruit production, fruit weight and yield were also recorded. The number of leaflets with lesions caused by B. cinerea were counted and removed from the greenhouse from the randomly selected groups of plants, five times in 1998 and 10 times in 2000. Experimental microclimate parameters recorded over the two years in the two greenhouses with different ventilation management are presented and analysed. It was shown that greenhouse air temperature was not significantly influenced by the night ventilation management. On the contrary, a significant reduction of air humidity occurred in the nocturnally ventilated greenhouse, even with unfavourable outside conditions that occurred during the spring of 2000. A dynamic climate model was tested, modified step by step, parameterised and validated for the conditions which occurred during this research. The modifications were mainly related with the crop and the soil characteristics, the heat transfer coefficients and the ventilation sub-models. The good agreement between the predicted and measured data showed that the revised model can be used to estimate the greenhouse climate conditions, based on the weather conditions and on the greenhouse-crop system characteristics. Also, it was shown that the modifications to the original model improved its performance. Nocturnal or permanent ventilation was shown to have a great contribution to reducing disease severity on tomato leaves caused by B. cinerea, in both years of the experiments. It was shown that nocturnal ventilation management is an environmental control technique which can be used as a prophylactic control measure, since it reduces the severity of B. cinerea on tomato crops grown in unheated greenhouses. This is a very important result since it permits a reduction in chemical use lowering both production costs and environmental impacts. A model that predicts grey mould severity caused by B. cinerea on tomatoes grown in unheated greenhouses was developed as a function of the time duration with air temperature and relative humidity within certain ranges. This model was validated, and comparison between predicted and observed disease data showed good agreement. Integration of the climate and the Botrytis models was tested and reasonable results were obtained, showing that integration of both models is possible. This combination permits the prediction of when the climate conditions would be favourable for disease development and what would be the expected grey mould severity. A warning system, defining disease risk levels based on disease severity was developed and could be a useful tool for technicians, advisors and growers, helping them to decide what are the adequate actions and the correct timing to avoid favourable conditions for disease development. A more practical and immediately implementable application was presented, defining disease risk levels based on the number of hours per day with relative humidity higher than 90 %, which is a useful tool for growers, helping them to identify the risk of disease occurrence and making it possible to act in order to reverse or to avoid disease favourable conditions...|$|R
