5|$|Aigle {{was part}} of a large expeditionary force in the summer 1809. Comprising more than 600 <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> nearly 40,000 troops, it left The Downs on 28 July, intent on {{destroying}} the dock-yards and arsenals at Antwerp, Terneuse and Flushing, and capturing the French fleet stationed in the river Scheldt.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 July and 21 September, German sources {{stated that}} 21 {{transport}} <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> 214 barges had {{been damaged by}} British air raids. These figures may have been under-reported.|$|E
5|$|In all, double-hull tankers {{are said}} to be safer than a single-hull in a {{grounding}} incident, especially when the shore is not very rocky. The safety benefits are less clear on larger <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> in cases of high speed impact.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{disruptions}} and {{the resulting}} electromagnetic loads are critical {{to the design of}} the vacuum <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> in-vessel components of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). This paper describes the status of plasma disruption simulations and related analysis, including the dynamic response of the vacuum <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> in-vessel components, stresses and deflections in the vacuum <b>vessel,</b> <b>and</b> reaction loads in the support structures...|$|R

5|$|In the {{simplest}} type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are {{joined at the}} ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> the flow of fluid depends on contraction of both the <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> the body wall's muscles. In some species, circulation is intermittent, and fluid ebbs and flows in the long-wise vessels. The fluid in the vessels is usually colorless, but in some species it contains cells that are yellow, orange, green or red. The red type contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen, but {{the function of the}} other pigments is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's Register {{is only as}} {{accurate}} as the information owners gave it, and there are discrepancies between the entries for <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> information from other sources. That said, there is generally a strong correspondence between the information in Lloyd's Register, and other sources, at least with respect to Prince of Wales.|$|E

50|$|The less-common designations RMMV for Royal Mail Motor <b>Vessel</b> <b>and</b> RMMS for Royal Mail Motor Ship, {{were used}} for a period when RMS was {{restricted}} to steam-ships.

5|$|Mycenaean {{ships were}} shallow-draught <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> could be beached on sandy bays. There were vessels {{of various sizes}} {{containing}} different numbers of oarsmen. The largest ship probably had a crew of 42–46 oarsmen, with one steering oar, a captain, two attendants and a complement of warriors.|$|E
5|$|On August24, fishing <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> {{small craft}} off the {{northern}} and eastern coasts of Luzon, Philippines were advised to not venture out due to large swells produced by Typhoons Bolaven and Tembin.|$|E
5|$|She {{had a short}} career, sinking four enemy <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> {{damaging}} one other. These victories {{took place}} {{over a period of}} two war patrols. During her first sortie, the boat sank two enemy <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> damaged a further one. On her second patrol, U-111 sank two more enemy ships before she herself was sunk on 4 October 1941 southwest of Tenerife, by depth charges from a British warship. Out of a crew of 52 officers and men, eight died in the attack; 44 survived.|$|E

5|$|The blood <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> lymph {{vessels are}} considered, the valves of the heart, and the {{separate}} functions of arteries and veins. Paley argues that such functions {{as that of}} the epiglottis could not have formed gradually (as by evolution).|$|E
5|$|The hurricane's {{effects were}} severe {{in the city}} of Charleston, where the storm {{produced}} northeasterly winds and heavy rainfall. The bulwark of the fort at nearby James Island was destroyed, and the palisades of the fort at Castle Pinckney were wrecked at the mouth of Charleston's harbor. The hurricane also swept vessels aground into marshes and wharves between Gadsden's Wharf and South Bay along the Cooper River. Several wharves—Pritchard's, Cochran's, Beale's, Craft's, and William's—were struck by <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> consequently severely damaged. The Montserrat, Mary, Birmingham Packet, Amazon, and Orange all endured some degree of damage. Three <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> the Mary collided with Governor's Bridge, which was impaired as a result; two <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> the Favorite slammed into Faber's Wharf, while the Concord filled with water at Prioleau's Wharf, resulting in the loss of 50tierces of rice. A counting and scale house was separated from its foundation after being struck by the Lydia within the vicinity of Blake's Wharf, while the African slave boat Christopher capsized at Geyer's Wharf, with all aboard escaping safely. Four slaves drowned after a boat overturned in the Ashley River.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of Cornell University, Eldred enlisted at age22 in the United States Navy in January 1918, {{nine months after}} the U.S. entry into World War I. After serving aboard various Navy <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> seeing combat in that conflict, he then worked in the agriculture and produce transportation industries, serving as a railroad industry official. Eldred continued as an active Scout leader and school board member throughout much of his adult life.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, Task Force 90 (CTF-90) {{was inaugurated}} {{under the command}} of Rear Admiral Lorenzo Sabin. US {{servicemen}} renovated and transformed cargo <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> tank carriers to house the thousands of Vietnamese who would be evacuated in them. The repairs were frequently done en route to Haiphong from their bases at Subic Bay in the Philippines. Sabin had no prior involvement in humanitarian matters, and he and his staff prepared Operation Order 2–54—the 114-page policy framework for the operation—in the space of a week during their sea voyage from Japan to Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|An airlock is {{a device}} which permits {{the passage of}} people and objects between a {{pressure}} <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> its surroundings while minimizing the change of pressure in the <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> loss of air from it. The lock consists of a small chamber with two airtight doors in series which do not open simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen for long periods.|$|E
5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> keep only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of the fragile <b>vessels,</b> <b>and</b> therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the distribution and}} permeability of blood vessels on the Conception <b>Vessel</b> <b>and</b> the Governor <b>Vessel</b> in the physiological state. MethodsEvans blue (EB) solution was injected into the marginal ear vein of healthy rabbits. Three hours after injection, the rabbits were sacrificed and the skin on the Conception <b>Vessel</b> <b>and</b> the Governor <b>Vessel</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding bilateral non-channels was collected. EB was extracted with 7 : 3 acetone: physiological saline, and the absorbance of EB at each skin tissue was measured with a spectrophotometer. ResultsThe A value of EB absorbance at the Conception Vessel on the abdominal skin was {{lower than that of}} the corresponding bilateral non-channels with a statistically significant difference (P 0. 05). ConclusionThere were differences in capillary distribution and permeability between the Conception Vessel, the Governor <b>Vessel</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding bilateral non-meridians...|$|R
