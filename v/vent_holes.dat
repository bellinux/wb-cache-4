5|$|At the 8 August 1993 Fairchild air show, Holland {{once again}} {{commanded}} the B-52 demonstration flight. The demonstration profile once again included bank angles greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, {{this time in}} excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out of the <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.|$|E

25|$|During his {{overnight}} stay at Titusville, Brooks had repaired the aircraft, using the propeller from the aircraft {{involved in the}} forced landing. He had also placed wooden toothpicks in the <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> on his fuel cap to prevent moist air from entering and condensing overnight. On February 25, Brooks took off to complete the flight, circled out over the Atlantic where his motor quit and he went down off Melbourne, Florida. The wreckage of the Ford Flivver washed up, but the pilot was never found. Investigation of the wreckage disclosed that the toothpicks had plugged the fuel cap <b>vent</b> <b>holes,</b> causing an engine stoppage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cooling rate is an {{important}} evaluation index of pressure pre-cooling effect for fruits and vegetables. Experimental device of pressure pre-cooling for fruits and vegetables has been established. Pre-cooling process of golden pears has been tested. The key parameters which affected pressure pre-cooling 7 / 8 cooling time of golden pears such as different air flow rates, different shapes and sizes of <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> and arrange form have been analyzed. The results show {{that it is better}} that cooling air flow rate is between 1. 5 m/s and 2 m/s. Ellipse <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> shape is the best <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> style and key-groove <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> is the worst. The cooling rate of stagger array form is faster than the parallel array form...|$|R

40|$|Braking {{system is}} very {{important}} element to control velocity of vehicle when it {{is working on the}} road. Braking system concept always follows principle of normal force which it is using friction force method for rubbing on lining pad of disc brake. Braking system must able to overcome circumstances when working on high level of velocity and stopping on safe circumstances. In this research field orientation, a number of disc brake with sum of different <b>venting</b> <b>holes</b> are being tested by giving variable of velocity from 20 to 80 km/hours and being interfaced by different braking pressure (4 to 6 kg) on lining pad of disc brake on stationary test. In conclusion, the results show 24 <b>venting</b> <b>holes</b> which have been giving effective performing amongst all of the other of <b>venting</b> <b>holes.</b> Similar to other of <b>venting</b> <b>holes</b> with pertaining velocity of vehicle and braked pressure can be explained clearly with significant chart when it is going to develop by interfacing control system for finding effective stopping time especially when brake pad of disc brake will be produced in manufacturing process as product consideration...|$|R
25|$|Except {{for very}} small cores, all cores require <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> to release gases. These are usually formed by using small wires to create holes {{from the surface}} of the mold to the core. When this is not {{feasible}} cinder and coke can be added to the core to increase permeability.|$|E
25|$|Both {{of these}} are {{undesirable}} pests to humans, but can be easily controlled without chemicals by enclosing {{the top of the}} pit with tight-fitting boards or concrete, using a sufficiently sealed toilet hole cover that is closed after every use, and by using fine-grid insect screen to cover the inlet and outlet <b>vent</b> <b>holes.</b> This prevents flying insect entry by all potential routes.|$|E

50|$|A whiskey thief is a {{tool that}} master {{distillers}} use to extract small portions of whiskey from an aging barrel for sampling or quality control. The old-fashioned ones are made typically of copper and resemble a drinking straw in design. It has a coned narrow hole {{at the bottom and}} a <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> at the top in which a distiller can cover with the thumb once the device is inserted in the barrel to trap and lift the whiskey out. By removing the thumb from the upper <b>vent</b> <b>hole,</b> the whiskey is released to drain into drinking glasses for tasting.|$|R
25|$|A {{classical}} marble facade with baroque scrolls {{decorate the}} partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words “PUBLIC VAULT” displayed {{by means of}} <b>vent</b> <b>holes.</b> The vault is constructed of Aquia Creek sandstone, which was also used to construct many important early structures in Washington, including the White House, the Capitol, and the Latrobe cenotaphs in the cemetery. The vault {{does not have any}} niches or shelves to hold coffins, rather the coffins were placed on the floor and stacked if necessary.|$|E
25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply bleed air when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} bleed air <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no bleed air is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.|$|E

There is a wooden platform on brick piers {{at the rear}} door and the metal frame walls are mortared. The gable roof was replaced in 1978. The chimney tops were repaired in 1982. The exterior walls are of local brick with half-brick <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> into the crawl space below the first floor level. The second and third floor has outer east and west windows. The cell windows have lintels and sills cut from local sandstone. The center hall and first floor windows have wood sills and lintels. The first floor and center windows of {{the second and third}} floor north sides have 6/6 double hanging windows. The center north side entrance is a four-raised panel door surrounded by a four-light transom. The gable ends are void of any window openings as is the south facade.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{to determine the}} shape of the cutout that will maximize its fatigue life and minimize the weight of the Fuel Flow <b>Vent</b> <b>Hole</b> under the operating loading conditions. Using the shape optimization process, changing the length of the fuel flow <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> gives a better fatigue life. The design space near the optimal region is found to be flat that is around 40 % shape optimization(80 mm hole), the original weight is 0. 44343 kg and obtained reduction in weight is 0. 27018, this allows us to achieve a considerable enhancement in fatigue life and weight reduction...|$|R

500|$|Inspired by Zibold's work, Chaptal built a small air well near Montpellier in 1929. Chaptal's {{condenser}} was a pyramidal {{concrete structure}} [...] square and [...] high, {{it was filled}} with [...] of limestone pieces being about [...] in diameter. Small <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> ringed {{the top and bottom of}} the pyramid. These holes could be closed or opened as required to control the flow of air. The structure was allowed to cool during the night, and then warm moist air was let in during the day. Dew formed on the limestone pieces and collected in a reservoir below ground level. The amount of water obtained varied from [...] to [...] per day depending on the atmospheric conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Vietnam War ended, the Soviet Union {{introduced}} a 40-mm grenade launcher that used the High-Low Principle, {{but with a}} twist on the original design. [...] The GP-25 40-mm grenade launcher fits under the assault rifle and fires a caseless projectile that is muzzle-loaded. [...] Instead of having a case, the high-pressure chamber {{is located on the}} rear of the projectile with ten <b>vent</b> <b>holes,</b> in which the launcher barrel acts as the low-pressure chamber. [...] The ignition of the propellant gases also causes the drive band to engage the launcher grooves, similar to the American Civil War Parrott muzzle loading rifled cannon.|$|E
2500|$|The burn barrel is a {{somewhat}} more controlled form of private waste incineration, containing the burning material inside a metal barrel, with a metal grating over the exhaust. The barrel prevents the spread of burning material in windy conditions, and as the combustibles are reduced they can only settle down into the barrel. The exhaust grating helps {{to prevent the spread}} of burning embers. Typically steel [...] drums are used as burn barrels, with air <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> cut or drilled around the base for air intake. Over time, the very high heat of incineration causes the metal to oxidize and rust, and eventually the barrel itself is consumed by the heat and must be replaced.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simulation methodology created {{to support an}} integrated safety system development process which was tested for the side impact collision load case. The methodology {{is based on the}} coupled and complementary use of two software packages: PreScan and Madymo. PreScan was utilized for designing two traffic scenarios and the sensing and control systems for the side collision recognition, while Madymo was utilized for assessing the effects of pre-crash deployment of thorax airbag. The collision conditions from the scenarios were used as input to define a Madymo side collision model of the host vehicle and to investigate and optimize several airbag deployment parameters: pre-crash deployment time, airbag permeability, <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> size and <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> opening time. Results showed that the best system configuration to reduce occupant injuries is achieved when the airbag is deployed in the pre-crash phase to push away the driver from the intrusion zone in {{the first phase of the}} crash. Then a delayed <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> opening softly separates the driver from the contact with the door structure when it intrudes. The proposed deployment strategy led to reduction of rib deflection and VC injury measures of 20 % and 50 % respectively, showing the potential of integrating active and passive safety methodologies to improve the occupant protection in case of side collision...|$|R

500|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of 5 numbered gunners - fewer crew than {{needed in the}} previous century. The No.1 was the gun commander, and a sergeant, who aimed the gun. The No.2 was the [...] "spongeman" [...] who cleaned the bore with the sponge dampened with water between shots; the intention being to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced. The No.3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder and then the projectile. The No.2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No.4 ("ventsman") pressed his thumb on the <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No.4 pricked the bagged charge through the <b>vent</b> <b>hole</b> and filled the vent with powder. At the No.1s command the No.5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.|$|R
2500|$|During July and August, Barclay {{received}} two small vessels, the schooner [...] and the sloop , {{which had been}} reconstructed at Chatham on the Thames River and attempted to complete the ship-rigged corvette [...] at Amherstburg. Because the Americans controlled Lake Ontario and occupied the Niagara Peninsula in early 1813, supplies for Barclay had to be carried overland from York. The American victory {{earlier in the year}} at the Battle of York resulted in the guns (24-pounder carronades) intended for Detroit falling into American hands. Detroit had to be completed with a miscellany of guns from the fortifications of Amherstburg. Barclay claimed at his court martial that these guns lacked flintlock firing mechanisms and matches, and that they could be fired only by snapping flintlock pistols over powder piled in the <b>vent</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{saxophone}} {{consists of}} an approximately conical tube, usually of thin brass, flared at the tip to form a bell. At intervals along the tube are between 20 and 23 tone holes of varying size and two very small <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> to assist the playing of the upper register. These holes are covered by keys (also known as pad cups) containing soft leather pads, which are closed to produce an airtight seal. At rest some of the holes stand open and others are closed. The keys are activated by keytouches pressed by the fingers, either directly on the pad cup or connected to it with levers, either directly or with joints called [...] "linkages." [...] The right thumb sits under a thumb rest to stabilize and balance the saxophone, while the weight of most saxophones {{is supported by a}} neckstrap attached to a strap ring on the rear of the body of the instrument. The fingering for the saxophone is a combination of that of the oboe with the Boehm system and is very similar to the flute or upper register of the clarinet. Instruments that play to low A have a left thumb key for that note.|$|E

There are, as you know, six galleys manned by crews from our prison there. The crew of each galley will embark upon it, and man the oars; the rest will divide themselves among the galleys. Before starting, we shall seize and set fire to all other galleys and ships in the port. The gangs in four of the rooms have been told off specially for this duty. Before firing them, they are to take out such provisions as they may find, and transport them to the galleys. We who take the forts are provided with hammers and long nails, to drive down the <b>vent</b> <b>holes</b> of the cannon; when we have done this, we are to wait until one of the galleys fetches us off.
