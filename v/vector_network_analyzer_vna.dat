40|$|Modern test {{equipment}} used for antenna measurements, such as <b>vector</b> <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> (<b>VNA),</b> generally provide un-balanced coaxial measurement ports. This presents {{a problem when}} performing measurements on devices such as dipole antennas, which present a balanced input. A balun must be used to interface the dipole to the VNA. Since there is no straightforward way to include the balun in the standard VNA calibration procedure, the calibration, and thus the measurement is referenced to the un-balanced input of the balun. However, it is desired to measure the antenna response at its input terminals, which are on the output side of the balun.

This work follows previous work on this subject that {{was presented at the}} 82 nd ARFTG conference in November 2013. As with the earlier investigation, three devices have been investigated - an offset short-circuit, a flush short-circuit, and a near-matched load.

As before, the repeatability of the measurements is assessed using statistical techniques, in terms of the experimental standard deviation in both the real and imaginary components of the complex-valued linear reflection coefficient.

40|$|A {{new concept}} for <b>vector</b> <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> design {{based on a}} {{perturbation}} two-port (PTP) is presented. The approach uses redundant states of the PTP. The best states of the PTP for a certain place in Smith chart and frequency are chosen to determine a reflection coefficient with minimum uncertainty. Four criteria for the selection are designed. The criteria were tested on measured parameters of different states of the PTP. Significant improvements in PTP bandwidth and uncertainty of measured data were achieved. Summary Six-port <b>vector</b> <b>network</b> <b>analyzers</b> (<b>VNA)</b> are well known for decades, [1]. Similar concept using only a scalar <b>network</b> <b>analyzer</b> and a PTP was designed in [2], where only a basic principle was designed and experimentally verified using a PTP with properties far from optimum. No recommendations for {{the structure of the}} PTP were given. Some suggestions for an optimum three state PTP can be found in [3], yet the states of the PTP are unpractical for a realization and are suitable only in a narrow frequency bandwidth. The main demand in the PTP design is to realize optimum states valid on the whole Smith chart in wide frequency band. These demands can be hardly satisfied with any minimum 3 -states PTP. The solution is a new concept of the PTP <b>vector</b> <b>network</b> <b>analyzer</b> based on redundant multi-state PTP. It releases the demands on PTP so that they must be satisfied only in a part of Smith chart. The concept can be summarized into three key steps. • over-determination of measured data using more than three minimum states of the PTP • approximate determination of measured reflection coefficient in Smith chart using proper three PTP states • state the measured reflection coefficient more precisely applying the best PTP states determined in given frequency in corresponding part of Smith chart by proper test criteria The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present proper criteria for the PTP state selection and a new circuit solution for individual states of the 7 -state PTP.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a study {{and implementation of}} several measurement procedures used to efficiently generate non-linear measurement-based behavioral models primary for microwave amplifiers. Behavioral models are a solution for representing devices that can present linear and/or non-linear behavior when little or no information about the internal structure is known. Measurement-based behavioral models are an advantage since they can be extracted from a direct measurement of the device. This work addresses some of the challenges {{of these types of}} measurements. A set of software modules has been produced that combine several modern techniques to efficiently generate practical models using equipment commonly available in a typical microwave lab. Advanced models using new and more complex equipment are also discussed. Modeling of the non-linear operation of power amplifiers is a common subject of study since it provides a path to improved system simulations. However, the measurement process used for non-linear behavioral modeling of PAs requires either non-linear measurement instrumentation, not yet widely available, or numerous measurements that makes the process tedious and susceptible to errors. Power dependent S-Parameters obtained with a conventional <b>Vector</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Analyzers</b> (<b>VNA)</b> can be used to extract AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM behavior of a device and to generate, simple but useful, behavioral models. A careful analysis of the characteristics of common RF measurement instrumentation combined with knowledge of common non-linear phenomena provides with the conditions under which useful models can be generated. The results of this work are presented as several programs implemented in National Instruments LabVIEW that will sequence through the different measurements required for the generation of measurement-based behavioral models.

Among other utilities time domain option from Agilent allows to measure microwave devices into a specific frequency range and down till DC {{as well with the}} two time domain mode: band-pass and low-pass mode. A special feature named gating is of important as it allows representing a portion of the time domain representation in frequency domain.   This thesis studies the time domain option 010 from Agilent; its uncertainties and sensitivity. The task is to find the best method to measure the antenna element matching taking care to reduce the influence of measurement errors on the results.   The Agilent 8753 ES is the instrument used in the thesis. A specific matching problem in the antenna electric down-tilt (AEDT) previously designed by Powerwave Technologies is the task to be solved. This is because it can not be measured directly with 2 -port VNAs. It requires adapters, extra coaxial cables and N-connectors, all of which influences the accuracy. The AEDT connects to the array antenna through cable-board-connectors (CBCs). The AEDT and the CBCs were designed before being put into the antenna-system. Their S-parameters do not coincide with the ones measured after these devices were put in the antenna block.   Time domain gating and de-embedding algorithms are two methods proposed in this thesis to measure the S-parameters of the desired antenna element while reducing the influence of measurement errors due to cables CBCs and other connectors. The aim is to find a method which causes less error and gives high confidence measurements.   For the time domain analysis, reverse engineering of the time domain option used in the Agilent VNA 8753 ES is implemented in a PC for full control of the process. The results using time-domain are not sufficiently reliable to be used due to the multiple approximations done in the design. The methodology that Agilent uses to compensate the gating effects is not reliable when the gate is not centered on the analyzed response. Big errors are considered due to truncation and masking effects in the frequency response.   The de-embedding method using LRL is implemented in the AEDT measurements, taking away the influences of the CBCs, coaxial cables and N-connector. It is found to have sufficient performance, comparable to the mathematical model. Error analysis of both methods has been done to explaine the different in measurements and design...|$|R
