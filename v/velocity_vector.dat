5|$|The meteoroid's {{absolute}} magnitude (the apparent magnitude {{it would have}} {{at an altitude of}} 100km at the observer's zenith) was approximately−6 and did not vary significantly during the few seconds of observation. It traveled a distance of 409km in 9.8seconds during the time it was observed. It moved at a speed of 41.74km per second, which did not change measurably during the flight. Jiří Borovička and Zdeněk Ceplecha from the Ondřejov Observatory in Czechoslovakia estimated that the deceleration caused by the friction of the atmosphere reached only 1.7m/s2 at the fireball's perigee (closest approach to Earth), and its velocity was reduced by only 0.012km per second (less than 0.03%). This corresponds well with computer simulations provided by D.W.Olson, R.L.Doescher and K.M. Watson at the Southwest Texas State University, who concluded that the deceleration was less than 0.5m/s2 except for a few seconds near perigee. This small loss of speed, 12m per second, corresponded to a loss of kinetic specific energy (in the earth's frame of reference) of 0.5 MJ/kg, which was converted to heat (and perhaps sound). The change in the object's <b>velocity</b> <b>vector</b> due to Earth's gravity during the hours it was in the earth's vicinity was on the order of kilometres per second (see Orbit).|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow <b>velocity</b> <b>vector.</b> Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} estimating the velocity field near the baseline of two ocean radars. Since a single radar measures only radial components of surface current <b>velocities,</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>vectors</b> are determined using the radial velocities measured by two or more radars. However, in composition of the <b>velocity</b> <b>vectors,</b> the measurement errors included in the radial velocities are enlarged where the beams of the two radars are nearly parallel to each other. Thus wild <b>velocity</b> <b>vectors</b> often appear near the baseline. Such velocities are ignored usually. In order to avoid this difficulty, we develop two methods of estimating current <b>velocity</b> <b>vectors</b> near the baseline using the nearby <b>velocity</b> <b>vectors</b> and radial <b>velocities</b> measured by the radars. One method is named the Azimuthal Component Interpolation Method (ACIM), {{and the other is}} named the Optimal Vector Interpolation Method (OVIM). The former is applicable only near the baseline, whereas the latter may be extended to more general interpolation and extrapolation. First these two methods are tested qualitatively and quantitatively based on a simple simulation of radar measurement. The current field calculated by ACIM and OVIM are correlated well with the true current field, whereas the ordinary algorithm fails to reproduce the true current field near the baseline. Then the two methods are applied to the real data of the Tsushima Strait. The resulting current field seems realistic and reasonable. Thus the two methods are of some practical use for estimating the current <b>velocity</b> <b>vectors</b> near the baseline, though much more improvement is needed for more general and more accurate application...|$|R
