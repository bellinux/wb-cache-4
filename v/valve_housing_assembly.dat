50|$|Clifton Park <b>Valve</b> <b>House,</b> {{also known}} as the Lake Clifton Gate House or Lake Clifton <b>Valve</b> <b>House,</b> is a {{historic}} building located in a northeast area known as Clifton Park of Baltimore, Maryland. It is a massive octagonal stone gatehouse featuring large Romanesque archways that alternate with Gothic style windows that once contained stained glass. It was constructed in 1887 by the Baltimore City Water Department. It also features a turret, atop an intricate tile roof supported by a complicated system of iron trusses.|$|R

5000|$|Clifton Park <b>Valve</b> <b>House.</b> Built in 1887-1888, it {{was used}} to build {{machinery}} used in the operation of Lake Clifton, once {{a major part of the}} city's water supply and was connected to Lake Montebello to the north by a 108-inch underground pipe. Lake Clifton began to be filled and developed in 1962, and the <b>Valve</b> <b>House</b> was no longer needed and eventually abandoned. By 1971, the building was in a serious state of disrepair. Baltimore City owns the building, and recent plans for private restoration have failed.|$|R
50|$|In 1883, the Cincinnati Water Works {{wanted to}} extend its {{efficient}} water supply main tunnel (which had remained incomplete for several years) 185 feet to the line at Gilbert Avenue. This efficient main started at the reservoir in Eden Park. To control {{the flow of water}} {{at the base of the}} steep hill, a <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> was needed. Because the Water Works wanted to enhance the landscape of the park, plus they wanted a structure that would also serve as a new entrance to the park, they felt that the <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> needed to have a special design.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the exhaust valve component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of exhaust valve component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> under different preload force, the deformation of exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN. This indicates that the exhaust valve seal well. The sealing and deformation of the exhaust valve component meets the desgin requirement...|$|R

50|$|Balmain {{reservoir}} {{was built}} in 1915 by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage, Sydney, and was originally supplied with water by gravity from Potts Hill. The restoration of Gladstone Park and the erection of a bandstand was made a condition of construction of the reservoir. The facility was made redundant by the commissioning of Petersham Reservoir in 1965 and has remained disused ever since. The neighbouring <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> was constructed in 1917 on the Booth Street frontage {{of the park and}} this, together with the footings of the bandstand, can still be seen today. Restoration work on the <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> earned a National Trust of Australia Heritage Award in 2006.|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} a bileaflet {{mechanical}} heart valve depends on the absence of persistent flow stases that may cause thrombus formation. Within the <b>valve</b> <b>housing,</b> the only obstruction to blood flow is the leaflets. The leaflet faces are repeatedly washed by blood as the valve opens and closes, but persistent flow stasis can occur at the leaflet pivot due to its size, location and design, as evidenced by recent thrombus-related failure (1 - 3). Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} char-acterize pivot flow of any bileaflet mechanical heart valve design prior to its clinical use (4). Pivot flow analysis is complicated by the geometry of the valve and its pivots. In general, a bileaflet mechanical heart valve typically comprises a rigid annular <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> and a pair of rotatable leaflets (5 - 9) (Fig. 1). Each leaflet has a pair of ears that pro-trude from the leaflet and mate with the pivot recesses in the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> The leaflet is retained inside the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> by the pivots, which control the range of the leaflet movement as the leaflets respond passively to local blood flow pressure gradients. Pivot flow analysis is challenging because the rotating leaflet obstructs visibility, and the complexity and motion of the pivot region result in complex flow that is difficult to measure or simulate. The present study outlines a systematic, detailed method for characterizing pivot flow of the Medtronic ADVANTAGE (ADV) bileaflet mechanical heart valve. This method, which was used during the design process of the ADV, combines both a macroscopic hydrodynamic performance assessment and a micro-scopic flow analysis. The St. Jude Medical (SJM) bileaflet mechanical valve was used as the control in these studies. Address for correspondence...|$|R
