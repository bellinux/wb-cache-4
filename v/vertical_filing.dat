25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{invention}} of the vertical file remains an unsolved mystery. The <b>Vertical</b> <b>Filing</b> Cabinet section in the Early Office Museum website begins {{with a discussion of}} the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed “secondary sources,” concerning the origin of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing.</b> The secondary sources claimed that a gold medal was presented at the World’s Fair of 1893 for a vertical file. The Early Office Museum found no evidence to substantiate those claims. However, the information presented in the Early Office Museum’s discussion of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets suggests that the commercial introduction of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of commercial <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets businesses kept papers in envelopes in turn stored in arrays of pigeonholes often lining a wall. Finding and opening envelopes and unfolding papers was troublesome and inefficient. However, the concept of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> was clearly practiced as early as 1895 when a U.S. patent(533053)was issued to W.A. Cooke, Jr. for A Receptacle for Letters or Other Papers.|$|E
50|$|The Archives {{currently}} {{hold over}} 30,000 <b>vertical</b> <b>files</b> on people, groups, and events affecting the {{lesbian and gay}} community. Unlike most of the Archives, the <b>vertical</b> <b>files</b> provide information about an individual or organization, rather than information produced by the individual or organization. The <b>vertical</b> <b>files</b> contain approximately fifty percent Canadian content and fifty percent international content.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{establishing}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>file</b> {{for a new}} branch library is traced; suggestions for making the <b>vertical</b> <b>file</b> a better resource are offered; and guidelines covering the general objective, responsibility for selection and maintenance, principles of selection, {{and scope of the}} collection for <b>vertical</b> <b>files</b> are presented. A four-item bibliography provides a listing of relevant material. (KM) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|R

5000|$|Research by Ester Ellen-Poe {{validated}} The Early Office Museum's findings, {{and suggests}} that the most credible claim to the invention of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing,</b> {{as we know it}} today, appears to have been by the Library Bureau. The Library Bureau’s 1903 pamphlet titled “Library Bureau Systems of <b>Vertical</b> <b>Filing</b> with Interchangeable Unit Cabinets,” begins with: “Vertical filing, as originated added and perfected by the Library Bureau, is the most complete, accurate and practical method ever invented added for taking care of correspondence, catalogs, reports, invoices, orders, duplicate bills, and loose sheets, or papers of any kind for any business ---large, small or peculiar.” (...)

50|$|In the 1890s, the Library Bureau {{introduced}} <b>vertical</b> <b>filing.</b> It {{soon became}} a large supplier of filing equipment, supplies, and expertise to business and government. Library Bureau schools in major cities taught filing to clerical workers.|$|E
5000|$|Edwin Grenville Seibels (September 12, 1866 [...] - [...] December 21, 1954) was the {{inventor}} in 1898 of the <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> {{system that has}} been in extensive use for over a century. Although he applied for a patent for his system, it was denied on the ground that it was only an idea, not a device.|$|E
50|$|In the US, these {{come in two}} sizes: for letter-size {{paper and}} legal-size paper. Most modern commercially {{oriented}} <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets in the US are manufactured in two-, three-, four-, and five-drawer versions in depths of 25, 26½, and 28 inches. The drawers are typically supported on a three-member suspension system that allows the drawer to be fully extended for complete access.|$|E

50|$|PIM is a {{new field}} with ancient roots. When the oral rather than the written word dominated, human memory was the primary means for {{information}} preservation. As information was increasingly rendered in paper form, tools were developed over time to meet the growing challenges of management. For example, the <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet, now such a standard feature of home and workplace offices, was first commercially available in 1893.|$|E
5000|$|The drawers of most <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> {{cabinets}} are {{engineered to}} accept hanging file folders, as these {{have come to}} dominate the way most users store information. Some files still have a [...] "follower block" [...] in each drawer. This is a device that adjusts the apparent depth of the drawer interior so that files are kept upright in the drawer. These are the legacy {{of a time when}} most filing was done with manila folders rather than hanging files.|$|E
5000|$|Within the United States, {{the primary}} {{standard}} for <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. [...] BIFMA used {{to maintain a}} separate Standard X5.2 for lateral filing cabinets, but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel filing cabinets, A-A-3186and A-A-3187respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of filing cabinets, medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for filing cabinets and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject {{may be found in}} the article on classified information in the United States.|$|E
