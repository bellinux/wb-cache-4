5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s cracks had {{appeared}} in the wall built {{at the back of the}} Grosvenor Road End. The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500. The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985. All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s. During the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End. Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End. Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room were readied. Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986–87, and <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> was installed inside the ground. Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met. These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats. However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

5|$|The group's Red Rocks {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} for 5 June 1983, but poor weather that day threatened to cancel the show. Torrential rain soaked the area, and flash flood warnings were issued. The weather {{made it difficult for}} the crew members to transport the band's gear and <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> through the mountains to the amphitheatre. The conditions also caused many technical problems for the filming and concert crews, which hampered stage construction and endangered the safety of those setting up lighting and sound equipment. Crew members used squeegees to keep rain away from the wires, although the assistant of recording engineer Randy Ezratty still received an electrical shock while setting up a lighting truss. The fans that attended had to hike through the Rocky Mountains in the rain. Between 15 and 20 fans were already camped out in the venue's front rows early in the morning, and lead singer Bono accommodated them by serving coffee and tea. The Alarm and Divinyls cancelled their opening sets for safety reasons, and many fans thought the entire concert had been cancelled. The show {{was scheduled for}} 6:00pm, and the band had until 1:00pm to decide whether to move the concert elsewhere or risk the weather worsening, which could have necessitated a cancellation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{explored}} {{the applicability of}} gesture commands in a PDA to the operation of DVD players, video tape players and TVs. Firstly, 58 {{subjects were asked to}} write the appropriate gesture commands for each of the 11 pre-selected commonly used operations in controlling <b>video</b> <b>equipments.</b> From this set of written gesture commands as well as the gesture commands used in the PalmRemote for Palm OS, five commands were screened for each operation by experts with the consideration on frequency been written, compliance with the one stroke writing rule and ease of writing. Another 50 subjects then were recruited to select the most appropriate command from the set of five commands for each of operation. With minor adjustment, a most appropriate set of gesture commands for the 11 operations was summarized. In the second phase of this study, three tasks were designed to simulated the commonly operations on <b>video</b> <b>equipments.</b> Eighteen subjects were asked to execute the three tasks by using conventional remote controller, remote control keypads on Sony CLIE PDA, and the devised gesture commands on Sony CLIE PDA in random sequence. Time and error rate on execution these tasks with three different operation approaches were compared and analyzed. Due to our familiarity with conventional remote controllers, it can be most effectively used to operate video devises. However, gesture commands can be performed more effective than control keypads, if we want to use a PDA to replace a remote controller in operating <b>video</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

25|$|Boyd-Moss's {{premature}} {{departure from}} the sport was particularly disappointing {{taking into account the}} glimpses of his considerable talent that he displayed. In 1982, Boyd-Moss and Kapil Dev hit 182 runs off of Derbyshire's front line bowlers in just 98 minutes, speeding up their declaration, leading ultimately to an emphatic victory. Kapil Dev may have already been established as one of the leading all-rounder's in Test Cricket at the time, but in this match Boyd-Moss had hit 137 in the first innings, following up with an unbeaten 80 in the second, matching his more illustrious batting partner shot for shot. He ended that season with 1,602 first-class runs at an average of 44.50, earning the County some new <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> as the Commercial Union Young Batsman of the Year. After the 1983 season, people were starting to talk about Boyd-Moss becoming the future Northamptonshire captain, and in 1984 he was awarded his County cap.

25|$|The Reading Plant's heritage, {{combined}} with constant innovation and product quality, positioned the Reading site {{as one of}} the largest semiconductor facilities in the world. In 2000, Lucent Microelectronics and Optoelectronics were reorganized as Agere Systems with the intention of spinning it off as an independent company. Agere Systems Inc. produced high-tech components such as opto-electronics products, which use light-wave technologies to transmit information, and integrated circuits, which are miniaturized chips used in computers and communications. The opto-electronics parts were used in systems such as submarine communication cables, cable transmitters, cable receivers, laser components, and network computing devices. The integrated circuits were found in a wide array of electronic products from modems and computers to cell phones and telephone offices to <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> and digital television. After becoming Agere Systems, by the end of 2000, the Reading Facility became the Muhlenberg plant and had grown its workforce by 800 to 3,000 as the anticipated lightwave business materialized. In 2001, Agere Systems's stock went public in late March. The spin-off was completed on June 1, 2002. By mid-2001, Agere cut 508 jobs at the Reading Works. These layoffs continued in waves as conditions in the semiconductor market deteriorated {{and by the end of}} the year only had a workforce of 1,546.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the tour}} {{was listed as}} co-sponsored by MTV, the group decided against {{explicit}} corporate sponsorship; band members, especially drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., were uncertain that the tour would be profitable. The daily cost of producing the tour was US$125,000, regardless of whether a show was held on a given day. An attempt to convince Philips to donate the <b>video</b> <b>equipment</b> was unsuccessful, and the band {{had to pay for}} it themselves. In order to defray the heavy expenses of the Pacific shows, U2 asked for large guarantees from local promoters up front, rather than sharing the financial burden as they had in the past. [...] This sometimes caused promoters to raise ticket prices above usual levels, which in turn sometimes resulted in less than full houses. Profit margin was a slim four to five percent at most sold-out shows.|$|E
500|$|Kenny Ortega, {{a common}} {{collaborator}} with The Walt Disney Company at the time, {{was hired as}} the tour's director and main choreographer. Ortega, along with set designer Michael Cotten, assembled an experienced personnel and developed the show, which was made fairly simple because Cyrus did not feel confident enough as a vocalist to perform stunts and use props while singing. Therefore, fixation was turned to video. Cotten envisioned the set to be [...] "an interactive mobile kaleidoscope of flash and style", a conceptualization that involved a massive amount of video. Nineteen individual LED video screens were located throughout the stage. Four high definition V9 LED video screens served as walls surrounding the main stage. Five Barco MiTrix cubes, which consisted of three LED panels that faced towards the audience and one supporting panel that faced the stage, were suspended by rigs throughout the stage. Nocturne Productions partnered with equipment supplier <b>Video</b> <b>Equipment</b> Rentals (VER) to accomplish the design. The lightweight and adaptability of the V9 LED screens allowed for designers to add more lighting elements than in most shows at the time.|$|E

Seattle landmarks such as Pioneer Square, the Space Needle and Elephant Car Washes feature in the game. The developers licensed logos and signs from local businesses. Griesemer called the game world an [...] "abstraction" [...] of Seattle rather than a re-creation since its layout did not suit Second Sons gameplay and required the team to make necessary changes. The team wanted to thematically explore Seattle's heritage of Pacific Northwest, Native American tribes in the game.|$|E
