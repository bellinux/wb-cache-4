Scholarly interest into VFR travel developed in the mid 1990s after Jackson’s (1990) [...] seminal article suggested {{that this type of}} tourism was much larger than official estimates suggested. [...] Most official data collections differentiate travel as being for either leisure, business, or VFR purposes. In many destinations, VFR is the largest or second-largest form of travel by size. Definitions have been traditionally lacking due to the complexities involved in understanding VFR travel. VFR travellers can state a VFR purpose of visit but that {{does not necessarily mean that}} they are staying with those friends / relatives. Similarly, they may be accommodated by friends / relatives although have a different purpose of visit.|$|E

Overseas visiting friends and relatives (<b>VFR)</b> <b>tourism</b> is largely an urban phenomenon and is consequently less seasonal than vacation tourism.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on the linkages between tourism and migration. Though it is widely recognised that the two phenomena are closely linked, and that migration may induce visiting friends and relatives) tourism (VFR), there has been little econometric evaluation of the relationship. The present analysis draws upon Australian data to identify a strong quantitative link between migration and <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism.</b> It also demonstrates a strong link between migration and other forms of tourism. Indeed the latter are almost equally as strong as the links between migration and <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism.</b> This unexpected finding has implications for policymakers and for conceptualising the migration-tourism relationship.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} profiles {{and characteristics of}} VFR travellers relative to non- VFR travellers in one tourist destination. It uses a <b>VFR</b> whole <b>tourism</b> system approach to explain more about VFR traveller behaviour. It {{is the relationship between}} the traveller (VFR) and the other tourism elements, through the VFR host, that this research considers. VFR travellers are not just visiting friends and/or relations. They may also use services provided by tourism industries, although to what degree has historically attracted little research. This study employs both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine this relationship. The quantitative research was undertaken in Australia’s Sunshine Coast and involved a survey of both visitors and residents in the Sunshine Coast. The qualitative research component was provided at a nationwide level, conducted by indepth interviews with the managers of the Regional Tourism Organisations (RTOs) throughout Australia. This allowed an examination of how VFR travel was regarded by RTO managers and what marketing strategies were in place to reach VFR travellers across the various RTOs in Australia. The {{results of this study suggest}} that VFR and non-VFR travellers came from different generating regions and travelled by different transit routes to reach the Sunshine Coast. Therefore, generic marketing campaigns aimed at the leisure market would be unlikely to be effective in capturing VFR travellers. VFR travellers surveyed were active tourists, undertaking a wide range of activities to a similar extent as non-VFR travellers. In fact, when VFR hosts’ expenditures were combined with VFR expenditures and compared against non-VFR travellers, there was no significant difference between the total expenditures. Thus, the importance of VFR travel to the local community of the Sunshine Coast is clear. One significant contribution of this study has been the development of three VFR models (The VFR Trilogy) to provide a foundation to improve understanding of VFR behaviour. VFR travel is a significant although little understood component of tourism. Therefore, this area of travel needs to be elevated to greater prominence in order for it to be understood well enough for it to be given greater attention by academics. Through doing so, it is more likely to be taught to future tourism marketers and tourism managers in order for it to receive the recognition the segment deserves. With VFR travel barely rating more than a cursory mention in core tourism texts and failing to even rate a place in the index of others, it is hardly surprising that VFR is regularly left off the higher education teaching syllabus for tourism units, resulting in the continual neglect of VFR travel as a worthwhile area of focus. The trilogy of VFR models may assist in providing the necessary tools to explain and teach VFR travel to future tourism students, so that VFR travel can be more than well-known but also known well...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the desire}} for visiting friends and {{relatives}} (VFR) has been examined in previous studies. Yet, research on the antecedences and consequences of social interaction between host and guest in <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> has not received enough attention. Addressing this gap, this study introduces ceremonious politeness (CP) by tourists in consuming food as a cultural code that facilitates the establishment of a communally arranged form of social interaction. Using a mixed methods scale-development approach (e. g., Delphi technique, qualitative interviews, and surveys) during fourteen months in 2015 - 2016, it develops and validates a CP scale to measure the impact of self-accountability and perceived others' control on tourists' sense of self-blame in social interaction situation related to consuming food in <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism.</b> The study contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing the concept of CP in a non-commercial setting...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work on the}} {{application}} of structural equation modelling to tourism demand analysis is extended by examining more varied origin-destination pairs, in particular those involving longer travel distances and fewer direct economic ties. The main potential economic determinants of international tourist flows disaggregated into holidays, business visits and visits to friends and relatives (VFR) are examined simultaneously using structural equation modelling. The tourist flows studied are inbound tourism to New Zealand from Australia, Japan, the UK and USA. The empirical results show that international trade plays the major role in influencing business tourism demand, retail sales are the major influence on the demand for foreign holidays, and new private car registrations are the major determinant of <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> demand. Comparison of the previous and current studies demonstrates the consistent importance of international trade in influencing business tourism, and origin income and destination price in influencing <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{piece of}} early-stage {{postgraduate}} research on Visiting Friends and Relatives (<b>VFR)</b> <b>tourism.</b> It aims to explore the potential economic and cultural value of this form of tourism, to critique its internal and external influences, and to understand emigrant/diasporic tourist behaviour and experiences, especially in relation to cultural tourism activities and motivations. Cultural heritage and movement (both spatial and temporal) provide the contextual backdrop for analytical exploration. Preliminary literature discusses VFR, (a World Travel Organization classification of tourism) cultural and heritage tourism; migration, diaspora and identity; and tourism motivation theory. Much has been written about cultural-heritage tourism and about <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> but little in terms of their interrelationship. This study will analyze the processes through which VFR and related cultural-heritage tourism takes place and examine the activities, experiences and deeper meanings associated with it. The proposed methodology will utilise both quantitative and qualitative strategies. A tri-partite approach will be undertaken: focus groups, questionnaires and in-depth individual interviews with both European (Irish) and Non-European (Chinese) migrants resident in London who undertake <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism.</b> Questionnaires and interviews will explore ‘internal’ factors such as: gender, length of migration, travel behaviour (spend, time, accommodation used, activities, attractions) and ‘external’ factors such as; marketing, exposure to media/ internet, and family influences. Additional narratives will be constructed on issues relating to cultural connectivity, tourism as a form of family legacy, and ‘home’. Collectively the proposed methodology will assess tourist patterns/behaviours and motives across two different cultural groups and also analyse tourism operator perspectives on this market. Formative feedback on this presentation will be very beneficial to the research...|$|E
40|$|Visiting Friends and Relatives (<b>VFR)</b> <b>tourism</b> is {{a segment}} of tourism that suffers from neglect, an absence of true {{recognition}} {{and a lack of}} appreciation. In order to find out the validity of these concepts in regards to the situation of Niue, a case study was conducted based on primary research that encompassed a thorough collection of secondary and primary data through field research. This field research included surveys, and semi-structured and non-structured interviews. This was combined with an analysis of secondary data from statistics, literature, websites, magazines, brochures and the media. Participants of the survey were selected from VFR travellers in Niue. The interviewees who participated in the in-depth interviews were selected from a diverse range of sources such as accommodation and service providers, local residents, officials from government and tourism authorities, and VFR travellers from New Zealand. This method of data collection was intended to gather important information from different points of view, in order to achieve a broad overview of the issue. The aim {{of the study was to}} cover the gap in the academic literature about the nature and role of <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> in Niue. Furthermore, it was intended to investigate the nature of economic contribution to sustainable economic development and the role of VFR travellers in the preservation of the fading culture in Niue. In the case of Niue, this study found that <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> not only plays an important role in the survival of the culture and language, but also, because of the nature and continuity of motivational factors and the purpose of travel, it could contribute towards the sustainability of tourism in the long term. Furthermore, the non-measurable economic contribution, such as the skills and knowledge brought in by VFR to the livelihood of the population, is an important factor in the economic development of Niue...|$|E
40|$|Tourism is {{becoming}} an important sector with {{a great impact on}} economic development. Tourists form a heterogeneous group of visitors with significantly different spending patterns. This paper addresses the economic importance of a particular class of tourists, viz. those visiting friends and relatives (VFR). After a review of the literature, this paper offers an empirical case study of <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> with reference to Surinam. The findings show that the economic impacts of tourist visits to friends and relatives are by no means negligible, but represent a heterogeneous spending pattern. tourism; Surinam; consumer behaviour...|$|E

A questionnaire survey conducted at a UK university {{is presented in the}} context of general UK tourism and the visits to friends and relatives (VFR) sector in particular. It is demonstrated that universities represent large, frequently underestimated, generators of <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> and that significant differences exist between the friends and the relatives' components. The paper draws concrete conclusions about the marketing opportunities and argues that the students themselves represent the most effective target for promotion efforts. It also points out possibilities for turning day visits into overnight stays, particularly in the relatives' segment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{travel behavior}} and expenditure patterns of Chinese university {{students and the}} associated VFRs in New Zealand. It also investigates the effects of socio-demographics, travel-related, and psychographic variables on travel behavior and expenditure patterns. The thesis involves both interviews and questionnaire surveys with Chinese university students. Analysis of the interviews {{was based on a}} Cat-Pac method, while analysis of survey questionnaires was using SPSS 14. 0. From a theoretical perspective, this study contributes to the body of literature on segmentation regarding the student travel market. It shows {{that it is possible to}} segment the Chinese university student travel market based on travel motivation and activity attributes of New Zealand. In addition, this study also contributes to the body of literature in relation to travel behavior and expenditure patterns by examining the variables identified in predicting travel behavior and expenditure. The results of this study provide a more comprehensive and holistic picture in the search of travel behavior and expenditure patterns regarding the student travel market. This study finds travel motivation contributes to overall travel satisfaction directly or indirectly via travel activities, which affects the loyalty. In terms of the VFR market, the valid existence of the effect of travel inhibitors on satisfaction is confirmed in this study, which affects the likelihood of further VFR trips in the future. Moreover, this study makes contribution to the role of students as catalysts for inbound <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> to New Zealand. This study also finds that a socio-demographic variable (i. e. immigration status) is the most influential variable affecting student tourism expenditure, while the socio-demographic variable (i. e. age) and travel-related variables (i. e. purpose of visit and length of stay) appear to have significant impacts on <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> expenditure. Further, this study suggests the VFR market is far from homogeneous. From a practical standpoint, this study sheds light by providing information about travel behavior and expenditure patterns of Chinese university students and their VFRs in New Zealand, and how their socio-demographics and trip characteristics affects travel satisfaction and travel expenditure pattern. Destination marketers may use this information to better segment their target market, allocate their marketing dollars more effectively, tailor their products to compete with other destination countries and develop better strategic marketing tools to satisfy and fulfill needs of Chinese university students and their VFRs and understand certain reasons behind their travel behavior and spending patterns. In addition, because Chinese university students are a significant market segment for New Zealand's <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> industry, promotional campaigns encouraging them to invite friends and relatives and informing them of activities in which they can engage with their VFRs are encouraged...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In South Africa {{the major}} share of tourism and its {{benefits}} flows geographically to metropolitan areas and secondary cities. Across the international experience tourism is recognised {{as a critical}} sector for economic development in small towns and rural areas. In common with the international trends tourism is increasingly identified as a potential driver for small town economic diversification {{as well as for}} promoting rural development in South Africa. Against this policy backdrop the paper examines the nature of tourism development and flows which are occurring outside of South Africa’s cities. An analysis of data extracted from the Global Insight tourism base provides a macro-view of tourism trends beyond that of South Africa’s metropolitan areas and secondary cities. It is revealed that whereas tourism destinations outside the cities account for 43. 5 percent of total tourism trips these areas capture only 31 percent of total tourism spending. Tourism flows outside the cities are strongly dominated by domestic rather than international travellers. In terms of purpose of travel, visiting friends and relatives (<b>VFR)</b> <b>tourism</b> is the most important; small towns and rural areas are destinations for 50 percent of all VFR travel in South Africa. The results of this analysis have implications for tourism-led planning for local development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{understanding of}} tourism mobility trajectories and outcomes by discussing if {{the trajectory of}} tourism mobility is path-dependent or path-creating and, therefore, whether tourism is locked into existing sub-optimal pathways, or is there scope for creating significantly more sustainable future pathways. Tourism mobilities are understood {{in the context of}} overall shifts in corporeal mobilities, especially the impact of migration on networks and visiting friends and relatives (<b>VFR)</b> <b>tourism.</b> Four main tourism mobilities drivers are considered-technology, markets, cultures of mobility and state intervention-but their impact on mobilities is contested. The concepts of enfolded and substitutable mobilities, and of scapes and flows, are explained and used as intermediary concepts for engaging with the key relationships influencing tourism mobilities. Path dependency is shown to be backed by existing technologies, cultures and markets, together with deeply embedded scapes and substantial investments in existing infrastructure. Trends towards path creation are shown to depend on technological breakthroughs, including virtual tourism, alternative lifestyles bringing cultural change, market conditions brought about by possible sustained high oil prices, and state intervention leading to behavioural change. The concept of "path-dependent path-creation" is discussed along with the powerful influence of uncertainties and unknown future tipping-points. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|A general {{trend in}} the study of {{international}} retirement migration has been the increased attention paid to the social contacts and network connections of the migrants in both the destination and the origin areas. These studies have examined the extent to which migrants build social relationships with their neighbours and the host society while also maintaining social links with their countries of origin, addressing the central role that leisure travel plays in sustaining increasingly dispersed social networks and maintaining the social capital of these networks and of the individuals involved in them. Using a case study approach to examine British retirement migration to Spain, we explore the relevance of transnational social networks in the context of international retirement migration, particularly the intensity of bidirectional visiting friends and relatives (<b>VFR)</b> <b>tourism</b> flows and the migrants’ social contacts with friends and/or family back in their home country. Building on the concept of social capital and Putnam's distinction between bonding and bridging social capital, we propose a framework for the analysis of the migrants’ international social networks. The results of a study conducted based on a sample of 365 British retirees living in the coast of Alicante (Spain) show both the strength of the retirees’ international bonding social capital and the role of ‘VFR's travel and communication technologies in sustaining the migrants’ transnational social practices and, ultimately, their international bonding social capital. It also provides evidence for the reinforcing links between tourism-related mobility and amenity-seeking migration in later life. This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Education Mobility Programme [SB 2006 - 0058]...|$|E
40|$|International {{migration}} {{for people}} in the Pacific has become a cultural and economic voyage in which identities are challenged and questioned. With the evolution of transport technology, the modern era has provided a more efficient form of transport. This study contributes to the theorising of relationships between Pacific migrants and ‘home’ in ways other than through remittances. Exploring the unique role of Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) and the cultural aspects associated with such travel, is a component that is often neglected or ignored in tourism literature. This study examines what tauhi vā (to take care of socio-spatial relationships between kin and kin like members) might mean {{from the perspective of the}} Tongan diaspora and how <b>VFR</b> <b>tourism</b> may contribute to maintaining cultural relations between home and Tongans living overseas. It also seeks to investigate the experiences of Tongan migrants returning to Tonga to attend a cultural village event. The participants in this research attended a week long village event “foki ki ‘api” (returning home). Using the framework of Kakala and Talanoa as a method to capture and give privilege to the voices of the returning migrants, VFR travel as a sub sector is useful for the strengthening of cultural and family relationships. It is also useful in validating the understanding of motivational factors behind the purpose of travel which could contribute to the sustainability of tourism in Tonga. The strengthening of cultural and family relations allows people from the home to renew, build and reconnect with their families overseas; the elusive space that connects one person to another. Furthermore, the Tongan culture and way of living plays a vital role in maintaining the ties and relations as seen in tauhi vā...|$|E
