5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the <b>vessel</b> <b>wall,</b> leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of vasospasms and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall)</b> directly into the artery. Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause venous thrombosis. With arterial thrombosis, blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of venous thrombosis {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E

5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall,</b> and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall.</b> However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} this {{situation}} is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of the}} serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall,</b> heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

25|$|Aneurysm {{means an}} outpouching of a blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> that {{is filled with}} blood. Aneurysms occur at a point of {{weakness}} in the <b>vessel</b> <b>wall.</b> This can be because of acquired disease or hereditary factors. The repeated trauma of blood flow against the <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> presses against the point of weakness and causes the aneurysm to enlarge. As described by the Law of Young-Laplace, the increasing area increases tension against the aneurysmal walls, leading to enlargement.|$|E
25|$|Aneurysms {{form for}} a variety of {{interacting}} reasons. Multiple factors, including factors affecting a blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> and the blood through the vessel, contribute.|$|E
25|$|Breakdown {{of parts}} of the <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> in these {{conditions}} is thought to result from an imbalance between proteinases (cysteine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases, increased) and their inhibitors (such as cystatin C, decreased).|$|E

25|$|Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille {{relations}} {{suggests that}} radial growth occurs {{as a result}} of circumferential stretch and circumferential growth {{occurs as a result}} of shear stress. Shear stress is proportional to the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the <b>vessel</b> <b>wall.</b> The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be high stress on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform compressive and tensile stress {{on both sides of the}} <b>vessel</b> <b>wall.</b> Generally, it has been found that circumferential residual stress is compressive and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.|$|E

25|$|Malignant {{tumors are}} also {{subdivided}} histopathologically into those showing blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> invasion {{and those that}} do not. Without blood <b>vessel</b> <b>wall</b> invasion there is a better prognosis. Dogs with noninvasive adenocarcinomas have an average survival time of two years, while dogs with invasive adenocarcinomas have an average survival time of one year. Tumor size also affects the prognosis, in that dogs with tumors greater than five centimeters have a greater chance of lymph node metastasis. Tumor type is also important. Sarcomas and carcinosarcomas carry an average survival time of nine to twelve months. Inflammatory carcinomas have a very poor prognosis, and have usually metastasized by the time of diagnosis. Metastasis for any malignant mammary tumor is usually to the regional lymph nodes and lungs.|$|E
25|$|Arterial {{thrombosis}} is {{the formation}} of a thrombus within an artery.

Arterial embolism occurs when clots then migrate downstream, and can affect any organ.|$|E
25|$|Like velcro, {{carbohydrate}} ligands on the circulating leukocytes bind to selectin molecules on {{the inner}} wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity.
