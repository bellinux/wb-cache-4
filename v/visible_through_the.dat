5|$|The spores of Myxogastria are haploid, mainly {{round and}} measure between 5µm and 20µm, rarely up to 24µm in diameter. Their surface is {{generally}} reticular, sharp, warty or spiky and very rarely smooth. The typical colour of the spore mass becomes <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> structure, since the spores {{themselves are not}} pigmented. In some species, especially of the genus Badhamia, the spores produce lumps. The colour, shape and diameter of spores are important characteristics for identifying species.|$|E
5|$|The base {{color of}} the living animal is very pale subtranslucent yellow. The mantle, kidney, and {{hepatopancreas}} are <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> shell but are often slightly obscured by {{the thickness of the}} shell. The dorsal surface of the mantle is pale yellow, tinted with olive, often marked with black streaks and blotches. Over the hepatopancreas is a golden yellow tessellation that is marked with gray or black spots and streaks. A dark marking on the posterior surface of the foot is distinctive. However, the mark is not present on the hatchlings, making them impossible to identify in the field. The mark becomes obvious once the snail reaches approximately 6 to 9mm in length.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was {{intended}} by Etty {{to illustrate the}} virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart {{as he prepares to}} kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she draws her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.|$|E

5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is heart- or trowel-shaped and slightly wider than long. A pair of large, kidney-shaped electric organs are <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> skin {{on either side}} of the head. The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles, which have seven to ten small, rounded projections on their rims. The snout is broadly rounded, with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut. Between the nostrils is a curtain of skin with a smooth to gently wavy posterior margin. The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped, and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw. The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. Five pairs of small gill slits are present on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|Towards 15:00, {{after hours}} of resistance, the Russian army was in dire straits, but the French forces were {{exhausted}} and had neither the necessary stamina nor the necessary will to carry out another assault. At this crucial juncture, Murat's chief of staff, General Augustin Daniel Belliard rode straight to the Emperor's Headquarters and, according to General Ségur who wrote {{an account of the}} campaign, told him that the Russian line had been breached, that the road to Mozhaysk, behind the Russian line, was <b>visible</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gaping hole the French attack had pierced, that an enormous crowd of runaways and vehicles were hastily retreating, and that a final push would be enough to decide the fate of the Russian army and of the war. Generals Daru, Dumas and Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier also joined in and told the Emperor that everyone thought the time had come for the Guard to be committed to battle.|$|E
