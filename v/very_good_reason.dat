The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.|$|E
25|$|Sparta's {{interference}} and {{invasion of}} Thebes in 382 BC gave the latter a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> {{to join the}} league. However her behaviour within the league became difficult and Athens started to realise that Thebes was not necessarily to be trusted. For example, Thebes destroyed Plataea in 372 BC, which had only recently been refounded. Athens started to think about negotiating peace with Sparta; it was while Athens was discussing this with Sparta that Thebes defeated the Spartan army conclusively at Battle of Leuctra (371 BC).|$|E

The Prince suddenly imagines his beloved nephew dead in the garden with his guts trailing out like the Crown soldier, and tries to dissuade him from departing. Tancredi, however, insists that he is fighting for a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Later, as the Prince gets dressed, he realizes the practicality of Tancredi's words. As he ponders the coming upheavals, he realizes that his nephew is more aristocratically like-minded than he thought.|$|E

25|$|Gamay Beaujolais is a Californian misnomer for a UCD clone {{series of}} upright-growing ('Pinot droit') Pinot noir. Planted mostly in California it also became {{established}} in New Zealand. In this latter country, its disposition to poor fruit set in cool flowering conditions can be problematic. Claims that the 'Gamay Beaujolais' Pinot noir {{was brought to}} California by Paul Masson. are not correct. It was collected in France by Harold Olmo for UCD in the 1950s {{and was one of}} the first Pinot noir vines this institution offered as a high health clonal line from about 1962 onward. However, it was misleadingly identified at UCD as a 'Gamay Beaujolais' type (of Pinot noir). In general, these upright growing 'Pinot droit' clones are highly productive (in suitable, hot-to-warm, flowering conditions) and in California and New Zealand they give robust, burly, wines favored by those who like muscle rather than charm and velvety finesse in their Pinot noir wines. In Burgundy, the use of (highly productive) Pinot droit clones is reportedly still widespread in inferior, Village appellation, or even non-appellation, vineyards and Pinot droit is consequently regarded, arguably with <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason,</b> as a (genetic) sub-form significantly inferior to classical, decumbent, 'Pinot fine' or 'Pinot tordu', clonal lines of Pinot.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{argument}} for Al-Kateb centred {{on the fact that}} he was a stateless man. Kateb's lawyer, O'Connor, noted that the provisions in the Migration Act about refugees were based on the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, both of which overlooked the situation of stateless persons. Several exchanges during the hearings illustrated the way in which the usual processes of the immigration system were not adapted well, if at all, to dealing with stateless people. In one such exchange, O'Connor referred to Al-Kateb both by his name and by the identifier used on the formal documents, [...] "SHDB" [...] (in matters concerning asylum seekers, names are usually suppressed in order to prevent persecution should they return to their country of origin). After some debate about whether to suppress Al-Kateb's name, Justice Kirby said that [...] "there often is a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason...</b> because people suffer great risks if their name goes on the Internet that that will become known to the country that they want to avoid," [...] to which Al-Kateb's lawyer replied, [...] "That is correct, but, of course, with Mr Al-Kateb there is no country." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Brian Howard of The Journal News {{described it}} as [...] "classic Office" [...] and praised the camaraderie the staff showed {{for each other and}} the [...] "bizarre discomfort" [...] of the double date with Jim, Pam, Phyllis and Bob. Howard described Dwight and Kevin as the episode's stand-outs. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the episode lacked many laugh-out-loud moments, but was effective because the characters are so well developed: [...] "The Office has, over the years, become as much of a kitchen sink drama as it is a comedy. ... The characters are so well-drawn by now, {{and for the most part}} so likable, that a sweet, low-key episode about Michael and the staff bonding over their singlehood worked even without a lot of memorable jokes." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN described the episode as [...] "familiar territory, but it has plenty of fun moments." [...] Fickett praised the scene with Carell and the mystery woman, and Jim and Pam's lunch. But Fickett said the series needed to address why Pam was staying with the company: [...] "Jim and Pam still work there because, well, that's part of the show – but there really isn't a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> as to why these two would still be at this dead end job." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{patrons of}} these artists were most often monastic establishments or wealthy {{families}} endowing a church. Because the paintings often had devotional purpose, the clients tended to be conservative. Frequently, it would seem, the wealthier the client, the more conservative the painting. There was a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for this. The paintings that were commissioned made a statement about the patron. Thus the more gold leaf [...] it displayed, the more it spoke to the patron's glory. The other valuable commodities in the paint-box were lapis lazuli and vermilion. Paint made from these colours did not lend itself to a tonal treatment. The azure blue made of powdered lapis lazuli went on flat, the depth and brilliance of colour being, like the gold leaf, {{a sign of the}} patron's ability to provide well. For these reasons, altarpieces are often much more conservatively painted than frescoes, which were often of almost life-sized figures and relied upon a stage-set quality rather than lavish display in order to achieve effect.|$|E
2500|$|While at Cambridge, Sharp {{heard the}} lectures of William Morris {{and became a}} Fabian Socialist and lifelong vegetarian. He was {{cautious}} in his public statements, however, feeling that he had much to lose, since, unlike Morris, he was not independently wealthy but dependent on outside funding for his researches. Respectability was important to him, increasingly so as he got older. According to his biographer, Maud Karpeles: [...] "Any display of singularity was displeasing to him; and he followed the convention in behaviour {{as well as in}} appearance unless there was a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> for departing from them. 'It saves so much trouble,' he would say." [...] During the post World War II [...] "second" [...] British folk revival of the 1950s and 60s, Sharp was occasionally chided for this by leftist critics such as Bert Lloyd. C. J. Bearman writes that [...] "Lloyd was effectively the first to offer public criticism of Sharp and of the first revival generally. This critique was from a Marxist perspective: Lloyd (1908-82) had associated himself with the Communist Party since the 1930s. ... However, he was always more pragmatic than doctrinaire, and he combined criticism of Sharp's philosophy and methods with high and unreserved praise for his motivation and the epic scale of his achievement.|$|E
