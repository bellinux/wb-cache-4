50|$|Until the 1950s, guns firing {{ballistic}} munitions {{ranging from}} 20 mm to 150 mm were the standard weapons; guided missiles then became dominant, {{except at the}} <b>very</b> <b>shortest</b> ranges (as with close-in weapon systems, which typically use rotary autocannons or, in very modern systems, surface-to-air adaptations of short range air-to-air missiles).|$|R
5|$|Nightjars are {{medium-sized}} ground-nesting nocturnal {{birds with}} long wings, short legs and <b>very</b> <b>short</b> bills. Most have small feet, {{of little use}} for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves.|$|E

5|$|Nightjars are {{medium-sized}} nocturnal {{birds that}} usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and <b>very</b> <b>short</b> bills.

60|$|The grounds, I was told, {{are full}} of {{beautiful}} paths and seats, favorite walks and lounges of the poet; but the obdurate pertinacity of the rain compelled us to choose the <b>very</b> <b>shortest</b> path possible to the carriage.

50|$|This {{proof is}} constructive. That is, given a tautology, one could {{actually}} follow the instructions {{and create a}} proof {{of it from the}} axioms. However, the length of such a proof increases exponentially with the number of propositional variables in the tautology, hence it is not a practical method for any but the <b>very</b> <b>shortest</b> tautologies.|$|R

5|$|Swifts {{are small}} birds which spend the {{majority}} of their lives flying. These birds have <b>very</b> <b>short</b> legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang.|$|E
5|$|The alpine meadows {{continue}} into the harsh alpine tundra zone, where poor soil, heavy snowfall, cold temperatures, and a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> growing season discourage {{all but the}} hardiest sedge grasses, heathers, and lichens.|$|E

50|$|Short short {{films are}} {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} a category of their own. The International Festival of <b>Very</b> <b>Shorts</b> is a festival based in Paris, which shows only movies less than three minutes long. Filminute, the international one-minute film festival, has presented and promoted a collection of one-minute films across multiple media since September 2006. FILMSshort.com also categorizes films under five minutes. They are known for their conciseness and entertainment value.|$|R

40|$|Targets of {{iron and}} {{stainless}} steel were irradiated by laser pulses of 0, 5 ns to 30 ns in the intensity range 1011 to 1015 W/cm 2. Microstructural modifications were investigated by optical and transmission electron rnicroscopy in addition to microhardness measurements. Shock pressure induced in targets can vary from 0, 1 Mbar to 60 Mbar. Metallurgical effects induced by laser shock {{are very similar to}} those obtained by conventionnal shock in spite of <b>very</b> <b>shorter</b> pulse durations...|$|R
5|$|The <b>very</b> <b>short</b> prologue {{contained}} three sharp corners. The {{first two}} kilometers were slightly uphill, {{the third one}} was slightly downhill and the rest was flat.|$|E
5|$|A scene between Skinner and The Smoking Man {{was removed}} from the final cut due to time considerations, {{reducing}} his role in the episode to a <b>very</b> <b>short</b> dialogue-less appearance. Another scene where Mulder questions Skinner's allegiance was also removed when it was viewed as too combative. The episode title means the incarnation of a deity in Sanskrit.|$|E
5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and <b>very</b> <b>short</b> in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull {{was nearly as}} tall as it was long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
50|$|With the {{regulator}} in place, and a finite {{value for the}} cutoff, divergent terms in the integrals then turn into finite but cutoff-dependent terms. After canceling out these terms with the contributions from cutoff-dependent counterterms, the cutoff is taken to infinity and finite physical results recovered. If physics on scales we can measure is independent of what happens at the <b>very</b> <b>shortest</b> distance and time scales, then {{it should be possible}} to get cutoff-independent results for calculations.|$|R
50|$|Vikaramaditya V (r. 1008-1015 CE) succeeded Satyashraya on the Western Chalukya throne. Vikramaditya was Satyashraya's nephew {{and had a}} <b>very</b> uneventful <b>short</b> reign.|$|R

5|$|As a {{cryogenic}} liquid, {{liquid nitrogen}} {{can be dangerous}} by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for <b>very</b> <b>short</b> exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, {{a young woman in}} England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either <b>very</b> <b>short</b> English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is better}} {{described}} as a non-contact force field having a finite range, albeit <b>very</b> <b>short.</b> In 1968, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electro-weak force.|$|E
40|$|As the {{financial}} crisis deepened and unsecured interbank markets effectively shut down, repo market activity became increasingly concentrated in the <b>very</b> <b>shortest</b> maturities and against the highest-quality collateral. Repo rates for US Treasury collateral fell relative to overnight index swap rates, while comparable sovereign repo rates in the euro area and the United Kingdom rose. The different dynamics across markets reflected, among other things, differences in the intensity of market disruptions {{and the extent of}} the scarcity of sovereign collateral. ...|$|R

Now originality is fatal to the Bengali. Debendra Nath should have stayed with his brother, who rode steadfastly for Jumala on the railway-line, thanking gods entirely unknown to the most catholic of universities that he had not taken charge of the district, and could still--happy resource of a fertile race!--fall sick.|$|R
