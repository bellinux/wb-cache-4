500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female <b>voice</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's <b>voice</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Stay here and sing for me.

500|$|In 2006, {{speculation}} began that Busch Gardens Tampa Bay {{would be}} removing the floors from SheiKra's trains. On January 31, 2007, the park confirmed the rumors {{at a press}} conference that was also broadcast on the internet. In late April 2007, a month before the temporary closure of the ride, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay placed billboards along Interstate 275 and advertisements in newspapers announcing that SheiKra's floors would soon be removed.

500|$|Benedict Cumberbatch's {{performance}} in Star Trek Into Darkness drew praise from critics with Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine {{calling it a}} [...] "tour-de-force to be reckoned with" [...] and his character [...] "a villain for the ages". Joe Neumaier of New York's Daily News wrote that Cumberbatch delivered [...] "one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory". Jonathan Romney of The Independent specifically noted Cumberbatch's <b>voice</b> <b>saying</b> it was [...] "So sepulchrally resonant {{that it could have}} been synthesised from the combined timbres of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Alan Rickman holding an elocution contest down a well."

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{selected}} the track as an album pick, but {{stated that the}} honest songs on Unbroken, including [...] "Fix a Heart", [...] "Skyscraper" [...] and [...] "For the Love of a Daughter", were similar {{to the content of}} Lindsay Lohan's record A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005). He also criticized Lovato's <b>voice,</b> <b>saying</b> that she [...] "doesn't quite have the pipes to sing [...] without straining". In contrast, Joe DeAndrea of AbsolutePunk wrote, [...] "Lovato's vocals are unmatched – not only compared to her previous efforts, but the majority of vocalists in general. [...] The emotion throughout tracks like 'Lightweight' and 'Fix a Heart' show the true compassion within her voice as you can feel her heartache pouring out of the speakers". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy called it [...] "one of the purest, rawest songs" [...] on the record.|$|E

500|$|The album's songs also feature offbeat sounds, improvisational elements, and {{conversational}} vocals {{derived from}} rap. The Revival {{begins with a}} directive from a grave voice: [...] "Play this record as frequently as possible, Then, as it becomes easier for you, play the record once a day, or as needed." [...] The album also features dialogue between an old lady who asks the group {{whether it will be}} like their last album, on which she was also featured; they respond to her question [...] "No, ma'am". [...] "All the Way" [...] has a scrambling beat, whistle sounds, and the rhythmic call and response [...] "What are we, what are we, what are we? ... Just a bunch of brothers having a party". The end of [...] "Feels Good" [...] features witty jazz keyboard playing behind a lively <b>voice</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "it feels good ... in the hands, feet, bones, heart, and soul".

500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of Rajneesh's muffled <b>voice</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people had to die. The investigation uncovered a September 25, 1984, invoice from the American Type Culture Collection of microbes, showing an order received by the Rajneeshpuram laboratory for Salmonella typhi, the bacterium that causes the life-threatening illness typhoid fever.|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a <b>voice</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E

500|$|During the Zoo TV Tour, {{clips of}} [...] "Zooropa" [...] were played during the {{beginning}} of the show. The clips included the lyric [...] "What do you want?" [...] repeated twice, which was displayed on video screens in various languages, and interspersed with a <b>voice</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "It's very simple". This part of the opening segment was intended to create confusion among the audience regarding the show's message, and eventually lead to information overload. [...] U2 performed [...] "Zooropa" [...] live at three consecutive concerts during the fourth leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1993. Bono originally discussed how the song would be played live during the album's recording sessions, saying that The Edge's guitar riffs may be extended in concert. The song debuted live at a concert in Glasgow in August 1993, and was performed {{in the middle of the}} set list following [...] "Numb". The live version was much shorter than the album version, skipping the piano intro, as well as the first three verses, starting with the line [...] "I have no compass, and I have no map". U2 had difficulty performing the song live, which Bono acknowledged to the audience following its debut. According to the book U2 Live: A Concert Documentary, the song's first performance sounded [...] "shaky" [...] and needed more rehearsal, although its subsequent Zoo TV performances [...] "sound better". Adam Clayton suggested performing the song as the show opener during the rehearsals for the tour's fifth and final Zoomerang leg, but it was not performed again on the tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} has a simple layout with a 180 ft drop at 87 degrees, meaning {{it does not}} have a true {{vertical}} drop. [...] The car slowly ascends 60 feet at a 45 degree angle to build tension, then levels out, slowly travelling around a curve on a unique chain system, seen only on Oblivion, as the cars approach the drop. As each car reaches the drop it is held by a holding chain for a maximum of five seconds, giving the rider {{a clear view of the}} long drop, before a brake is released allowing the car to drop into the tunnel. This is followed by a highly banked turn that climbs up and makes the train lie on its side as it goes through. Then after dropping out of the turn the train climbs over a small rise in the track to the brakes, slowing down, and then pulls around back to the station. The open design cars accommodate sixteen passengers in two rows of eight. The back row is slightly raised to give passengers a clear view of the drop. A pre-recorded and disembodied <b>voice</b> <b>saying</b> 'don't look down' was played just before release. In 2004, this sound effect was removed due to sound restrictions on the park and instead the words [...] "Don't look down" [...] have been painted on the floor of the guest observation area where the ride enters the ground. The words are clearly visible to riders when the train is hanging over the edge of the drop.|$|E
