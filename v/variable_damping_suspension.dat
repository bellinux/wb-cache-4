40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in the paper was to illustrate the application of fuzzy-logic techniques to the control of a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> automotive <b>suspension</b> system. The study was analytical and involved {{the use of a}} multibody (MBS) model of a passenger car. The model included the dominant vehicle nonlinearities in the kinematic behaviour and the force characteristics, as well as realistic representations of the actuating, sensing and control systems of the <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> system. The fuzzy-logic controller has four inputs involving both vehicle response parameters and driver inputs and one output being the selected damping rate. The compositional rule of inference was applied in the controller described, and two methods of defuzzification were used, mean of maxima and centroid. The paper describes the model and controller used in the study and discusses the vehicle response results obtained from a range of road and driver input simulations. Finally, some conclusions as {{to the success of the}} control design techniques and resultant controller are drawn...|$|R
40|$|As the {{vibration}} of high speed train becomes fierce {{when the train}} runs at high speed, {{it is crucial to}} develop a novel suspension system to negotiate train’s vibration. This paper presents a novel suspension based on Magnetorheological fluid (MRF) damper and MRF based smart air spring. The MRF damper is used to generate <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> while the smart air spring is used to generate field-dependent stiffness. In this paper, the two kind smart devices, MRF dampers and smart air spring, are developed firstly. Then the dynamic performances of these two devices are tested by MTS. Based on the testing results, the two devices are equipped to a high speed train which is built in ADAMS. The skyhook control algorithm is employed to control the novel suspension. In order to compare {{the vibration}} suppression capability of the novel suspension with other kind suspensions, three other different suspension systems are also considered and simulated in this paper. The other three kind <b>suspensions</b> are <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> with fixed stiffness suspension, variable stiffness with fixed <b>damping</b> <b>suspension</b> and passive suspension.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to provide a systematic probe into necessity of the active suspension based on LQG control for supplying some reference to optimal design of the suspension based on LQG control.

So there is a probability that performance of the semi-active suspension based on LQG control can be very close to the active one when the basal damp is small. When the basal damp is small, the simulation shows quadratic performance index of the semi-active suspension based on LQG control is only 1. 76 % bigger than that of the active one.

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of <b>suspension</b> <b>damper,</b> {{semi-active}} dampers with only minimal power requirement could be applied to achieve <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> to enhance <b>suspension</b> performance under complex vibration and shock environments. Magneto-rheological (MR) fluid based dampers offer significant potential for realizing semi-actively controlled <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> with only minimal power. The MR-fluid dampers invariably exhibit considerable hysteresis, while the damping force varies with the intensity of applied electro-magnetic field and the nature of vibration in a highly nonlinear manner. A simulation model based on symmetric and asymmetric sigmoid functions is developed to fully characterize the properties of a MR-damper as function of excitation and control current. A comprehensive laboratory test program is undertaken to characterize the damping properties of a MR damper under wide ranges of excitations and control current. The essential fundamental features are identified for the modeling task, while the model parameters are identified using multi-parameter error minimization techniques. The validity of the proposed generic model is thoroughly examined by comparing the model response with the measured data under a wide range of excitations, particularly the force saturation and the hysteresis behaviour. An independent current function is further derived that could be integrated to reported regression-based hysteresis models to enhance their prediction abilities. From the results of the study, it is concluded that the refined Bouc-Wen and the proposed generalized sigmoid function model can fully characterized the nonlinear MR damping behaviour as function of applied current and excitation. A nonlinear analytical model of a pneumatic suspension seat including the motion limiting stops is developed for synthesis and analyses of the MR-damping control algorithms. The validity of the passive suspension seat model is thoroughly examined under various deterministic and random vibration excitations of varying intensities. The results suggest that attenuation of shock as well as vibration imposes difficulties design compromise of the passive damper. Owing to the strongly nonlinear properties of the suspension-seat and the MR-damper, such as hysteresis, saturation and end-stop impacts, a 'hi-lo' semi-active control algorithm is synthesized to realized modulation of the control current and thus the damping force following the skyhook control law. A continuous modulation function is further synthesized and integrated to ensure smooth transition between the 'hi' and 'lo' states. A relative position control is further introduced to limit the frequency and severity of shock motions caused by end-stop impacts. A set of performance measures is proposed to assess the characteristics of the semi-active and the resulting integrated controller under a wide range of excitations, including deterministic excitations of continuous and transient nature and random excitations of different vehicles. The potential performance benefits of the controller design are further investigated through a hardware-in-the-loop test and simulation program. The results are used to demonstrate the validity of the MR-damper and suspension seat models, and effectiveness of the control algorith...|$|R

A <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> control {{strategy has been}} developed for swing extension {{in order to improve}} gait symmetry and reduce energy expenditure during level ground walking. Preliminary biomechanical studies suggest that the knee utilizes a <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> control during swing extension. This thesis proposes a biologically inspired <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> control strategy which can be simplified into a piecewise function with respect to the knee angle. The <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> profile of the knee during swing extension has been modeled as an initial linear increase with respect to knee angle followed by a quadratic increase at the end of swing. A damping controller based on this proposed piecewise function has been implemented in a biomimetic, active, knee prosthesis (AAAKP) developed at MIT's Biomechatronics Lab. Preliminary studies on a unilateral, transfemoral amputee have shown that the AAAKP with the proposed damping control strategy is able to more closely emulate the damping profile of the unaffected leg, when compared to a conventional knee prosthesis (Otto Bock C-Leg®). This Initial study suggests that the proposed <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> strategy for swing extension is able to more accurately emulate the joint mechanics of the unaffected knee.

40|$|Damping in a {{multitude}} of engineering applications has a variable threshold requirement based on the input excitation given to the system. In most applications the desired system response is known but the input to the system is a time dependent function with fluctuating amplitudes and frequencies. Therefore for optimal performance the damping characteristics of a given system {{must be able to}} adapt to increase or decrease the amount of energy being absorbed by the system. In most mechanical systems (including vehicles) damping is achieved through a viscous medium; such as hydraulic oil. Although the oil is capable of absorbing the unwanted energy in the system, its passive nature limits its ability to achieve an optimal amount of damping given the excitation. To achieve the requisite functionality of variable damping; {{a multitude}} of solutions have been implemented, proposed, and evaluated at both commercial and academic research levels. These solutions have met the <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> requirements but have significant cant drawbacks associated with them. To address the shortcomings associated with the aforementioned <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> solutions, a hybrid design consisting of a conventional hydraulic damper and a linear motor topology was fused together to produce a hybrid <b>variable</b> <b>damper.</b> In this hybrid design, the oil in the system acts as bias and the linear motor topology allows for variability in the amount of damping being provided to the system. This hybrid design allows for the requisite <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> requirement to be achieved. In addition to the hybrid design being able to achieve <b>variable</b> <b>damping,</b> it has the capacity to act as a generator and also provide fail-safe operation due to the viscous bias.

40|$|In the report, the {{investigation}} of controlling helicopter-blade lead-lag vibration is described. Current practice of adding passive damping may be improved to handle large dynamic range of the blade with several peaks of vibration resonance. To minimize extra-large damping forces that may damage the control system of blade, passive dampers should have relatively small damping coefficients, which in turn limit the effectiveness. By providing <b>variable</b> <b>damping,</b> a much larger damping coefficient to suppress the vibration can be realized. If the damping force reaches the maximum allowed threshold, the damper will be automatically switched into the mode with smaller damping coefficient to maintain near-constant damping force. Furthermore, the proposed control system will also have a fail-safe feature to guarantee the basic performation of a typical passive damper. The proposed control strategy to avoid resonant regions in the frequency domain is to generate <b>variable</b> <b>damping</b> force {{in combination with the}} supporting stiffness to manipulate the restoring force and conservative energy of the controlled blade system.
