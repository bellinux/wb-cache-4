40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{understanding}} of how a phenomenon or process of collective action with regard to the negotiation in <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> can be expected to happen in a certain way, which in the end could improve our understanding of <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> implementation processes. - Design/methodology/approach – Game theory is utilized to model the structure of relations between the actors involved. Game theory is a mathematical approach to study collective decision‐making situations in which the decision makers involved have conflicting preferences. Here, the authors consider the implementation of <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> as the result of an agreement between a municipality and landowners to contribute to the costs of public infrastructure development which, in essence, is a form of collective action. - Findings – The paper is not only demonstrating the usefulness of game theoretical modelling in conceptualising relations between different stakeholders in the implementation of <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> and suggesting the best possible strategy for every stakeholder; but also observing the limitations of the methods in analyzing the behaviour of actors involved in decision‐making processes with respect to <b>value</b> <b>capturing.</b> - Originality/value – Unlike most of <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> studies which focused on either a valuation point of view (how much <b>value</b> can be <b>captured?),</b> a governance or instrumentalist point of view (which instruments can be effective for <b>value</b> <b>capturing?),</b> or a political point of view (to whom belongs the increment value that is the result of government investments or decisions?) – this paper emphasizes an alternative perspective to <b>value</b> <b>capturing,</b> namely the decision‐making or negotiation process underlying <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> by relying on game‐theoretical approach...|$|R
40|$|Debates {{with respect}} to {{financial}} problems of public-sector infrastructure developmentincreasingly focus on ways to improve <b>value</b> <b>capturing.</b> Two issues {{play a crucial role}} in thisdebate: how much <b>value</b> can be <b>captured</b> and how can we maximize the <b>value</b> to be <b>captured?</b> Inthis paper a conceptual model is presented that enables defining the optimal level of public sectorinfrastructure development—combining a social and financial perspective. Using the model, it is possible, in principle, to define the maximum level of <b>value</b> <b>capturing.</b> Additionally, the paper provides empirical evidence of the potentials of <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> in three Dutch case studies. Thecase studies show that the potential <b>value</b> to be <b>captured</b> as a result of investments in rail infrastructure is substantial, but also that it is unknown whether <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> would be higherin case of alternative investment levels. It will be argued that the conceptual model might be useful to define the optimal level of investment in accessibility in each case study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and tests}} {{a theory of}} entrepreneurial <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> in maritime markets. The framework is argued to be applicable in all maritime fields and other fields with similar attributes but is specifically tested on Oil Service companies operating in the North Sea region. This specific empirical application, however, mirrors general maritime concerns of derived demand and high capital intensity and knowledge specificity. The paper introduces the construct of Commercial Capabilities and models the relevance of such a subset of firm capabilities from an entrepreneurial dynamic market process view; building on Kirznerian alertness, Hayekian capital heterogeneity, and Knightian uncertainty. The theory helps explain <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> from a firm perspective but also subsequent new firm creation or value loss. The model is tested and relevant managerial implications, as well as reflections on further research, presented. The paper is written {{so as to be}} relevant for maritime economists, in moving an emergent maritime entrepreneurship agenda forward, but also mainstream entrepreneurship research, and applied Austrian economics, in attempting to test theory in an industry setting only sparingly engaged by non-maritime researchers...|$|R

50|$|Although it is {{not always}} talked about as such, the most common <b>value</b> <b>capture</b> {{mechanism}} is the general real property tax, with no special features other than regular assessment of market value; this is because the common real estate tax includes the less known land value tax. The value of any given land is determined by its proximity to various amenities (both public and private). Thus, for example, when a new subway station or highway interchange is installed, land near the new facility becomes more valuable. Investment in capital improvements to land can synergistically generate capital investment in other nearby locations, which further increases land value. Thus, even if the rate of taxation does not change, the tax revenue generated from properties which benefit goes up by way of higher land values and increased development. The effectiveness of <b>value</b> <b>capture</b> depends, of course, on a smoothly functioning ad valorem property or land value tax system, with regularly updated assessments.|$|E
40|$|Value {{creation}} {{is the result}} of the continuous innovation activity of the entrepreneur, which is carried out mainly in form of open innovation among the agri-food SMEs. However value {{creation is}} not the ultimate goal of the enterprises. They are more interested in increased appropriation of the created value. Although the value creation (innovation) is very well explored and cultivated area of research, there are some voids in the field of agriculture and food industry: the behavioural aspect of open innovation is very rare. The <b>value</b> <b>capturing</b> is even much less studied, therefor our research approach is largely explorative one. Data are drawn from a survey carried out in Hungary among the agri-food SMEs in 2014. We use Structural Equation Modelling as well as ordered probit and semi-non parametric ordered probit models for analysing the data. Our results show that there is positive relationship between the knowledge sharing with chain partners and the innovativeness. We could explore that size of the firm, absorptive capacity and openness to foreign trade ambiguously affects <b>value</b> <b>capturing.</b> However trust in chain partners, reciprocity in knowledge sharing with chain partners and willingness to cooperate with buyers positively influence the appropriation of the created value...|$|R

Nevertheless, the use of OSS as a form of open innovation is such a recent phenomenon that many unanswered questions still persist. The very concept of OSS represents phenomena that require firms to rethink their strategy as the shift in focus from ownership to one of openness requires a reconsideration of the processes that generate <b>value</b> creation and <b>capture.</b> In responding to this research gap, this paper begins a theory building process for examining OSS <b>value</b> creation and <b>capture.</b> In particular, various theoretical frameworks employed for <b>value</b> creation and <b>capture</b> are explored.
