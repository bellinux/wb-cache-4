5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the <b>valency</b> of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E

5000|$|Frankland {{took the}} view that the valence (he used the term [...] "atomicity") of an element was a single value that corresponded to the maximum value observed. The number of unused <b>valencies</b> on atoms of what are now called the p-block {{elements}} is generally even, and Frankland suggested that the unused <b>valencies</b> saturated one another. For example, nitrogen has a maximum valence of 5, in forming ammonia two <b>valencies</b> are left unattached; sulfur has a maximum valence of 6, in forming hydrogen sulphide four <b>valencies</b> are left unattached.|$|R

25|$|While Hurrian {{could not}} combine {{multiple}} stems to form new stems, {{a large number}} of suffixes could be attached to existing stems to form new words. For example, attardi (ancestor) from attai (father), futki (son) from fut (to beget), aštohhe (feminine) from ašti (woman). Hurrian also provided many verbal suffixes, which often changed the <b>valency</b> of the verb they modify.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analytically}} {{investigates the}} Darcy-Poisson-Nernst-Planck system. This {{system is a}} mathematical model for electrolyte solutions. In this paper, we consider electrolyte solutions, which consist of a neutral fluid and two suspended oppositely charged chemical species with arbitrary <b>valencies</b> z_ 1 > 0 > z_ 2. We prove global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in two space dimensions and three space dimensions. So far, most of the existence results have been proven for symmetric electrolyte solutions. These solutions consist of a neutral fluid and two suspended charged chemical species with symmetric <b>valencies</b> +/-z. As many electrolyte solutions in biological applications and hydrodynamical applications are not symmetric, the presented extension of the previous existence results is an important step...|$|R

25|$|Non-empirical (deductive) glass models exist. They {{are often}} not created to obtain {{reliable}} glass property predictions {{in the first place}} (except melting enthalpy), but to establish relations among several properties (e.g. atomic radius, atomic mass, chemical bond strength and angles, chemical <b>valency,</b> heat capacity) to gain scientific insight. In future, the investigation of property relations in deductive models may ultimately lead to reliable predictions for all desired properties, provided the property relations are well understood and all required experimental data are available.|$|E

40|$|Multivalency is an {{important}} phenomenon in protein–carbohydrate interactions. In order to evaluate glycodendrimers as multivalent inhibitors of carbohydrate binding proteins, we displayed them on a microarray surface. <b>Valencies</b> were varied from 1 to 8, and corrections were made for the <b>valencies</b> so that all surfaces contained {{the same amount of}} the sugar ligand. Five different carbohydrates were attached to the dendrimers. A series of fluorescent lectins was evaluated, and for each of them a binding profile was obtained from a single experiment showing both the specificity of the lectin for a certain sugar and whether it prefers multivalent ligands or not. Very distinct binding patterns were seen for the various lectins. The results were rationalized with respect to the interbinding distances of the lectins...|$|R

The negative suffixes (7), the ergative person suffixes (8), and the ergative number suffixes (9) merge in ways which are not entirely predictable, so the person endings are usually listed in separate singular and plural versions.|$|E
