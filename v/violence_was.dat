40|$|<b>Violence</b> <b>is</b> {{an issue}} that is {{attracting}} increasing attention in the nursing literature. There is general agreement that nurses are exposed to unacceptable levels of violence and aggression in the workplace, and that levels of <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> increasing. Despite this attention and awareness, however, violence does not have a standard definition, and theoretical explanations of <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> seldom considered when discussing it in relation to nursing. This paper discusses current issues associated with defining violence, and presents an overview of some of the traditional and contemporary theories of aggression and violence in relation to nursing and the health context. Conflicting issues surrounding predictors and precipitators of <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> examined. We explore the notion that <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> 'part of the job' in nursing. In conclusion, we assert that the current discourses on aggression and violence maintain the status quo, and argue that new explanatory positions on aggression and <b>violence</b> towards nurses <b>are</b> needed...|$|R

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women. Whole units were occasionally involved in the crime with upwards of one-third of the instances being gang-rape. Frequently {{in the case of}} Jewish women, they were immediately murdered following acts of sexual violence. Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes that military decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E

When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E

Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E

Some townships overwhelmingly supported submitting to U.S. law, but opposition to the government remained strong in areas where poor and landless people predominated. The final report of the commissioners recommended the use of the military to enforce the laws. The trend was towards submission, however, and westerners dispatched representatives William Findley and David Redick to meet with Washington and to halt the progress of the oncoming army.
