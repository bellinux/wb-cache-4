5|$|To {{defeat the}} <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> McCulloch {{introduced}} an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It {{would have allowed}} the Attorney General to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination about a jurisdiction, {{and it would have}} imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats {{as an alternative to the}} <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171-248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> by a 333-85 vote (Democrats 221-61, Republicans 112-24).|$|E
5|$|King {{organized}} and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights.

50|$|Though {{federal civil}} <b>rights</b> and <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> <b>acts</b> passed in 1964 and 1965, Hawkins felt the Great Society {{policies}} of President Lyndon Johnson were sacrificed to the war. So when the Peace and Freedom Party {{was formed in}} late 1967 to end US intervention in Vietnam and fight poverty and racism, Hawkins supported the registration drive {{to put it on}} the ballot; Ironically, Hawkins himself, then 15, wouldn’t be able to vote for another six years because the law then stated one had to be 21 in order to vote.|$|R
50|$|Eisenhower told District of Columbia {{officials}} to make Washington {{a model for}} the rest of the country in integrating black and white public school children. He proposed to Congress the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b> Although both <b>acts</b> were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation, they constituted the first significant civil <b>rights</b> <b>acts</b> since 1875.|$|R
50|$|By this time, voting was {{becoming}} a right rather than {{the property of the}} privileged. However, women were not granted <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> until the <b>Act</b> of 1918, which enfranchised all men over 21 and women over thirty. This last piece of gender discrimination was eliminated 10 years later (in 1928) by the Equal Franchise Act and the voting age was lowered to 18 in 1969.|$|R
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965, {{eventually}} ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But whites in the state {{had more than one}} way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.|$|E
5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the Democratic National Committee and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi Democratic Party. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent Blackwell and three other delegates to the 1964 Democratic National Convention in New Jersey. Their voices heard at the Convention helped contribute {{to the passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965. In late 1982 Blackwell went to the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and received a Master's Degree in Regional Planning. Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and life experience.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
500|$|While the Sejm {{comprised}} representatives only of {{the nobility}} and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers (townspeople), who {{in the fall of}} 1789 organized a Black Procession, demonstrating their desire {{to be part of the}} political process. Taking a cue from similar events in France, and with the fear that if burghers' demands were not met, their peaceful protests could turn violent, the Sejm on April 18, 1791 adopted a law addressing the status of the cities and the rights of the burghers (the Free Royal Cities Act). Together with the legislation on the <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> (the <b>Act</b> on Sejmiks of [...] March 24, 1791), it became incorporated into the final constitution.|$|R
50|$|In the Senate, Morton was {{considered}} a moderate and voted, along with his Republican colleague John Sherman Cooper and most other Republicans, for the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964. A compromise that Morton proposed to guarantee jury trials in all criminal contempt cases except for <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> proved, {{with the assistance of}} Senators Everett Dirksen and Bourke Hickenlooper, crucial in passing that Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil <b>Rights</b> to investigate <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|R
5|$|Since 1985 the {{government}} of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member city council. The mayor is elected at-large, and the council members are elected {{from each of the}} seven city council single-member districts (SMDs). A supermajority of five votes is required to conduct council business. This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which used three city commissioners who were elected at-large, was ruled to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> in the 1975 case Bolden v. City of Mobile. Due to appeals, the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system. Municipal elections are held every four years.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 is a {{landmark}} piece of federal {{legislation in the}} United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It {{was signed into law}} by President Lyndon B. Johnson {{during the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act secured voting rights for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country.|$|E
50|$|In 2010 Quinn's Electoral (Disqualification of Convicted Prisoners) Amendment Bill {{was drawn}} from the member's ballot. The Bill removed <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> for prisoners, and was {{declared}} to be inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b> The bill was passed into law in December 2010.|$|R
50|$|After the {{subsequent}} intensive acts of 1964 and 1965, {{the act of}} 1957 and the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1960 were deemed ineffective for the firm establishment of civil rights. The later legislation had firmer ground for the enforcement and protection {{of a variety of}} civil <b>rights,</b> where the <b>acts</b> of 1957 and 1960 were largely limited to <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b> The Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1960 dealt with race and color but omitted coverage of those discriminated against for national origin, although Eisenhower had called for it in his message to Congress.|$|R
2500|$|The modern Democratic party {{emphasizes}} egalitarianism {{and social}} equality through liberalism. They support <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> and minority rights, including LGBT rights, multiculturalism, and religious secularism. A longstanding social policy is upholding civil rights, which affect {{ethnic and racial}} minorities and includes <b>voting</b> <b>rights,</b> equal opportunity, and racial equality. The party championed the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964, which {{for the first time}} outlawed segregation. Democrats made civil rights and anti-racism a core party philosophy. Carmines and Stimson say, [...] "the Democratic Party appropriated racial liberalism and assumed federal responsibility for ending racial discrimination." ...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Emanuel Celler (D-NY), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, {{introduced}} the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965 as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee {{was the first}} committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, {{but it did not}} file its committee report until June 1. The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote, and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack's support. The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose chair, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1960 {{addressed}} some of {{the shortcomings}} of the 1957 act. It expanded the authority of federal judges to protect <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b> It required local authorities to maintain comprehensive voting records for review, so that the government could determine if there were patterns of discrimination against certain populations.|$|R
50|$|Like most {{senators}} from the South at that time, Walters <b>voted</b> against civil <b>rights</b> legislation, including the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964.|$|R
50|$|Forrest County Registrar Theron Lynd {{prevented}} {{blacks from}} registering to vote. Thirty {{percent of the}} population was black, but less than 1% of them were on the voting rolls, while white registration was close to 100%. In 1961, the U.S. Justice Department filed suit against Lynd and he became the first southern registrar to be convicted under the Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1957 for systematically violating African American <b>voting</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R
5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the <b>Voting</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>Act,</b> funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him. Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E

Following the Supreme Court ruling, Southern whites in Virginia began a [...] "Massive Resistance." [...] Violence against blacks rose there and in other states, as in Little Rock, Arkansas where that year President Dwight D. Eisenhower had ordered in federal troops to protect nine children integrating into a public school, the first time the federal government had sent troops to the South since the Reconstruction era.

Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the United States Constitution, principally its power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment, and its duty to protect <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> under the Fifteenth Amendment. The final version of Civil <b>Rights</b> <b>Act</b> of 1964 was signed into law later on that same day by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964, at the White House.|$|R
25|$|The Black Codes {{indicated}} the {{plans of the}} southern whites for the former slaves.

They could not own firearms, serve on a jury in a lawsuit involving whites or move about without employment. The Black Codes outraged northern opinion.

While enforcing the <b>voting</b> <b>rights</b> of African Americans {{set out in the}} Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, the act had several loopholes.
