500|$|The beef from Highland cattle is <b>very</b> <b>tender,</b> but {{the market}} for {{high-quality}} meat has declined. To address this decline, it is common practice to breed Highland [...] "suckler" [...] cows with a more favourable breed such as a Shorthorn or Limousin bull. This allows the Highland cattle to produce a crossbred beef calf that has the tender beef of its mother on a carcass shape of more commercial value at slaughter. These crossbred beef suckler cows inherit the hardiness, thrift and mothering capabilities of their Highland dams and the improved carcass configuration of their sires. Such crossbred sucklers can be further crossbred with a modern beef bull such as a Limousin or Charolais to produce high quality beef.|$|E
500|$|James Jesse Strang {{was born}} March 21, 1813, in Scipio, Cayuga County, New York. He {{was the second}} of three children, and his parents had a good {{reputation}} in their community. [...] James' mother was <b>very</b> <b>tender</b> with him {{as a consequence of}} delicate health, yet she required him to render an account of all his actions and words while absent from her. [...] In a brief autobiography he wrote in 1855, Strang reported that he had attended grade school until age twelve, but that [...] "the terms were usually short, the teachers inexperienced and ill qualified to teach, and my health such as to preclude attentive study or steady attendance." [...] He estimated that his time in a classroom during those years totaled six months.|$|E

Nevertheless, other commentators have observed that Belldandy might be , but writers such as Gilles Poitras note that the series—far from being soft porn—is in fact a <b>very</b> <b>tender</b> and romantic comedy: the characters {{do no more than}} simply kiss (and that infrequently) {{over the course of the}} series. Newitz suggests that part of the appeal of Oh My Goddess! is the romantic nature of the story: [...] "In anime, romantic love is possible because overt sexuality is not". According to Newitz the relationships in romantic anime, such as Oh My Goddess!, are not about consummation but about [...] "sexual innuendo and deferral".|$|E

And sneering within himself, he wondered with how many other gentlemen she had sung duets since his time? But he did not think fit to put this awkward question aloud: and only said, with the <b>very</b> <b>tenderest</b> air which he could assume, [...] "I should like to hear you sing again, Miss Blanche.

So he came to the {{conclusion}} that, if he could do nothing else, he would go home. If the Jaguar chose to follow him, he could not help it, of course. So, gradually, he pulled himself, Jaguar and all, down to the river, and, as the banks sloped quite suddenly at this place, he soon plunged into deep water, with his bloodthirsty enemy still hanging fiercely to him.|$|R

Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around."

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} during March 2010 – 2011 at Capitol Studios and Avatar Studios. The album's title {{comes from the}} lead track [...] "I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter", originally a hit for Fats Waller in 1935. Said McCartney in the liner notes, [...] "I worked with Diana Krall, and great jazz musicians like John Clayton. This is an album <b>very</b> <b>tender,</b> very intimate. This is an album you listen to at home after work, {{with a glass of}} wine or a cup of tea." [...] The disc was helmed by LiPuma who has previously worked with Miles Davis and Barbra Streisand, among others. The album is mostly standards, with two originals written in the same style ("My Valentine" [...] and [...] "Only Our Hearts"). [...] "My Valentine", composed by McCartney, the first song released from the album, features Eric Clapton on guitar. Stevie Wonder plays harmonica on [...] "Only Our Hearts". McCartney plays acoustic guitar on [...] "Get Yourself Another Fool" [...] and [...] "The Inch Worm", but otherwise contributes only vocals.|$|E
500|$|The album's title track, [...] "Music Box", {{is another}} ballad Carey wrote with Afanasieff. The song is {{described}} as one of Carey's more difficult compositions, due to its [...] "softness". The song requires {{a great deal of}} legato to keep [...] "the tunes softness and sweetness, without resorting to volume." [...] Carey's vocals on the track are defined as [...] "soft and controlled," [...] managing to maintain the delicate balance in a manner that seems effortless, floating easily over the keyboard and the shimmer of the guitar. Lyrically, due to the song's message of [...] "commitment and promise," [...] and the [...] "tinkling music-box line played on the synthesizer," [...] the track gives the sensation of a wedding vow recital. [...] "Never Forget You" [...] is a slow song, further connecting it to the song's message of [...] "lamenting the loss of love, in a <b>very</b> <b>tender</b> way." [...] The song contains keyboard notes that hover over the verses and allow Carey to indulge in her backing vocals. It was described by Nickson as a [...] "stand out track," [...] one that could have easily become a hit single, [...] "with an appeal that would have easily transcended generational barriers." ...|$|E

500|$|Voice coach John Quinlan was {{impressed}} by Sinatra's vocal range, remarking, [...] "He has far more voice than people think he has. He can vocalize to a B-flat on top in full voice, and he doesn't need a mic either". [...] As a singer, early on he was primarily influenced by Bing Crosby, but later believed that Tony Bennett was [...] "the best singer in the business". [...] Bennett also praised Sinatra himself, claiming that as a performer, he had [...] "perfected the art of intimacy." [...] According to Nelson Riddle, Sinatra had a [...] "fairly rangy voice", [...] remarking that [...] "His voice has a very strident, insistent sound in the top register, a smooth lyrical sound in the middle register, and a <b>very</b> <b>tender</b> sound in the low. His voice is built on infinite taste, with an overall inflection of sex. He points everything he does from a sexual standpoint". Despite his heavy New Jersey accent, according to Richard Schuller, when Sinatra sang his accent was [...] "virtually undetectable", with his diction becoming [...] "precise" [...] and articulation [...] "meticulous". His timing was impeccable, allowing him, according to Charles L. Granata, to [...] "toy with the rhythm of a melody, bringing tremendous excitement to his reading of a lyric". [...] Tommy Dorsey observed that Sinatra would [...] "take a musical phrase and play {{it all the way}} through seemingly without breathing for eight, ten, maybe sixteen bars." [...] Dorsey was a considerable influence on Sinatra's techniques for his vocal phrasing with his own exceptional breath control on the trombone, and Sinatra regularly swam and held his breath underwater, thinking of song lyrics to increase his breathing power.|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and <b>very</b> <b>tender</b> and devoted to Lord Rosebery, {{it is easy to see}} that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|As the enamel and dentin are destroyed, {{the cavity}} becomes more noticeable. [...] The {{affected}} {{areas of the}} tooth change color and become soft to the touch. [...] Once the decay passes through enamel, the dentinal tubules, which have passages to the nerve of the tooth, become exposed, resulting in pain that can be transient, temporarily worsening with exposure to heat, cold, or sweet foods and drinks. [...] A tooth weakened by extensive internal decay can sometimes suddenly fracture under normal chewing forces. When the decay has progressed enough to allow the bacteria to overwhelm the pulp tissue {{in the center of}} the tooth, a toothache can result and the pain will become more constant. Death of the pulp tissue and infection are common consequences. The tooth will no longer be sensitive to hot or cold, but can be <b>very</b> <b>tender</b> to pressure.|$|E
