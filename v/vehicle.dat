5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each <b>vehicle</b> {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the <b>vehicle</b> propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the <b>vehicle,</b> fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the <b>vehicle</b> was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the <b>vehicle</b> body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E
5|$|A flexible-fuel <b>vehicle</b> (FFV) or dual-fuel <b>vehicle</b> (colloquially {{called a}} flex-fuel <b>vehicle)</b> is an {{alternative}} fuel <b>vehicle</b> with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} major auto {{companies}} have developed alternative fuel <b>vehicles</b> and all-electric <b>vehicles</b> in a move to reduce petroleum consumption.

5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} <b>vehicle</b> (PEV) is any motor <b>vehicle</b> {{that can}} be recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of electric vehicles that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric <b>vehicle</b> conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} <b>vehicle</b> (PHEV or PHV), {{also known}} as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid electric <b>vehicle</b> with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric <b>vehicle</b> and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
