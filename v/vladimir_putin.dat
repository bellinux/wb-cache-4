50|$|All the Kremlins Men (2015). The book {{became the}} most {{important}} Russian non-fiction about the metamorphoses of Putin and his inner circle. The book was the #1 bestseller in Russia for 4 months. In it Mikhail Zygar traces <b>Vladimir</b> <b>Putins</b> ascent {{to become the most}} powerful Russian president in decades, and illustrates the grip that extreme paranoia has on Moscows power elite.

In his book, Zygar battles against the idealization of Putin as a savvy and ingenious puppet-master; both the demonic version put forth by the West, and the idolizing version propagated by Russias official state media. Zygar is far from adapting the insulted tone of the Russian establishment in his assessment. He is more interested in tracing Russian leaderships slide into the aggressive world view that has eventually led to the war in Eastern Ukraine and military intervention in Syria.|$|R
