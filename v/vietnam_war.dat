5|$|Few films {{before the}} late 1970s about the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>War</b> {{actually}} depicted combat. The exceptions included The Green Berets (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because {{of opposition to}} United States involvement in the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>War,</b> making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army {{did not wish to}} assist in making anti-war films.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Vietnam</b> <b>War</b> (1955–1975) was an {{important}} issue on college campuses across the United States in the 1960s and 1970s.
