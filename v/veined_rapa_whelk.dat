50|$|Rapana venosa, {{common name}} the <b>veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> or Asian rapa whelk, is {{a species of}} large predatory sea snail, a marine {{gastropod}} mollusk or whelk, in the family Muricidae, the rock shells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelks</b> favor compact sandy bottoms, {{in which}} they can burrow almost completely. The native habitat of this species is a region of wide annual {{temperature}} ranges, comparable to other localities. Fleeing cold waters in the winter, this species may migrate to warmer, deeper waters, thereby evading cool surface waters. This fertile sea snail is extremely versatile, tolerating low salinities, water pollution and oxygen deficient waters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelks</b> {{have caused}} {{significant}} changes in the ecology of bottom-dwelling organisms, and have become marine pests in the Black Sea. Although scientists are not completely aware of the impacts of the whelk, they are very concerned about its potential impact on native Bay species. Studies are currently under way to help determine the whelk's spread in Chesapeake Bay, so that scientists can develop a model that will define potential impacts to the Bay's ecosystem.|$|R
50|$|<b>Veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelks</b> are {{carnivorous}} selective predatory gastropods {{whose main}} diet {{consists of a}} variety of other mollusk species, mainly epifaunal bivalves such as oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Modiolus and Geukensia), but also clams (Anadara inaequivalvis, Chamelea gallina, Tapes philippinarum, Venus verrucosa, and the northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria). Prey are chosen by the whelk according to their species and size. Most snails feed by drilling a hole into their bivalve prey, but <b>rapa</b> <b>whelks</b> usually smother their prey by wrapping around the hinged region of the shell and feed by introducing their proboscis between the opened valves. The whelk can also secrete a thick mucus {{that may or may not}} contain biotoxins to weaken the prey. Shell drilling, however, is also not unknown in this species.|$|R
50|$|The imposex {{phenomenon}} {{has been observed}} in the <b>veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> in Chesapeake Bay. Imposex {{is characterized by the}} development of masculine sexual organs in female individuals as a consequence of exposure to organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). Such compounds are biocide and antifouling agents, commonly mixed in paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. For this reason, {{it is not uncommon for}} high concentrations of such compounds to be present in the sea water near shipyards and docking areas, consequently exposing the nearby marine life to its possibly harmful effects. This unnatural development of male reproductive organs, however, has shown no negative effects on populations of this species, and no loss of reproductive capabilities of female R. venosa as a consequence of Imposex has been observed so far.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> ( [...] The mr conroy {{of the sea}} [...] )The {{shell of}} Rapana venosa is globose (rounded) and heavy, {{possessing}} a very short spire, a large body whorl, a strong columella and a deep umbilicus. The aperture is large and roughly ovate. Ornamentation is present externally as axial ribs, smooth spiral ribs ending in blunt knobs at both the shoulder and body whorl, and internally as small elongated teeth disposed along the outer lip margin. The external color varies from gray to reddish-brown, with dark brown dashes on the spiral ribs. Some specimens may have distinctive black/dark blue vein-like coloration patterns throughout the inner portions of the shell, usually originating from each individual tooth at the outer lip.A diagnostic feature for this species is the deep orange color found in the aperture and on the columella. The height of the shell can reach up to 180 mm (about 7 in).|$|E
5000|$|It {{is known}} that the {{abundance}} of prey, the lack of competition from other gastropod species, {{as well as the}} absence of direct predators of R. venosa may be some of the factors that contributed to the successful establishment of new populations of this sea snail outside its native range. [...] The thick strong shell of the rapa whelk is arguably its strongest advantage over native whelks, because rapas can easily prey on local whelks, whereas local whelks are unable to successfully attack rapas. The thick shell also means that predators such as sea turtles are unable to feed on the invasive species, and can only feed on local whelk populations. It is suggested that once the rapa whelk reaches adulthood, it exists unchecked in the local population, and can consume and reproduce freely.The <b>Veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> is also highly tolerant to wide variations in salinity and oxygen concentration, a fact that may also help to explain its success as an invader of marine coastal and brackish ecosystems. In its native range Rapana venosa shows high temperature tolerance, being able to withstand temperatures varying from 4 to 27 °C (39.2 - 80.6 °F).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} length-weight relationships, growth {{type and}} feeding {{behavior of the}} benthic predator <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> at the coast of Camburnu, south-eastern Black Sea. Methods: <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> was monthly collected by dredge sampling on the south-eastern Black Sea at 20 m depth. The relationships between morphometric parameters of <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> were described by linear and exponential models. The allometric growth of each variable relative to shell length (SL) was calculated from the function Y=aSLb or logY=loga+blogSL. The functional regression b values were tested by t-test at the 0. 05 significance level if it was significantly different from isometric growth. The total time spent on feeding either on mussel tissue or live mussels was recorded for each individual under controlled conditions in laboratory. Results: The length-weight relationships showed positive allometric growth and no inter-sex variability. Body size in the male population {{was significantly higher than}} in the individuals of the female. All characters in males and females showed a trend towards allometry rather than isometry. While the total time spent feeding increased with increasing prey size the total time that Rapana venosa spent feeding decreased with increasing <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> size. The total average feeding time needed by <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelks</b> was 160 min. But they took 310 min on live mussels in 27 - 28 °C in the laboratory conditions. Conclusions: Length and weight relationships, growth type, total time spent feeding of this species were explained in details for this region. It would be useful to sustainable management in the south-eastern Black Sea of Turkey. The results about the feeding behaviour of this species will contribute {{to the understanding of the}} role of this species within the ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{short-term}} hypoxia on predation by the non-native <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> (Rapana venosa) on the three most common bivalve prey in northern Adriatic lagoons: the non-native ark shell (Scapharca inaequivalvis) and Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum), and the native cockle Cerastoderma glaucum. In mesocosm experiments, bivalves were offered to predator as single prey, and as multiple choice of prey. Bivalve prey showed behavioural responses when exposed to short-term hypoxia. Under normoxia, prey were consumed in almost equal numbers when offered separately, but when choice was offered to the predator R. venosa showed a marked preference for S. inaequivalvis. Short-term hypoxia increased the vulnerability of T. philippinarum, and, consequently, <b>rapa</b> <b>whelks</b> modified their predatory behaviour and switched their preference to T. philippinarum. We hypothesize {{this to be a}} case of environmentally-mediated, non-reciprocal indirect interaction between the two non-native prey species, whose causes are based upon differences in specific traits of prey. Hypoxia may facilitate the coexistence of the two non-native bivalves via predator switching. The native cockle seems the net loser of the game...|$|R

40|$|Larval {{metamorphosis}} of the <b>veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> (Rapana venosa) is a pelagic to benthic transition {{that involves}} considerable structural and physiological changes. Because metamorphosis plays {{a pivotal role}} in R. venosa commercial breeding and natural populations, the endogenous proteins that drive this transition attract considerable interest. This study is the first to perform a comprehensive and quantitative proteomic analysis related to metamorphosis in a marine gastropod. We analyzed the proteomes of competent R. venosa larvae and post-larvae, resulting in the identification of 5312 proteins, including 470 that were downregulated and 668 that were upregulated after metamorphosis. The differentially expressed proteins reflected multiple processes involved in metamorphosis, including cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, ingestion and digestion, stress response and immunity, as well as specific tissue development. Our data improve understanding of the physiological traits controlling R. venosa metamorphosis and provide a solid basis for further study...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inferring of {{parentage}} {{in natural}} populations {{is important in}} understanding the mating systems of a species, which have great effects on its genetic structure and evolution. Muricidae, a large group (approximately 1, 600 species) of marine gastropods, are poorly investigated in patterns of multiple paternity and sperm competition based on molecular techniques. The <b>veined</b> <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelk,</b> Rapana venosa, a commercially important muricid species with internal fertilization, is an ideal species to study the occurrence and frequency of multiple paternity and to facilitate understanding of their reproductive strategies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed five highly polymorphic microsatellites in R. venosa and applied them to identify multiple paternity in 19 broods (1381 embryos) collected from Dandong, China. Multiple paternity was detected in 17 (89. 5 %) of 19 broods. The number of sires per brood ranged from 1 to 7 (4. 3 on average). Of the 17 multiply sired broods, 16 (94. 1 %) were significantly skewed from equal paternal contributions, and had a dominant sire which was also dominant in each assayed capsule. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that {{a high level of}} multiple paternity occurs in the wild population of R. venosa. Similar patterns of multiple paternity in the 2 - 6 assayed capsules from each brood imply that fertilization events within the body of a female occur mostly (but not entirely) as random draws from a "well-but-not-perfectly blended sperm pool" of her several mates. Strongly skewed distributions of fertilization success among sires also suggest that sperm competition and/or cryptic female choice might be important for post-copulatory paternity biasing in this species...|$|E

40|$|The <b>veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> (Rapana venosa) {{is widely}} {{consumed}} in China. Nevertheless, it preys on oceanic bivalves, thereby reducing this resource worldwide. Its larval metamorphosis comprises {{a transition from}} pelagic to benthic form, which involves considerable physiological and structural changes and has vital roles in its natural populations and commercial breeding. Thus, understanding the endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) that drive metamorphosis is of great interest. This is the first study to use high-throughput sequencing to examine the alterations in miRNA expression that occur during metamorphosis in a marine gastropod. A total of 195 differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained. Sixty-five of these were expressed during the transition from precompetent to competent larvae. Thirty-three of these were upregulated {{and the others were}} downregulated. Another 123 miRNAs were expressed during the transition from competent to postlarvae. Ninety-six of these were upregulated and the remaining 27 were downregulated. The expression of miR- 276 -y, miR- 100 -x, miR- 183 -x, and miR- 263 -x showed a > 100 -fold change during development, while the miR- 242 -x and novel-m 0052 - 3 p expression levels changed over 3000 -fold. Putative target gene coexpression, gene ontology, and pathway analyses suggest that these miRNAs play important parts in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, metabolic regulation, and energy absorption. Twenty miRNAs and their target genes involved in ingestion, digestion, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and apoptosis were identified. Nine of them were analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which showed an inverse correlation between the miRNAs and their relative expression levels.

40|$|Background The <b>veined</b> <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> Rapana venosa is an {{important}} commercial shellfish in China and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has become the standard method to study gene expression in R. venosa. For accurate and reliable gene expression results, qRT-PCR assays require housekeeping genes as internal controls, which display highly uniform expression in different tissues or stages of development. However, to date no studies have validated housekeeping genes in R. venosa for use as internal controls for qRT-PCR. Methods In this study, we selected the following 13 candidate genes for suitability as internal controls: elongation factor- 1 α (EF- 1 α), α-actin (ACT), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX 1), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 α subcomplex subunit 7 (NDUFA 7), 60 S ribosomal protein L 5 (RL 5), 60 S ribosomal protein L 28 (RL 28), glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-tubulin (TUBB), 40 S ribosomal protein S 25 (RS 25), 40 S ribosomal protein S 8 (RS 8), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E 2 (UBE 2), histone H 3 (HH 3), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA). We measured the expression levels of these 13 candidate internal controls in eight different tissues and twelve larvae developmental stages by qRT-PCR. Further analysis of the expression stability of the tested genes was performed using GeNorm and RefFinder algorithms. Results Of the 13 candidate genes tested, we found that EF- 1 α was the most stable internal control gene in almost all adult tissue samples investigated with RL 5 and RL 28 as secondary choices. For the normalization of a single specific tissue, we suggested that EF- 1 α and NDUFA 7 are the best combination in gonad, as well as COX 1 and RL 28 for intestine, EF- 1 α and RL 5 for kidney, EF- 1 α and COX 1 for gill, EF- 1 α and RL 28 for Leiblein and mantle, EF- 1 α, RL 5, and NDUFA 7 for liver, GAPDH, PPIA, and RL 28 for hemocyte. From a developmental perspective, we found that RL 28 was the most stable gene in all developmental stages measured, and COX 1 and RL 5 were appropriate secondary choices. For the specific developmental stage, we recommended the following combination for normalization, PPIA, RS 25, and RL 28 for stage 1, RL 5 and RL 28 for stage 2 and 5, RL 28 and NDUFA 7 for stage 3, and PPIA and TUBB for stage 4. Discussion Our results are instrumental for the selection of appropriately validated housekeeping genes for use as internal controls for gene expression studies in adult tissues or larval development of R. venosa in the future...|$|E

2500|$|Human action {{presents}} both intentional and unintentional {{threats to}} the species' survival. Intentional threats include continued hunting, poaching and egg harvesting. More dangerous are unintentional threats, including boat strikes, fishermen's nets that lack turtle excluder devices, pollution and habitat destruction. Chemical pollution may create tumors; effluent from harbors near nesting sites may create disturbances; and light pollution may disorient hatchlings. Habitat loss usually occurs due to human development of nesting areas. Beach-front construction, land [...] "reclamation" [...] and increased tourism are examples of such development. An infectious tumor-causing disease, fibropapillomatosis, is also a problem in some populations. The disease kills a sizeable fraction of those it infects, though some individuals seem to resist the disease. In addition, {{at least in the}} Southwestern Atlantic (Río de la Plata, Uruguay), exotic invasive species such as the <b>rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> Rapana venosa, were reported massively bio-fouling immature green turtles, reducing buoyancy, increasing drag, and causing severe injuries to the carapace. Because of these threats, many populations are in a vulnerable state.|$|R
40|$|Baltic Sea Benthic {{ecosystem}} impacts from demersal {{fishery in}} the western Baltic is assumed to come mainly from Nephrops trawling in the central and southern Kattegat, mussel dredging in the Belt Sea, and mixed cod trawling {{in the western}} Baltic Sea. These fisheries both impact the seabed, as well as produce substantial amounts of discards. The western Baltic Sea offer {{a unique opportunity to}} analyse the benthic effects of fishingthanks to the closure of Øresund to towed gears since the 1920 s, and the introduction of the Kattegat MPA in 2009 (including cod closure) and the western Baltic Sea Natura- 2000 areas. Furthermore an extensive benthic nationalmonitoring and data collection effort has taken place in the area over a number of years, which can be usedto investigate spatial and temporal differences in the development of benthic communities in (chronically) towed and non-towed areas. To evaluate benthic impacts of towed gears in the Baltic Sea a number of gear technological innovations to reduce effort, benthic contact of fishing gears, and discarding are evaluated. There are conducted experimental fisheries in relation to evaluation and comparison of direct ecosystem and habitat impacts, catch efficiency (target/by-catch/discard/invertebrates), selectivity (discard), energy efficiency, and economic efficiency (vessel specific cost-efficiency/cost-benefit analyses) of different gear modifications compared to standard gears. Furthermore, the case study evaluates potential fishing closures directed towards sensitive benthic habitats and communities. A review of known regional benthic impacts of fishery with demersal towed gears in the area is evaluated with focus on the mussel dredging, demersal cod trawl fishery and Nephrops trawl fishery, where latter is also compared to Nephrops creel fishery. Subtidal dredging and benthic trawling in the area has been reported to affect the benthic fauna and flora as well as to change the structure of the sea bed. The impact of towed gears may also reduce substrate complexity owing to by-catch and movement of shells and stones. Among other this has been demonstrated to locally reduce survival of juvenile blue mussels as well as the population structure of sessile epibenthic organisms. Benthic towing also potentially impact on water transparency either directly owing to resuspension of sediment or {{as a result of a}} reduction in the filtering biomasser. Resuspension is induced at the bottom and in the water column during towing and at the surface when by-catch of sediment is released when heaving/washing the catch. Besides reducing transparency, resuspension of sediment has been found to increase levels of ammonia and silicate in the water column and to reduce the oxygen content. The innovations evaluated comprise: A) Lighter mussel dredges with less benthic impact; B) Smart mussel and cod fishery with previous acoustic or video monitoring or test fishery on the resources before fishery to optimize the catch and to reduce total effort as well as effort on more sensitive habitats resulting in reduced benthic impact; C) Semi-pelagic doors and alternative gear riggings to lift the doors off the seafloor in the western Baltic trawl mixed cod trawl fishery. For species like cod and plaice, which are herded by the sweeps/bridles, an off-bottom door rigging where these other gear components are on the bottom, may be a solution to maintain catchability and eliminate the seabed impact of the doors. The technical challenge with such rigging is to keep the trawl door distance above bottom nearly constant. D) Another focus is scenario evaluation of different effort (re-) allocation schemes with respect to benthic impacts and catch efficiency of W. Baltic mixed trawl fishery by reduction of overall effort or effort in more sensitive habitats through potential closures. The evaluation use the DISPLACE spatial explicit bio-ecomic model (Bastardie et al. 2013; 2014). E) Use short sweep lengths to reduce benthic impacts in the Nephrops trawl fishery (standard of 74 m compared to 5 - 10 m sweeps). Shorter sweeps are not expected to change the selectivity and catch of Nephrops, because Nephrops are not herded by the sweeps, while fish by-catch and discard is expected to be reduced because of less herding. Benthic impacts of demersal trawl fishing in an open fishing area, a short-term closed area, and a long term closed area in the Kattegat and the Sound is investigated. F) Evaluate benthic impacts of creels to be compared to benthic impacts of the Nephrops-fish mixed trawl fishery through overlapping fishery, creel fishery on soft bottom, and test attachment points of creels and inside creel shelters. The comparative analysis of all the above points of changed fishing methods with less benthic impact will involve comparative analyses of catchefficiency, benthic impacts, cost benefit (CBA), energy efficiency, and by-catch and discard. Pilot investigations on use of a light mussel dredge indicate that: a) the weight of sediment retained and re-reduction in energy transfer to the sediment, c) catch efficiency tend to increase – reducing effort and area of impact and reducing fuel consumption - and accordingly increasing economic efficiency, and d) Sea floor tracks made by the two dredges could be distinguished by use of a side-scan sonar and the tracks were still detectable two months after fishing. Pilot investigations in relation to use of semi-pelagic trawl doors indicate similar catch rates between door settings, however, there are area and seasonal differences in the catch efficiency when using pelagic doors, possibly due to substrate or seasonal related behavior differences of cod in reaction to the gears. Pilot investigations with evaluation of mixed trawl fishery impact on W. Baltic and Kattegat sensitive habitats with respect to effort pressure is presented here and will be made finally reported under WP 2 when the actual impact of the specific gear is known. Pilot investigations of bio-diversity and presence/absence of species from benthic sampling in open and short term closed trawl fishing areas in Kattegat is ongoing. Pilot investigations with creels in (Frandsen et al. 2013 b) indicate that i) the creels sank very much down into the soft sediment (camera monitoring); ii) the creels were not directly lifted off the bottom but were dragged for several minutes making a footage (camera monitoring); iii) the bait attracted Hagfish (Myxine spp.) which scared the Nephrops in the creels => some escapement; iv) all by-catch thrown overboard immediately went to the bottom, and no predation from sea birds was observed, and there were observed no visible deviations in the cod's behaviour when they swam to the bottom; v) the catch rates were about 180 g/creel per day; vi) CBA indicate a daily profit about 3800 DKK per day which is comparable to trawl fishery for trawlers 18 m (12 - 17 m) and < 18 m (18 - 32 m) which are common for Black Sea trawl fishery fleet. In each sampling period, the catches were recorded on board from at least two commercial vessels representing the study area. Fieldwork included estimating the total catch and the relative fractions per haul and recording the faunal composition as standardized for per haul duration or per day. The sediment samplings were taken from totally 40 stations and particle size analysis were realized. The stations for sediment sampling were assigned as on a vertical line to land at certain distances from each other and at four different depths. The data derived from PSA (Particle Size Analysis) and also the information of coordinates applied to the ArcMap Sediment Classification Tool (ArcGIS ver 9. 2) to derive the habitat map of the substrate in SSA. The abundance of macro benthic fauna is greater in summer months than in winter, spring and fall. The fishing mortality is increasing in this period. 70. 3 % of total catch is composed of <b>Rapa</b> <b>whelk</b> and 29. 7 % is the bycatch species. The reasons for the heavy pressure on red mullet and whiting populations were the low selectivity of meshes and the long operation durations. The high exploitation rate generally causes the catch of relatively small and immature individuals. Though the rate of discarded catch in weight is lower than the marketed catch, as it is considered in number of individual the discarded portion is larger than the market. The age composition of red mullet was composed of 0 and 1 age groups and of whiting are 0, 1 and 2 age groups. In the whiting fishery of the 2013 and 2014, the mean values of fishing effort are found to have no significant difference between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is estimated in fall and the lowest in spring but the difference is not statistically significant. In red mullet fishery for the same years, the trend seems similar within the whiting fishery. The mean values of fishing effort in red mullet are also not significantly different between seasons for the landing. The highest CPUE for the landing and discard is determined in winter and the lowest in spring with no statistical difference. Though the rate of discard by weight seems less than of landings, the rate of discard by individual number is significantly high and cause great bio-economic losses. SSA can be accepted as a soft bottom habitat that is mostly composed of muddy sand and sandy mud. Stations having hard substratum is very limited. This soft bottom is highly available for all kind of drag-net fisheries and this makes this habitat highly sensitive because of heavy fishing pressure...|$|R
