The central column would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and rearmament, the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R.

Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and exploiting the simplicity of tandem-repeat protein structures, we delineate a network of these states and the routes between them. We show that our target, gankyrin, a 226 -residue 7 -ankyrin-repeat protein, can access two alternative (un) folding pathways. We resolve intermediates as well as transition states, constituting a comprehensive series of snapshots that map early and late stages of the two pathways and show both to be polarized such that the repeat array progressively unravels {{from one end of}} the molecule or the other. Strikingly, we find that the protein folds via one pathway but unfolds via a different one. The origins of this behavior can be rationalized using the numerical results of a simple statistical mechanics model that allows us to visualize the equilibrium behavior as well as single-molecule folding/unfoldin...|$|R
40|$|Multi-resistant organisms (MROs), the {{bacteria}} that {{are resistant to}} a number of different antibiotics, have been very popular around the world in recent years. They are very difficult to treat but highly infectious in humans. MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) is one of the MROs. It is believed that in 2007 more people died of MRSA than of AIDS worldwide. In Australia "there are about 2000 people per year who have a bloodstream infection with the MRSA germ and the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> those get <b>them</b> from health care procedure" (Nader, 2005).

This review provides insight into the hand washing and isolation infection-control strategies for MRSA. The important technologies on those two aspects worldwide are well surveyed, compared, contrasted, and discussed.

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the problem Von Neumann was trying to address was not self-reproduction per se, but the {{evolutionary}} growth of complexity. His “proof-of-principle” designs showed how it is logically possible, by using a general purpose programmable (“universal”) constructor, to exhibit an indefinitely large class of self-reproducing machines, spanning a wide range of “complexity” (in von Neumann's sense of “the ability to do complicated things”), interconnected by a network of potential mutational pathways, including pathways from the most simple to the most complex. This is an important result, as prior to that it might have been conjectured that there is a fundamental logical barrier to the existence of such pathways; in which case, biological organisms, which do support such pathways, could not be “machines”, as conventionally understood. But the result does not show what other conditions are necessary, in practice, for evolution along such pathways from simple to complex to be spontaneously realised or followed. In his unfinished work he briefly considers conflict and interactions between his self-reproducing machines; but in practice, his particular model cannot yield evolutionary dynamics because the machines are too fragile - the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> perturbations cause <b>them</b> effectively to disintegrate.|$|R

40|$|Providing {{food for}} human beings {{is one of the}} major {{challenges}} for the future. Plant diseases cause massive losses in crop production all over the world. Pesticides have been used as a major strategy of crop disease control, however conventional pesticides typically rely on toxic activity leading to environmental problems. Synthetic elicitors can protect plants from diseases by activating host immune responses. The identification and characterization of synthetic elicitors can result in valuable tools for the dissection of the plant defense network as well as leads for the development of environmentally-safe pesticide alternatives. Synthetic elicitors have been classified and the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> known <b>them</b> belong to the large group of functional SA analogs. Additionally imprimatins, sulfonamides, adipic acid derivatives and jasmonic acid analogs were found to have synthetic elicitor activity. By high-throughput screening we identified over 100 synthetic elicitors. By using model pathosystems Arabidopsis/Hpa, I functionally characterized two novel synthetic elicitors, BHTC and DPMP and their effects on plant defense pathways. BHTC can induce disease resistance quickly and transiently, has a distinct mode-of- action from already characterized synthetic elicitors. BHTC can enhance root elongation on Arabidopsis when applied at low doses, while induces defense reactions at high doses. This phenomenon is known as hormesis. Transcriptional patterns associated with BHTC-mediated hormesis were different from those associated BHTC-mediated defense. Furthermore, the WRKY 70 transcription factor is required for both BHTC-mediated immunity and hormetic root elongation and links plant defense signaling to hormetic developmental responses. DPMP is one of the strongest synthetic elicitors that were identified by our screening. It also exhibited hormesis effect at low doses and induces disease resistance at high doses. Its activity is fully dependent on NPR 1 and partially dependent on WRKY 70. Interestingly, two separate moieties of DPMP can independently induce immune responses. While their direct targets in plant defense are still yet to be defined, it is clear that they are powerful tools to dissect plant defense networks as well as develop novel pesticide alternative...|$|R

This will largely result in haploinsufficiency, though {{in some cases}} the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the cell membrane. The three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity. The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP. It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.|$|E
