The Royal College of Psychiatrists produced three more sets of guidelines, and carried out two more surveys.

40|$|Until recently, South African car-carriers {{operated}} under the abnormal load permit system allowing an additional 300 mm height and 500 mm length. Because car-carrier payloads are divisible and abnormal load permits are usually granted for indivisible loads, these permits were granted {{only as a}} special concession to the car-carrier industry. This practice is being phased out due to concerns over {{the stability of the}} over-height vehicles and a number of incidents of non-compliance by some car-carrier operators. The Abnormal Loads Technical Committee has stipulated two requirements should operators wish to operate car-carriers in excess of legislated dimensional limits. Firstly, the operator must be RTMS-certified (RTMS is the Road Transport Management System, a <b>voluntary</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme</b> addressing overloading, vehicle maintenance, driver training etc.); and secondly, the car-carrier should be shown to comply with the Performance-Based Standards (PBS) scheme. The PBS scheme is a detailed set of safety standards which regulate vehicle performance (such as vehicle rollover tendency) when conducting prescribed manoeuvres. A number of PBS demonstration projects are currently running in South Africa. This paper outlines the progress to date in developing and implementing PBS-compliant car-carrier designs, the regulatory challenges encountered, and the envisaged regulatory future for car-carriers in South Africa.

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} {{progress}} made {{within the field}} of product design and crime prevention and suggests that although much has been discussed, little has made the transition from research to policy or practice. Whist accepting that this weakness can be explained in part through limited funding and changes in personnel within key organisations, it is suggested that the central difficulty has been a lack of leadership from a central organisation, a duplication of effort and a reluctance to implement ideas which may seem unfeasible, unrealistic or unachievable. As well as reviewing the progress made within this field, this chapter proposes a system to measure the risk of theft of electronic products as a means of motivating developers to design secure products and encouraging consumers to demand secure products. Building upon the gains made within the fields of the built environment, food standards and environmental protection, this chapter proposes a two-tiered system to allow manufacturers to market their products as â€˜secureâ€™ and consumers to easily identify a productâ€™s risk of theft. The first system would be a <b>voluntary</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>scheme</b> and associated logo which would allow products meeting the required standards to be marketed as a â€˜Secure Productâ€™. The second proposal, aimed at allowing consumers to readily identify the risk of theft of electronic products, would be the introduction of a signposting â€˜traffic lightâ€™ system which assigns two traffic light colours to each product â€“ the first would identify the productâ€™s vulnerability to theft (measured using a crime risk assessment mechanism), the second would identify the productâ€™s existing levels of security. The chapter concludes by suggesting that it is time for those working {{within the field of}} product design and crime prevention to be bold and push forward proposals to make research a reality...|$|E
