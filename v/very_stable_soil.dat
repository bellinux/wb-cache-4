It was originally {{considered to be}} <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> in <b>soils,</b> but is now understood to be mobile in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The magnitude of BC flux into oceans via riverine transport has been established, but the exact conditions under which transport occurs are unknown. This research monitored surface water sites {{to determine if a}} pulse of BC could be identified from a recently burned forested area in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. BC was shown to vary more highly in concentration at lower stream order, however, short-term trends in concentration demonstrated no signal of recent fire activity in dissolved BC. Instead, surface waters exhibited evidence of a stable pool of dissolved BC being released to streams from the watershed...|$|R

40|$|Aggregate {{stability}} and aggregate size distribution on soil surface that is impacted by rain drops affect soil erosion yet {{little is known}} about less weathered coarse textured soils. The objectives of the current study were to determine (i) the aggregate {{stability and}} associated aggregate fraction size distribution and (ii) the impact of the initial aggregate size on the aggregate stability and the resulting sediment fraction size distribution following rain drop impact in some quartz dominated coarse textured soils in the Eastern Cape Province. Soil samples for this experiment were collected from 14 ecotopes on the surface with a natural slope between 7. 5 to 11 % and at the depth between 0 to 0. 2 m in the Eastern Cape Province. In each ecotope, twenty-five different spots were sampled using a spade at depth 0 to 0. 2 m in other to eradicate biasness and ensure homogeneity. Thereafter, the soil samples were mixed to make a composite sample. The composited soil samples were then placed in rigid containers and taken to the soil science laboratory of the University of Fort Hare, Alice Campus where analyses were carried out. The soil properties were determined by passing the 0. 053 mm fragments. The remaining > 0. 053 mm was re-immersed in ethanol and further oven dried at 40 o C for 5 minutes. Thereafter, the > 0. 053 mm fraction was transferred from 0. 053 mm sieve, oven dried at 40 o C, dry sieved using Digital Electromagnetic Shaker on a six column of sieves: 2 mm, 1 mm, 0. 5 mm, 0. 25 mm, 0. 106 mm, and 0. 053 mm. The aggregate stability was determined using the resulting size distribution in seven classes by calculating the mean weight diameter (MWD, mm). The <b>soils</b> were <b>very</b> <b>stable,</b> moderately stable or unstable. The presence of smectite and cultivation as opposed to pasture lowered aggregate stability. The studied soils showed three different aggregate size distributions. Unstable soils were dominated by 0. 106 – 0. 25 mm aggregate size and showed a positively skewed aggregate fraction size distribution. Aggregates finer than 0. 106 mm were limited because of the coarse nature of the <b>soil</b> texture. Moderately <b>stable</b> <b>soils</b> broke down to both micro aggregates, 0. 106 – 0. 25 mm and macro aggregates, 2 – 5 mm giving a bimodal distribution. The aggregate size distribution in the <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> <b>soils</b> was dominated by the aggregate fraction size 2 – 5 mm and a negatively skewed aggregate fraction size distribution. The smaller the initial aggregate size the higher was the aggregate stability but the reverse was true for splash erosion. It was thought that the short 5 minutes duration of the rainfall might not have been enough to cause a total breakdown of the aggregates. Alternatively, ecotopes that were dominated by primary soil minerals such as quartz showed different breakdown behaviour compared to those containing secondary minerals such as kaolinite or smectite...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs) within background soil profiles was investigated in boreal (Norway) and montane (Italy) areas. The typical build-up of slowly mineralizing humus layers, containing high amounts of soil organic matter (SOM) makes soils of such ecosystems an important global sink for POPs released to the environment. The study focused on evidence and implications of processes influencing the fate of POPs in soil. POP deposition, interaction with SOM, volatilization, leaching, degradation, and bioturbation are discussed. Results indicate that the less volatile POPs such as hexa- and higher chlorinated biphenyls (CBs) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers are <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> in <b>soil</b> profiles, undergoing little translocation or (re) transfer to other environmental compartments. In contrast, more volatile compounds (e. g., tri- and tetra-CBs) were found in soil layers below those formed from vegetation ever directly exposed to airborne POPs. This suggests the occurrence of downward transport and hence limited surface-air exchange of more volatile POPs as they are removed from the top layers. Such soils may therefore be able to retain higher amounts of these compounds than just addressed by the capacity of their surface layers...|$|R
40|$|Phytate, {{which is}} one of the {{dominant}} organic phosphorus compounds in nature, is <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> in <b>soils.</b> Although a substantial amount of phytate is carried from terrestrial to aquatic systems, it is a minor component of organic phosphorus in coastal sediments. The ephemeral nature of phytate implies the rapid hydrolysis of phytate under aquatic conditions. Among the four classes of known phytases that have been identified in terrestrial organisms, only β-propeller phytase-like sequences have been identified in the aquatic environment. A novel β-propeller phytase gene (phyS), cloned from Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1, was found to encode a protein with two beta-propeller phytase domains. The characterization of recombinant full-length PhyS and its domains demonstrated that Domain II was the catalytic domain responsible for phytate hydrolysis. The full-length PhyS displayed a K m of 83 μM with a kcat of 175. 9 min- 1 and the Domain II displayed a Km of 474 μM with a kcat of 10. 6 min- 1. These results confirm that the phyS gene encodes a functional β-propeller phytase, which is expressed in S. oneidensis under phosphorus deficienct condition. The presence of multiple sequences with a high similarity to phyS in aquatic environmental samples and the widespread occurrence of the Shewanella species in nature suggest that the β-propeller phytase family is the major class of phytases in the aquatic environment, and that it may play an important role in the recycling of phosphorus. © Springer-Verlag 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Lead (Pb) is a <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> {{metal in}} <b>soil</b> and is highly toxic to humans and animals. Exposure to Pb occurs via {{inhalation}} of particles from industry and soil, {{as well as}} household dust, water, and contaminated food. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate Pb contents and allocation in vegetable crops grown in a soil contaminated by battery recycling wastes. Eight plant species were studied: tomato, sweet pepper, beet, carrot, cabbage, green collards, eggplant, and okra. The experiment {{was set up in}} blocks at random with four replicates. The results showed that carrot, green collards, beet, and okra were the most Pb tolerant species, while the others were very Pb-sensitive, since they did not complete their cycle. The decreasing order for Pb accumulation in the vegetables crops was: carrot > okra > tomato > eggplant > sweet pepper > green collards > cabbage > beet. Taking into account the Pb allocation in plants, the order was: root > stems > leaves > edible parts. Although carrot translocated the lowest Pb amount into the edible part, such level exceeded the legal limit...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Due to its recalcitrance against {{microbial}} degradation, biochar is <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> in <b>soil</b> {{compared to}} other organic matter additions, making its application to soils a suitable approach for the build-up of soil organic carbon (SOC). The net effects of such biochar addition also depend on its interactions with existing organic matter in soils. A study was established to investigate how the status of pre-existing soil organic matter influences biochar stabilisation in soil in comparison to labile organic additions. Carbon loss was greater in the C-rich sites (C content 58. 0 gC/kg) than C-poor soils (C content 21. 0 – 24. 0 gC/kg), regardless {{of the quality of}} the applied organic resource. Biochar-applied, C-rich soil showed greater C losses, by> 0. 5 kg/m 2. year, than biochar-applied C-poor soil, whereas the difference was only 0. 1 kg/m 2. year with Tithonia diversifolia green manure. Biochar application reduced the rate of CO 2 -C loss by 27 %, and T. diversifolia increased CO 2 -C losses by 22 % in the C-poor soils. With biochar application, a greater proportion of C (6. 8 times) was found in the intra-aggregate fraction per unit C respired than with green manure, indicating a more efficient stabilisation in addition to the chemical recalcitrance of biochar. In SOC-poor soils, biochar application enriched aromatic-C, carboxyl-C, and traces of ketones and esters mainly in unprotected organic matter and within aggregates, as determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. In contrast, additions of T. diversifolia biomass enriched conjugated carbonyl-C such as ketones and quinones, as well as CH deformations of aliphatic-C mainly in the intra-aggregate fraction. The data indicate that not only the stability but also the stabilisation of biochar exceeds that of a labile organic matter addition such as green manure...|$|R
40|$|Quarry faces several {{kilometers}} {{long in the}} Glesborg area in Denmark {{show that}} Bronze Age farmers used a sustainable land-use system. Despite nutrient-poor soils, the Glesborg area was under a rotation system in which cropland alternated with grassland.

40|$|Hexavalent {{chromium}} (Cr(VI)) {{is one of}} {{the most}} dangerous metals in polluted soils because of its carcinogenicity and high bioavailability. Conversely, its reduced form Cr(III) is low-toxic and <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> in the <b>soil,</b> since it occurs mainly as precipitated hydroxides. Different strategies can be adopted to remediate Cr(VI) -polluted soils and, among these, solidification/stabilization (S/S) is very efficient, being usually a cost-effective and rapid technology. It consists on the soil treatment with materials or reagents able to decrease the solubility and toxicity of heavy metals and/or entrap them in stable solid phases. In this study, glass and aluminium recycled from municipal solid wastes were used to treat, under alkaline hydrothermal conditions, a Cr(VI) -spiked soil with the aim of reducing Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and immobilizing Cr(III) in insoluble newly formed solid structures. A sandy soil was spiked with a solution of Cr(VI) to obtain, after 3 months of aging, a stable concentration of 580 mg kg- 1. The soil was then added with a mixture (MIX) of pulverized glass and aluminium (1 / 10 and 1 / 20 MIX/soil, w/w). The samples were then added with KOH and deionised water (1 : 2 w/v), and stored at 90 °C in closed HDPE bottles. Two controls without MIX, one containing KOH and the other with water alone, were also prepared. After 1, 7, 30, 60 and 90 days, soil aliquots were sampled and analyzed for Cr(VI) concentration (methods USEPA 3060 A and 7196 A) and Cr fractionation (BCR sequential extractions). Chromium stabilization was further investigated by analyzing the soil samples for elemental distribution (micro X-ray fluorescence – μXRF), mineralogical composition (X-ray powder diffraction – XRPD), and 3 D structure of the solid phases of new formation (high resolution micro X-ray computed tomography - μCT). The reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was accelerated and intensified by the S/S treatment. In fact, about 98...|$|R

40|$|INTERMITTENT TURBULENCE IN THE <b>VERY</b> <b>STABLE</b> EKMAN LAYER This study {{describes}} a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> Ekman layer {{in which a}} constant downward heat flux is applied at the lower boundary, thus cooling the fluid above. Numerical experiments were performed in which {{the strength of the}} imposed heat flux was varied. For downward heat fluxes above a certain critical value the turbulence becomes intermittent and, as the heat flux increases beyond this value, the flow tends to relaminarize because of the very strong ambient stratification. We adopt Mahrt?s (1999) definition of the <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> boundary layer as a boundary layer in which intermittent, rather than continuous turbulence, is observed. Numerical experiments were used to test various hypothesis of where in ?stability parameter space? the <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> boundary layer is found. These experiments support the findings of Howell and Sun (1999) that the boundary layer will exhibit intermittency and therefore be categorized as ?<b>very</b> <b>stable?,</b> when the stability parameter, z/L, exceeds unity. Another marker for the <b>very</b> <b>stable</b> boundary layer, Derbyshire?s (1990) maximum heat flux criterion, was also examined. Using a case study drawn from the simulations where turbulence intermittency was observed, the mechanism that causes the intermittence was investigated. It was found that patchy turbulence originates from a vigorous inflectional, Ekman-like instability [...] a roll cell [...] that lifts colder air over warmer air. The resulting convective instability causes an intense burst of turbulence. This turbulence is short-lived because the lifting motion of the roll cell, as well as the roll cell itself, is partially destroyed after the patchy turbulence is generated. Examples of intermittent turbulence obtained from the simulations appear to be consistent with observations of intermittency even though the Reynolds number of the DNS is relatively low (400) ...|$|R
