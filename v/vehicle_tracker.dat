40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracker</b> for Infrared (IR) videos {{motivated}} by the recent advance in compressive sensing (CS). The new eL 1 -PF tracker solves a sparse model representation of moving targets via L 1 regularized least squares. The sparsemodel solution addresses real-world environmental challenges such as image noises and partial occlusions. To further improve tracking performance for frame-toframe sequences involving large target pose changes, two extensions to the original L 1 tracker are introduced (eL 1). First, in the particle filter (PF) framework, pose information is explicitly modelled into the state space which significantly improves the effectiveness of particle sampling and propagation. Second, a probabilistic template update scheme is designed, which help...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a synergistic approach to integrated lane and vehicle tracking for driver assistance. The approach {{presented in this}} paper results in a final system that improves on the performance of both lane tracking and vehicle tracking modules. Further, the presented approach introduces a novel approach to localizing and tracking other vehicles on the road with respect to lane position, which provides information on higher contextual relevance that neither the lane tracker nor <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracker</b> can provide by itself. Improvements in lane tracking and vehicle tracking have been extensively quantified. Integrated system performance has been validated on real-world highway data. Without specific hardware and software optimizations, the fully implemented system runs at near-real-time speeds of 11 frames per second.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} methods behind tracker evaluation, the aim {{being to}} evaluate {{how well a}} tracker is able to determine {{the position of a}} target object. Few metrics exist for positional tracker evaluation; here the fundamental issues of trajectory comparison are addressed, and metrics are presented which allow the key features to be described. Often little evaluation on how precisely a target is tracked is presented in the literature, with results detailing for what percentage of the time the target was tracked. This issue is now emerging as a key aspect of tracker performance evaluation. The metrics developed are applied to real trajectories for positional tracker evaluation. Data obtained from a sports player tracker on video of a 5 -a-side soccer game, and from a <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracker,</b> is analysed. These give quantitative positional evaluation of the performance of computer vision tracking systems, and provides a framework for comparison of different methods and systems on benchmark data sets. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} techniques for monocular-based vehicle detection. A novel {{system that can}} robustly detect and track the movement of vehicles in the video frames is proposed. The system consists of three major modules: a symmetry based object detector for vehicle cueing, a two-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier for vehicle verification and a Kalman filter based <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracker.</b> For the cueing stage, a technique for rapid detection of all possible vehicles in the image is proposed. The technique exploits {{the fact that most}} vehicles ’ front and rear views are highly symmetrical in the horizontal axis. First, it extracts the symmetric regions and the high symmetry points in the image using a multi-sized symmetry search window. The high symmetry points are then clustered and the mean locations of each cluster are used to hypothesize the locations of potential vehicles. From the research, it was found that a sparse symmetry search along several scan lines on a scaled-down image can significantly reduce the processing time without sacrificing the detection rate. Vehicle verification is needed to eliminate the false detections picked up by the cueing stage. Several verification techniques based on template matching and image classificatio...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{real-time}} {{computer vision system}} that enables a UGV to safely cross urban road-intersections. Specifically, when the UGV approaches the stop sign at a 4 -way intersection, it {{must be aware of}} the vehicles at the other three roads and adhere to traffic rules by waiting for its turn to proceed. The proposed solution consists of three main components: a <b>vehicle</b> detector, a <b>tracker,</b> and a finite-state-machine to model the traffic. We use an OT-MACH filter to detect the leading vehicle in each of three camera-views of the corresponding roads. Then, we track the vehicles using an edge-enhanced dynamic correlation tracker, which estimates the current and next positions, velocities, and accelerations of the vehicles. Finally, the finite-state-machine describes the traffic in each road with one of four possible states (i. e. No Vehicle Waiting, Arriving, Waiting, and Passing), and signals an autopilot system when it is safe to pass the intersection. We provide the results from an actual intersection with real traffic to demonstrate that the UGV is able to automatically navigate the intersection using the proposed system...|$|R
40|$|Driver’s {{face is a}} {{rich source}} of {{information}} for understanding driver behaviour. From the driver’s face, one could get an idea of the driver’s emotional state and where s/he looks at. In recent years, naturalistic driving studies and field operational tests have been conducted to collect driver behavioural data, which often includes video of the driver, from many drivers driving {{for an extended period of}} time. Due to the Data Privacy Act, it is desirable to make the driver video anonymous, while preserving the original facial expressions. This paper describes our attempt to make a system that could do so. The system is a combination of an automatic Facial Action Coding System (FACS) coder based on Active Appearance Models (AAMs), a classifier that analyses local deformations in the AAM shape mesh and a 3 D visualisation. The image acquisition hardware is based on a SmartEye eye tracker installed in a <b>vehicle.</b> The eye <b>tracker</b> we used provides a constant image quality independent of external illumination, which is a precondition for deploying the system in a vehicle environment.

40|$|Location {{privacy in}} {{vehicular}} ad hoc networks has gained considerable {{attention in the}} past few years. The majority of studies concern changing pseudonyms to prevent linking messages of the same pseudonym. However, the precise spatiotemporal information included in beacons (i. e., timestamp, position, speed and heading) makes them vulnerable to tracking even if they are completely anonymous. One of the most important issues in designing location privacy scheme is to preserve the quality of service of the application. This issue is more significant for safety applications, since they require precise and frequent state updates. Thus, it is crucial to consider this trade-off between location privacy and quality of service of the safety application when designing and evaluating privacy schemes. In this paper, we propose a methodology to measure both the protection level of a privacy scheme and its impact on safety applications. We employ an empirical <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracker</b> to measure the effectiveness of a privacy scheme in terms of a number of confusions. We also measure its impact on a safety application by estimating the probability of correctly identifying the fundamental factors of that application using Monte Carlo analysis. Further, we propose an obfuscation privacy scheme which perturbs position and beacon frequency. Finally, we apply our methodology to evaluate the proposed scheme and compare it with the popular privacy scheme, random silent period...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} federal circuit courts {{have refused to}} apply the Fourth Amendment’s exclusionary rule to {{evidence}} obtained from GPS vehicle trackers that were installed and monitored without a warrant before United States v. Jones. Those courts have largely reached that result by invoking Davis v. United States’ holding that the exclusionary rule does not apply where an officer reasonably relied on binding appellate precedent that was later overruled. More specifically, the circuit courts have viewed the Supreme Court’s 1983 decision in United States v. Knotts (addressing “beeper” tracking devices) as binding precedent that specifically authorized the warrantless installation and monitoring of GPS vehicle trackers prior to Jones. The Fourth Circuit’s decision in United States v. Stephens {{is representative of the}} “Knotts is binding precedent under Davis approach” that most of the circuit courts have used to resolve the exclusionary rule question. This Article, therefore, uses Stephens as a vehicle for analyzing that approach. This Article argues that decisions like Stephens have stretched the holding of Davis and interpreted Knotts in a way that contradicts Supreme Court precedent. And, the circuit courts have done so for no good reason because they could have reached the same result—refusing to exclude the GPS <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracker</b> evidence—by working through the general good-faith analysis. Instead, most of the circuit courts have chosen to resolve the exclusionary rule issue by defining the terms “specifically authorized” and “binding precedent” to mean “suggested” and “persuasive precedent. ” In the process, the courts have converted the intentionally narrow holding of Davis into a broad decision with unknown boundaries...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} challenging tasks of automatic and real-time vehicle detection and tracking from aerial video. The aim of this thesis is to build an automatic system that can accurately localise any vehicles that appear in aerial video frames and track the target <b>vehicles</b> with <b>trackers.</b> <b>Vehicle</b> detection and tracking have many applications and this has been an active area of research during recent years; however, it is still a challenge to deal with certain realistic environments. This thesis develops vehicle detection and tracking algorithms which enhance the robustness of detection and tracking beyond the existing approaches. The basis of the vehicle detection system proposed in this thesis has different object categorisation approaches, with colour and texture features in both point and area template forms. The thesis also proposes a novel Self-Learning Tracking and Detection approach, which is an extension to the existing Tracking Learning Detection (TLD) algorithm. There are a number of challenges in vehicle detection and tracking. The most difficult challenge of detection is distinguishing and clustering the target vehicle from the background objects and noises. Under certain conditions, the images captured from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are also blurred; for example, turbulence may make the vehicle shake during flight. This thesis tackles these challenges by applying integrated multiple feature descriptors for real-time processing. In this thesis, three vehicle detection approaches are proposed: the HSV-GLCM feature approach, the ISM-SIFT feature approach and the FAST-HoG approach. The general vehicle detection approaches used have highly flexible implicit shape representations. They are based on training samples in both positive and negative sets and use updated classifiers to distinguish the targets. It has been found that the detection results attained by using HSV-GLCM texture features can be affected by blurring problems; the proposed detection algorithms can further segment the edges of the vehicles from the background. Using the point descriptor feature can solve the blurring problem, however, the large amount of information contained in point descriptors can lead to processing times that are too long for real-time applications. So the FAST-HoG approach combining the point feature and the shape feature is proposed. This new approach is able to speed up the process that attains the real-time performance. Finally, a detection approach using HoG with the FAST feature is also proposed. The HoG approach is widely used in object recognition, as it has a strong ability to represent the shape vector of the object. However, the original HoG feature is sensitive to the orientation of the target; this method improves the algorithm by inserting the direction vectors of the targets. For the tracking process, a novel tracking approach was proposed, an extension of the TLD algorithm, in order to track multiple targets. The extended approach upgrades the original system, which can only track a single target, which must be selected before the detection and tracking process. The greatest challenge to vehicle tracking is long-term tracking. The target object can change its appearance during the process and illumination and scale changes can also occur. The original TLD feature assumed that tracking can make errors during the tracking process, and the accumulation of these errors could cause tracking failure, so the original TLD proposed using a learning approach in between the tracking and the detection by adding a pair of inspectors (positive and negative) to constantly estimate errors. This thesis extends the TLD approach with a new detection method in order to achieve multiple-target tracking. A Forward and Backward Tracking approach has been proposed to eliminate tracking errors and other problems such as occlusion. The main purpose of the proposed tracking system is to learn the features of the targets during tracking and re-train the detection classifier for further processes. This thesis puts particular emphasis on vehicle detection and tracking in different extreme scenarios such as crowed highway vehicle detection, blurred images and changes in the appearance of the targets. Compared with currently existing detection and tracking approaches, the proposed approaches demonstrate a robust increase in accuracy in each scenario...|$|R
