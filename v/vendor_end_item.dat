ISS Plug-In Plan (IPiP) supports power and data for science, Payloads (or Utilization), vehicle systems, and daily operations through the Electrical Power System (EPS) Secondary Power/Data Subsystem. Yet limited resources and increasing requirements continue to influence decisions on deployment of ISS <b>end</b> <b>items.</b> Given the fluid launch schedule and the rapidly- increasing number of <b>end</b> <b>item</b> providers requiring power support, {{the focus of the}} Plug-In Plan has evolved from a simple FIFO recommendation to provide power to <b>end</b> <b>item</b> users, to anticipating future requirements by judicious development and delivery of support equipment (cables, power supplies, power strips, and alternating current (AC) power inverters), employing innovative deployment strategies, and collaborating on <b>end</b> <b>item</b> development. This paper describes the evolution of the ISS Program Office, Engineering Directorate, Flight Operations Directorate (FOD), International Partners and the <b>end</b> <b>item</b> provider relationship and how collaboration successfully leverages unique requirements with limited on- board equipment and resources, tools and processes which result in more agile integration, and describes the process designed for the new ISS <b>end</b> <b>item</b> provider to assure that their power requirements will be met...|$|R

The Marine Corps operates a Depot Level Maintenance Program (DLMP) {{to support the}} continued operation of principal <b>end</b> <b>items.</b> Principal <b>end</b> <b>items</b> require periodic induction into the DLMP. This maintenance consists of major systems overhauls aimed at extending {{the life cycle of}} the principal <b>end</b> <b>item.</b> The frequency of these inductions is different for each <b>end</b> <b>item.</b> The number of systems requiring induction into Depot Level Maintenance in a given year is always greater than the funding available in that year resulting in a constraint.

40|$|Material Requirements Planning (MRP) is a {{computer-based}} {{production planning}} and inventory control system. MRP {{is concerned with}} both production scheduling and inventory control. It is a material control system that attempts to keep adequate inventory levels to assure that required materials are available when needed. MRP is applicable in situations of multiple items with complex bills of materials. MRP is not useful for job shops or for continuous processes that are tightly linked. The major objectives of an MRP system are to simultaneously: 1. Ensure the availability of materials, components, and products for planned production and for customer delivery, 2. Maintain the lowest possible level of inventory, 3. Plan manufacturing activities, delivery schedules, and purchasing activities. MRP is especially suited to manufacturing settings where the demand {{of many of the}} components and subassemblies depend on the demands of items that face external demands. Demand for <b>end</b> <b>items</b> are independent. In contrast, demand for components used to manufacture <b>end</b> <b>items</b> depend on the demands for the <b>end</b> <b>items.</b> The distinctions between independent and dependent demands are important in classifying inventory items and in developing systems to manage items within eac...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new model}} for studying requirements planning in multistage production-inventory systems. We first charac-terize how most industrial planning systems work, and we then develop a mathematical model to capture {{some of the key}} dynamics in the planning process. Our approach is to use a model for a single production stage as a building block for modeling a network of stages. We show how to analyze the single-stage model to determine the production smoothness and stability for a production stage and the inventory requirements. We also show how to optimize the tradeoff between production capacity and inventory for a single stage. We then can model the multistage supply chain using the single stage as a building block. We illustrate the multistage model with an industrial application, and we conclude with some thoughts on a research agenda. Most discrete parts manufacturing firms plan theirproduction with MRP (materials requirements planning) systems, or at least, with logic based on the un-derlying assumptions of MRP. A typical planning system starts with a multiperiod forecast of demand for each fin-ished good or <b>end</b> <b>item.</b> The planning system then devel-ops a production plan (or master schedule) for each <b>end</b> <b>item</b> to meet the demand forecast. These production plans for the <b>end</b> <b>items,</b> after offsetting for lead times, then ac...|$|R
