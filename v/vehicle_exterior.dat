25|$|Introduced in 1998 {{with the}} AS200 (Chassis code GXE10) and RS200 (chassis code SXE10) sedans, the compact vehicle was {{produced}} using a shortened, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive midsize platform, allowing Japanese buyers {{to take advantage}} of tax savings imposed by Japanese government regulations concerning <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> dimensions and engine displacement, and adapted parts from the larger second-generation Aristo/GS. The 2.0-liter 1G-FE inline-six powered AS200 (GXE10, sedan) featured a five-speed manual transmission as standard, while a four-speed automatic was optional. The 2.0-liter 3S-GE inline-four-powered RS200 (SXE10, sedan) featured a six-speed manual transmission, while a five-speed automatic was optional. The different size engine choices gave Japanese buyers a choice of which annual road tax obligation they wanted to pay, and the larger engine offered more standard equipment as compensation.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{generation}} (1991-1997) featured a longer wheelbase {{as well as}} greater length, width, and height, while still remaining in the Japanese Governments regulations concerning <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> dimensions and engine displacement. It retained the 4G63B four-cylinder engine, but phased out the 4G37B and replaced the old turbodiesel with a newer and larger 1,997 cc 4D68T powerplant, and in 1993 a 2,350 cc 4G64 {{was added to the}} range. A five-speed manual, or four-speed automatic could be specified, and in high-end models an INVECS electronically controlled four-speed auto with [...] "fuzzy logic" [...] was also available.|$|E
50|$|Sales {{were not}} strong, {{particularly}} due to competition from Honda's other offerings. The sixth-generation Accord coupé received an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights, wheels {{and many other}} body panels, being now marketed as a somewhat separate model from the family-oriented sedan — yet its sedan roots gave it much more utility than the comparatively cramped Prelude. The sixth-generation Civic Si coupé has also gained a reputation {{in its own right}} and was considerably less expensive than the Prelude. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> dimensions of the Prelude were no longer in compliance with Japanese government regulations, and the additional costs contributed to the popularity of smaller Honda products.|$|E

50|$|The Lexus HS (Japanese: レクサス・HS, Rekusasu HS) is a {{dedicated}} hybrid vehicle introduced by Lexus {{as a new}} entry-level luxury compact sedan in 2009. Built on the Toyota New MC platform, it is classified as a compact under Japanese regulations concerning <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> dimensions and engine displacement. Unveiled at the North American International Auto Show in January 2009, the HS 250h went on sale in July 2009 in Japan, followed by the United States in August 2009 as a 2010 model. The HS 250h represented the first dedicated hybrid vehicle in the Lexus lineup, {{as well as the}} first offered with an inline-four gasoline engine. Bioplastic materials are used for the vehicle interior. With a total length of 184.8 inches, the Lexus HS is slightly larger than the Lexus IS, but still smaller than the mid-size Lexus ES.|$|E
5000|$|The stylist {{responsible}} {{for the design of}} the exterior of the vehicle develops the proportions, shape, and surfaces of the <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Exterior</b> design is first done by a series of digital or manual drawings. Progressively, drawings that are more detailed are executed and approved by appropriate layers of management. Clay (industrial plasticine) and or digital models are developed from, and along with the drawings. The data from these models are then used to create a full sized mock-up of the final design (body in white). With three- and five-axis CNC milling machines, the clay model is first designed in a computer program and then [...] "carved" [...] using the machine and large amounts of clay. Even in times of high-class 3d software and virtual models on power walls, the clay model is still the most important tool to evaluate the design of a car and therefore used throughout the industry.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe warning {{effect of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> noise for {{vulnerable}} users has recently emerged. Quieter cars could reduce pedestrians ability to travel safely. One {{of the objectives}} of the EVADER project is to propose technologies that will allow the best compromise between the potential risk of quiet vehicles for pedestrians and the quietness of residents. First, we identified critical safety scenarios, considering the safety risks and strategies used by pedestrians. Then, we defined the type of vulnerable people, the minimal reaction times, and visual obstacles. The paper aims at characterizing different soundscapes, in order to choose psychoacoustic maskers and determine acoustic characteristics of a selection of vehicles. Finally, a measurement protocol, in order to evaluate the auditory detectability of electric vehicles by pedestrians, is proposed. This work intended to fill the gap between <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> noises perceptibility and the accident avoidance...|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{the vehicle}} {{development}} process, automotive manufacturers {{must work to}} meet a variety of customer needs. One increasingly important attribute is <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> perceived quality, which is largely dependent on how well exterior parts fit together. Before vehicles are produced and sold to customers, manufacturers utilize several processes and tools to "tune in" vehicle exteriors. This thesis examines one manufacturer's approach to delivering <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> quality, including a recent change initiative to improve the tune in process. The overall vehicle development process is introduced, and then detail is provided for areas of the process that relate closely to vehicle exteriors. Two areas that are explored in depth are the manufacturer's tune in build strategy and a new exterior fitting fixture implementation. An assessment of build strategy is provided and a framework is proposed. The framework is based on functional build theory and Key Characteristic (KC) chains. Functional build is a process {{to ensure that the}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> meets specifications while allowing engineering teams to determine the best way to solve dimensional problems, {{which may or may not}} include forcing a component in the assembly to design intent. (cont.) A KC chain analysis is one way to view how <b>vehicle</b> <b>exterior</b> requirements relate to each other and engineering organizational structure. Viewing build strategies with these two techniques illustrates how build decisions are impacted by organizational and technical complexity, as well as material rigidity. At an automotive manufacturer, several fitting fixtures are used during the tune in process. An initiative to implement a new fitting fixture is assessed. Both technical and organizational issues are addressed. The conclusion of this thesis is that several factors that are both organizational and technical must be considered in order to gain the benefit of the new fitting fixture. Some of the major factors include: build strategy alignment with the fixture, learning systems to support continuous improvement, and organizational leadership and ownership aligned to quickly solve problems. by Paul T.
