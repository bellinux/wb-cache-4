5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Its great {{distance}} and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale–Bopp might become <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997. However, comet scientists were wary – comets {{can be extremely}} unpredictable, and many have large outbursts at {{great distance}} only to diminish in brightness later. Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a 'comet of the century' and {{turned out to be}} unspectacular.|$|E
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear <b>very</b> <b>bright,</b> shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it would cross Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E
60|$|But {{the little}} bride, simple as she was, had a woman's love of jewels, {{and could not}} forego the hope of {{possessing}} the <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> in the world, {{in spite of the}} perils with which it must be won.|$|R
2500|$|The {{smaller the}} number of a star's magnitude, the {{brighter}} it is. Thus those of the 1st magnitude are brighter {{than those of the}} 2nd. Even negative magnitudes are possible, and the few so rated, though still called [...] "first" [...] magnitude, are the <b>very</b> <b>brightest.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In practice, the {{traditional}} names are only universally {{used for the}} <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> stars (Sirius, Arcturus, Vega, etc.) and for {{a small number of}} slightly less bright but [...] "interesting" [...] stars (Algol, Polaris, Mira, etc.). For other naked eye stars, the Bayer or Flamsteed designation is often preferred.|$|R
5|$|Hale–Bopp became {{visible to}} the naked eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become <b>very</b> <b>bright.</b> It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to estimate the chances of another <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> Kreutz comet arriving in the near future, but given that at least 10 have reached naked eye visibility over the last 200 years, another great comet from the Kreutz family seems almost certain to arrive at some point. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli in 1970 reached an apparent magnitude of 1. In December 2011, Kreutz sungrazer C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) survived its perihelion passage and had an apparent magnitude of −3.|$|E
5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation with Earth, always {{showing the}} same face, with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill {{the spaces between}} the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters. As seen from the Earth, it is the second-brightest regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky, after the Sun. Its surface is actually dark, although compared to the night sky it appears <b>very</b> <b>bright,</b> with a reflectance just slightly {{higher than that of}} worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.|$|E
50|$|Previous sky surveys with {{ground-based}} telescopes have mainly detected giant exoplanets. In contrast, TESS {{will examine}} {{a large number}} of small planets around the <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> stars in the sky. TESS will record the nearest and brightest main sequence stars hosting transiting exoplanets, which are the most favorable targets for detailed investigations.|$|R

He said he had [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> memories" [...] of Mikhail Tal and told an anecdote from the 15th Chess Olympiad about Soviet {{analysis}} of an adjourned game between Fischer and Botvinnik. He was described by Chess24 as being 'sprightly'.|$|R
60|$|So Blacky led the {{way over}} to the most lonesome corner of the Green Forest, {{straight}} to the tree in which Hooty the Owl was comfortably sleeping. Blacky had taken pains to slip over early that morning and make sure just where he was. He had discovered Hooty fast asleep, and he knew that he would remain right where he was until dark. You know Hooty's eyes are not meant for much use in bright light, and the brighter the light, the more uncomfortable his eyes feel. Blacky knows this, too, and he had chosen the <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> part of the morning to call his relatives over to torment poor Hooty. Jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun was shining his <b>very</b> <b>brightest,</b> and the white snow on the ground made it seem brighter still. Even Blacky had to blink, and he knew that poor Hooty would find it harder still.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Simon Spies, {{owner of}} Spies Rejser, speculated in February 1971 {{that he might}} merge his airline Conair of Scandinavia with Trans Polar, {{although}} he also stated that once his airline received new aircraft {{it would no longer}} necessarily need to charter aircraft from other airlines. Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 in pay and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline unless he was paid. The company responded that he would have a very difficult time bankrupting them and the press should instead write about the airline's future, which they regarded as <b>very</b> <b>bright.</b>|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and two straight mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be <b>very</b> <b>bright,</b> and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|E

5|$|Ultraviolet {{astronomy}} employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately 100 and 3200Å (10 to 320nm). Light {{at those}} wavelengths are {{absorbed by the}} Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space. Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited {{to the study of}} thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> in this wave band. This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys. Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei. However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E
5|$|Gamma-ray bursts are <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> as {{observed}} from Earth {{despite their}} typically immense distances. An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star {{of our galaxy}} despite a distance of billions of light years (compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars). Most of this energy is released in gamma rays, although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well. GRB 080319B, for example, was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5.8, {{comparable to that of}} the dimmest naked-eye stars despite the burst's distance of 7.5 billion light years. This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source. Assuming the gamma-ray explosion to be spherical, the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest-mass energy of the Sun (the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation).|$|E

With 9 bodies already discovered this suggests that the inventory of bright KBOs is nearly complete. Comment: Accepted to A...|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{training}} its own {{students through}} {{a wide spectrum}} of courses, JNCASR actively supports a range of education outreach activities. For example, every year the centre's Summer Research Fellowship programme hosts some of the <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> undergraduates in the country; the Educational Technology Unit produces a range of teaching aids and educational material; the centre also organises and teaches short-term courses at universities across India; and promising young chemists and biologists are trained intensively as part of the programmes of Project-Oriented-Chemical-Education (POCE) and Project-Oriented-Biological-Education (POBE).|$|R
60|$|It {{seems to}} me that the years between 1856 and 1861 were the <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> of Coleridge Patteson's life. He had left all for Christ's sake and the Gospel's, and was reaping the blessing in its freshness. His struggles with his defects had been successful, the more so because he was so full of {{occupation}} that the old besetting trouble, self-contemplation, had been expelled for lack of opportunity; and he had become far more simple, since humility was ceasing to be a conscious effort.|$|R
5|$|The Aurigids had a {{spectacular}} outburst in 1994, when many grazing meteors—those {{that have a}} shallow angle of entry and seem {{to rise from the}} horizon—were observed in California. The meteors were tinted blue and green, moved slowly, and left trails at least 45° long. Because they had such a shallow angle of entry, some 1994 Aurigids lasted up to 2 seconds. Though {{there were only a few}} visual observers for part of the outburst, the 1994 Aurigids peak, which lasted less than two hours, was later confirmed by Finnish amateur radio astronomer Ilkka Yrjölä. The connection with Comet Kiess was finally confirmed in 1994. The 2007 outburst of the Aurigids was predicted by Peter Jenniskens and was observed by astronomers worldwide. Despite some predictions that there would be no Alpha Aurigid outburst, many bright meteors were observed throughout the shower, which peaked on September 1 as predicted. Much like in the 1994 outburst, the 2007 Aurigids were <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> and often colored blue and green. The maximum zenithal hourly rate was 100 meteors per hour, observed at 4:15am, California time (12:15 UTC) by a team of astronomers flying on NASA planes.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{collapse}} of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000years. Every nebula begins {{with a certain amount}} of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as <b>very</b> <b>bright</b> condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class0 protostars is high— a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion.|$|E

50|$|Measuring 300 to 390 mm in snout-to-vent length (SVL) when full grown, the San Salvador rock iguana is a {{colorful}} lizard, the coloration varying between subspecies {{as well as}} between individual specimens. The lizard's back color can range from red, orange or yellow, to green, brown or grey, usually patterned by darker markings. The <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> colors (red, orange, blue, or yellow) are normally only displayed by males and are more pronounced when at warmer body temperatures. Immature iguanas lack these bright colors, being either solid brown or grey with faint slightly darker stripes.|$|R

50|$|The <b>very</b> <b>brightest</b> {{part of this}} nebula (the knot at {{the western}} edge) is {{separately}} classified as NGC 896, {{because it was the}} first part of this nebula to be discovered.
