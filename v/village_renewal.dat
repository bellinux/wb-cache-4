50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> scheme was {{carefully}} undertaken to improve infrastructure. These measures, funded through cost-sharing, were at first opposed by many villagers {{owing to the}} great financial burden. It soon became clear, however, {{that there was no}} alternative. The <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> was finished with the building of a village community centre.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001 the {{voluntary}} group Firhouse Village Community Council {{was given a}} mandate at a general meeting to have the title [...] "Firhouse Village" [...] recognised for the area. In pursuing this they obtained EU and National Development Plan grant aid for Firhouse Village Park. While there is no formal definition or legal status of [...] "village" [...] in Ireland, by its name {{and the fact that}} grant aid was obtained under the <b>Village</b> Urban <b>Renewal</b> Scheme and E.U. funding, some form of recognition by the local authority that Firhouse was a village in its own right can be inferred, as the <b>Village</b> Urban <b>Renewal</b> Scheme 2000-2006 allocated monies only to villages throughout Ireland outside Dublin City and County.|$|R

50|$|Dreikirchen is a {{residential}} community with some industry. Since 1994, Dreikirchen {{has been a}} stronghold {{in the realm of}} <b>village</b> <b>renewal.</b> Many improvement measures have already been undertaken; some are in the planning stages, and others have been realized. The community lies in the southern Verbandsgemeinde of Wallmerod, a kind of collective municipality.|$|E
50|$|The village, {{in which}} roughly 310 people live today, has {{retained}} its individual {{character in a}} cared-for and neighbourly atmosphere, underscored by a successful <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> project with much greenery. Particularly worthy of note is the newly remodelled village square around the bakehouse and the old timber-frame middle-class house (Bürgerhaus) that is enjoyed by families for its “homely appearance”.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, {{within the}} {{framework}} of territorial reform in Hesse, Dietkirchen lost its independence and became the first of the surrounding villages to be incorporated into the City of Limburg. Since 2001, Dietkirchen {{has been part of the}} Hessian <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> program. Supported by funding from this program, several old agriculture buildings, particularly on Brunnenstraße and Limburgerstraße, were renovated and converted into homes.|$|E
50|$|The Habsburgs {{ruled the}} cities in Vorarlberg partly from Tyrol and from Further Austria. From 1805 to 1814 {{it belonged to}} Bavaria, then back to Austria. Langenegg was part of Vorarlberg since its {{founding}} in 1861. The place was part of the French occupation zone from 1945 until 1955. On July 6, 2010 Langenegg won the competition for the 11th European <b>Village</b> <b>Renewal</b> Award.|$|E
50|$|Urban renewal {{involves}} {{the relocation of}} businesses, the demolition of structures, the relocation of people, {{and the use of}} eminent domain (government purchase of property for public purpose) as a legal instrument to take private property for city-initiated development projects. This process is also carried out in rural areas, referred to as <b>village</b> <b>renewal,</b> though it may not be exactly the same in practice.|$|E
50|$|Public {{institutions}} are concentrated around the former school whose tower {{can be seen}} far afield. Right near this stand the primary school and the community house, in which is also found the fire brigade’s equipment house. A bus loop with a waiting building rounds out the community institutions {{in the middle of}} the community. A qualified <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> concept guarantees positive development in both the public and private sectors.|$|E

Further responsibilities include land planning and <b>village</b> <b>renewal,</b> and awarding the Rheingau Literatur Preis.|$|E
50|$|In {{the course}} of <b>village</b> <b>renewal,</b> a number of {{measures}} were undertaken: The village thoroughfare was widened, the fountain square was redesigned, a new village square was built, the Wiegehäuschen (“Little Weighing House”) was renovated, a children’s playground was built, and a paved carpark was laid at the municipal building (built in 1960), which itself was renovated and modernized by conversions and additions; furthermore, many trees and shrubs were planted {{in and around the}} village.|$|E
50|$|A tower-like castle {{was built}} around 800, partly {{destroyed}} in 954-55, rebuilt in 1051 and in 1400 {{converted into a}} chapel.It {{was used by the}} people of Engelbrechtsmünster until 1827.The parish of Engelbrechtsmünster was the second largest in the diocese of Regensburg, {{and one of the best}} endowed.It had a number of churches and supported a pastor and several chaplains.In 1971 the village was incorporated into the neighboring town of Geisenfeld.A <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> project was undertaken in 2010.As of 2012 there were 376 inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|They {{have worked}} towards {{retaining}} their original identity through {{a project of}} <b>Village</b> <b>Renewal</b> since the 1990s. Currently, they have been adjudged to be very successful in this regard, and are now known for their established approach to rural development which has become an example in rural development studies in Germany and Europe. Their approach to rural development has become a subject of analyses in an academic research Journal publications, in and outside Germany. Many farming villages in the surrounding area {{are part of the}} municipality.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, Frücht has {{experienced}} a construction boom under a <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> plan. By opening up new land to development, the community {{has been able to}} meet a strong demand for housing in attractive surroundings while still being close to the city. In 1974, the newly built neighborhood [...] "Am Hofacker" [...] was developed. It was followed by the development in the locality called “In den Wiesen / Vordertal”, including the new streets [...] "Grummetwiese", [...] "Im Vogelsang" [...] and the [...] "Mühlenweg." [...] A school built in Frücht in 1962-1963 was renovated into a kindergarten in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Kohr taught {{economics}} and political philosophy at Rutgers University, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, from 1943 to 1955. From 1955 to 1973, he was professor of Economics and Public Administration in the University of Puerto Rico, in San Juan, {{except for a}} period in 1965-66 when he was professor of Economics at the University of the Americas in Mexico City, Mexico; during these years he developed his concepts of <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> and traffic calming, and [...] "lent his advice to local city planning initiatives." [...] He also advised the independence movement of the nearby island of Anguilla.|$|E
50|$|The Electorate of the Palatinate {{geographer}} {{and historian}} Johann Goswin Widder wrote the following in 1788: “The village is currently {{made up of}} 29 families, 116 souls, 18 civic and private houses.” These 116 souls earned their livelihoods almost exclusively at agriculture. Beginning in the mid 20th century, though, more and more farmers were taking up other occupations, working the land only as a secondary source of income, or even giving it up altogether. Today, farming only plays a minor rôle in the village’s life. Many workforce members commute. The village’s basic structure changed. In line with this new employment pattern and by carrying out a <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> plan, the population itself changed, too. People came from elsewhere and moved into empty houses, remodelling them. The downward population trend was thereby slowed down or even reversed.|$|E
50|$|Also {{found in}} Nußbach is the Alte-Welt-Museum (“Old World Museum”), which houses old craft {{exhibits}} and, among other things, an 18th-century loom. The dedication {{took place on}} 15 March 2002, {{and there was an}} “open house” the next day for all who were interested. The museum is housed in a newly renovated timber-frame house, the Haus Wildanger at Bachstraße 2. It has a “great gallery” that can be used as extra room for exhibitions. Planning for the museum began in 1996 {{in the course of a}} <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> programme. Weaving is a traditional craft in Nußbach, with an address book from 1877 listing six linen weavers in the village. Exhibits show how flax is woven into ﬁnished linen. In a key exhibit at the museum, ladies’ historical costume from the 19th and 20th centuries is displayed. On show in the arcade are pictures of timber-frame houses in the district, both still standing and bygone.|$|E
50|$|The {{newly built}} Nantenbach Curve and Nantenbach Main Valley Bridge (Maintalbrücke Nantenbach) on the Aschaffenburg-Würzburg railway {{line and the}} bypass on Bundesstraße 26 have changed the {{community}}’s face considerably. From 1901 to 1982, Neuendorf had its own railway station. Today the community is served by public transport association buses running on the B 26. The community {{is included in the}} Bavarian <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> programme. As part of the village beautification measures, Frankenstraße (street) was at last newly renovated in 2001 and 2002. In past years it was possible with the Würzburg Road Building Office’s help to build a continuous cycle path along the Main to both Gemünden am Main and Lohr am Main. A modern town hall with a multipurpose hall for local clubs, a new kindergarten, and a sporting ground newly built by SV Neuendorf (the sport club) along with its clubhouse should foster the sense of community and a variety of activities in the community.|$|E
50|$|The {{core of this}} village, {{which was}} {{originally}} a small clump village, lies on a low, flat elevation at the valley’s edge, an expanse of land that is somewhat shielded against flooding. In {{this part of the}} village, the old houses built for farming still stand out clearly. In the expansions before the Second World War down the valley and back from the river towards the mountains, a mixture of building forms arose. After the war, farther down the valley in the bow of the Sulzbach and on the mountain slope (Schleidchen), a new, looser housing development was built with many single-family dwellings, and a few multiple-family dwellings. Small industrial facilities are built into the residential area. <b>Village</b> <b>renewal</b> and property boundary rationalization (a kind of Flurbereinigung called Ortslagenflurbereinigung) were also undertaken to promote tourism. Bedesbach has several times been the district-level winner in the contest Unser Dorf soll schöner werden (“Our village should become lovelier”).|$|E
50|$|The {{country is}} divided into 402 {{administrative}} districts: 295 rural districts and 107 urban districts. Germany is among the largest agricultural producers in the European Union. More than half of Germany's territory - almost 19 million hectares - is used for farming, and {{are located in the}} rural areas. Almost 10% of employees in Germany has work linked directly or indirectly with the agricultural, forest and fisheries sectors; approximately a fifth of them are employed in primary production. The implication is that, unlike in some other European countries, where rural areas are known for being backward when compared to urban areas, in Germany, the trend is changing. Due to the country's policy of equal living conditions, {{this is not the case}} in Germany. Rural areas receive nearly equivalent attention as the urban areas do. Also, through a special approach to rural development, usually referred to as <b>Village</b> <b>Renewal,</b> the challenges of rural Germany are taken care of.|$|E
5000|$|Remediation efforts {{occurred}} {{during the years of}} 2011-2016. In the summer of 2011, Holden conducted their normal program, but also began to see work and workers (up to 65) in and around the Village. Continuing during the summer of 2012, these [...] "Early Works" [...] projects prepared the way for the [...] "Heavy Construction" [...] years of 2013-2015. During 2013-2015 Holden Village made creative changes to its program as they housed and fed 200+ construction people working in shifts 24/7 on the project. In late 2016 the number of construction workers on site will decrease as the mine projects wrap up, and Holden volunteers will work on <b>Village</b> <b>renewal</b> projects. Holden Village welcomed guests again for Christmas 2016 and New Year's 2017 and restarted normal operations in the spring of 2017. There will then be a five-year period of testing and analysis to determine whether further work will be necessary in the eastern portion of the affected area. If required, this additional work would have an undetermined (at this time, at least) impact on Holden Village.|$|E
50|$|After the 1948 {{currency}} reform, {{a measure}} of normalcy began to return to village life. In 1949, Bärweiler began holding kermises again. A year later, the gymnastic club was refounded. Since the club had no apparatus at its disposal, it produced two theatrical plays each winter. The admission was 1 DM for each playgoer and the proceeds were used to buy new gymnastic apparatus. The first mayor after the war was Willi Kistner, who was chosen by municipal decision. He remained in office for three years. In 1950, Bärweiler had 420 inhabitants, a peak for the 20th century. It {{can be explained by}} the presence in the village at that time of 12 Germans driven out of Germany’s former eastern territories and other refugees. Moreover, people who had lost homes to bombing in the cities temporarily sought shelter in Bärweiler. Once their dwellings had been reconstructed or repaired, these people mostly went back to their towns and their jobs. Only a few of the refugees stayed in Bärweiler or neighbouring villages. Several medals from the contest Unser Dorf soll schöner werden (“Our village should become lovelier”) bear witness to the successful <b>village</b> <b>renewal</b> measures, which have made Bärweiler into a showplace over the last 20 years.|$|E
