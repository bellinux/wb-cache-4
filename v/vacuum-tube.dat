25|$|In {{industrial}} process control, thousands of analog loop controllers {{were used to}} automatically regulate temperature, flow, pressure, or other process conditions. The technology of these controllers ranged from purely mechanical integrators, through <b>vacuum-tube</b> and solid-state devices, to emulation of analog controllers by microprocessors.|$|E
50|$|By judicious {{choice of}} the screen-grid percentage-tap, the {{benefits}} of both triode and pentode <b>vacuum-tubes</b> can be realised. Over a very narrow range of percentage-tapping, distortion is found to fall to an unusually low value - sometimes less than for either triode or pentode operation - while power efficiency is only slightly reduced compared with full pentode operation. The optimum percentage-tap to achieve ultra-linear operation depends mainly {{on the type of}} valve used; a commonly seen percentage is 43% (of the number of transformer primary turns on the plate-circuit) which applies to the KT88, although many other valve types have optimum values close to this. A value of 20% was recommended for 6V6GTs. Mullard circuits such as the 5-20 also used 20% distributed loading (but did not achieve ultra-linear operation), while LEAK amplifiers used 50%.|$|R
50|$|Although most early radio {{receivers}} used regeneration Armstrong approached RCA's David Sarnoff, who {{he had known}} since giving a demonstration of his regeneration receiver in 1913, about the corporation offering superheterodynes as a superior offering to the general public. (The ongoing patent dispute was not a hindrance, because extensive cross-licensing agreements signed in 1920 and 1921 between RCA, Westinghouse and AT&T meant that Armstrong could freely use the Lévy patent.) Superheterodyne sets were initially thought to be prohibitively complicated and expensive as the initial designs required multiple tuning knobs and used nine <b>vacuum-tubes.</b> However, in conjunction with RCA engineers, Armstrong developed a simpler, less costly design. RCA introduced its superheterodyne Radiola sets in the U.S. market in early 1924, and they were an immediate success, dramatically increasing the corporation's profits. These sets were considered so valuable that RCA would not license the superheterodyne to other U.S. manufacturing companies until 1930.|$|R
25|$|The {{output of}} a given {{microphone}} delivers the same power whether it is low or high impedance. If a microphone is made in high and low impedance versions, the high impedance version has a higher output voltage for a given sound pressure input, and is suitable for use with <b>vacuum-tube</b> guitar amplifiers, for instance, which have a high input impedance and require a relatively high signal input voltage to overcome the tubes' inherent noise. Most professional microphones are low impedance, about 200Ω or lower. Professional <b>vacuum-tube</b> sound equipment incorporates a transformer that steps up the impedance of the microphone circuit to the high impedance and voltage needed to drive the input tube. External matching transformers are also available {{that can be used}} in-line between a low impedance microphone and a high impedance input.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vacuum-tube</b> {{amplification}} {{would not}} be developed until the 1910s, so there were limited means for producing signals strong enough to be heard throughout the system. Therefore, for transmitting the news, announcers with especially loud voices — known as stentors — were hired and instructed to speak as forcefully as possible into specially designed double-receivers.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{nuclear power}} plant was {{commissioned}} on June 27, 1954 in Obninsk. Soviet scientists made a major contribution {{to the development of}} computer technology. The first major achievements in the field were associated with the building of analog computers. In the USSR, principles for the construction of network analysers were developed by S. Gershgorin in 1927 and the concept of the electrodynamic analog computer was proposed by N. Minorsky in 1936. In the 1940s, the development of AC electronic antiaircraft directors and the first <b>vacuum-tube</b> integrators was begun by L. Gutenmakher. In the 1960s, important developments in modern computer equipment were the BESM-6 system built under the direction of S. A. Lebedev, the MIR series of small digital computers, and the Minsk series of digital computers developed by G.Lopato and V. Przhyalkovsky.|$|E
25|$|Mica is {{a natural}} {{material}} and not available in unlimited quantities. So in the mid-1920s the deficiency of mica in Germany and the experience in porcelain—a special class of ceramic—led in Germany to the first capacitors using ceramic as dielectric, founding a new family of ceramic capacitors. Paraelectric titanium dioxide (rutile) {{was used as the}} first ceramic dielectric because it had a linear temperature dependence of capacitance for temperature compensation of resonant circuits and can replace mica capacitors. 1926 these ceramic capacitors were produced in small quantities with increasing quantities in the 1940s. The style of these early ceramics was a disc with metallization on both sides contacted with tinned wires. This style predates the transistor and was used extensively in <b>vacuum-tube</b> equipment (e.g., radio receivers) from about 1930 through the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Systems as {{complicated}} as computers require very high reliability. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The <b>vacuum-tube</b> SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable – installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. Hot-pluggable hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when server farms are the delivery platform. Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working {{on the concept of}} replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.|$|E
2500|$|Thermionic (<b>vacuum-tube)</b> diodes and {{solid-state}} (semiconductor) diodes {{were developed}} separately, at {{approximately the same}} time, in the early 1900s, as radio receiver detectors. [...] Until the 1950s, vacuum diodes were used more frequently in radios because the early point-contact semiconductor diodes were less stable. In addition, most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for amplification that could easily have the thermionic diodes included in the tube (for example the 12SQ7 double diode triode), and <b>vacuum-tube</b> rectifiers and gas-filled rectifiers were capable of handling some high-voltage/high-current rectification tasks better than the semiconductor diodes (such as selenium rectifiers) that were available at that time.|$|E

2500|$|A {{variant of}} the Marchant, called the Binary-Octal Marchant, was a radix-8 (octal) machine. It was sold to check very early <b>vacuum-tube</b> (valve) binary {{computers}} for accuracy. (Back then, the mechanical calculator was much more reliable than a tube/valve computer.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The dual-gate MOSFET has a tetrode configuration, {{where both}} gates control the current in the device. It is {{commonly}} used for small-signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain-side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by Miller effect, replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration. Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing (frequency conversion). The [...] "tetrode" [...] description, though accurate, does not replicate the <b>vacuum-tube</b> tetrode. <b>Vacuum-tube</b> tetrodes, using a screen grid, exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes. These improvements are commonly {{an order of magnitude}} (10 times) or considerably more. Tetrode transistors (whether bipolar junction or field-effect) do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1912 {{there was}} {{increased}} investigation of <b>vacuum-tube</b> capabilities, simultaneously by numerous inventors in multiple countries, who identified additional important {{uses for the}} device. These overlapping discoveries led to complicated legal disputes over priority, perhaps the most bitter being one in the United States between de Forest and Edwin Howard Armstrong over the discovery of regeneration (also known as the [...] "feedback circuit" [...] and, by de Forest, as the [...] "ultra-audion").|$|E
2500|$|By the mid-1930s, {{commercial}} production of TRF receivers was largely replaced by superheterodyne receivers. [...] By the 1940s the <b>vacuum-tube</b> superheterodyne AM broadcast receiver was refined into a cheap-to-manufacture design called the [...] "All American Five", because it only used five vacuum tubes: usually a converter (mixer/local oscillator), an IF amplifier, a detector/audio amp, audio power amp, and a rectifier. [...] From this time, the superheterodyne design {{was used for}} virtually all commercial radio and TV receivers.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph {{approached}} Beckman, who {{proposed that}} {{instead of trying to}} increase the sensitivity of his measurements, he amplify his results. Beckman, familiar with glassblowing, electricity, and chemistry, suggested a design for a <b>vacuum-tube</b> amplifier and ended up building a working apparatus for Joseph. [...] The glass electrode used to measure pH was placed in a grid circuit in the vacuum tube, producing an amplified signal which could then be read by an electronic meter. The prototype was so useful that Joseph requested a second unit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1915, the company {{received}} an Experimental license for station 2XG, located at its Highbridge laboratory. In late 1916, de Forest renewed the entertainment broadcasts he had suspended in 1910, now using the superior capabilities of <b>vacuum-tube</b> equipment. 2XG's debut program aired on October 26, 1916, {{as part of an}} arrangement with the Columbia Graphophone Company to promote its recordings, which included [...] "announcing the title and 'Columbia Gramophone [...] Company' with each playing". Beginning November 1, the [...] "Highbridge Station" [...] offered a nightly schedule featuring the Columbia recordings.|$|E
2500|$|A {{basic list}} of topics {{to be covered}} was prescribed, but {{it was up to}} the schools to develop this into a three-month {{instructional}} program. Mandatory topics included the following: advanced d-c and a-c circuit theory, electrical motors and generators, <b>vacuum-tube</b> characteristics, power supplies, amplifiers, oscillators, modulation techniques, filters and wave-shaping, receiver circuits, transmitter circuits, transmission lines and antennas, and basic electromagnetic propagation theory. Mathematical topics (mainly trigonometry and elementary calculus) were taken up when necessary for developing theoretical equations. Each student built a superheterodyne receiver, and fault-finding was taught using systematic signal-tracing.|$|E
2500|$|The grid Audion, which de Forest called [...] "my {{greatest}} invention", and {{the vacuum}} tubes developed from it, dominated {{the field of}} electronics for forty years, making possible long-distance telephone service, radio broadcasting, television, and many other applications. It {{could also be used}} as an electronic switching element, and was later used in early digital electronics, including the first electronic computers, although the 1948 invention of the transistor would lead to microchips that eventually supplanted <b>vacuum-tube</b> technology. For this reason de Forest has been called {{one of the founders of}} the [...] "electronic age".|$|E
2500|$|The {{lead-acid}} battery is still used today in automobiles and other applications where weight {{is not a}} big factor. The basic principle has not changed since 1859. In the early 1930s, a gel electrolyte (instead of a liquid) produced by adding silica to a charged cell was used in the LT battery of portable <b>vacuum-tube</b> radios. In the 1970s, [...] "sealed" [...] versions became common (commonly known as a [...] "gel cell" [...] or [...] "SLA"), allowing the battery to be used in different positions without failure or leakage.|$|E

Planet of the Vampires, 1965), and a ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vacuum-tube</b> {{amplifiers}} (also {{known as}} tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers {{can be much}} more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, {{as well as in}} musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for [...] "tube sound".|$|E
2500|$|More ambitious demonstrations followed. A {{series of}} tests in {{conjunction}} with the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City were conducted to determine whether it was practical to broadcast opera performances live from the stage. Tosca was performed on January 12, 1910, and the next day's test included Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. On February 24, the Manhattan Opera Company's Mme. Mariette Mazarin sang [...] "La Habanera" [...] from Carmen over a transmitter located in De Forest's lab. But these tests showed that the idea was not yet technically feasible, and de Forest would not make any additional entertainment broadcasts until late 1916, when more capable <b>vacuum-tube</b> equipment became available.|$|E
2500|$|Election return {{broadcasts}} {{had been}} a tradition since shortly after the development of radio, although due to technical limitations initially they could only be done using Morse code, which greatly limited the potential audiences. Following the development of <b>vacuum-tube</b> transmitters that made audio transmissions possible, the first spoken-word election night broadcast was made on November 7, 1916 by the DeForest Radio Telephone and Telegraph Company's station, 2XG, located in the Highbridge section of New York City, {{in conjunction with the}} New York American, announcing the results of the Wilson-Hughes presidential election. On August 31, 1920, the Detroit News, whose [...] "Detroit News Radiophone" [...] began making daily broadcasts on August 20, had broadcast local primary election results.|$|E
2500|$|Ground {{radar systems}} for {{automated}} guidance of aircraft to a predetermined point (e.g., for bomb release using a bombsight or avionics radar) included the July 1951 AN/MPQ-14 Radar Course Directing Central. [...] By 1954 the MARC (Matador Airborne Radio Control) used the AN/MSQ-1A for missile guidance {{to the terminal}} dive point, and SAGE GCI provided computer-controlled guidance of aircraft to continuously-computed interception points (1958 AN/FSQ-7 Bomarc missile guidance and the later Ground to Air Data Link Subsystem for fighters). [...] Despite the availability of solid-state military guidance computers in 1961, planning for a USAF <b>vacuum-tube</b> trajectory computer/radar system began in early 1965. [...] In October 1965, F-100s tested the AN/MSQ-77 at Matagorda Island General Bombing and Gunnery Range on the Texas Gulf Coast.|$|E
2500|$|Hercules {{remained}} a major front-line weapon in Europe into the 1980s. Over the years, the <b>vacuum-tube</b> guidance system, {{as well as}} the complex fire control systems' radars, suffered from diminishing manufacturing source (DMS) issues. In part because of less parts supportability, Western European (Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force (4 ATAF) and Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF) sites essentially became fixed sites and were no longer considered capable of a mobile role. During the last years of their deployment in Europe the issue at hand was more about maintaining security of the nuclear capable missiles, rather than mobility. The DoD invested considerably in upgrading the security of the storage areas of the launcher sections, ultimately installing significant towers that were capable of watching over all three sections within the [...] "exclusion area." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} financing plan, {{of using}} the revenues from radio receiver sales to pay station costs, proved to be insufficient {{for a number of}} reasons. Additional expenses included the requirement to pay royalties to musical composers, plus the fact that, unlike the amateur Westinghouse Company staff performers, professional acts started to expect to be paid in something more tangible than publicity. On the revenue side, Westinghouse found that it didn't have the near-monopoly for selling <b>vacuum-tube</b> receivers that it expected it had gotten through the purchase of the commercial rights to the Armstrong regenerative patent. Armstrong had previously sold [...] "amateur and experimental" [...] rights to around 17 small firms, which also began selling receivers to the general public. Westinghouse sued on the grounds that this went beyond their rights, but lost, which resulted in the formation of a series of major competitors, including Crosley and Zenith.|$|E
2500|$|Microphones {{containing}} active circuitry, such as most condenser microphones, require {{power to}} operate the active components. The first of these used <b>vacuum-tube</b> circuits with a separate power supply unit, using a multi-pin cable and connector. With the advent of solid-state amplification, the power requirements were greatly reduced and it became practical {{to use the same}} cable conductors and connector for audio and power. During the 1960s several powering methods were developed, mainly in Europe. The two dominant methods were initially defined in German DIN 45595 as [...] or T-power and DIN 45596 for phantom power. Since the 1980s, phantom power has become much more common, because the same input may be used for both powered and unpowered microphones. In consumer electronics such as DSLRs and camcorders, [...] "plug-in power" [...] is more common, for microphones using a 3.5mm phone plug connector. Phantom, T-power and plug-in power are described in international standard IEC 61938.|$|E
2500|$|Westinghouse's {{preparations}} {{included the}} construction of a shack and antenna system {{on the roof of the}} nine story K Building at the East Pittsburgh Works in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. Frank Conrad had originally planned to broadcast the election results over 8XK, in cooperation with the American Radio Relay League, but shifted his efforts to help with the Westinghouse broadcast. He and Donald G. Little had primary responsibility for constructing a 100 watt <b>vacuum-tube</b> transmitter. A telephoned temporary authorization was received to operate under the call sign of 8ZZ. (The first [...] "Z" [...] in this call sign indicated it was a [...] "Special Amateur" [...] grant, which was a classification that permitted the use of transmitting frequencies other than the congested 200 meter (1500 kHz) standard amateur wavelength.) Although the pre-broadcast publicity and contemporary accounts stated that 8ZZ was the call sign used for the election night broadcast — for example, in 1922 L. R. Krumm, Westinghouse's Superintendent of Radio Operations, referred to Westinghouse's [...] "station at East Pittsburgh, now known as KDKA, the matured successor of 8ZZ" [...] — later reviews, including a 1930 re-creation of the original broadcast, often incorrectly state that the KDKA call sign was used during the debut broadcast.|$|E
