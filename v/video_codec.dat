The DVD and Blu-ray were released in both Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1 and Pan and Scan versions and both included a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. The releases also included a number of special features, such as film previews and a six-part making-of documentary. The film was also released on UMD for Sony's PlayStation Portable on August 22, 2006; there are no special features but the disc includes a 1.78 widescreen format, Dolby Digital 2.0, and subtitles. An HD DVD was released in Germany by Concorde Home Entertainment on August 22, 2007, containing the film encoded in the VC-1 <b>video</b> <b>codec</b> and also has the main audio track in DTS-HD, and retaining the film aspect ratio of 2.35:1.|$|E

2500|$|The codec was {{originally}} part of Nero Digital, a complete MPEG-4 Audio/Video solution. The ASP/AVC (<b>video)</b> <b>codec</b> {{was developed by}} a French company called Ateme. Nero built an in-house team to develop the AAC (audio) codec that included Ivan Dimkovic, Menno Bakker, and others. Dimkovic {{was the author of}} the PsyTel codec, and the Nero AAC codec is said to be based on this work. Menno Bakker was the developer of FAAC, one of the earliest widely available AAC encoders, and also what would be become its companion decoder, FAAD. The Nero AAC codec became a stand-alone package around 2006, although still called Nero Digital Audio until 2009. Nero apparently still uses the codec in its products. Neither Dimkovic nor Bakker currently work at Nero, and development of the codec has stalled, but the software is stable and remains a reliable, and high-quality, option for AAC encoding.|$|E
