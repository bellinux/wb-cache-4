5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by <b>volume</b> <b>expansion</b> during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} the lithium–sulfur design {{is that when the}} sulfur in the cathode absorbs lithium, <b>volume</b> <b>expansion</b> of the LixS {{compositions}} happens, and predicted <b>volume</b> <b>expansion</b> of Li2S is nearly 80% of the volume of the original sulfur. This causes large mechanical stresses on the cathode, which is a major cause of rapid degradation. This process reduces the contact between the carbon and the sulfur, and prevents the flow of lithium ions to the carbon surface.|$|E

40|$|A CO 2 {{expanded}} carbonation {{technique is}} proposed for direct synthesis of alumina powders {{that does not}} require structure directing substances or templates. Mesoporous amorphous flower-like alumina was synthesized at relatively low <b>volume</b> <b>expansions</b> (lower ethanol to water volume ratio), whereas mesoporous crystalline honey-comb-like alumina was synthesized at high <b>volume</b> <b>expansions.</b> The alumina powders exhibited high surface area and pore size with small crystallite sizes. The alumina structures were stable from 400 to 800 °C. Experimental tests showed that the alumina powders could catalytically convert cyclohexanone to Ε-caprolactone efficiently. The use of the calcined catalysts (at 400 and 800 °C; flower-like alumina) at equal ethanol to water volume ratio avoids the usual and inevitable hydrolysis of Ε-caprolactone to Ε-hydroxyhexanoic acid. The catalyst was recyclable and stable {{for up to five}} reaction cycles. ? 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

25|$|Despite the inefficient {{production}} of aldosterone, the more characteristic mineralocorticoid effect of 11β-OH CAH is hypertension. Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme over{{production of}} 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood. DOC is a weak mineralocorticoid, but usually reaches high enough levels in this disease to cause effects of mineralocorticoid excess: salt retention, <b>volume</b> <b>expansion,</b> and hypertension.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} aid design of future {{structural}} battery components an analytical model is developed for modelling <b>volume</b> <b>expansions</b> in laminated structural batteries. <b>Volume</b> <b>expansions</b> {{are caused by}} lithium ion intercalation in carbon fibre electrodes. An extended version of Classical Lamination Plate Theory (CLPT) is used to allow analysis of unbalanced and unsymmetric lay-ups. The fibre intercalation expansions are treated analogously to a thermal problem, based on experimental data, with intercalation coefficients relating the fibre capacity linearly to its expansions. The model is validated using FEM and allows {{the study of the}} magnitude of interlaminar stresses and hence the risk of delamination damage due to the electrochemically induced expansions. It also enables global laminate deformations to be studied. This allows information about favourable lay-ups and fibre orientations that minimise deformations and the risk of delamination to be obtained.

25|$|At {{the glass}} {{transition}} temperature the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding Tg then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below Tg the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all <b>volume</b> <b>expansion</b> projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require high Tg matrix.|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is {{hyperplastic}} and overstimulated, with no impairment of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough <b>volume</b> <b>expansion,</b> blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.|$|E
