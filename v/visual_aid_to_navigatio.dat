40|$|Science {{commonly}} stated as {{a difficult}} subject {{for the student}} to learn and for the teacher to deliver. One of the problem often arose from the fact that students sometimes cannot visualize the object which the teacher trying to describe. This problem cause minimum engagement inside the classroom. Since most people can perceive visual better than auditory, therefore without <b>visual</b> <b>aid,</b> the learning process somehow disturbed. Good teachers occasionally would bring <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> support their explanation on science subject, however most of those <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> was in 2 D which often fail to bring clear picture of the object which originally in 3 D. By engaging 3 D modeling technology in the creation of mobile learning application, student will be equipped with more realistic <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> help them grab a better understanding of science while study with their teacher or independently.

25|$|Another {{problem was}} navigation. As night-flying aids {{in a day}} fighter were rudimentary, an {{elaborate}} system of <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> <b>to</b> navigation had to be established, encompassing light beacons, searchlight patterns, flak guns firing combinations of various tracer colours through the clouds and parachute flares. To {{make up for the}} lack of <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at night. Another navigation aid was simply the Allied bombing target; a city illuminated as it burned would guide the fighters to their target.|$|R
