Pigment {{components}} present in the eggs include bilin and carotenoids such as idoxanthin, crustaxanthin, and <b>vitamin</b> <b>A2</b> aldehyde (3-dehydroretinal). The bilin and retinal produces the base green color, {{and the amount of}} relative idoxanthin content is the key determinant of the color variation. Study of its prey (such as the amphipods) or the fish's stomach contents reveal negligible traces of idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, which means the fish must be internally converting other carotenoid substances such as astaxanthin that are abundant in their food into idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, given that fish in general cannot build their own carotenoid wholly out of building block materials. Researchers hypothesize that the intake of astaxanthin influences the idoxanthin concentration in the body, which result in the egg color change.|$|E
