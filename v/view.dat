5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views. Action <b>view</b> is a {{trailing}} third-person shot similar to {{looking over the}} player-character's shoulder, while Sports <b>view</b> is a spectator perspective similar that of a televised basketball game. Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports <b>view.</b> The camera <b>view</b> cannot be changed once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports <b>view</b> will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action <b>view</b> camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E

5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist <b>view</b> {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their <b>view</b> is a compatibilist <b>view</b> of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible).

40|$|Background: Television <b>viewing</b> {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in preschoolers (3 - 5 years). Because of the adverse health outcomes {{related to this}} behavior, {{it is important to}} investigate associations and mediators of young children's television <b>viewing</b> time. This study investigated whether parental rules regarding television <b>viewing</b> time and parental concerns about screen <b>viewing</b> activities mediated the association between parents' and preschoolers' television <b>viewing</b> time. Methods: Mediation analyses were performed with the product-of-coefficient test on data derived from the Australian HAPPY study (n = 947) and the Belgian sample of the ToyBox-study (n = 1527). Parents reported their own and their child's television <b>viewing</b> time, their rules regarding television <b>viewing</b> and concerns about their child's screen <b>viewing</b> activities. Results: Parents' television <b>viewing</b> time was directly associated with preschoolers' television <b>viewing</b> time and parental rule for television <b>viewing</b> time mediated this association in both samples (14. 4 % and 8. 1 % in the Australian and Belgian samples, respectively). Conclusions: This study is unique in examining the mediating pathway of parental television <b>viewing</b> and a rule limiting TV <b>viewing</b> time and whether this is consistent in different samples. Due to the consistent importance, both parents' television <b>viewing</b> time and rules should be targeted in interventions to decrease preschoolers' television <b>viewing</b> time...|$|R
