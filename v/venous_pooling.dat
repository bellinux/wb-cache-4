Neurogenic and hypovolaemic shock can also cause fainting. In these cases, the smooth muscles surrounding the veins become slack and the veins fill with the majority of the blood in the body, keeping blood away from the brain and causing unconsciousness.

30|$|The {{diagnostic}} criteria of the FDG-PET/CT {{were based on}} visual evaluation of a higher abnormal vessel wall uptake than that in the blood pool. For qualitative evaluation, the vessel standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of each vascular region {{was defined as the}} maximal value by drawing several volumes of interest (VOIs) with a radius of 5  mm. For normalizing the SUVmax value, we also calculated the ratio of the arterial SUVmax to that of the <b>venous</b> blood <b>pool,</b> also known as the target-to-background ratio (TBR). Rudd et al. described the TBR as a reproductive and quantitative method for assessing the arterial wall [33]. Besson et al. reported the utility of TBR for the assessment of aortic inflammation in giant cell arteritis patients [34]. With regard to the background, the VOIs in the inferior vena cava and right atrium were also measured.

In all three patients groups severe disturbances of skin microcirculation could be observed. In the POAD group changes of areterial perfusion pressure play an important role for microcirculatory responses. When perfusion pressure is impaired by leg elevantion tcPO 2 recordings are impaired, too. In contrast to healthy subjects who show a decrease of cutaneous flow when they rise form lying to standing, all patients with PAOD increased with tcPO 2 (37 degree C) indicating the disturbance of integrity of this reflex. The same pattern of reactions occurs during the venous occlusion manoeuvre. Patients with CVI are mainly compromised by their venous hypertension. Leg elevation leeds to an outflow of blood from <b>venous</b> <b>pools.</b> Therefore skin capillary blood flow is increased as was shown by both methods. When venous pressure is incrased during leg dependency cutaneous blood flow is derminished. This effect is more marked than the pure vasoconstrictor response in healthy subjects. The same effect could be recorded during the venous occlusion procedure. In the third group (PAOD combined with CVI) most of the effects on skin microcirculate are paralysed by both disorders.

40|$|Studies were {{performed}} on 11 healthy men to evaluate the role of low pressure baroreceptors in the reflex forearm vasoconstrictor responses (plethysmography) to <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> produced by lower body negative pressure. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) at - 5, - 10, - 20, and - 40 mm Hg lowered central venous pressure by 42, 59, 74, and 93 %, respectively, and decreased forearm vascular conductance by 24, 29, 34, and 40 %, respectively. The decreases in forearm blood flow and conductance during the low levels of <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> (LBNP - 5 and - 10 mm Hg) occurred without significant changes in arterial pressure, arterial dP/dt. and heart rate. These results with the low levels indicate that maneuvers which decrease venous return and central venous pressure in man can influence forearm vascular tone without {{significant changes in the}} determinants of carotid and aortic baroreceptor activity. During high levels of <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> (LBNP - 20 and - 40 mm Hg), significant decreases in arterial pressure and dP/dt and significant increases in heart rate accompanied the further reductions in central venous pressure, forearm blood flow, and forearm vascular conductance. About 73 % of the decrease in conductance during <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> at LBNP - 40 mm Hg, which was sufficient to decrease arterial pressure and activate high pressure baroreceptor reflexes, occurred during low levels of <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> at LBNP - 10 mm Hg without changes in arterial pressure.

This was a major step in extracorporeal life support. In the years following (1972 – 1976) the first published reports of the successful use of extracorporeal life support emerged [9].

40|$|A dip {{in blood}} {{pressure}} (BP) in response to head-up tilt (HUT) or active standing {{might be due to}} rapid pooling in the veins below the heart (preload) or muscle activation-induced drop in systemic vascular resistance (afterload). We hypothesized that, in the cardiovascular response to passive HUT, where, in contrast to active standing, little BP dip is observed, features affecting the preload play a key role. We developed a baroreflex model combined with a lumped-parameter model of the circulation, including viscoelastic stress-relaxation of the systemic veins. Cardiac contraction is modeled using the varying-elastance concept. Gravity affects not only the systemic, but also the pulmonary, circulation. In accordance with the experimental results, model simulations do not show a BP dip on HUT; the tilt-back response is also realistic. If it is assumed that venous capacities are steady-state values, the introduction of stress-relaxation initially reduces <b>venous</b> <b>pooling.</b> The resulting time course of <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> is comparable to measured impedance changes. When venous pressure-volume dynamics are neglected, rapid (completed within 30 s) <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> leads to a drop in BP. The direct effect of gravity on the pulmonary circulation influences the BP response in the first approximately 5 s after HUT and tilt back. In conclusion, the initial BP response to HUT is mainly determined by the response of the venous system.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{experiments}} {{it was decided}} to have each test-subject serve as his own control by fitting the test-subjects with a G-suit and comparing the condition of inflated G-suit to the normal situation. G-suit inflation was intended to only displace blood on the venous side of the circulation, not to increase total peripheral resistance. Therefore, a very modest inflation of 50 mmHg was applied. This was considered sufficient to expel most of the blood from the <b>venous</b> <b>pool</b> in abdomen and legs, even under the condition of increased G-loading in the pull-up phase. The parabolas were to be undergone in three body positions: standing upright, sitting and supine. The prediction of the experimental outcome was that we would find no difference between transients with and without G-suit inflation in the supine position, that an initial overshoot in pressure and stroke volume in the upright position would be very much damped by the G-suit, even more in the standing than in the sitting position. Studies were performed in 5 flights of NASA's KC- 135, in January 1993. Per flight 40 parabolas were flown in an adapted 'roller coaster profile', i. e. 0 -G phases were followed by a 2 -G pull-out phase, after a very brief 1 -G phase again followed by the next 2 -G pull-up phase. This sequence was flown for 10 parabolas, then a 1 -G horizontal flight period was inserted. The first 3 parabolas of each set of 10 the subjects were sitting upright, seat belt fastened. The next three they were standing, feet stuck under a load strap on the floor, stabilizing themselves by a grip on the ceiling.

40|$|Diving {{involves}} breathing of pressurized inert gas, which accumulates in {{body tissues}} during the dive. When the diver ascends towards the surface, {{the pressure is}} relieved and gas bubbles may form. These bubbles are {{the root cause of}} Decompression Sickness (DCS) and staged ascent schedules are used to prevent this event. Available procedures are shown to have shortcomings in terms of safety and efficiency, which is the motivation for the work behind the present thesis. The thesis presents a new decompression algorithm founded on a dynamic dual-phase model, named Copernicus, using Venous Gas Emboli (VGE) as a stress predictor. VGE is the occurrence of intra-vascular bubbles in the central <b>venous</b> <b>pool,</b> where the bubbles may be detected using ultrasonic Doppler or imaging. VGE is graded after a semi-quantitative scale, and is currently the only objective measure of decompression stress. Copernicus is calibrated against three different data sets of VGE measurements in human divers, counting 457 exposures in total. The data consist of complete time-sampled depth trajectories from computer logs combined with post-dive measurements of bubble grade. A selected set of model parameters is estimated using nonlinear optimization of a cost function based on least square error. Since the model fundamentals are derived from a physiological approach, many of the model coefficients are given from individual and physiological parameters. Individual settings, such as weight, age, and fitness level, will thus affect the model outcome. Workload estimates from heart-rate measurements are also incorporated in the model by modifying tissue gas dynamics in real time. With a comprehensive and observable model as foundation, optimal control theory is applied to calculate decompression procedures. It is hypothesized that if post-dive VGE peak is kept sufficiently low, the risk of DCS is at an acceptable level, which, in this thesis, is defined as a Low VGE (LVGE) dive. The methodology is based on nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to provide the fastest possible ascent schedule subject to the constraint of a model-predicted VGE peak. Implementation aspects for low-cost, embedded processors in dive computers are also discussed, using explicit solutions through multi-parametric nonlinear programming (mp-NLP).

40|$|Short-term {{cardiovascular}} {{responses to}} postural change from sitting to standing involve complex {{interactions between the}} autonomic nervous system that regulates blood pressure, and cerebral Autoregulation that maintains cerebral perfusion. We present a mathematical model that can predict dynamic changes observed in beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity during postural change from sitting to standing. Our cardiovascular model utilizes 11 compartments to describe blood pressure, blood flow, compliance and resistance in the heart and systemic circulation. To include dynamics due to the pulsatile nature of blood pressure and blood flow, resistances in the large systemic arteries are modeled using nonlinear functions of pressure.

We retrospectively evaluated 37 patients with IgG 4 -related disease (IgG 4 -RD) who underwent both FDG-PET/CT and CECT. The arterial SUVmax and its value normalized to the background <b>venous</b> blood <b>pool</b> (BP) [...] the target-to-background ratio (TBR) in the entire aorta and the major first branches [...] were measured. Active vascular inflammation was considered in cases with a higher FDG uptake than BP and a thickened arterial wall (> 2 mm). Results: Fifteen (41 %) patients exhibited IgG 4 -aortitis. Most patients (80 %) showed multiple region involvement. The entire aorta, including the major first branches, were involved, typically showing a thickened wall and high FDG uptakes. The most common site was the iliac arteries (35 %), followed by the infrarenal abdominal aorta (33 %), thoracic aorta (8 %), first branches of the thoracic aorta (8 %), suprarenal abdominal aorta (6 %), and the first branches of the abdominal aorta (5 %). The IgG 4 -aortitis-positive vessel regions were thickened, with an average maximal wall thickness of 6. 3 ± 2. 9 mm. The SUVmax and TBR values were significantly higher in the IgG 4 -aortitis-positive regions (median 3. 7 [1. 6 - 5. 5] and 2. 1 [1. 4 - 3. 7], respectively) than in the IgG 4 -aortitis-negative regions (median 2. 1 [1. 2 - 3. 7] and 1. 3 [0. 9 - 2. 3], respectively; p < 0. 0001). The IgG 4 -aortitis-positive group patients were older (69. 5 ± 6. 0 vs. 63. 3 ± 12. 6 years, respectively) and had a higher male predominance (80 vs. 55 %, respectively) than the negative group, although the differences were not significant (p = 0. 17 and p = 0. 06, respectively).

40|$|Cardiovascular and {{postural}} {{control systems}} have been studied independently despite the increasing evidence showing the importance of cardio-postural interaction in blood pressure regulation. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of cardio-postural interaction in relation to cardiac baroreflex in blood pressure regulation under orthostatic stress before and after mild exercise. Physiological variables representing cardiovascular control (heart rate and systolic blood pressure), lower limb muscle activation (electromyography), and postural sway (center of pressure derived from force and moment data during sway) were measured from 17 healthy participants (25 ± 2 years; 8 females) during a sit-to stand test before and after sub-maximal exercise. The cardio-postural control (characterized by baroreflex-mediated muscle-pump effect in response to blood pressure changes, i. e., muscle-pump baroreflex) was assessed using wavelet transform coherence and causality analyses {{in relation to the}} baroreflex control of heart rate. Significant cardio-postural blood pressure control was evident counting for almost half of the interaction time with blood pressure changes that observed in the cardiac baroreflex (36. 6 - 72. 5 % pre-exercise and 34. 7 - 53. 9 % post-exercise). Thus, cardio-postural input to blood pressure regulation should be considered when investigating orthostatic intolerance. A reduction of both cardiac and muscle-pump baroreflexes in blood pressure regulation was observed post-exercise and was likely due to the absence of excessive <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> and a less stressed system after mild exercise. With further studies using more effective protocols evoking <b>venous</b> <b>pooling</b> and muscle-pump activity, the cardio-postural interaction could improve our understanding of the autonomic control system and ultimately lead to a more accurate diagnosis of cardio-postural dysfunctions...|$|E
30|$|The {{current study}} has several limitations. The study {{population}} was small, and these results {{will need to}} be validated in a larger prospective study. Only a single patient with an anaplastic astrocytoma was evaluated, severely limiting our ability to characterize fluciclovine PET uptake in this important class of glioma and how it relates to either glioblastomas or LGGs. Additionally, the low fluciclovine uptake seen in both diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas may be an artifact of the small sample size, thus explaining the difference between our study and previous reports of relatively high uptake of MET and FET in tumors with oligodendroglial components [28, 32]. Also, in contradistinction to other amino acid radiopharmaceuticals, such as FET and FDOPA, we found no statistically significant difference between <b>venous</b> blood <b>pool</b> and normal brain parenchymal SUVmean. These other amino acids are known to have higher brain parenchyma uptake compared to blood pool, and this difference may be due to our small sample size or possibly less penetrance of the intact BBB [33]. Future studies are being planned to include patients with suspected glioma as evidenced by MRI to undergo fluciclovine PET prior to surgical intervention, to better evaluate the transport of fluciclovoine PET across an intact BBB.|$|R
30|$|Most of our {{respondents}} decide to decompress the abdomen based {{on the presence of}} organ dysfunction or failure in combination with IAH (Figure 3). The attitude towards the critical threshold (> 20 mmHg or > 25 mmHg) divides respondents into two groups of similar size (39 % vs 46 %). This is comparable to the surveys done by Ravishankar and Mayberry ([4, 9], Table 1). One reason may be the lack of evidence as prospective outcome studies are missing and the mortality rate of ACS has remained high despite decompression [18, 31]. Tiwari describes a reluctance among surgeons to operate patients with ACS [2]. They probably try to avoid complications associated with decompression and the management of an open abdomen as described by Kirkpatrick et al. in their survey of Canadian surgeons [10]. This restraint might arise from reports about sudden deaths following surgical decompression in patients suffering from IAH and ACS [32 – 34]. Fatal outcome in these patients might be related to fatal pulmonary embolism caused by venous stasis in the splanchnic <b>venous</b> capacitance <b>pool</b> during IAH/ACS. It has also been stated that lethal acute circulatory collapses and asystolia after decompression might be caused by the release of anaerobic metabolic products and inflammatory mediators from prior less perfused tissues (ischemia-reperfusion syndrome [35, 36]). This pathogenesis, however, is not generally accepted.|$|R

On propranolol, heart rate was 10 bpm lower supine and 20 bpm less at 60 deg but cardiac output {{was only slightly}} lower before and following tilt-up. However, after 15 min upright, stroke volume and cardiac output recovered on propranolol exceeding the controls after 21 min without change in heart rate. Returning to supine, heart rate dropped in all tests with a transitory increase in stroke volume, cardiac output and arteriovenous O 2 difference. At the same time, apparent O 2 uptake increased temporarily, reflecting the return of <b>pooled</b> <b>venous</b> blood to the lungs. Orthostatic tolerance {{did not appear to}} be affected by beta-adrenergic blockade...|$|R
