500|$|Hitler's letters provide {{evidence}} that {{he was fond of}} her, and worried when she participated in sports or was late returning for tea. His secretary Traudl Junge stated that during the war, Hitler telephoned Braun every day. He was concerned for her safety when she was staying in the Munich home he had bought her. Junge further asked Hitler once why he never married. Hitler replied, [...] "...I wouldn't have been able to give enough time to my wife". Hitler told her that he didn't want children, as they would have had [...] "...a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time,</b> because they're expected to possess the same gifts as their famous parents and they can't be forgiven for being mediocre". In the end, Hitler and Braun married in the Berlin Führerbunker in late April 1945, less than 40 hours before committing suicide together.|$|E
500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time.</b> Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

500|$|Brosnan {{also raises}} money for {{charitable}} causes through sales of his paintings. After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I {{always wanted to be}} an artist, a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you see yourself in the world…from a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities."

50|$|In the 19th century, {{emigration}} to the United States started. One of {{the most}} important causes of this emigration was the emergence of steamships.

2500|$|Promiscuities received, in general, {{negative}} reviews. A New York Times review characterized Wolf as a [...] "frustratingly inept messenger: {{a sloppy}} thinker and incompetent writer.

Two days earlier, however, a different Times reviewer praised the book, writing, [...] "Anyone—particularly anyone who, like Ms. Wolf, {{was born in the}} 1960s—will have a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> putting down Promiscuities. Told through a series of confessions, her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire." [...] In contrast, The Library Journal excoriated the work, writing, [...] "Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white, middle-class, liberal milieu to a whole generation....There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument." ...|$|E

Yet, the only musical relic that remains from the period is the Excultet, a representation from the 11th century of two angels playing trumpets that is preserved in the Basilica of San Nicola in Bari.
