40|$|Abstract This study aims to {{determine}} whether <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> can aid the diagnosis of functional visual loss and differentiate it from optic neuritis in children. The medical records and <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> of 72 patients registered in the neurophysiological database of our Institution in the period 2000 - 2009, with diagnoses of functional visual loss or optic neuritis were reviewed retrospectively. In 61 children, <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> confirmed the diagnosis: 49 functional visual loss and 12 optic neuritis. <b>Visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were normal in all patients but 1 in the functional visual loss group, while all were abnormal in the optic neuritis group. Overlapping clinical features occurred between the 2 {{groups as well as}} prevalent severe visual loss, relative afferent pupillary defect, and papillitis in optic neuritis. <b>Visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> are of value in confirming clinical suspicion of functional visual loss, particularly when clinical overlap with optic neuritis occurs...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionAlzheimer‘s {{disease is}} a long term {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disease and might affect the retinal nerve fibre layer thickness of the eye. There is increasing evidence that <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> which are an objective way to indicate visual field loss, might {{be affected by the}} disease as well. Material and Methods 22 patients (mean age: 75. 9 &# 177; 6. 1 years; 14 women) with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer‘s disease and 22 sex-matched healthy patients were examined. We compared the use of <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness using latest high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography with eye-tracking capabilities for optimised peripapillary scan centring {{for the first time in}} Alzheimer‘s disease patients. ResultsThe mean MMSE score was 22. 59 &# 177; 5. 47 in the Alzheimer‘s disease group, and did not significantly correlate with the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> latencies. We found no significant difference between the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> latencies of the Alzheimer‘s disease patients and those of the control patients. No peripapillary sector of the retina had a retinal nerve fibre layer thickness significantly correlated with the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> latencies. DiscussionWe demonstrated that pattern <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> did not show any significant correlation despite subtle loss in retinal nerve fibre layer thickness. It remains open whether additional flash <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> combined with retinal nerve fibre layer thickness analysis may be useful in diagnosing Alzheimer‘s disease, particularly for mild-to-moderate stages of the disease...|$|R
40|$|Background Migraine is {{a complex}} multifactorial disease that arises from the {{interaction}} between a genetic predisposition and an enabling environment. Habituation is considered as a fundamental adaptive behaviour {{of the nervous system}} that is often impaired in migraine populations. Given that migraineurs are hypersensitive to light, and that light deprivation is able to induce functional changes in the visual cortex recognizable through <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> habituation testing, we hypothesized that regional sunlight irradiance levels could influence the results of <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> habituation studies performed in different locations worldwide. Methods We searched the literature for <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> habituation studies comparing healthy volunteers and episodic migraine patients and correlated their results with levels of local solar radiation. Results After reviewing the literature, 26 studies involving 1291 participants matched our inclusion criteria. Deficient <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> habituation in episodic migraine patients was reported in 19 studies. Mean yearly sunlight irradiance was significantly higher in locations of studies reporting deficient habituation. Correlation analyses suggested that <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> habituation decreases with increasing sunlight irradiance in migraine without aura patients. Conclusion Results from this hypothesis generating analysis suggest that variations in sunlight irradiance may induce adaptive modifications in visual processing systems that could be reflected in <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> habituation, and thus partially account for the difference in results between studies performed in geographically distant centers. Other causal factors such as genetic differences could also play a role, and therefore well-designed prospective trials are warranted. Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept is}} as follows: Each visual field {{location}} is stimulated with a stimulus sequence that is uncorrelated to the sequences {{used for the}} other locations. All visual field locations are stimulated in parallel with their individual stimulus sequence. The retinal or cortical activity, which {{is a mixture of}} the responses from all visual field locations, is recorded with usual electroretinographic or <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> methods, respectively. Due to the independence of the stimulus sequences, the responses for each visual field location can be extracted using mathematical algorithms.|$|E
5000|$|The visual N1 is a <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential,</b> {{a type of}} event-related {{electrical}} potential (ERP), that is produced {{in the brain and}} recorded on the scalp. The N1 is so named to reflect the polarity and typical timing of the component. The [...] "N" [...] indicates that the polarity of the component is negative with respect to an average mastoid reference. The [...] "1" [...] originally indicated that it was the first negative-going component, but it now better indexes the typical peak of this component, which is around 150 to 200 milliseconds post-stimulus. The N1 deflection may be detected at most recording sites, including the occipital, parietal, central, and frontal electrode sites. Although, the visual N1 is widely distributed over the entire scalp, it peaks earlier over frontal than posterior regions of the scalp, suggestive of distinct neural and/or cognitive correlates. The N1 is elicited by visual stimuli, and is part of the <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> - a series of voltage deflections observed in response to visual onsets, offsets, and changes. Both the right and left hemispheres generate an N1, but the laterality of the N1 depends on whether a stimulus is presented centrally, laterally, or bilaterally. When a stimulus is presented centrally, the N1 is bilateral. When presented laterally, the N1 is larger, earlier, and contralateral to the visual field of the stimulus. When two visual stimuli are presented, one in each visual field, the N1 is bilateral. In the latter case, the N1's asymmetrical skewedness is modulated by attention. Additionally, its amplitude is influenced by selective attention, and thus it has been used to study a variety of attentional processes.|$|E

Some studies in children show that iron deficiency anemia affects on <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> waves. In this study, we evaluated the effect of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia on <b>visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> in adults. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted on 99 non-pregnant women. Patients divided into three groups. Women whose ferritin and hemoglobin levels are less 15 ng/ 1 and 12 mg/dl placed in iron deficiency aimena group, women whose ferritin level is less than 15 ng/ 1 and hemoglobin level is more than 12 mg/dl, placed in iron deficiency puorg and women whose ferritin and hemoglobin levels are more than 50 ng/ 1 and 12 mg/dl, chosen as control group. <b>Visual</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> was done from both eyes and the results evaluated by ANOVA test. Results: The average of N 75 latency was 65. 24 ± 5. 06 miliscecond in anemia group, 66. 27 ± 7. 77 miliscecond in iron deficiency group and 67. 19 ± 6. 79 miliscecond in control group. The average of P 100 latency was 101. 60 ± 9. 05 miliscecond in anemia group, 102. 75 ± 7. 91 miliscecond in iron deficiency group and 100. 67 ± 7. 34 miliscecond in control group. The average of N 135 latency was 139. 18 ± 31. 21 miliscecond in anemia group, 144. 81 ± 10. 73 miliscecond in iron deficiency group and 141. 81 ± 10. 73 miliscecond in control group.
