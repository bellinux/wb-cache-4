50|$|In a non-mythological context, xenia {{provided}} for the equitable treatment of foreign dignitaries, traders, and guests while <b>visiting</b> <b>alien</b> city-states through {{the office of the}} proxenos. A proxenos was a city-appointed official, either a native or a resident alien, who would look over the citizens of a specific foreign city when they visited the city he represented. That is, for example, a native citizen of Athens or a resident Corinthian would be appointed proxenos for visitors of Corinth in Athens, and was therefore responsible for both diplomacy between the two cities and the interests of Corinthian citizens in Athens. Looking after another city's citizens meant arranging for favors as mundane as obtaining theater tickets, to more complicated procedures, such as ensuring access to capital or an audience with city officials. In addition to cities, trade groups or other organizations might appoint a proxenos to ensure their clients were treated fairly during visits.|$|E

40|$|Indian {{writing in}} English has stamped its greatness by mixing up {{tradition}} and modernity {{in the production}} of art. The interest in literature lit the burning thirst of the writers which turned their energy and technique to innovate new forms and styles of writing. Earlier novels projected India’s heritage, tradition, cultural past and moral values. But a remarkable change can be noticed in the novels published after the First World War, which is called, modernism. Amitav Ghosh is one among the postmodernists. He is immensely influenced by the political and cultural milieu of post independent India. Being a social anthropologist and having the opportunity of <b>visiting</b> <b>alien</b> lands, he comments on the present scenario. As per postmodernists, national boundaries are hindrances to human communication. They believe that Nationalism causes wars. So, post-modernists speak in favour of globalization. Amitav Ghosh’s novels centre on multiracial and multiethnic issues: As a wandering cosmopolitan, he roves around and weaves them with his narrative beauty. In The Shadow lines, Amitav Ghosh makes the East and West meet on a pedestal of friendship, especially through the characters like Tridib, May and etc. He stresses more on the globalization rather than nationalization. This paper attempts to expose the postmodern elements are Class politics, Exploring issues of Nationhood and Diaspora, Non-absolute space and Co-existence impossible in The ShadowLines...|$|E
