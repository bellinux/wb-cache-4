500|$|A {{different}} {{rhythm and}} tempo {{occurs in the}} middle where it main composition has rock influences and piano, as Banderas uttered the line, [...] "She didn't say much, but she said it loud". The choir is brought back towards the end, followed by an orchestral passage consisting of the main theme, accompanied by sounds of gong and timpani. Madonna sings the final verses, uttering the lines [...] "share my glory, so share my coffin". Author J. Randy Taraborrelli complemented Madonna's singing in the book, , describing her vocals as [...] "supple and strong". This view was shared by author Lucy O'Brien in [...] who said that [...] "the sweetness {{and the power of}} Madonna's <b>voice</b> <b>comes</b> out as never before on these tracks". It also received positive review from Paul Verna of Billboard, who listed the [...] "flamenco flavored" [...] song as a highlight from the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Eternal Pyre {{features}} three {{tracks in}} total. [...] "Cult" [...] {{was characterized by}} Thom Jurek as [...] "scathing rejection of religion as the cause for world conflict." [...] The song revolves around guitarist Kerry King's perception of flaws in American religion and was a comment on America, which he describes as [...] "the biggest cult in the world". Their performance was positively commented on, with Pitch.com saying that [...] "King and Jeff Hanneman riff like they're summoning a storm of thunder, lightning and human blood," [...] and was also noted to be a down-tuned, two-string vamp [...] "that slithers into the foreground creates a tension as Lombardo's cymbals call the band into the riff that opens the tune. It's slow, meaty, unrelenting in its tautness. When Araya's <b>voice</b> <b>comes</b> in, the whole track is off the rails and stays there." [...] "War Ensemble" [...] was filmed live from Germany, and contains four minutes of studio footage. Lyrics were said to [...] "please fans still harboring a grudge from Catholic school." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Real Song for the Deaf", {{which is}} {{essentially}} Track 0, {{is located in the}} pregap of Track 1 as a hidden track. The hidden track can be found by rewinding the first track to roughly -1:33. A <b>voice</b> <b>comes</b> on and says: [...] "Huh? What?" [...] and a pattern of low-frequency bass plays and modulates {{for the rest of the}} song.|$|E

2500|$|Once, {{asked what}} was her {{favourite}} role, she answered: [...] "Isolde made me famous. Turandot made me rich". When long-time Metropolitan Opera director Sir Rudolf Bing was asked if she was difficult, he reportedly said, [...] "Not at all. You put enough money in, and a glorious <b>voice</b> <b>comes</b> out". When Nilsson was preparing her taxes and was asked {{if she had any}} dependents, she replied, [...] "Yes, just one, Rudolf Bing".|$|E
2500|$|Beckett's prose pieces {{during the}} late period were not so {{prolific}} as his theatre, {{as suggested by the}} title of the 1976 collection of short prose texts Fizzles (which the American artist Jasper Johns illustrated). Beckett experienced something of a renaissance with the novella Company (1980), which continued with Ill Seen Ill Said (1982) and Worstward Ho (1984), later collected in Nohow On. In these three [...] "'closed space' stories," [...] Beckett continued his preoccupation with memory and its effect on the confined and observed self, {{as well as with the}} positioning of bodies in space, as the opening phrases of Company make clear: [...] "A <b>voice</b> <b>comes</b> to one in the dark. Imagine." [...] "To one on his back in the dark. This he can tell by the pressure on his hind parts and by how the dark changes when he shuts his eyes and again when he opens them again. Only a small part of what is said can be verified. As for example when he hears, You are on your back in the dark. Then he must acknowledge the truth of what is said." [...] Themes of aloneness and the doomed desire to successfully connect with other human beings are expressed in several late pieces, including Company and Rockaby.|$|E

6000|$|And {{all this}} time I was busily wooing Mistress Dolly; but she, little minx, would give me no satisfaction.
