Despite a straightforward mechanism of action, results of negative pressure wound therapy {{studies have been}} inconsistent.

40|$|High-temperature {{annealing}} of {{gallium arsenide}} in <b>vacuum</b> causes <b>excess</b> evaporation of arsenic, with accumulation of gallium as liquid droplets on the surface. Using real-time in situ surface electron microscopy, {{we found that}} these droplets spontaneously run across the crystal surface. Running droplets have been seen in many systems, but they typically require special surface preparation or gradient forces. In contrast, we show that noncongruent evaporation automatically provides a driving force for running droplets. The motion is predicted and observed to slow and stop near a characteristic temperature, with the speed increasing both below and above this temperature. The same behavior is expected to occur during the evaporation of similar III-V semiconductors such as indium arsenide...|$|R

Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate sheer fabric curtain). <b>Excess</b> <b>vacuum</b> is [...] "bled off" [...] by partially opening a bleed port or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool. The bleed port is typically located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of {{high quality}} boron carbide (B 4 C) powders is {{achieved}} by carbothermal reduction of boron oxide (B 2 O 3) from a condensed boric acid (H 3 BO 3) /polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) product. Precursor solutions are prepared via free radical polymerisation of vinyl acetate (VA) monomer in methanol {{in the presence of}} dissolved H 3 BO 3. A condensed product is then formed by flash evaporation under <b>vacuum.</b> As <b>excess</b> VA monomer is removed at the evaporation step, the polymerisation time is used to manage availability of carbon for reaction. This control of carbon facilitates dispersion of H 3 BO 3 in solution due to the presence of residual VA monomer. B 4 C powders with very low residual carbon are formed at temperatures as low as 1, 250 °C with a 4 hour residence time...|$|R
40|$|A Penning trap {{experiment}} for {{the determination}} of the g-factor of the bound electron in heavy highly-charged ions, ALPHATRAP, is under construction at the Max-Planck-Institute in Heidelberg MPIK. As a part of this experiment, a vacuum valve and an electromechanical switch were constructed and tested. ALPHATRAP will be connected to an electron-beam ion trap (EBIT) via a room temperature beam-line. Since trapping of highly-charged ions requires extremely good <b>vacuum,</b> in <b>excess</b> of 10 - 15 mbar, the external flow of the background gas from the room-temperature beam-line has to be reduced significantly. Therefore, a cryogenic vacuum valve was developed, which enables adequate storage times. The valve is manually actuated, and operates at cryogenic temperatures as well as in strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, for the image-current detection electronics a cryogenic electromechanical switch was developed. The switch is actuated by a piezoelectric element. Advantages compared to semiconductor devices are negligible leakage currents for the switch being in open position and negligible dielectric losses. The switch is designed as a single-pole single-throw switch and has a residual resistance of only 11 m. The designs and test results of the devices are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{more fully}} developed, {{electronic}} valve operation will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, {{could be made}} much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or [...] "dead hole". Another even more significant advancement will be {{the elimination of the}} conventional throttle. When a car is run at part throttle, this interruption in the airflow causes <b>excess</b> <b>vacuum,</b> which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder, placed just before the intake valves. With electronic valve operation, {{it will be possible to}} control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At part throttle, when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each valve event, and opens it all the way up.|$|R
40|$|Important and crucial {{element in}} the {{management}} of the technological flow of production of sugar product standards is the period of time the enrichment of massecuite, since its neutralization in the process of crystal formation in <b>vacuum</b> apparatus, <b>excess</b> sugar solution. Although currently proposed and implemented in the industry, including as a front-end accompany the process, a number of ways in the real world sugar production in many cases have to resort to the services of an experienced operator. It is obvious that in any case it is necessary to have a surround-dependent glucose solution data on time for the excess sugar solution into the vacuum apparatus. With regard to the period of the enrichment of depleted sucrose solution are entered into this substance excess sucrose solution, {{it should be noted that}} this problem is theoretically still insufficiently developed. It is obvious that for practical purposes it is desirable to have a simple and convenient for engineering calculation of sugar processing time dependencies of the specified volume of water from the operating parameters of the process (the required concentration of sucrose, temperature of the solution stirring). The problem is the quantitative analysis of sucrose crystallization in vacuum apparatus, including the timing of enrichment solution to the excess syrup, period of time processing massecuite total this apparatus has been investigated in many works. However, due to its importance to the task of obtaining commercial sugar high standards this issue required further in-depth examination. In the article to support the enrichment process solution sucrose due to neutralize this solvent system in vacuum apparatus, from the standpoint of diffusion theory provides a more reasonable compared to known so far, quantitative analysis of this process. Where as sucrose crystals team are considering a system of balls, uniformly distributed in vacuum apparatus.

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of one year of tests of a three-channel water vapour {{radiometer}} (WVR) on two VLA antennas. The output from one of the circularly-polarized feeds of a standard VLA 22 -GHz receiver is split on exiting the dewar; one signal path leads to a temperature-stabilized plate on which the WVR detection system is mounted, the other leads to the normal astronomical system electronics. We measure the correlation between fluctuations in astronomical phase (assumed to be dominated by the troposphere),, and the WVR difference output from the two antennas, on various timescales. We find that in all cases applying a correction derived from the WVR improves the rms phase, for observing frequencies ranging from 8 GHz to 43 GHz. The improvement is most dramatic when the sky is clear and the tropospheric phase fluctuations are large. When there are clouds present the WVR output is contaminated by the fluctuations in system temperature caused by liquid water, and the correlation between and the WVR output is not as good. However, even in this case the RMS phase is still improved by applying a correction derived from the correlation. 1. BACKGROUND TO WATER VAPOUR RADIOMETRY The dominant source of phase fluctuations for the EVLA at high frequencies (GHz) will be fluctuations in the water vapour content of the troposphere.

40|$|Vacuum {{assisted}} radial consolidation {{has been}} increasingly used to stabilise soft clays worldwide. The {{advantages of the}} combined vacuum-surcharge pressure over the conventional surcharge alone such as reduction of the embankment height, increasing the rate of consolidation, and increasing the factor of safety of the embankments against failure are appreciated however they are not precisely addressed in the literature. In this research a comprehensive laboratory {{study was conducted to}} capture the effects of combined vacuum-surcharge pressure during radial consolidation. The modification of a Rowe cell was initiated at the University of Wollongong to monitor lateral effects of <b>vacuum</b> pressure on <b>excess</b> pore water pressure and associated effective stresses. The new apparatus was then employed to develop a radial consolidation model incorporating the effects of vacuum pressure and non-linear flow relationship via flow velocity-hydraulic gradient relationship during radial consolidation. Based on the laboratory observation, degree of consolidation and back calculated coefficient of consolidation increase with increasing vacuum pressuretotal surcharge ratio (VSR). Coefficients of consolidation back calculated from excess pore water pressure dissipation showed lower values than those back calculated from settlement data. Empirical formulations were then developed to calculate both these coefficients for varying VSR based on settlement based determined from oedometer testing. Decrease in excess pore water pressure across the soil due to the application of vacuum pressure inside the vertical drains is not immediate and its non-linear variation depends on the radial distance from the drain and elapse time after the application of vacuum. During laboratory studies in this research, it was shown that the application of a combined vacuum-surcharge pressure results in a higher rate of excess pore pressure dissipation and settlement than the application of conventional surcharge alone. Higher gain in effective stresses and higher overconsolidation ratio were consequently observed after the removal of vacuum. Considering these effects, a design methodology was proposed incorporating VSR to minimise the removal of embankments which in turn reduces both the time and the cost of the projects and plays as a more environmentally friendly technique by reducing the extent of earthworks that is typically associated with surcharge-only embankments. Using modified Rowe cell, new non-linear flow relationship was proposed during vacuum assisted radial consolidation eliminating the shortcomings of the conventional methods. The relationship was then used to develop a radial consolidation model incorporating the effects of vacuum pressure. It was shown that the proposed model can effectively be used for both laboratory and field conditions and its predictions provided better agreement with the measured data than the existing models...|$|R
