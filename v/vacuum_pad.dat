40|$|Abstract: In this article, a new {{proportional}} pneumatic floating <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> {{is developed}} and constructed. There are two features concerning this new <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad.</b> The {{first is the}} inclusion of a proportional solenoid, which enables the continuously variable control of the suction force output. The floating mechanism design between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the work-piece is the second feature, which is more preferable in real industries because it can protect the surface of the work-piece from scratches or other damage. Moreover, in addition to the open-loop gap control mode, two closed-loop gap control schemes are proposed in this paper. The first is the constant gap control. A preset gap is input to the controller as the command input that further drives the proportional solenoid to maintain a steady-state gap between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the work-piece. In the second control approach, the gap between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the work-piece is kept as large as possible to minimize the energy consumption. Both closed-loop control schemes are successfully implemented in this study...|$|E

This paper {{is concerned with the}} development of a new energy-saving <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> using CFD-technique. Nowadays, application of pneumatic vacuum pads may be found in many different real industries, especially in the field of automatic conveyer system, automatic assembly line, semiconductor industry as well as silicon wafer factory, etc. Traditional vacuum pads generally utilize nozzles to create the effect of vacuum. In this paper, however, a new idea to generate the effect of vacuum is proposed by designing a structure similar to that of an aerostatic bearing. In details, the air is guided to flow through an optimally designed restrictor inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and flow out through the outlet between the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> and the sucked work-piece. Therefore, according to Bernoulli’s equation, the air pressure near the center line of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> decreases because of the increased airflow velocity. Consequently, the effect of vacuum is generated. To achieve two preset requirements, that is, large suction force output and low air consumption, the commercial CFD-RC software is utilized to simulate the air flow field and design the optimal geometry inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad.</b> Experimental results further prove that the new <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> with two preset features is successfully developed and implemented in this study. cs 201...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The world’s first ship-to-ship {{automatic}} dock-ing {{system has}} been developed to provide a safe and reli-able solution for docking between two ships exchanging containers in ocean. The system consists of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pads,</b> robot arms, cables, automatic winches and fenders. Basi-cally, the docking status is maintained by contact force of fenders and cable tension controlled by automatic winches. All the developmental procedures from the conceptual design to the final prototype-system demonstration are presented focusing {{on the details of}} the two most important features: the passive- and emergency-mode controls. The passive-mode control makes the docking system freely follow the relative motion between the two ships without resistance. In case of emergency, the emergency-mode control is activated and the docking connection can be instantly released. A prototype was built to demonstrate the technical and operational feasibility in the actual ocean environment...|$|R
40|$|Flush {{mounting}} of {{a sensor}} on a surface {{is provided by}} first forming a recessed area on the surface. Next, an adhesive bonding mixture is introduced into the recessed area. The adhesive bonding mixture is chosen to provide thermal expansion matching with the surface surrounding the recessed area. A strip of high performance polymeric tape is provided, with the sensor attached to the underside thereof, and the tape is positioned over the recessed area so that it acts as a carrier of the sensor. A shim having flexibility {{so that it will}} conform to the surface surrounding the recessed area is placed over the tape, and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pad</b> is placed over the shim. The area above the surface is then evacuated while holding the sensor flush with the surface during curing of the adhesive bonding mixture. After such curing, the pad, shim, and tape are removed from the sensor, electrical connections for the sensor are provided, after which the remaining space in the recessed area is filled with a polymeric foam...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{sliding force}} {{arising from the}} closed chain {{mechanism}} among the adhering points of a climbing caterpillar robot (CCR), a sliding phenomenon will happen at the adhering points, e. g., the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pads</b> or claws holding the surface. This sliding force makes the attachment of the climbing robot unsteady and reducesthe motion efficiency. According to the new bionic research on the soft-body structure of caterpillars, some flexible structures made of natural rubber bars are applied in CCRs correspondingly as an improvement to the old rigid mechanical design of the robotic structure. This paper firstly establishes the static model of the sliding forces, the distortion of flexible bars and the driving torques of joints. Then, a method to reduce the sliding force by exerting a compensating angle to an active joint of the CCR is presented. The analyses and experimental {{results indicate that the}} flexible structure and the compensating angle method can reduce the sliding forces remarkably...|$|R
40|$|The {{suitability}} of the MoorMasterTM system by Cavotec MSL in inland shipping is researched. It is an innovative mooring system using <b>vacuum</b> <b>pads</b> with active motion control, utilising a PID controller. A {{case study of}} a 110 m Large Rhine vessel moored directly beside the Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (ARK) is performed. In order for the system to be suitable, the ship motions have to remain within certain mooring criteria, while passing vessels {{should not have to}} reduce speed. The forces on the moored vessel caused by the passing vessels are simulated using ROPES, a numerical method based on a 3 D flow model, using the panel method. Three different passing vessels at three different passing distances are simulated. All passing vessels are simulated to sail at the maximum allowed speed in the ARK. Next, the manoeuvring model is used to set up the equations of motion of the moored vessel. The external force consists of the forces calculated in the Ropes simulations and the modelled forces of the MoorMasterTM units. Solving these equations results in the ship motions.

30|$|The {{investigation}} of CeN nanoribbon {{is carried out}} through density functional theory (DFT) using TranSIESTA module in SIESTA package [6]. DFT method is a good approach to study the electronic transport property of nanomaterials. TranSIESTA enables the molecular electronic device based on DFT to estimate the self-consistent electronic structure of nanomaterials within the three-dimensional electrodes at different chemical potentials. DFT methods explore the information concerning the scattering region, transmission coefficient, electron current and non-equilibrium forces in the system [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In the present work the calculation was based on DFT with the electronic exchange, and correlation effects are designated by generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The electron–electron interactions of the molecules are estimated with GGA through Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange correlation [12, 13]. In the present work, GGA–PPE functional is used throughout the calculation [14, 15, 16, 17]. The optimization of the molecular geometry is taken into picture by decreasing the atomic forces of the atoms, which is smaller than 0.05  eV/Å. The sampling of the Brillouin zones is done with 3  ×  3  ×  50  k points. The real space grids for the electrostatic potentials are calculated with the mesh cut-off energy of 10 − 5 eV. The atomic coordinates are adjusted without any symmetry constraint with a convergence criteria of 0.05  eV for energy and 0.05  Å for displacement. CeN nanoribbon electronic transport property is calculated using <b>vacuum</b> <b>padding</b> of 10  Å, which is modeled along x- and y-axis to avoid {{the interaction of the}} nanoribbon with their periodic images. The atoms in nanoribbon are free to move in their positions until a convergence criteria with the force less than 0.05  eV/Å on each and every atom in the CeN nanoribbon is achieved. The electronic transport system is being divided into three subsystems: left electrode, right electrode, and the scattering region which consists of CeN. The electronic transport properties and optimization of the CeN scattering region are carried out by the double zeta plus polarization (DZP) basis set for the CeN nanoribbon scattering region and for electrode region in the present study.|$|R
40|$|Linear aerostatic {{bearings}} {{are frequently}} used in high precision stages for their advantageous bearing properties, with low friction and absence of stick-slip being most notable. To improve relatively low out-of-plane stiffness of air bearings, pre-loading is applied. A common method of pre-loading is by utilizing vacuum, where a constant vacuum force decreases film height resulting in increased stiffness. Other methods for increasing stiffness are available, {{which is an}} active field of research. However, high stiffness results in strong coupling between bearing and running surface, transferring unwanted external vibrations. The amount of vibration transfer is quantified as transmissibility, which is the ratio of displacements between coupled surfaces. This property is frequency dependent. To reduce disturbance from external vibrations, this research focusses on reducing air bearing stiffness by combining pressurized and <b>vacuum</b> bearing <b>pads,</b> which to {{the knowledge of the}} author has not yet been researched. To analyse stiffness behaviour, air bearings have been modelled based on Reynolds equation. The effect of a vibrating running surface is modelled by linear perturbation of Reynolds equation. Resulting equations have been solved with a self developed finite volume method code, resulting in air film stiffness and damping as a function of frequency in an computationally efficient manner. Two combinations of thrust and vacuum bearings with a stable low stiffness operating point have been designed with the developed models. By offsetting vacuum and thrust surfaces or by using a micrometer pocket in the thrust bearing surface, vacuum and thrust stiffness cancel out, creating a range of low stiffness between regions with higher stiffness. To validate the models, air bearings have been manufactured. Measurements on restrictor properties have shown the literature model to be invalid for realistic pressure drops. Without taking the measured restrictor behaviour into account, model and measurement will not match. Also shown is that controlling surfaces flatness is essential for predictable bearing behaviour. Performance of available production methods is thoroughly researched. Model and measurement correspondence can only be achieved by taking surface properties into account. Also, the low tip-tilt stiffness of a single air bearing has been found to negatively effect measurements on film height. By using three bearings in the measurement set-up, tip-tilt stiffness has been significantly increased. This reduces measurement uncertainty. By taking these findings into account, excellent agreement between measurements and model has been achieved. This clears the way for development of a low stiffness prototype, combining thrust and vacuum bearings. Ideas on model improvement and prototype development are shared in the recommendations.
