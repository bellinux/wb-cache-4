5|$|After the {{garrison}} of Nevesinje had been relieved, Laxa directed his main effort towards the Gacko and Avtovac districts. Sensitive {{to the fact}} that the Italians had not respected the territorial borders of the NDH when they sent their column to Gacko, he considered it <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> Croatian military and political prestige be restored, otherwise the Italians might decide to remain in the area rather than withdraw to their garrison near the Adriatic coast. He planned to follow this consolidation by clearing the border areas with Montenegro then clearing the hinterland of any remaining rebels. For this last task he intended to deploy a yet-to-be-formed special unit to be led by Lieutenant Colonel Josip Metzger. The task of re-asserting NDH authority in the Gacko and Avtovac districts was allocated to Prohaska's group, consisting of the 6th Battalion, one company of the 18th Battalion, two companies of the 17th Battalion, and the recently arrived 15th and 21st Battalions, which were to be sent to Nevesinje from Mostar. Prohaska was to act in concert with the 11th Battalion who were already in the vicinity of Plužine, just to the north of the Nevesinje–Gacko road. In preparation, the 15th Battalion was trucked to Nevesinje, and a company of the 17th Battalion conducted a coordinated attack with the 11th Battalion on rebel positions near Kifino Selo. This attack was defeated by the rebels, and a battalion commander was killed.|$|E

It is generally suggested that the stirrup be no more than 1inch larger than the widest part of the sole of the rider's boots.|$|E

25|$|The {{attractiveness}} of a constructed wetlands solution {{lies in its}} relative low cost. They are limited by the metal loads they can deal with (either from high flows or metal concentrations), though current practitioners have succeeded in developing constructed wetlands that treat high volumes (see description of Campbell Mine constructed wetland) and/or highly acidic water (with adequate pre-treatment). Typically, the effluent from constructed wetland receiving near-neutral water will be well-buffered at between 6.5-7.0 and can readily be discharged. Some of metal precipitates retained in sediments are unstable when exposed to oxygen (e.g., copper sulfide or elemental selenium), and it is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the wetland sediments remain largely or permanently submerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though {{we think that the}} problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, it is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E

Examples of clear fluids are apple juice, chicken and/or beef broth or bouillon, lemon-lime soda, lemonade, sports drink, and water. It is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the patient remain hydrated. Sports drinks contain electrolytes which are depleted during the purging of the bowel. Orange juice, prune juice, and milk containing fiber should not be consumed, nor should liquids dyed red, purple, orange, or sometimes brown; however, cola is allowed.

25|$|In {{order to}} deliver the {{developed}} product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and software components at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When {{this is not the}} case the software vendor will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.|$|E

500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> he doesn't trust the Klingons.

500|$|... d [...] The {{propaganda}} line of Jewish Bolshevism {{was used}} intensively by Nazis in instigating antisemitic feelings among Lithuanians. It built upon the pre-invasion antisemitic propaganda of the anti-Soviet Lithuanian Activist Front which had seized upon {{the fact that}} more Jews than Lithuanians supported the Soviet regime. This had helped to create an entire mythos of Jewish culpability for the sufferings of Lithuania under the Soviet regime (and beyond). A LAF pamphlet read: [...] "For the ideological maturation of the Lithuanian nation it is essential that anticommunist and anti-Jewish action be strengthened [...] It is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> this opportunity be used {{to get rid of the}} Jews as well. We must create an atmosphere that is so stifling for the Jews that not a single Jew will think that he will have even the most minimal rights or possibility of life in the new Lithuania. Our goal is to drive out the Jews along with the Red Russians. [...] The hospitality extended to the Jews by Vytautas the Great is hereby revoked for all time because of their repeated betrayals of the Lithuanian nation to its oppressors." [...] An extreme faction of the supporters of Augustinas Voldemaras, a group which also worked within the LAF, actually envisioned a racially exclusive [...] "Aryan" [...] Lithuanian state. With the start of German occupation, one of Kaunas' newspapers – Į Laisvę (Towards Freedom), commenced a spirited antisemitic crusade, reinforcing the identity of the Jew with communism in popular consciousness: [...] "Jewry and Bolshevism are one, parts of an indivisible entity." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Zaillian's central {{objective}} was to maintain the novel's setting. To portray Larsson's vision of Sweden, and the interaction of light on its landscape, Fincher cooperated with an artistic team that included cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and production designer Donald Graham Burt. The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED MX digital camera, chosen to help evoke Larsson's tone. The idea, according to Cronenweth, was to employ unorthodox light sources and maintain a realistic perspective. [...] "So there may be shadows, there may be flaws, but it's reality. You allow silhouettes and darkness, {{but at the same}} time we also wanted shots to counter that, so it would not all be one continuous dramatic image." [...] Sweden's climate was a crucial element in enhancing the mood. Cronenweth commented, [...] "It's always an element in the background and it was <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>that</b> you feel it as an audience member. The winter becomes like a silent character in the film giving everything a low, cool-colored light that is super soft and non-direct." [...] To get acquainted with Swedish culture, Burt set out on a month-long expedition across the country. He said of the process, [...] "It takes time to start really taking in the nuances of a culture, to start seeing the themes that recur in the architecture, the landscape, the layouts of the cities and the habits of the people. I felt I had to really integrate myself into this world to develop a true sense of place for the film. It was not just about understanding the physicality of the locations, but the metaphysics of them, and how the way people live comes out through design." ...|$|E
