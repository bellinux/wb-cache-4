40|$|Nitrogen {{is universally}} {{present in all}} steels, and {{although}} its solubility under normal steelmaking conditions is small it can exert large effects on steel properties. Some of these effects are detrimental, often being associated with various embrittlement phenomena. This has led to liquid steel refining processes designed, amongst other things, to decrease the nitrogen content. However nitrogen also has beneficial effects, and since it is abundant and cheap, different steels containing enhanced nitrogen have been developed, Nitrogen levels obtained in the traditional steelmaking processes are well established. In the present investigation a detailed study of the origin and control of nitrogen in the New Zealand Steel iron and steelmaking process has been studied. The progress of 18 individual heats was followed by collecting samples at successive processing stages, and {{an attempt was made}} to correlate the observed nitrogen with recorded process variables. It was found that hot metal from the melters had an average nitrogen content of 0. 002 % and a further increase in nitrogen content was observed at VRU. However, there was a drop in nitrogen content after oxygen blowing in the KOBM. It is suggested that nitrogen in solution in the liquid steel is absorbed into gas bubbles passing through the steel bath giving a flushing action, consequently carbon monoxide bubbles formed during oxygen lancing will effectively reduce the nitrogen content. There was a significant increase in nitrogen content between the KOBM samples and LTS samples, and a further increase in nitrogen content was observed in the GGM samples. These increases at the LTS and CCM seem to result from the absorption of nitrogen during tapping, transferring the ladle to the LTS and teeming at the CCM where there is little protection of the molten stream from the atmosphere and consequential nitrogen absorption. This investigation examines the effect of thermal treatments on the precipitation of <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> in high strength, low alloy steels. The thermal cycle of a hot rolling strip mill has been simulated in the laboratory and precipitation of <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> studied. The solubility of <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> in high strength, low alloy type steels was determined for temperatures from 900 °C - 1250 °C, and the ferrite grain size after the simulated thermal cycle determined. Change in yield strength, charpy transition temperature and strain age propensity as a result of <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> precipitation, have also been determined. The effect of a normalizing heat treatment subsequent to the simulated thermal cycle was also examined. Analysed Ninsol suggests that the precipitation of <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> is rapid in the high temperature ferrite phase range, and is diffusion controlled. Peak precipitation of <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> has been shown to occur at a simulated coiling temperature of 700 °C for the high strength, low alloy steels examined. Minimum ferrite grain size for the simulated thermal cycle, and for samples subsequently normalized, suggest that <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> formed in the ferrite phase dominates the subsequent ferrite grain size. The mechanical properties of these high strength, low alloy steels {{have been shown to be}} dependent on both grain size and <b>vanadium</b> <b>nitride</b> precipitated during the simulated hot rolling thermal cycle. Nitrogen also has an influence on the microstructure and properties of dual phase steels. Nitrogen increases the hardenability of the austenite phase formed at intercritical annealing temperature by partitioning. Manganese retards the partitioning of nitrogen by forming atom pairs within the iron lattice and providing low energy sites for nitrogen atoms. In this present investigation the partitioning of nitrogen has been investigated for a range of steels with manganese contents up to 1. 5 %. Significant partitioning of both nitrogen and manganese was shown to occur during the intercritical annealing heat treatment. Partitioning of nitrogen in low manganese steels was shown to be rapid, but with increased managanese content, partitioning of nitrogen retarded. This retardation was proportional to the manganese content. The effect of manganese partitioning on the formation of dual phase microstructure has also been examined...|$|E

In this study, an attempt to characterize the creep behaviour of three ASTM grade high alloy steels to determine their suitability for use in various steam turbine applications was made. The steels of interest were ferritic in nature and include a 12 %CrMoV stainless steel, a 1 %CrMoV steel, and a steel suitable for nitriding. The testing consisted mainly of creep tensile tests to determine the creep behaviour of these materials at temperatures near the service temperature, which is approximately 538 °C. Other tests such as tensile and hardness tests were also performed to determine or verify other material properties. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and Xray analysis work were performed on as-received materials and ruptured creep, specimens. The results of the creep testing showed that the creep strength and oxidation resistance of the 12 %CrMoV steel was significantly {{greater than that of}} the two low alloy steels, although the rupture ductility was significantly lower.

In addition to double-layer (electrostatic) charge storage, these materials store charge via a pseudocapacitive mechanism involving charge-transfer reactions. The goal of my research is to investigate the charge-storage mechanism of these materials as electrochemical capacitor electrodes. Nitrides and carbides of molybdenum, vanadium and tungsten were synthesized using a temperature-programmed reaction method.

The active electrolyte ions contributing to charge storage were identified by pairing each ion in the standard electrolyte with an inactive counter ion. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in each of these electrolytes.

It was registered the drop of corrosion rates values in two orders of magnitude for sample processed at 0. 5 mA/cm 2 in reference to untreated material...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{isothermal}} aging on precipitation behaviour and Charpy impact toughness of Nb-V stabilised 18 Cr- 2 Mo {{ferritic stainless steel}} was investigated by means of Thermo-Calc prediction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Charpy impact toughness testing. The results show that, niobium, <b>vanadium</b> carbides and <b>nitrides,</b> Fe 2 Nb (Laves phase) and Cr 23 C 6 formed after 2 h aging at 800 °C, and the equilibrium solvus temperature of Fe 2 Nb phase increases to above 750 °C, higher than the calculated temperature (730 °C) using Thermo-Calc. After isothermal aging at 750 - 950 °C, 2 h aging resulted in a decrease in toughness due {{to the formation of}} precipitation, especially (Nb,V) (C,N) and Fe 2 Nb. When isothermally aged at 800 °C for up to 24 h, the coarsening rate of Fe 2 Nb particle is much higher than that of (Nb,V) (C,N), and the impact toughness of the steel is dependent on quantity and sizes of (Nb,V) (C,N) and Fe 2 Nb particles...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe method {{proposed}} by Tkatchenko and Scheffler [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009) ] to correct density functional calculations {{for the missing}} van derWaals interactions is implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code and tested {{on a wide range}} of solids, including noble-gas crystals, molecular crystals (alpha-N- 2, sulfur dioxide, benzene, naphthalene, cytosine), layered solids (graphite, hexagonal boron <b>nitride,</b> <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide, MoS 2, NbSe 2), chain-like structures (selenium, tellurium, cellulose I), ionic crystals (NaCl, KI), and metals (nickel, zinc, cadmium). In addition to the original formulation expressing the van der Waals (vdW) corrections as pairwise potentials whose strength is derived from the rescaled polarizabilities of the neutral free atoms, the self-consistently screened (TS + SCS) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012) ] variant of the method involving electrodynamic response effects has been examined. Analytical expressions for the forces acting on the atoms and for the components of the stress tensor needed for the relaxation of the volume and shape of the unit cell using the TS + SCS method are derived. While the calculated structures are reasonably close to experiment, the van der Waals corrections to the binding energies are often found to be overestimated in comparison with experimental data. The TS + SCS approach leads to significantly better results in some problematic cases, such as the binding energy of graphite. However, there is room for further improvements, in particular for strongly ionic systems...|$|R
