According to Sull's research, firms, in the growing up phase, will gradually develop core ability to create the value of enterprises. The succeed model, which called “successful formulate” by (Sull, 2003), resulted in top management follow the past successful experience when they met the change of environment The tendency of behavior to follow past successful experience is called “Active inertia”. From physics viewpoint, active inertia has dual, both positive and negative, effects to firms. For example, an endless innovate business culture, a flexible supply chain, a effective production process belong to positive inertia; a autocratic top management, a resistance of organization change, a heavy construction of capital assets, belong to negative inertia in the highly changeable environment of global competition. How does firm pursue sustainable growth? This research aseerts that before the forming of organization structure and the input of resource top manager must find out the influence of active inertia for future. The forming process of organization structure, organization behavior can be controlled by flow process and interior regulation. But the transformation of organization in future will be limited at the same time. This study, expects through the study of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lamp</b> manufacturer development process find out the correlation between transformation of organization and positive/negative inertia, to arouse top manager can pay much attention to the character of human being and nature.

50|$|Founded in 1949 in {{the city}} of Stara Zagora, this plant {{produces}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>lamps,</b> ship projectors and many more. It also produces a variety of street lams, the most popular models of which are 36.9.900.094, 36.2.900.101 and 36.2.900.103. An interesting fact is that these lamp models survived for two decades before being replaced with newer, but (as reported by independent specialists in the field of lighting) inferior street lamps, produced by Hit Lighting - Bulgaria. Svetlina's lanterns are bigger and heavier than the Hit Lighting ones. However, they also have bigger refractors, thus spreading light more efficiently. In addition they have an original design, whether the lanterns of Hit Lighting look very similar to the current lanterns of other manufacturers, e.g. General Electric and Technosvet. Svetlina luminaries stayed almost the same in the outside (because their design is considered both standard and aesthetic, while in the same time not being obsolete), but constantly changed in the inside. They were also exported to many countries, particularly to USSR, Russia and Germany. Highly neglected from 2001 to 2006, these lanterns are currently regaining their popularity from the past. As of Early 2008, there aren't any sources available on whether or not these lamp models are still produced.|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high data rate}} is ever increasing. OFDM-based {{wideband}} systems such as LTE and WiMAX are being employed as they can provide such high data rates. The performances of these systems not only depend on SNR but also on wideband arameters such as delay spread and angular spread. Obstacles (buildings, trees, <b>vehicles,</b> <b>lamp</b> posts, etc.) in radio propagation environment can cause reflection, diffaction and scattering ofthe radio signal. This results in attenuation, dispersion in time and spreading in angle of the radio signal at the receiver. The resulting delay spread and angular spread affect the performance of OFDM and MIMO technologies respectively, which are adopted for future mobile network systems (LTE and WiMAX). To evaluate the performance of wideband OFDM-MIMO systems, it is therefore important that these wideband parameters be accurately predicted. Propagation modeling based on ray-tracing {{can be used to}} predict these wideband parameters. To this end, the prediction accuracies that these models can provide in different scenarios have to be evaluated. In this thesis, the prediction accuracy of received power, delay spread and angular spread that was achieved by using 3 D ray-tracing prediction model has been evaluated by comparing predictions with wideband field measurements. The prediction results showed reasonable agreement with the measurements. The effects of parameter settings of ray-based propagation model on the predictions were also studied and the results are presented in this thesis.

40|$|Statistics {{show that}} a disproportionate amount of road {{fatalities}} occur at night-time despite the greatly reduced volume of traffic on roads. This thesis describes a system aimed at addressing this issue by automatically detecting the two main categories of road users: other road vehicles and pedestrians. A vehicle detection system using a visible spectrum camera and a pedestrian detection system using an infrared camera are presented, followed by a fusion of these systems. An image processing system to detect and track <b>vehicles</b> using their <b>lamps</b> is presented. As the appearance of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lamps</b> in video can vary depending on camera hardware, a camera configuration process is implemented. To identify red tail- and brake-lamps, parameters for a red colour threshold are derived from automotive regulations. Higher intensity headlamps are identified by utilising a seeded region growing technique. To obtain vehicle location data from identified lamps, they are paired using bilateral symmetry analysis. This is assessed by means of image cross-correlation, a shape and size independent approach to symmetry analysis. However, images of vehicle headlamps and tail-lamps suffer from perspective distortion during road manoeuvres, such as turning, engaging road bends and overtaking. A projective image transformation corrects for this perspective distortion, ensuring consistent detection performance through these road manoeuvres. A night-time pedestrian detection system, based on the processing of Far-Infrared video, is presented. A pre-processing step is introduced, which compensates for distortion caused by clothing, using vertically-biased morphological closing. Regions Of Interest (ROIs) are identified using a region growing technique with high intensity seeds and feature-based stopping criteria. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are calculated from a database of images to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, advantages are attained by implementing a cooperative fusion of the visual vehicle detection and IR pedestrian detection systems. Vehicle location extracted from the visual system is used to mask the IR frame, removing warm vehicle parts such as lamps, tyres and exhaust pipes. This reduces the probability of false positives in pedestrian detection. Pedestrians detected in IR video are highlighted in the visual image, making pedestrians much more visible for human video consumers.

Fundamental matrix estimation is difficult since it is often based correspondences that are spoilt by noise and outliers. Outliers must be thrown out via robust statistics, and noise gives uncertainty. In this article we provide a closed-form formula for the uncertainty of the so-called 8 point algorithm, which is a basic tool for fundamental matrix estimation via robust methods. As an application, we modify a well established robust algorithm accordingly, leading to a new criterion to recover point correspondences under epipolar constraint, balanced by the uncertainty of the estimation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a prototype of}} a digital video image analysis system that measures the relative luminance of highway signs using nighttime video images taken by a camera mounted in a moving vehicle. The concept is that by using an inexpensive video camera and laptop computer mounted in a vehicle a measurement of the brightness and visibility of the sign can be made. The system uses real time image analysis of night images of signs acquired on a mobile platform moving at highway speeds, illuminated by normal <b>vehicle</b> head <b>lamps.</b> Using video images at night results in measurements that {{as closely as possible}} reflect what the human eye sees. This is an improvement over current practice for ensuring that the signs are performing at night as required. Current methods consist of either visual inspection, measurement of retroreflectivity with a hand-held retroreflectometer, or systematic periodic replacement of signs irregardless of whether they are deficient or not. None of these approaches are ideal. Visual inspection is too subjective, hand-held retroreflectometer measurements are tedious, time-consuming, and sometimes dangerous, and systematic replacement is not cost effective.

40|$|Summary There is {{some concern}} that <b>vehicle</b> {{direction}} indicator <b>lamps</b> with clear outer lenses {{make it difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. This study photo-metrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and colour contrast between the on and off states for direction indicator lamps that use either an amber lens or a dear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that colour contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens direction indicators is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with dear-lens signal lamps remains to be ascertained. ...|$|R

The main {{objective of}} this project is to design and develop a prototype model that can reduce energy consumption by using light intensity and proximity from the vehicles. Besides, it is to support government mission to encourage more people in saving energy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{an active}} headlight (AH) system, developed by Honda R&D and Stanley Electric. The AH system delivers a low-beam pattern using two lamps {{on each side}} of a <b>vehicle.</b> The inboard <b>lamps</b> are fixed and the outboard lamps can be turned horizontally. An onboard computer selects a horizontal angle for the rotatable lamps based on three factors: steering-wheel angle, vehicle speed, and position of the turn-signal switch. In the first of three experiments, pedestrian visibility was assessed on left and right curves. The subject was seated in a stationary vehicle {{at the start of a}} curve, and a dark-clad pedestrian moved either toward or away from the subject's vehicle. On the curves tested (with radii of approximately 90 m), the AH system, in comparison to a standard headlight system, provided extra visibility of 7. 5 m (additional 14 %) on the left curve and extra visibility of 1 m (additional 2 %) on the right curve. (The vehicle and its position on the roadway were configured for U. S. /European right-hand traffic.) In the second experiment, discomfort glare for the oncoming drivers was evaluated on the same curves as in the first experiment. The subject was seated in a stationary vehicle at the start of a curve, and rated discomfort glare experienced from an oncoming car (equipped with either the AH or a standard system) by using the deBoer discomfort-glare scale. The results indicate that on the left curve (from the perspective of the glare car) there wa...|$|R
