50|$|Dallas’s {{report of}} the case only states that the court decided that Samuel Price’s legacy was a <b>vested</b> <b>legacy,</b> and gave {{judgment}} in the favor or Samuel’s Administratrix. There is no {{report of the}} court’s legal analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{legal issue}} {{was whether the}} testator’s bequest {{constituted}} a <b>vested</b> <b>legacy</b> to Samuel, in which case his share was his (and his estate’s after his death); or whether Samuel’s legacy lapsed because Samuel died before Ruth died, and thus before the testators {{had the power to}} sell the house.|$|E
5000|$|Samuel’s Administratrix {{argued that}} the will {{directed}} that in any event, the house be sold when Ruth died or remarried, so that the bequest was of money, not real estate. (The rules for the inheritance of real estate were different from the rules for the inheritance of personal property or money). Since there was no contingency regarding {{the sale of the}} real estate, and both of the contingencies occurred which would <b>vest</b> Samuel’s <b>legacy</b> (he reached the age of 21, and [...] he married), his share was vested, and could not be denied him, even though he had died. Thus, Samuel’s share should be paid to his estate.|$|R
50|$|A clause or {{provision}} in a will which imposes on a beneficiary {{the duty of}} employing the proceeds of a bequest for certain specified purposes is termed a modus. The addition of a modus to a bequest {{does not make it}} conditional. Consequently, the <b>legacy</b> <b>vests</b> in the legatee on the testator’s death; no fideicommissum is created in favour of the persons intended to be benefited.|$|R
5000|$|Watkins, {{the trustee}} under Price’s will, argued {{that since the}} legacy arose out of real estate, and the real estate could not be sold until Ruth Price died, that Samuel’s {{interest}} could not vest until Ruth’s death. Since Samuel predeceased Ruth, he died without his <b>legacy</b> <b>vesting.</b> Samuel’s share, therefore, should {{go back into the}} original testator’s estate, to be divided among his heirs.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature of}} an {{interest}} which is vested but not enjoyable, {{as opposed to}} one which is both vested and enjoyable, is well illustrated by {{the case of a}} legacy by the testator of “a sum of money to my daughter, payable on her attaining the age of 25 years.” In such a case, the legacy is generally not conditional upon the daughter’s attaining the age of 25, but the enjoyment of it merely is postponed. It follows that, on the death of the testator if the daughter is alive, dies cedit occurs, and the <b>legacy</b> <b>vests</b> in her, but dies venit only occurs when she reaches the age of twenty-five. If the daughter dies before reaching twenty-five, her right to the legacy passes to her heirs.|$|R
