5000|$|The Greek {{historian}} Strabo {{believed that}} the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain. Herodotus also {{believed that the}} homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain. This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: [...] "In the Greek geographers, for instance, we read of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Arad, Bahrain, which boasted {{that they were the}} mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples." [...] The people of Tyre in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words [...] "Tylos" [...] and [...] "Tyre" [...] has been commented upon. However, there is little evidence of occupation at all in Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.Herodotus's account (written c. 440 BC) refers to the Phoenicians originating from Bahrain.

[...] There were probably more than 56 lost because several children under fare age were never accounted for. Bad as this was, things could have been much worse, as Clallam had embarked only 92 people (31 crew and 61 passengers) on her last voyage, although she was licensed to carry 250 passengers on ordinary <b>voyages</b> with <b>freight,</b> or 500 on excursions without freight.|$|R

As well as the 3,844 sheep, 6 bullocks and 77 sucking pigs the Mataura carried: hares, rabbits, fowls, ducks, barracudas, hapuka, pukeko, frost fish, cheeses, hams and a cask of penguin skins. The New Zealand Refrigerating Company made a tiny profit but the shipping company's costs of the <b>voyage</b> exceeded their <b>freight</b> charge. The shippers on their own account were pleased with results but the overfat sheep were unsaleable.|$|R

The {{balance is}} paid by our produce {{carried to the}} West Indies (and sold in our own islands, or to the French, Spaniards, Danes, and Dutch); by the same produce carried to other colonies in North America (as to New-England, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Carolina, and Georgia); by the same, carried to {{different}} parts of Europe (as Spain, Portugal, and Italy). In all which places we receive either money, bills of exchange, or commodities that suit for remittance to Britain; which, together with all the profits on the industry of our merchants and mariners, arising in those circuitous <b>voyages,</b> and the <b>freights</b> made by their ships, centre finally to Britain to discharge the balance, and pay for British manufactures continually used in the provinces, or sold to foreigners by our traders.|$|R

Steaming via Bermuda and Norfolk, she arrived at Boston on 24 May 1944. Following voyage repairs and alterations at the Boston Navy Yard, she sailed to Norfolk in early July 1944 and then made passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>voyages</b> to Bahia Praia and Horta, Azores, and to Casablanca, before returning to Norfolk on 16 August 1944. On 7 September 1944, Barnegat departed Norfolk and proceeded to Eastern Bay, in Maryland {{at the mouth of}} the Patuxent River, where she laid out a seaplane operating area, placing mooring buoys and seadrome lights to prepare for training operations with Patrol Wing 5 (VP-5). She worked with these aircraft over the next two weeks and returned to Norfolk on 23 September 1944.|$|R
