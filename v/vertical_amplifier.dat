25|$|In dual and multiple-trace oscilloscopes, an {{internal}} electronic switch selects the relatively low-level output of one channel's amplifiers and sends {{it to the}} following stages of the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier,</b> which is only a single channel, so to speak, from that point on.|$|E
25|$|In {{an analog}} oscilloscope, the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier</b> acquires {{the signal to}} be displayed. In better oscilloscopes, it delays them by a {{fraction}} of a microsecond, and provides a signal large enough to deflect the CRT's beam. That deflection is at least somewhat beyond the edges of the graticule, and more typically some distance off-screen. The amplifier has to have low distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to recover quickly from overloads. As well, its time-domain response has to represent transients accurately—minimal overshoot, rounding, and tilt of a flat pulse top.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} and simplest type of oscilloscope {{consisted of}} a cathode ray tube, a <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier,</b> a timebase, a horizontal amplifier and a power supply.

25|$|For work at high {{frequencies}} and with fast digital signals, the bandwidth of the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and sampling rate must be high enough.

50|$|Most {{multichannel}} oscilloscopes do {{not have}} multiple electron beams. Instead, they display only one trace at a time, but switch the later stages of the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier</b> between one channel and the other either on alternate sweeps (ALT mode) or many times per sweep (CHOP mode). Very few true dual-beam oscilloscopes were built.|$|E
2500|$|The {{time taken}} for the output to settle {{to within a}} certain {{percentage}} of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the settling time, and is usually specified for oscilloscope <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and high-accuracy measurement systems. Ringing refers to an output variation that cycles above and below an amplifier's final value and leads to a delay in reaching a stable output. [...] Ringing is the result of overshoot caused by an underdamped circuit.|$|R
25|$|In analog instruments, the {{bandwidth}} of the oscilloscope {{is limited}} by the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and the CRT or other display subsystem. In digital instruments, the sampling rate of the analog to digital converter (ADC) is a factor, but the stated analog bandwidth (and therefore the overall bandwidth of the instrument) is usually less than the ADC's Nyquist frequency. This is due to limitations in the analog signal amplifier, deliberate design of the Anti-aliasing filter that precedes the ADC, or both.|$|R
50|$|For work at high {{frequencies}} and with fast digital signals, the bandwidth of the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and sampling rate must be high enough. For general-purpose use, a bandwidth {{of at least}} 100 MHz is usually satisfactory. A much lower bandwidth is sufficient for audio-frequency applications only.A useful sweep range is from one second to 100 nanoseconds, with appropriate triggering and (for analog instruments) sweep delay. A well-designed, stable trigger circuit is required for a steady display. The chief benefit of a quality oscilloscope {{is the quality of}} the trigger circuit.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{is driven}} by an {{external}} voltage (the vertical input) that is taken from the circuit or experiment that is being measured. The amplifier has a very high input impedance, typically one megohm, so that it draws only a tiny current from the signal source. Attenuator probes reduce the current drawn even more. The amplifier drives the vertical deflection plates with a voltage that {{is proportional to the}} vertical input. Because the electrons have already been accelerated by typically 2kV (roughly), this amplifier also has to deliver almost a hundred volts, and this with a very wide bandwidth. The gain of the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier</b> can be adjusted to suit the amplitude of the input voltage. A positive input voltage bends the electron beam upwards, and a negative voltage bends it downwards, so that the vertical deflection at any part of the trace shows the value of the input at that time.|$|E

50|$|In {{vacuum-tube}} oscilloscopes made by Tektronix, {{the vertical}} amplifier's delay line {{was a long}} frame, L-shaped for space reasons, that carried several dozen discrete inductors and a corresponding number of low-capacitance adjustable ("trimmer") cylindrical capacitors. These oscilloscopes had plug-in vertical input channels. For adjusting the delay line capacitors, a high-pressure gas-filled mercury-wetted reed switch created extremely fast-rise pulses which {{went directly to the}} later stages of the <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier.</b> With a fast sweep, any misadjustment created a dip or bump, and touching a capacitor made its local part of the waveform change. Adjusting the capacitor made its bump disappear. Eventually, a flat top resulted.|$|E
50|$|The {{power supply}} is an {{important}} component of the oscilloscope. It provides low voltages to power the cathode heater in the tube (isolated for high voltage!), and the <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>amplifiers</b> as well as the trigger and sweep circuits. Higher voltages are needed to drive the electrostatic deflection plates, which means that the output stage of the <b>vertical</b> deflection <b>amplifier</b> has to develop large signal swings. These voltages must be very stable, and amplifier gain must be correspondingly stable. Any significant variations will cause errors in the size of the trace, making the oscilloscope inaccurate.|$|R
40|$|The {{compatibility}} of GaInNAs/GaAs active {{regions with}} AlGaAs Bragg mirror technology {{opens up a}} range of surface-normal device formats for the spectral region around 1. 3 μm. The authors report recent progress {{on the development of}} diode-pumped vertical external-cavity surface emitting lasers (VECSELs) and vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifiers (VCSOAs) based on this technology. Pertinent performance characteristics are reported for GaInNAs 1. 3 -μm VECSELs capillary-bonded to diamond heatspreader platelets. In a conventional three-mirror air-spaced laser cavity up to 0. 6 W of TEM 00 output power was obtained. With the outer surface of the diamond platelet coated to form a dielectric output coupler mirror, it was possible to obtain the first monolithic microchip operation of a GaInNAs VECSEL, where a Gaussian beam with output power up to 120 mW was obtained. The influence of temperature on the performance of a six-quantum-well VCSOA with on-chip gain values of up to 16 dB was also reported. It reveals that on-chip gain of 9 dB can be achieved over a range of 85 °C, allowing the amplifier characteristics to be tuned over more than 9. 5 nm. Further investigations of the influence of optical feedback on the performance of these <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifiers</b> demonstrate that a three-mirror analysis explains the observed phenomena...|$|R
40|$|A <b>vertical</b> {{transmission}} optical <b>amplifier</b> with {{a multiple}} active layer structure has been fabricated {{and the single}} pass gain has been measured for the first time. 1. INTRODUCTION Optical interconnects {{have the potential to}} present a high speed, large capacity bus system for a massively parallel processing computer. Making the most of the speed of light, optical signal data should be conveyed in the form of light from one board to another. Such a high-speed parallel optical bus system requires optical amplifiers to compensate for tapped powers. Our research target is to realize a <b>vertical</b> transmission optical <b>amplifier</b> 1, 2), which has been little studied, for the parallel optical bus. 2. DEVICE STRUCTURE A prototype device has a multiple active layer structure 1) that is proposed to extend the active layer thickness, which leads to an enhancement of the internal gain.

50|$|Between the {{electron}} gun {{and the screen}} are two opposed pairs of metal plates called the deflection plates. The <b>vertical</b> <b>amplifier</b> generates a potential difference across one pair of plates, giving rise to a vertical electric field through which {{the electron}} beam passes. When the plate potentials are the same, the beam is not deflected. When the top plate is positive {{with respect to the}} bottom plate, the beam is deflected upwards; when the field is reversed, the beam is deflected downwards. The horizontal amplifier does a similar job with the other pair of deflection plates, causing the beam to move left or right. This deflection system is called electrostatic deflection, and is different from the electromagnetic deflection system used in television tubes. In comparison to magnetic deflection, electrostatic deflection can more readily follow random and fast changes in potential, but is limited to small deflection angles.|$|E

40|$|The {{physical}} {{mechanism of}} Cerenkov radiation in air {{caused by the}} periodic electron bunches is presented here in a simplified and exact mathematical forms, as well, as some applications and evidence. The experiment {{is an effort to}} verify the theoretical prediction of the power increase and fall off with discrete harmonic frequency in the microwave region. The radiation diagrams and absolute power measurements in the far field for the first four harmonics are provided by the improvements such as: frequency selection by the YIG filter, power amplification by the TWT amplifiers, high sensitivity of the signal detection by the oscilloscope <b>vertical</b> differential <b>amplifier</b> along with the noise reduction and radiation shielding. Suggested experimental method may be expanded to the higher harmonics with appropriate equipment. The experimental data reveal the unexpected spikes in the radiation diagrams. The absolute power results are reasonably cose to the theoretical ones. The experimental method satifies this Cerenkov experiment and may be improved. Further research may provide usable information for the electron beam monitoring or Cerenkov source at higher micorwave frequencies, for which a certain interest exists[URL] Navy author...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{theoretical}} analysis of GalnNAs alloys for use in optoelectronic devices. We develop reliable theoretical models that describe the properties of GaInNAs alloys and apply these to establish design rules. We develop a k centre dot p model for the band structure of GaInNAs-based Quantum Wells (QW) that accounts for valence band mixing effects, strain effects and the N induced coupling of the conduction band states of GaInNAs alloys. We implement the model to study the effect of N on the conduction and valence bands. The optical properties of GaInNAs structures are studied and design rules that ensure optimal performance are derived for 1. 3 mu m emission. It is established that high N content decreases the differential gain and the Momentum Matrix Element (MME) for TE polarisation while it increases the transparency concentration and the MME for TM polarisation. The material gain and linewidth enhancement factor are found to have comparable values to InGaAsP structures. The effect of alternative barriers, namely GaNAs and GalnAs, is analysed and design maps are discussed. GaInNAs/GaNAs structures are predicted to provide better material gain characteristics than GaInNAs/GaAs, whereas we suggest the use of GalnAs barriers as a route for the equalisation of TE and TM of GalnNAs-based devices. We suggest and study the application of GaInNAs/GaAs QWs in Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA). It is concluded that N content deteriorates the SOA performance while polarisation insensitivity is not possible unless the GalnAs barrier is used. We investigate gain and nonlinear characteristics of GaInNAs-based <b>Vertical</b> Cavity Optical <b>Amplifiers</b> (VCSOA) and <b>Vertical</b> Cavity Amplifying Modulators (VCAM). The performance of GaInNAs-based VCSOAs is predicted to be comparable with InGaAsP-based VCSOAs. GaInNAs VCAMs exhibit good values of Extinction Ratio (ER) and we propose a scheme for the maximisation of ER when the VCAM is operated in the reflection m...|$|R
