500|$|Burhop and Bohm later {{studied the}} {{characteristics}} of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion. Their papers on the properties of plasmas under magnetic containment would find utilization in the post-war world in research into controlled nuclear fusion. Other technical problems were more mundane but no less important. Although the beams had low intensity, they could, over many hours of operation, still melt the collectors. A water cooling system was therefore added to the collectors and the tank liner. Procedures were developed for cleaning the [...] "gunk" [...] that condensed inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank.</b> A particular problem was blockage of the slits by [...] "crud", which caused the ion beams to lose focus, or stop entirely.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem was}} that the beams {{interfered}} with each other, producing a series of oscillations called hash. An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference, resulting in reasonably good beams being produced, in September 1942. Robert Oppenheimer and Stan Frankel invented the magnetic shim, a device used to adjust the homogeneity of a magnetic field. These were sheets of iron about [...] in width that were bolted to {{the top and bottom of}} the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank.</b> The effect of the shims was to slightly increase the magnetic field in such a way as to help focus the ion beam. Work would continue on the shims through 1943. The main calutron patents were Methods of and apparatus for separating materials (Lawrence), Magnetic shims (Oppenheimer and Frankel), and Calutron system (Lawrence).|$|E

Test for this by pressing down on the small pin projecting {{from the front of}} the bowl until the carburetor floods.

2500|$|... ω {{is fixed}} by the pendulum's period, and M {{is limited by}} the load {{capacity}} and rigidity of the suspension. So the Q of clock pendulums is increased by minimizing frictional losses (Γ). Precision pendulums are suspended on low friction pivots consisting of triangular shaped 'knife' edges resting on agate plates. Around 99% of the energy loss in a freeswinging pendulum is due to air friction, so mounting a pendulum in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> can increase the Q, and thus the accuracy, by a factor of 100.|$|E
2500|$|The Q of pendulums {{ranges from}} several {{thousand}} in an ordinary clock {{to several hundred}} thousand for precision regulator pendulums swinging in vacuum. [...] A quality home pendulum clock might have a Q of 10,000 and an accuracy of 10 seconds per month. The most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock was the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock, invented in 1921. [...] Its Invar master pendulum swinging in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> had a Q of 110,000 and an error rate of around a second per year.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems on the vehicle. Vacuum-assist brake servos, for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost foolproof. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tanks</b> were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.|$|R
50|$|The British Rail Class 109 is a {{class of}} 2-car diesel {{multiple}} units built in 1957 by D Wickham & Co. Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design. The design, first used in 1936 for South American railways, aimed to minimise weight. It had no underframe, but the whole body was formed into a welded stress-bearing box girder made of 1/8 in solid drawn steel tube. Aluminium was used for panels, luggage racks, window frames, vacuum pipes and fuel and <b>vacuum</b> <b>tanks.</b> The corrugated steel floor was filled with sprayed asbestos and covered with asbestos-filled flame-proofed hardboard and rubber sheet.|$|R

2500|$|Von Sterneck and Mendenhall gravimeters: In 1887 Austro-Hungarian {{scientist}} Robert von Sterneck {{developed a}} small gravimeter pendulum mounted in a temperature-controlled <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> {{to eliminate the}} effects of temperature and air pressure. It used a [...] "half-second pendulum," [...] having a period close to one second, about 25cm long. [...] The pendulum was nonreversible, so the instrument was used for relative gravity measurements, but their small size made them small and portable. The period of the pendulum was picked off by reflecting {{the image of an}} electric spark created by a precision chronometer off a mirror mounted {{at the top of the}} pendulum rod. The Von Sterneck instrument, and a similar instrument developed by Thomas C. Mendenhall of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1890, were used extensively for surveys into the 1920s.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{components}} that comprised START included the support structure, pulse transformer, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank,</b> toroidal and poloidal field coils, and a limiter. The support structure positioned {{and supported the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> which also shared the same spherical center as the large pulse transformer. The main role of the pulse transformer was to provide the current for the toroidal field coils which was supplied through fifteen irons cores that were spirally wound from a [...]03 millimeter iron strip. The toroidal field coil was a central conductor made of copper on the axis of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank,</b> and {{was attached to the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> through copper limbs covered by insulated clamps. START had six poloidal field coils within the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> and were encased in 3 millimeter stainless steel cases. The poloidal coils were supported {{from the base of the}} tank and each could be adjusted as necessary. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>tank</b> was the primary vessel where experiments take place; it was cylindrical in shape and was divided into three sections. The tank offered numerous ports for the attachment of pumps and diagnostics. A graphite limiter was positioned around the central stainless steel tube and this provided a simple way to measure the innermost edge of the plasma during experiments.|$|E

These storage facilities consist of individual flywheels in a modular design. Energy up to 150 kW can be absorbed or released per flywheel. Through combinations of several such flywheel accumulators, which are individually housed in buried underground <b>vacuum</b> <b>tanks,</b> a total power of up to several 10 MW can be achieved.

5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or <b>vacuum</b> <b>tanks.</b> The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|R

The identification of damaged collimator jaws by observation of beam measurements is challenging: online loss measurements {{at the moment of}} the impacts can be tricky and degradation of the overall performance from single collimator damage can be difficult to measure. Visual inspections are excluded because collimator jaws are enclosed in <b>vacuum</b> <b>tanks</b> without windows. However, the sound generated during the beam impact can be used to give an estimate of the damage level.
