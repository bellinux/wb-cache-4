25|$|<b>Vital</b> <b>statistics</b> are {{depleted}} {{by performing}} some actions. Health, (determined by strength and vitality), determines the hit {{points of the}} character, which decreases when the player is attacked or harms himself. Stamina, (based on agility and vitality), limits the number of actions (exercise, fighting, running, etc.) the character is able to perform before needing rest or risking injury. Mana is only required by characters with skill in magic, and is calculated according to the character's intelligence and magic attributes.|$|E
25|$|Sine Mora {{does not}} use a {{traditional}} player health mechanic. It instead plays on the aspect of time. Each level is given a set amount of time which continues to tick downwards. Taking damage will temporarily speed up this process, while eliminating enemies will add time back. Powerups in the game can provide bonuses such as shielding, extra time, and upgraded weapon. Players can choose from multiple characters and planes, and the combination of choices determines the <b>vital</b> <b>statistics</b> during play. Characters are not tied to a specific plane, rather characters and planes each have unique attributes, the combination of which determines the statistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} famine deaths during Great Leap Forward has been {{estimated}} by different methods. Banister, Coale, and Ashton et al. compare age cohorts from the 1953, 1964, and 1982 censuses, yearly birth and death records, and results of the 1982 1:1000 fertility survey. From these they calculate excess deaths above a death rate interpolated between pre- and post-Leap death rates. All involve corrections for perceived errors inherent in the different data sets. Peng uses reported deaths from the <b>vital</b> <b>statistics</b> of 14 provinces, adjusts 10 percent for under reporting, and expands the result to cover all of China assuming similar mortality rates in the other provinces. He uses 1956/57 death rates as the baseline death rate rather than an interpolation between pre- and post-GLF death rates.|$|E

40|$|Thesis(M. P. H.) [...] University of Washington, 1991 <b>Vital</b> event <b>statistics</b> such as infant {{births and}} infant {{mortality}} rates {{are used by}} health professionals {{for a wide variety}} of purposes. Infant births and mortality rates are used for program planning and evaluation at the local, state, and federal levels. For example, the infant mortality rate is regarded as a summary measure of infant health, and in its broadest use, a measure of the quality of Jtfe in a society. Comparing infant mortality rates between groups can help describe how factors present before, during, and after pregnancy affect the developing fetus and newborn. Studying trends through time allows further advancement in knowledge about how best to prevent morbidity and mortality, and how to promote a healthy society. Implicit in the use of <b>vital</b> event <b>statistics</b> is the assumption that the information is collected and analyzed correctly. Without accurate data, credible conclusions are not possible. Information on births is subject to limitations, but to a lesser extent than mortality information, since birth records include information on not only the child, but also the mother and father. Infant death records provide information only on the infant. An important problem in interpreting vital event information results from the apparent lack of information put into the records to verify characteristics such as race...|$|R

25|$|She married Ezekiel Lysander Bascom on February 26, 1806. He was a Congregational {{minister}} in Phillipston, {{who was married}} twice before. His second wife died in July, 1805. Bascom did not give birth to any children during the marriage, but she was an attentive and caring stepmother to Ezekiel's daughter, Priscilla Elvira Bascom Philbrick (b. 1803), from a previous marriage. After Ezekiel's sister, Eunice Loveland, committed suicide in 1810, the Bascom's raised her youngest child, a five- or seven-year-old boy named Lysander Bascom Loveland. As a minister's wife, Bascom was busy socializing, recording church events, and visiting the sick. In addition to her household duties, she was active in temperance societies and at the library. In 1816 Bascom began recording the town's <b>vital</b> <b>statistics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Changing {{religion}} on one's card {{is extremely}} difficult, {{especially for those}} who are converting from Islam. The Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need, claims that conversion to Christianity remains prohibited in practise even though Article 46 of the Constitution says that the state guarantees freedom of belief and religion. Therefore, according to the <b>Vital</b> <b>Statistics</b> Office, a Muslim who is baptised a Christian is still a Muslim. This means that a former Muslim cannot change his or her identity papers to show a new religion or name. The charity claims that the lack of a law on conversion from Islam to another religion leaves the matter in the hands of judges who must choose between Sharia and the principle of equality of all citizens before the law.|$|E

The plantation owner said the negro man, seemingly about 26 years old, came from Tunica {{two or three weeks}} before he died to play banjo at a negro dance given there on the plantation. He stayed in the house with some of the negroes saying he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this negro as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said it was his opinion that the man died of syphilis.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{the birth}} rate {{increased}} again. Russia recorded 1,896,263 births, {{the highest number}} since 1990, and even exceeding annual births during the period 1967–1969, with a TFR of 1.691, the highest since 1991. (Source: <b>Vital</b> <b>statistics</b> table below). In fact, Russia, despite having only slightly more people than Japan, has recently had nearly twice as many births as that country. The number of births was expected to fall {{over the next few}} years as women born during the baby bust in the 1990s enter their prime childbearing years, but this didn't occur thanks to the continued growth of the TFR. The figures for 2013-2015 again showed around 1.9 million births, about the same as in 2012, but because the number of women of childbearing age is dropping, especially for those in their early 20s, the TFR actually rose to 1.777, which places Russia at first 9 or 10 countries out of 50 developed nations, and at 6th place in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The riot {{was covered}} by {{national}} newspapers and the reported number of deaths varies widely.

The next day, the same paper reported the count as 9 whites and 21 blacks. The New York Times said that 77 people had been killed, including 68 blacks, but it later lowered the total to 33. The Richmond Times Dispatch of Virginia reported that 85 people (including 25 whites) were killed; it also reported that the Police Chief had reported to Governor Robertson that the total was 75; and that a Police Major put the figure at 175. The Oklahoma Department of <b>Vital</b> <b>Statistics</b> count put the number of deaths at 36 (26 black and 10 white). Estimates in contemporary Red Cross documents ran as high as 300.|$|E
