40|$|This study {{explores the}} extent and quality of {{localised}} mining water-related disclosures from the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). The data set provides an atypical opportunity to study voluntary and mandatory environmental reporting, as mining companies often produce their own <b>voluntary</b> sustainability <b>reports,</b> yet some mandatory reporting is also required due to NSW development consent conditions. In order to assess the extensiveness of mandatory reporting, development consent reporting requirements are compared to a selection of <b>voluntary</b> water <b>reporting</b> indicators. Most indicators {{were taken from the}} Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Water Accounting Framework for the Minerals Industry (WAFMI), but the authors also included additional indicators derived from community waterrelated discussions. It is found that most of the information required by the indicators is also required by the consent conditions. In particular, information relevant to four GRI indicators is reported within either annual reviews or environmental management plans. Consent conditions are discretionary, however, and older consent conditions may not require such reports to be made publicly available through the internet. Additionally, a content analysis is conducted of available mandatory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>reports</b> from four mining operations. The <b>voluntary</b> <b>reports</b> were found to provide site-level information that was either as good as that found within the annual reviews, or of lesser quality, but in no instance better. Further, no <b>voluntary</b> <b>report</b> stated definitively whether operations impacted on water sources. Nor was there any reporting on water storage capacity or the quality of water after recycling or reuse. Finally, Dryzek's 'discursive democracy' theoretical framework on the quality of a deliberation system is used to analyse the extent to which NSW legal and administrative processes are designed to facilitate deliberation by catchment residents. Theoretically, the system is well designed, as important information is made publicly available and community consultation is a mandatory part of the process. However, the system is not without flaws and could be improved by providing better access to information. 13 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} the former <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system to {{generate}} market transparency in U. S. livestock markets was called into question by producer groups and academic research prior to the new federal system of mandatory price reporting being implemented. The market transparency issue is investigated by comparing price data collected from the former AM S <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system to mandatory price reporting data for live slaughter steers collected by the State of South Dakota {{before the advent of}} the new federal system. The relationship between a set of public price report series and the South Dakota mandatory price series is analyzed using cointegration techniques. The empirical findings indicate a strong long-run and short-run integrated relationship between the mandatory price series and a majority of the selected public price reports. We conclude that in the cash market for live steers in South Dakota, the former <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system did foster market transparency and aided in the price discovery process. 1 Wachenhiem and DeVuyst (2001) discuss the issue of price transparency in livestock markets.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reflect on the {{adoption}} of mixed methods in <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> research. Design/methodology/approach – The costs and benefits of mixed methods are outlined, and the use of mixed methods in prior <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> research is discussed. A reflection of the author's experience and the practical issues of adopting a QUAN?qual sequential mixed methods research design to examine <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> practices and processes are presented. Findings – Adopting mixed methods research involves costs to the researcher and the research, including the extra time and energy needed to collect, analyse, interpret, integrate and write up the data, and the need to consider potential biases and trade-offs affecting design choices. However, these costs are outweighed by the opportunity mixed methods research presents to develop greater research skills and provide a fuller and richer picture of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting.</b> Research limitations/implications – The specific costs and benefits of adopting mixed methods research discussed in this paper are primarily limited to research designs involving content analysis and interviews due to the use of these research methods in the focal study and in most prior mixed methods research examining <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting.</b> Originality/value – This paper is one of few to reflect on the adoption of mixed methods research to examine <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting.</b> It highlights to other researchers the research design considerations that should be made, the costs involved (both to the research and the researcher), and the improved contribution to knowledge achievable when adopting mixed methods research over alternative approaches.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the former federal <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system to {{facilitate}} market efficiency in the cash markets for U. S. livestock was questioned by producer groups and academic researchers prior to implementation of federal mandatory price reporting regulations. In the cash market for slaughter cattle, concerns raised in the literature centered {{on the effect of}} thinning cash markets and strategic price reporting behavior on the robustness of <b>voluntary</b> cash price <b>reports</b> issued by the USDA-Agricultural Marketing Services. A theoretical framework is developed describing the interregional spatial linkages between cash markets and price reporting regimes (mandatory versus voluntary). Data from South Dakota and Nebraska cash markets for live cattle are used to test if the conditions necessary for interregional price transparency did exist prior to implementation of federal price reporting regulations. A set of testable hypotheses, based on the theoretical framework, is developed to test if the concerns raised in the literature about the <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system can be empiracally verified. The empirical results do not support the literature's proposition that the <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system for live cattle failed to provide timely and accurate market price information to the cash market prior to the implementation of the federal mandatory price reporting system in South Dakota and Nebraska. Furthermore, empirical evidence does not support the suppostion that a thinning cash market or strategic price reporting had a significant negative effect on the AMS <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system's accuracy or timely transmission of price information. Therefore, we conclude that the AMS <b>voluntary</b> price <b>reporting</b> system provided price transparency for South Dakota and Nebraska producers selling in the cash market and contributed to the price discovery process. grid pricing, price discovery, price reporting, slaughter cattle...|$|R

METHODS: The authors analyzed mandatory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>reports</b> from the adverse events reporting system for medical devices at the FDA. RESULTS: In 1988, adverse event reports related to SGBIs accounted for 2. 4 % of the 14, 473 mandatory reports entered into the FDA database on medical devices. In 1992, SGBI-related reports accounted for 30. 3 % of the total 66, 476 mandatory reports of adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse event in 1988, before the widespread publicity on breast implants, was implant burst or rupture. In contrast, in 1992 the most frequently reported event was reaction, a term used to describe a range of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: The numbers of mandatory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>reports</b> of SGBI-related adverse events increased exponentially, as did {{the complexity of the}} reports, following publicity over the lack of safety data on breast implants and a short voluntary moratorium on their sale.

40|$|Society is {{increasingly}} calling for organisations to demonstrate {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR). To fulfil this demand, organisations need to be accountable, democratic and transparent to their stakeholders. This can be achieved using a number of tools including communication about the environmental, social and economic impacts of an organisation’s actions and activities. Yet despite the importance of communicating environmental information, and society’s heightened environmental awareness, organisations are still demonstrating an insufficient commitment to environmental reporting, continuing their reluctance to be open and accountable about their environmental impacts. This suggests organisations currently have little understanding of why they should report, what they should report and/or how they should report. For environmental reporting progress to be achieved {{it is important that}} we have knowledge of how various factors influence <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> engagement. This research, in contributing to and extending the body of environmental reporting knowledge, aims to provide an understanding of the Why, What and How of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> by specifically examining: why organisations should, and why organisations do, voluntarily report environmental information; what environmental information organisations should, and what environmental information organisations do, voluntarily report; and how organisations should, and how organisations do, voluntarily report environmental information. In using a combination of research methodologies this research extends prior CSR reporting studies – closing the gap between <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> practice and theory, providing better insights into the underlying reasons and motivations for <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting,</b> and providing improved knowledge of the considerations made by companies as part of the <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> process. In doing so, this research presents a more recent examination of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> in the annual reports of New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies. Aspects of <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> that have not been extensively examined before, particularly in Australasia, are examined. These include a focus on content-quality (as opposed to reporting quantity), an investigation of the effect of public pressure (using a combination of three proxy measures), and, through the use of qualitative research, an expansion of the insights obtained from quantitative data. This research finds that New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies continue to have an insufficient and incorrect understanding of why they should report, what they should report and/or how they should voluntarily report environmental information. This deficient understanding results in <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> in their annual reports which is inadequate – the reporting lacks meaning and purpose (i. e. has form but little or no substance), and reflects managers’ incorrect perceptions about the environmental impact of their company’s actions and activities. As a result <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>reporting</b> in the annual reports of New Zealand and Australian publicly listed companies fails to “… give an understanding, which is not misleading, …” of the environmental consequences of an organisation’s actions and activities (adapted from Alexander & Jermakowicz, 2006, p. 132), providing little accountability to stakeholders, and serving neither external stakeholders nor those reporting well. As the demand for organisations to demonstrate accountability to stakeholders continues to increase over time it is important to develop informed environmental reporting guidance and undertake further examinations of the Why, What and How of environmental reporting...|$|R
