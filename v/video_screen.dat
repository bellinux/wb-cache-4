5|$|With the {{exception}} of two shows early in the tour, the song was played at every date of the Innocence + Experience Tour, typically opening the encore.

5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E
5|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, {{multiple}} photographs of We Are Our Mountains were displayed during {{the presentation of}} voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> at Yerevan's Republic Square in the background, and another was displayed {{on the back of}} a clipboard that the presenter Sirusho was reading results from. Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.|$|E
50|$|The arena's center-hung {{scoreboard}} {{was designed}} as a joint venture between Panasonic and White Way Sign. Originally it contained four LCD <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> (one on each side) plus enough room for two players' stats on each team; as pro basketball grew in popularity, the scoreboard was upgraded in 1991 so that stats for five players on each team could be shown; the original <b>video</b> <b>screens</b> were replaced a decade later with Panasonic Astrovision LED <b>video</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R

5|$|Throughout 1996, One Times Square's first {{electronic}} billboards were installed, such as, a Cup Noodles billboard with steam effects {{was added}} {{to the front of the}} tower, later accompanied by an animated Budweiser sign. In October, a new 55-foot <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> sponsored by ITT Corporation was introduced to the top of the tower, which would feature video advertisements and community service announcements. In December 1996, a new Panasonic display operated by NBC known as Astrovision was introduced as a replacement for Sony's Jumbotron at the base of the tower.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E

40|$|With {{technology}} evolving, {{organizations are}} constantly examining {{more efficient and}} accessible modes of screening job applicants. Executives want the hiring process to be seamless, unveiling, and efficient. Globalization adds {{to the complexity of}} this process as organizations have the need to connect with a broader external labor market in order to gain a competitive advantage in the market. However, it is unrealistic and costly to screen applicants in person. Even if all applicants were in close proximity, it would be too cumbersome and time-consuming for employers to interview each one. To alleviate such problems, employers are turning to more creative methods to screen applicants for positions. For many years organizations have been using the telephone as a screening method to narrow down the applicant pool. With advances in technology, many organizations are now using <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> rather than more traditional methods to <b>screen</b> applicants. <b>Video</b> <b>screening</b> reveals more about the applicants and how they interact. Additionally, <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> allows employers to be selective with their time by only reviewing the videos of those who are qualified. However, little research has been conducted explaining the effects of this technology on applicants and the external labor market. This research looked at the differences in applicant perception after telephone <b>screening</b> and <b>video</b> <b>screening.</b> The researchers used a survey method to determine the results of their study. Upon completion of a <b>video</b> and telephone <b>screening,</b> participants were asked to participate in the survey. The survey data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics to determine the existence of any significant difference in participants? perception between the telephone and <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> methods. The research supported that the participants believed that the telephone screening was easier than the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> and that the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> technology made them feel uncomfortable. It also showed that the participants believed that they would secure a follow-up interview with either method but most felt that this was more so when the telephone method was used. Lastly, the participants believed that they were better represented when using the telephone screening as opposed to the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> method. Overall, the research showed that the participants were pleased with process of the <b>video</b> <b>screening</b> but felt more confident with the traditional telephone screening...|$|R
5|$|U2's 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour was {{preceded by}} several complications. A sudden illness to the Edge's {{daughter}} nearly resulted in the tour's cancellation, before the group decided to adjust the tour schedule to accommodate her treatment. Additionally, ticket presales on the band's website were plagued with issues, as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited ticket availability, partially due to scalpers exploiting the system. Commencing in March 2005, the Vertigo Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs. The indoor stage replaced the heart-shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage, while the stadium stage used a massive LED <b>video</b> <b>screen.</b> Setlists on tour varied {{more than in the}} group's past and included songs they had not played in decades. Like its predecessor, the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success, ranking as the top-earning tour of 2005 with US$260million grossed.|$|E
5|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Yokozuna {{began at}} Survivor Series 1993. During an {{elimination}} match, Yokozuna {{was unable to}} injure The Undertaker, despite slamming The Undertaker's head into the ring steps and performing the Banzai drop on him. A match was booked for Royal Rumble 1994, in which The Undertaker would challenge WWF World Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna for the title in a Casket match. During the match, which featured a no-disqualification clause, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, hired nine other wrestlers to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf. Yokozuna won the match after opening The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, contained the secret to The Undertaker's powers. After the match, The Undertaker appeared on the <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> and vowed {{to return to the}} World Wrestling Federation one day. He was not seen for several months, although, in reality, he was taking time off wrestling to allow injuries to heal. The Undertaker returned at SummerSlam 1994, defeating an Undertaker look-alike. A rematch against Yokozuna was scheduled for Survivor Series. This was also to be a Casket match, but Chuck Norris was brought in as a special outside referee to prevent interference.|$|E
5|$|The steel {{structure}} was 51 metres (167 feet) tall (doubling {{the size of}} the stadium set for The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour, the previous record holder), was able to hold up to 200 tonnes underneath it, and required 120trucks to transport each of the three sets constructed to support the tour. Each leg of the structure contained its own sound system. The cost of each structure was between £15million and £20million ($23 million and $31 million, respectively). As a result, the tour was heavily insured. The size of the stage led to some problems with its construction in certain venues. The band paid $2million to raise the HD <b>video</b> <b>screen</b> in Cowboys Stadium for their concert in Arlington, and paid $3million to expand the Hippodrome de Montréal into a temporary stadium for their concert in Montreal. The 360° tour crew consisted of 137 touring production crew supplemented by over 120 hired locally. Daily costs of the production were approximately $750,000, not including the stage construction; the majority of this came from truck rentals, transportation, and staff wages. The tour was not expected to break even until the conclusion of the second leg.|$|E
