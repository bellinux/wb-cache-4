5|$|Black {{began dating}} actress Lisa Hartman in 1990. The couple kept their {{relationship}} <b>very</b> <b>quiet.</b> The first {{picture of the}} two of them together was not published until the week they were engaged. The couple married in Katy, Texas in October 1991.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{finished}} second in the 1971–72 season for the third successive time, this time ending up just one point behind champions Derby County after losing to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux {{on the final day of}} the season. However Charlton managed to complete his list of domestic honours as Leeds beat Arsenal 1–0 in the FA Cup final; he kept Charlie George to a <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> game as Leeds successfully defended their slender lead.|$|E
5|$|The contact call is a <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> {{thin and}} high-pitched sit, {{but the most}} {{distinctive}} call is a penetrating tsree, with a vibrato quality, sometimes repeated {{as a series of}} notes. The male's song begins with srrih, srrih followed in turn by a few twittering notes, a longer descending ripple, and a whistle that falls and then rises.|$|E
60|$|It was at Rockaway Beach that I {{saw these}} fellow-beings whose mere {{multitude}} {{was too much}} for me. They were otherwise wholly without offence towards me, and so far as I noted, towards each other; they were, in fact, the most entirely peaceable multitude I ever saw in any country, and the <b>very</b> <b>quietest.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} down together. Ten days later, all the {{families}} round came to pay visits of condolence; and to each Lisle said that, although he himself {{could not think of}} going out, at present, his friend Hallett, who had come to stay with him for a month, would be glad to join in any quiet festivity. So Hallett was frequently invited out, Lisle accompanying him only to the <b>very</b> <b>quietest</b> of dinners.|$|R

5|$|A German photographer, Astrid Kirchherr, {{asked if}} they wouldn't mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups only had snapshots taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in der Dom, a municipal park, close to the Reeperbahn. In the afternoon Kirchherr took them to her mother's house in Altona, minus Best, who decided not to attend. Dot Rhone, McCartney's girlfriend at the time who later visited Hamburg, described Best as being <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> and never taking part in conversations with the group.|$|E
5|$|Males {{initiate}} copulation by mounting {{the female}} and tilting her hear back 90 degrees. The male then secures his position by biting and pulling {{back on the}} hairs {{at the base of}} the female’s skull. The male then uses his thumbs to further stabilize his position and enters the female under her interfemoral membrane. Both individuals have been noted to be <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> during the copulation process. Once the process is over the male dismounts the female and flies away to find another mate.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> in normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5000|$|... "He's a <b>very</b> nice, <b>quiet,</b> low-key guy", said Parton of Higgins. [...] "I don't {{know what}} I {{would have done}} if I'd {{had one of those}} mean {{directors}} on my first film." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{glanced at}} him curiously. [...] "There was," [...] she said. [...] "I {{remember}} it lay shining before us between the woods. It was <b>very</b> beautiful, <b>quieter</b> and calmer than our lakes in Canada." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} Antoinism was <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> after 1940. In Belgium, Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the {{religion}} until their death, alongside {{the members of}} this body. The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claiming to be faithful to the true Antoinist tradition, opened a temple in Angleur on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple. In France, the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.|$|E
5|$|Tomoya meets {{a genius}} girl named Kotomi Ichinose, {{one day in}} the school library. She is ranked in the top 10 {{throughout}} the whole country in standardized exam results of every subject—she always goes to library to read extra materials, especially books in foreign languages. Kotomi is a <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> girl with poor social skills and it is quite difficult to communicate with her; Kotomi can even completely ignore someone when reading, even if they make loud disturbances around her. Clannad fourth heroine is a second-year student named Tomoyo Sakagami who transfers into Tomoya's school. Tomoyo can be aggressive is a very strong fighter, preferring to use kicking over punching, and is very athletic. Although Tomoya is older than her, Tomoyo does not show him respect as a senior student. Tomoyo appears in Key's fifth game, , as the main heroine.|$|E

60|$|It {{was better}} when they once got to New York, and were settled in an {{apartment}} of an old-fashioned down-town hotel. They thought themselves very cramped in it, and they were but little easier when {{they found that the}} apartments over and under them were apparently thought spacious for families of twice their numbers. It was the <b>very</b> <b>quietest</b> place in the whole city, but Kenton was used to the stillness of Tuskingum, where, since people no longer kept hens, the nights were stiller than in the country itself; and for a week he slept badly. Otherwise, as soon as they got used to living in six rooms instead of seventeen, they were really very comfortable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] said Mr. Dennant, moving {{after his}} second ball, which Shelton had smitten to the farther end, [...] "be offended, my dear Shelton, and {{by no means}} give him a hint; he {{interests}} me very much--a <b>very</b> clever, <b>quiet</b> young fellow." ...|$|R
25|$|In the 19th century Santiago de Cali, {{capital of}} the Valley of the Cauca River State, was a <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> {{community}} {{with no more than}} 20,000 inhabitants. The urban center of the city was in the neighborhoods of Empedrado or Altozano, which were surrounded by La Merced and San Antonio neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{proved to}} be low turnout with 35% of 117,000 eligible voters casting ballots in the election. Advanced turnout was <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> with just 148 votes being cast. Ernest Watkins won with 43% of the vote and held the seat for his party. The race {{turned out to be}} a primarily two way race, with the other 3 candidates finishing well back.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{conformal}} passive hydrophones are hard-mounted {{to each side}} of the hull, using the AN/BQR-24 internal processor. The system uses FLIT (frequency line integration tracking) which homes in on precise narrowband frequencies of sound and, using the Doppler principle, can accurately provide firing solutions against <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> submarines. The AN/BQQ-5’s hull array doubled the performance of its predecessors.|$|E

He's a <b>very</b> energetic, <b>quiet,</b> funny, serious, and greedy news anchor {{climbing}} the ladder at GNB. His favorite food is Crab Cakes. He never refers to Kipp by name, but merely as [...] "Secretary." ...|$|R

25|$|Hunters have meticulous turnout {{and tend}} toward <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, bridles, crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while {{caring for their}} horses and grooming them well, are not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range of}} equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout always is preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E
25|$|If any {{of these}} {{symptoms}} are observed, veterinary advice should be sought. The veterinarian will usually auscultate (listen to the horse's chest with a stethoscope) to attempt to detect adventitious lung sounds. If these are <b>very</b> <b>quiet,</b> a rebreathing bag may be used - a plastic bag over the nose to intensify the horse's respiratory effort and hence the sounds. This procedure can be dangerous {{and should not be}} attempted by non-professionals.|$|E
25|$|For an {{extended}} period of time—prewar through the early 1950s—the Pontiac was a quiet, solid car, but not especially powerful. It came with a flathead straight eight. Straight 8s were slightly less expensive to produce than the increasingly popular V8s, but they were also heavier and longer. Additionally, the long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, restricting straight 8s to a relatively low compression ratio with a modest redline. However, in this application, inexpensive (yet <b>very</b> <b>quiet)</b> flatheads were not a liability.|$|E

25|$|Tullibee was {{the result}} of Project Nobska, a study ordered in 1956 by Admiral Arleigh Burke, then Chief of Naval Operations, from the Committee on Undersea Warfare of the National Academy of Sciences. That report {{emphasized}} the need for deeper-diving, ultraquiet submarine designs using long-range sonar. Tullibee incorporated three design changes based on Project Nobska. First, it incorporated the first bow-mounted spherical sonar array. This required the second innovation: amidships, angled torpedo tubes. Thirdly, Tullibee was propelled by <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> turbo-electric transmission powered by a S2C reactor.|$|E
25|$|The BAe 146/Avro RJ is a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with a T-tail. It {{has four}} turbofan engines mounted on pylons underneath the wings, and has retractable tricycle landing gear. The aircraft has <b>very</b> <b>quiet</b> operation, {{and has been}} marketed under the name Whisperjet. It sees wide usage at small city-based airports such as London City Airport. In its primary role {{it serves as a}} regional jet, short-haul airliner or regional airliner. The BAe 146/Avro RJ is in wide use with several European-based airlines, such as Brussels Airlines, CityJet and Swiss Global Air Lines.|$|E
