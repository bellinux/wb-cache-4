5|$|Construction {{was mostly}} done by volunteers; the {{building}} of the stadium required 31,000 man-hours in <b>volunteer</b> <b>work</b> and cost NOK 150,000.

5|$|Fabian was {{the strongest}} {{hurricane}} to hit Bermuda since Hurricane Arlene in 1963. It was both the most damaging and the first hurricane to cause a death on the island since 1926. The hurricane's powerful winds resulted in moderate damage and destroyed roofs throughout the island. A strong storm surge associated with the hurricane killed four people crossing a causeway on Bermuda, temporarily closing the only link between two islands. The endangered Bermuda petrel, {{better known as the}} cahow, was threatened by the hurricane, which destroyed ten nests, although <b>volunteer</b> <b>work</b> transported the species to a safer location. Strong swells resulted in damage in northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and also caused four people to drown along the United States' Atlantic coast. In all, Fabian caused around US in damage and eight deaths.|$|E

5|$|The hill {{required}} {{a lot of}} <b>volunteer</b> <b>work</b> to maintain and run during the season and particularly for the tournament. It also lacked a ski lift. Combined, this made {{it increasingly difficult to}} recruit new ski jumpers during the 1960s, particularly after a lift was installed on Mount Revelstoke in 1961. Skiing activities moved to Mount Mackenzie during the 1960s and in 1973, the ski club also relocated to there. The Tournament of Champions during 1971 and 1972 incurred a heavy loss. The last major tournaments in Nels Nelson Hill were the Western Canadian Ski Jumping Tournament, the Canadian Junior and Senior Ski Jumping Championship and the International Cross Country Championship, held in February and March 1974. The last tournament was a junior event held in 1975. The venue has since fallen into disrepair.|$|E
