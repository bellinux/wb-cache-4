40|$|Abstract. Large, multidimensional {{datasets}} {{are difficult}} to visualize and analyze. Visualization interfaces are constrained in resolution and dimension, so cluttering and problems of projecting many dimensions into the available low dimensions are inherent. Methods of real-time interaction facilitate analysis, but often these are not available due to the computational complexity required to use them. By organizing the dataset into a level-of-detail (LOD) hierarchy, our proposed method solves problems of both inefficient interaction and <b>visual</b> <b>cluttering.</b> We do this by introducing an implementation of R-trees for large multidimensional datasets. We introduce several useful methods for interaction, by queries and refinement, to explain the relevance of interaction and show {{that it can be}} done efficiently with R-trees. We examine the applicability of hierarchical parallel coordinates to datasets organized within an R-tree, and build upon previous work in hierarchical star coordinates to introduce a novel method for visualizing bounding hyperboxes of internal R-tree nodes. Finally, we examine two datasets using our proposed method and present and discuss results. ...|$|R

Pragmatic actions here mean that the analyst is able to visually select and filter in-formation, determining visual configurations that reveal different perspectives; epistemic actions mean that the analyst can record, annotate, and recall intermediate visualizations created pragmati-cally. To do so, we use a tree-like organization to keep multiple vi-sualization workspaces linked according to the analytical decisions took by the user. Our goal is to promote an innovative systematiza-tion that can augment the potential for database visual inspection, and for visualization systems in general. It is our contention that Hierarchical Visual Filtering can inspire a novel scheme of visu-alization environments in which space limitations and complexity are treated by means of interactive tasks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Seeding {{streamlines}} in 3 D flow fields {{without considering}} their projections in screen space can produce visually cluttered rendering results. Streamlines will overlap or intersect {{with each other}} in the output image, which makes it difficult for the user to perceive the underlying flow structure. This paper presents a method to control the seeding and generation of streamlines in image space to avoid <b>visual</b> <b>cluttering</b> and allow a more flexible exploration of flow fields. In our algorithm, 2 D images with depth maps generated by a variety of visualization techniques can be used as input from which seeds are placed and streamlines are generated. The density and rendering styles of streamlines can be flexibly controlled based on various criteria to improve visual clarity. With our image space approach, it is straightforward to implement the level of detail rendering, depth peeling, and stylized rendering of streamlines to allow for more effective visualization of 3 D flow fields. Index Terms—Three-dimensional flow visualization, streamlines, streamline seeding, level of detail, depth peeling, stylized rendering. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Network data often contain {{important}} attributes {{from various}} dimensions {{such as social}} affiliations and areas of expertise in a social network. If such attributes exhibit a tree structure, visualizing a compound graph consisting of tree and network structures becomes complicated. How to visually reveal patterns of a network over a tree has not been fully studied. In this paper, we propose a compound graph model, TreeNet, to support visualization and analysis of a network at multiple levels of aggregation over a tree. We also present a visualization design, TreeNetViz, to offer the multiscale and cross-scale exploration and interaction of a TreeNet graph. TreeNetViz uses a Radial, Space-Filling (RSF) visualization to represent the tree structure, a circle layout with novel optimization to show aggregated networks derived from TreeNet, and an edge bundling technique to reduce visual complexity. Our circular layout algorithm reduces both total edge-crossings and edge length and also considers hierarchical structure constraints and edge weight in a TreeNet graph. These experiments illustrate that the algorithm can reduce <b>visual</b> <b>cluttering</b> in TreeNet graphs. Our case study also shows that TreeNetViz {{has the potential to}} support the analysis of a compound graph by revealing multiscale and cross-scale network patterns.

Our approach can show the motion of mass at multiple levels of detail, and it allows classifying the motion dynamics based on directional information. Interactive visualization of large particle sets is required to analyze the complicated structures and formation processes in astrophysical particle simulations. While some research has been done on the development of visualization techniques for steady particle fields, only very few approaches have been proposed to interactively visualize large time-varying fields and their dynamics. Particle trajectories are known to visualize dynamic processes over time, but due to occlusion and <b>visual</b> <b>cluttering</b> such techniques have only been reported for very small particle sets so far.

In combination with visualization techniques that adapt to the respective scales, clusters of particles with homogeneous motion as well as separation and merging regions can be identified effectively. The additional use of mapping functions to modulate the color and size of trajectories allows emphasizing various particle properties like direction, speed, or particle-specific attributes like temperature.

40|$|With the {{widespread}} availability of mobile graphics terminals andWebGL-enabled browsers, 3 D graphics over the Internet is thriving. Thanks to {{recent advances in}} 3 D acquisition and modeling systems, high-quality 3 D models are becoming increasingly common, and are now potentially available for ubiquitous exploration. In current 3 D repositories, such as Blend Swap, 3 D Café or Archive 3 D, 3 D models available for download are mostly presented through a few user-selected static images. Online exploration is limited to simple orbiting and/or low-fidelity explorations of simplified models, since photorealistic rendering quality of complex synthetic environments is still hardly achievable within the real-time constraints of interactive applications, especially on on low-powered mobile devices or script-based Internet browsers. Moreover, navigating inside 3 D environments, especially on the now pervasive touch devices, is a non-trivial task, and usability is consistently improved by employing assisted navigation controls. In addition, 3 D annotations are often used in order to integrate and enhance the visual information by providing spatially coherent contextual information, typically {{at the expense of}} introducing <b>visual</b> <b>cluttering.</b> In this thesis, we focus on efficient representations for interactive exploration and understanding of highly detailed 3 D meshes on common 3 D platforms. For this purpose, we present several approaches exploiting constraints on the data representation for improving the streaming and rendering performance, and camera movement constraints in order to provide scalable navigation methods for interactive exploration of complex 3 D environments. Furthermore, we study visualization and interaction techniques to improve the exploration and understanding of complex 3 D models by exploiting guided motion control techniques to aid the user in discovering contextual information while avoiding cluttering the visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approaches both in large screen museum installations and in mobile devices, by performing interactive exploration of models ranging from 9 Mtriangles to 940 Mtriangles. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Flow {{maps are}} used in order to {{indicate}} movements by persons or objects in a given time period. The major problem concerning the production of flow maps is the appropriate placement of movement lines in the map. This paper presents a method of placing lines automatically, based on a modification of an exisiting algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented as an ArcMap extension and was subsequently tested with a data set representing pupil school transitions. 1 BASIC PRINCIPLES Flow maps are of use in many applications: whenever movements by people or objects take place, they can be shown on a flow map. The data visualized in these maps exhibit a high complexity, due to {{the high number of}} transition edges present in such a map. Drawing a flow map is difficult, because every flowline has to be placed very carefully depending on the other egdes and nodes. In order to arrange the map as effectively as possible, a special emphasis in its generation has to be put on a clever placement of the edges within the map. A study on the cross-linking of schools (in terms of transition of students) within a defined region served (us) as a use case to analyse the problem of flow maps. The effectiveness of a map is at its highest if the designer and the map user use the same concepts for the organization of the representation, see MacEachren (1995). Following MacEachren (1982), the effectiveness of a map is determined by a variety of aspects, of which map complexity and symbolization are the most important ones. The symbolization specifies how data are represented on a map, whereas the complexity specifies {{the degree to which the}} symbols on a map appear intricate (MacEachren 1982). In this use case the important factors are: 1. The complexity, because of its negative impact on effectiveness. Thus it is important to reduce the number of objects depicted/visualized in the map to such an extent that no <b>visual</b> <b>clutters</b> are arising...|$|R
40|$|Similarity-based layouts {{generated}} by multidimensional projections or other dimension reduction techniques {{are commonly used}} to visualize high-dimensional data. Many projection techniques have been recently proposed addressing different objectives and application domains. Nonetheless, very {{little is known about}} the effectiveness of the generated layouts from a user’s perspective, how distinct layouts from the same data compare regarding the typical visualization tasks they support, or how domain-specific issues affect the outcome of the techniques. Learning more about projection usage is an important step towards both consolidating their role in high-dimensional data analysis and taking informed decisions when choosing techniques. This work provides a contribution towards this goal. We describe the results of an investigation on the performance of layouts {{generated by}} projection techniques as perceived by their users. We conducted a controlled user study to test against the following hypotheses: (1) projection performance is task-dependent; (2) certain projections perform better on certain types of tasks; (3) projection performance depends on the nature of the data; and (4) subjects prefer projections with good segregation capability. We generated layouts of high-dimensional data with five techniques representative of different projection approaches. As application domains we investigated image and document data. We identified eight typical tasks, three of them related to segregation capability of the projection, three related to projection precision, and two related to incurred <b>visual</b> <b>cluttering.</b> Answers to questions were compared for correctness against ‘ground truth’ computed directly from the data. We also looked at subject confidence and task completion times. Statistical analysis of the collected data resulted in Hypotheses 1 and 3 being confirmed, Hypothesis 2 being confirmed partially and Hypotheses 4 could not be confirmed. We discuss our findings in comparison with some numerical measures of projection layout quality. Our results offer interesting insight on the use of projection layouts in data visualization tasks and provide a departing point for further systematic investigations.
