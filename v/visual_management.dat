The user stories are then added to the board and the team completes them, the team working on as few user stories at a time as practical (the work-in-progress, or WIP, limit). To keep iterations short, WIP limits are thus used, and a planning trigger is set in place for the team to know when to plan next - when WIP falls below a predetermined level. There are no predefined roles in Scrumban; the team keeps the roles they already have.|$|E
40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> (VM), {{which is}} one of the {{founding}} blocks of the Toyota Production System, is the managerial strategy of integrating information and sensory aids into work settings for increased self-management. This paper presents the preliminary findings of a collaborative research conducted between Finland and the UK, as part of an effort to introduce the dissemination of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> in the Finnish construction industry. How the <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> concept is realised on Finnish construction sites is the main research question of the paper. The examination of the current <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> conditions on typical Finnish construction sites was conducted through multiple case studies carried out on five different construction sites in the country. The findings were presented by case descriptions. The main finding is that the <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> strategy is currently at an initial level and based on individual initiatives, not systematic company approaches. The discussion of the <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> conditions in Finland, some recommendations for the implementation of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> in the country, and the future <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> research efforts were also presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> (VM) is the {{managerial}} strategy of employing visual (sensory) tools and aids in close-range communication at a workplace {{to increase the}} self-management ability of the workforce. It is {{an important element of}} the Toyota Production System (TPS), contributing to the reduction of waste and variability in the production system. The <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> strategy increases transparency and pervasive information availability in a work setting. Along with increased information availability, transparency and better information flow, neat, orderly and transparent work settings can help improve the image of the construction industry. The objective of this thesis is to better understand the implementation of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> in construction. The objective was explored through the research questions in three stages. The first stage relates to the theoretical constitution of the subject through a synthesis of the literature review, addressing the research question of what <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> is. The second stage of the research was conducted to investigate the state-of-the-art implementation of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> in construction, employing the case study research methodology at nine Brazilian construction companies. In order to understand the level of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> on conventional construction sites, the final stage of the research was conducted in Finland, using the case study research methodology and a survey. The functions of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management,</b> the role of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> in other managerial activities, the implementation methods and characteristics of the <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> strategy in construction, the conditions of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> on conventional construction sites are some of the findings of the research. The future <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> research and implementation opportunities in construction are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Purpose- The {{purpose of}} this paper is to holistically discuss, explore and {{synthesise}} the key literature on <b>Visual</b> <b>Management,</b> an important, yet highly fragmented subject that is frequently referred in lean production accounts. Research Methodology - An extensive literature review was conducted to classify the current literature, to explore the different aspects and limitations of the current discussions on the subject, to clarify in what ways <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> benefits manifest themselves in a workplace and to identify the future research focus. Findings- <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> is an important close-range communication strategy based on cognitively effective information conveyance. This strategy has been frequently discussed in the production management literature. However, (a) the literature is fragmented as to the roles of <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> in a production setting, (b) the body of literature lacks integrated focus and cohesion with an abundance of related terminology from scholarly works and consultant books, (c) a practical VM tools taxonomy and a visual workplace implementation framework were presented (d) there is poor clarity with regards to the functions (benefits) that <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> may provide within organisations; nine conceptual <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> functions were proposed (e) a wide array of future research directions related to <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> was identified.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the current <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> practices in highways construction projects in England. Design/methodology/approach: Following a comprehensive literature review, the research topic was investigated by using five case studies and focus groups. Findings: The main findings are (i) the current implementation of VM is limited, particularly on the construction field, (ii) there are some identified points (suggestions) that require attention to disseminate and advance the current practices further (iii) many conventional and BIM based opportunities to extend the current <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> implementations exist for the sector. Originality/value: The highways construction and maintenance sector in England has been systematically deploying lean construction techniques in its operations for a while. One of those lean techniques is a close-range visual communication strategy called <b>Visual</b> <b>Management.</b> The literature on the <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> implementation in construction is scarce and generally limited to the building construction context. This paper documents the current industry practice in conventional and Building Information Modelling (BIM) based <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> and identifies a set of recommendations and some <b>Visual</b> <b>Management</b> ideas for future implementation efforts in the highways construction and maintenance sector...|$|E
