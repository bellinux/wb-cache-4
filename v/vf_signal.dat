40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study the modifications on cardiac response during ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced by physical training. The analysis was performed in the frequency domain of VF, and the regularity of the signal was also considered. Two sets of records were acquired: control (G 1 : without physical training, N= 10), and trained (G 2, N= 9). Cardiac registers were obtained using a 240 -electrodes matrix located on left ventricle of isolated rabbit heart. A Langendorff system was used to maintain the heart perfusion. VF was induced by increased frequencies. To analyze {{the time course of}} VF, records were processed in 4 -second segments. For every segment and channel, Welch periodogram with Hanning window, two non-overlapped sections and zero padding, was computed. Parameters considered in frequency domain are: dominant frequency (DF) and normalized energy (NE: spectral energy in the window DF± 1 Hz, normalized by spectral energy in 5 - 35 Hz band). For every segment and channel, a regularity analysis of VF was performed, obtaining the regularity index (RI), which is a measure of similarity among local activation waves present in every channel. Mean values for the parameters (DF, NE and RI) of the whole set of electrodes were computed for every segment. Obtained results show that DF is lower for trained rabbits (G 1 : 18. 234 ± 1, 241 Hz; G 2 : 14. 370 ± 0, 866 Hz; p< 0. 001). NE is greater for this group (G 1 : 0. 140 ± 0. 006; G 2 : 0. 263 ± 0. 017; p< 0. 001), suggesting a greater spectral concentration around DF.

40|$|Abstract Background Ventricular {{tachycardia}} (VT) and {{ventricular fibrillation}} (VF) {{are the most}} serious cardiac arrhythmias that require quick and accurate detection to save lives. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) {{have been developed to}} recognize these severe cardiac arrhythmias using complex algorithms inside it and determine if an electric shock should in fact be delivered to reset the cardiac rhythm and restore spontaneous circulation. Improving AED safety and efficacy by devising new algorithms which can more accurately distinguish shockable from non-shockable rhythms is a requirement of the present-day because of their uses in public places. Method In this paper, we propose a sequential detection algorithm to separate these severe cardiac pathologies from other arrhythmias based on the mean absolute value of the signal, certain low-order intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) of the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) analysis of the signal and a heart rate determination technique. First, we propose a direct waveform quantification based approach to separate VT plus VF from other arrhythmias. The quantification of the electrocardiographic waveforms is made by calculating the mean absolute value of the signal, called the mean signal strength. Then we use the IMFs, which have higher degree of similarity with the VF in comparison to VT, to separate <b>VF</b> from VTVF <b>signals.</b> At the last stage, a simple rate determination technique is used to calculate the heart rate of VT signals and the amplitude of the <b>VF</b> <b>signals</b> is measured to separate the coarse VF from VF. After these three stages of sequential detection procedure, we recognize the two components of shockable rhythms separately. Results The efficacy of the proposed algorithm has been verified and compared with other existing algorithms, e. g., HILB 1, PSR 2, SPEC 3, TCI 4, Count 5, using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, Creighton University Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia Database and MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia Database. Four quality parameters (e. g., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivity, and accuracy) were calculated to ascertain the quality of the proposed and other comparing algorithms. Comparative results have been presented on the identification of VTVF, VF and shockable rhythms (VF + VT above 180 bpm). Conclusions The results show significantly improved performance of the proposed EMD-based novel method as compared to other reported techniques in detecting the life threatening cardiac arrhythmias from a set of large databases. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is {{a common}} {{presenting}} dysrhythmia {{in the setting of}} cardiac arrest whose main treatment is defibrillation through direct current countershock to achieve return of spontaneous circulation. However, often defibrillation is unsuccessful and may even lead to the transition of VF to more nefarious rhythms such as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Multiple methods have been proposed for predicting defibrillation success based on examination of the VF waveform. To date, however, no analytical technique has been widely accepted. We developed a unique approach of computational VF waveform analysis, with and without addition of the signal of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO 2), using advanced machine learning algorithms. We compare these results with those obtained using the Amplitude Spectral Area (AMSA) technique. Methods A total of 90 pre-countershock ECG signals were analyzed form an accessible preshosptial cardiac arrest database. A unified predictive model, based on signal processing and machine learning, was developed with time-series and dual-tree complex wavelet transform features. Upon selection of correlated variables, a parametrically optimized support vector machine (SVM) model was trained for predicting outcomes on the test sets. Training and testing was performed with nested 10 -fold cross validation and 6 – 10 features for each test fold. Results The integrative model performs real-time, short-term (7. 8 second) analysis of the Electrocardiogram (ECG). For a total of 90 signals, 34 successful and 56 unsuccessful defibrillations were classified with an average Accuracy and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 82. 2 % and 85 %, respectively.

Patients with bilateral glaucomatous optic neuropathy of similar degree, as determined by optic disc morphology, Humphrey visual field (VF) and/or optical coherence tomography (OCT) were recruited. Any form of glaucoma was included. One eye was randomized to receive TES (treatment arm) by drawing envelop, and the other eye would automatically be in the control arm. Each patient received TES for a period of 30 minutes once per week over 26 weeks. The studied parameters, including visual acuity, intraocular pressure, anterior segment and posteior segment examination with microscopy, VF, OCT for retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and electroretinography (ERG) using multifocal ERG, were measured once at baseline, every 3 months during the study period, and at 3 and 6 months after the last stimulation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: <b>VF,</b> ERG <b>signal</b> Secondary outcomes: RNFL thickness RESULTS: Forteen patients were enrolled into the study and three of them completed at least 3 months treatment and investigations at the time of report. The 3 patients were from 63 - 76 years old, 2 males and 1 female. Regarding the VF, all patients demonstrated improvement in {{at least one of the}} parameters (median deviation and visual field index) in the treatment eye at 3 months post-treatment as compared to the baseline.

40|$|Despite well {{developed}} {{emergency medical services}} with rapid response advanced life support capabilities, survival rates following out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) have remained bleak in many venues. Generally, these poor resuscitation rates are attributed to delays {{in the performance of}} basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation by bystanders or delays in defibrillation, but recent laboratory data suggest that the current standard of immediately providing a countershock as the first therapeutic intervention may be detrimental when VF is prolonged beyond several minutes. Several studies now suggest that when myocardial energy supplies begin to dwindle following more prolonged periods of VF, improvements in coronary artery perfusion must first be achieved in order to prime the heart for successful return of spontaneous circulation after defibrillation. Therefore, before countershocks, certain pharmacologic and/or mechanical interventions might take precedence during resuscitative efforts. This evolving concept has been substantiated recently by clinical studies, including a controlled clinical trial, demonstrating a significant improvement in survival when basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation is provided for several minutes before the initial countershock. Although this evolving concept differs from current standards and may pose a potential problem for automated defibrillator initiatives (e. g. public access defibrillation), successful defibrillation and return of spontaneous circulation have been rendered more predictable by evolving technologies that can score the <b>VF</b> waveform <b>signal</b> and differentiate between those who can be shocked immediately and those who should receive other interventions first...|$|R

These data support theories which postulate a greater ability of the right hemisphere for bilateral processing.

40|$|Background—Much of the {{research}} performed studying the mechanism of ventricular fibrillation (VF) has been in normal ventricles rather than under a pathological condition predisposing to VF. We hypothesized that different ventricular substrates would alter the mechanism and characteristics of VF. Methods and Results—Three groups of dogs were studied: (1) control (n 8), (2) pacing-induced congestive heart failure (n 7), and (3) acute ischemia produced by 30 minutes of mid left anterior descending artery ligation (n 5). A noncontact mapping catheter (Ensite 3000, ESI) was placed via transseptal into the left ventricle (LV), along with an electrophysiology catheter. A multielectrode basket catheter (EP Technologies) {{was placed in the}} right ventricle, along with an electrophysiology catheter. Several episodes of VF were recorded in each animal. In addition to constructing isopotential and isochronal maps of the <b>VF</b> episodes, <b>signals</b> underwent frequency domain analysis as a fast Fourier transform was performed over a 2 -second window every 1 second. From the fast Fourier transform, the dominant frequency was determined, and the organization was calculated. In control dogs, meandering, reentrant spiral wave activity was the main feature of the VF. The congestive heart failure group showed evidence of a stable rotor (n 3), evidence of a focal source (n 3), or no evidence of a driver in the LV (n 1). The ischemic group showed evidence of an initial focal mechanism that transitioned into reentry. In the control and ischemic groups, the LV always had higher dominant frequencies than the right ventricle.

He was told that this was impossible and he could not say he had already done it with Colossus because he was bound by the Official Secrets Act. However, a fully electronic prototype Time Division Multiplex Model Exchange was constructed at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill and then an experimental TDM exchange system was built and tested at Highgate Wood, North London, in 1962, but it was found to be beyond the technology of the time: the solid-state switching worked well, but the analogue transmission (which had worked on the short cable runs of a laboratory model at Dollis Hill) was too noisy for public service on the long cable runs of a large exchange. However, the principles would be used later, as transmission became digital, in the development of digital exchanges the world over, including System X.|$|R
