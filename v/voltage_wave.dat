It {{has been reported that}} exercise can be considerably useful in the treatment of psychological diseases. In the present study the effect of running on Spontaneous electroencephalographic activity (EEG) of rats was investigated. Method: Male wistar rats weighting 190 - 250 gr were selected and divided into control and exercise groups. The animals of exercise group were run on treadmill (I hour a day) for duration of two weeks. Then the animals in both groups were anesthetized with urethane and EEGs of them were recorded. Result: In the exercise group alpha, beta and theta waves significantly increased and delta waves deceased in comparison to the control group. Discussion: In the present study high frequency- low <b>voltage</b> <b>waves</b> increased and low frequency-high <b>voltage</b> <b>waves</b> decreased in the exercise group. This provides further support to the earlier supposition that increase in high frequency- low <b>voltage</b> <b>waves</b> represent promotion of consciousness.

40|$|Superposition {{demands that}} a linear {{combination}} of solutions to an electromagnetic problem {{also be a}} solution. This paper analyzes some very simple problems: the constructive and destructive interferences of short impulse <b>voltage</b> and current <b>waves</b> along an ideal free-space transmission line. When <b>voltage</b> <b>waves</b> constructively interfere, the superposition has twice the electrical energy of the individual waveforms because current goes to zero, converting magnetic to electrical energy. When <b>voltage</b> <b>waves</b> destructively interfere, the superposition has no electrical energy because it transforms to magnetic energy. Although the impedance of the individual waves is that of free space, a superposition of waves may exhibit arbitrary impedance. Further, interferences of identical waveforms allow no energy transfer between opposite ends of a transmission line. The waves appear to recoil elastically one from another. Although alternate interpretations are possible, these appear less likely. Similar phenomenology arises in waves of arbitrary shape and those propagating in free space as well. We may also interpret this behavior as each wave reflecting from the impedance variations the superposition imparts on free space. This work has practical implications to quantum mechanics, field diversity antenna systems, and near-field electromagnetic ranging.

50|$|One way of {{thinking}} about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a parasitic element to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its centre, with a short circuit across its feed point. As is well known in transmission line theory, a short circuit reflects all of the incident power 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of the parasitic element as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power and sending it down a transmission line to a matched load, and a transmitter sending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the antenna element. If the transmitted <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> were 180 degrees out of phase with the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage waves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the feedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). Thus a half-wave parasitic element radiates a wave 180° out of phase with the incident wave.|$|E
5000|$|The {{function}} of the spark gap is to initially present a high resistance to the circuit so that the C1 capacitor is allowed to charge. When the breakdown voltage of the gap is reached, {{the air in the}} gap ionizes, the resistance across the gap is dramatically lower and a current pulse flows across the arc {{to the rest of the}} circuit. The gap is set so that the discharge coincides with a maximum or near maximum of charge in C1 and it is as if a high speed switch is turned on at just the right moment to allow the C1 capacitor to discharge its stored energy into the other circuit elements. This pulse of energy is rapidly exchanged back and forth between the C2 and L elements and takes the form of a damped oscillation at a radio frequency. The back and forth exchange of energy is in the form of an alternating current and <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> with much of the energy flowing out to the antenna.|$|E
50|$|Voltage {{harmonics}} {{are mostly}} caused by current harmonics. The voltage {{provided by the}} voltage source will be distorted by current harmonics due to source impedance. If the source impedance of the voltage source is small, current harmonics will cause only small voltage harmonics. It is typically the case that voltage harmonics are indeed small compared to current harmonics. For that reason, the voltage waveform can usually be approximated by the fundamental frequency of voltage. If this approximation is used, current harmonics produce {{no effect on the}} real power transferred to the load. An intuitive way to see this comes from sketching the <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> at fundamental frequency and overlaying a current harmonic with no phase shift (in order to more easily observe the following phenomenon). What can be observed is that for every period of voltage, there is equal area above the horizontal axis and below the current harmonic wave as there is below the axis and above the current harmonic wave. This means that the average real power contributed by current harmonics is equal to zero. However, if higher harmonics of voltage are considered, then current harmonics do make a contribution to the real power transferred to the load.|$|E

40|$|Random {{energisation}} {{of power}} transformers often causes significant inrush currents and steep switching <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> fronts {{that are responsible}} for several adverse effects like huge current forces in the transformer windings, dielectric stress of the transformer winding insulation and temporary overvoltages. Controlled switching taking into account the residual flux is able to eliminate these inrush currents, but significant <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> fronts emerge from the switching action in almost all cases. Thus, a new algorithm is presented that extends the existing one so that a combined reduction of all stresses can be achieved.

Thereby, an inrush current peak of 1 pu will be tolerated so that the <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> front amplitude can be reduced. Depending on the strategy for controlled switching, the maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>wave</b> front amplitude of all phases can be limited to 0. 75 pu (“Delayed Closing”, reduction of 11. 7 %) respectively to 0. 7 pu for “Rapid Closing ” (reduction of 22 %) ...|$|E

Some researchers have also suggested that this region has some roles in consciousness. In the present study, the effect of electrical stimulation and lesion of nucleus accumbens on Electroencephalogram waves (EEG) of addict and non-addict rats was investigated. Method: Male wistar rats (weight 190 - 250 g) were divided into control and addict groups. Addiction was induced by injection of morphine (three {{times a day and}} for four days). Then all rats in both groups were aneasthetized by urethane and stainless steel electrodes were implanted in nucleus accumbens. EEG waves were recorded in three stages of control, after stimulation (130 µA, 100 HZ, every 5 sec for 10 min), and after lesion (0. 4 mA, 60 sec) of nucleus accumbens in each group. Results: In addict group alpha and betha waves were increased, while theta and dltha waves were decreased compared to intact group. Electrical stimulation and lesion of nucleus accumbens decreased theta waves in intact group and increased betha waves in addict group comparing to the control stages. Conclusion: Although morphine dependency causes increase of high frequency- low <b>voltage</b> <b>waves</b> and decrease of low frequency-high <b>voltage</b> <b>waves,</b> it seems, that nucleus accumbens has no role in variations of brain waves.
