The <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicle</b> stabilizes to a shifted reference position/heading defined by the leader, and provides a reference velocity for the synchronization control law of the follower. Only position/heading measurements {{are available from the}} leader, and the closed-loop errors are shown to be uniformly globally practically asymptotically stable. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} pattern {{preserving}} path following control of unicycle teams with communication delays. The {{pattern of the}} vehicle team {{is said to be}} preserved if the distance between it and the desired one remains in some given range. A <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicle</b> formation is introduced such that each <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicle</b> becomes the pursuit target for the corresponding real vehicle. First, an input-driven consensus protocol is used to force the <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicle</b> formation close to the desired vehicle formation. Then a controller is designed to achieve model reference tracking for each vehicle with constrained motion. It is shown that, by our strategy, the pattern can be maintained if the formation speed is less than some computable value, and the desired formation pattern can be eventually achieved if this speed tends to zero...|$|R

50|$|The current Ghanaian {{number plate}} format {{has been in}} use since January, 2009; Ghanaian vehicle license plates consist of a two-letter region code, {{followed}} by a 4-digit numeric and a 2-digit year code. The 2-letter region code indicates the region in which the vehicle was registered; the 4-digit numeric code is the unique item one can find on a Ghanaian number plate - the digits show the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in the Region in which the <b>vehicle</b> was <b>registered.</b> The year code also tells one the exact {{year in which the}} <b>vehicle</b> was <b>registered.</b> For instance, the 2567th <b>vehicle</b> <b>registered</b> in the Ashanti Region in the year 2012, will bear the number plate AS 2567-12.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We apply {{virtual machine}} abstractions to {{networked}} autonomous vehicles enabling {{what we call}} cloud computing in space. In analogy to traditional system virtualization and cloud computing, there are (customer-operated) <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicles</b> that essentially perform like real vehicles although they are hosted by possibly fewer, shared (provider-operated) real vehicles. Here the focus is, however, on motion rather than computation. In the service-level agreement, a <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicle</b> is a <b>virtual</b> machine plus a virtual speed. We define virtual deadline for each task based on virtual speed, and make the spatial cloud a soft real-time system [7], [1]. The performance isolation {{is measured by the}} average of tardiness and delivery probability. We use Voronoi tessellation to allocate the tasks to the real vehicles, and design scheduling policies such as Earliest Virtual Deadline First (EVDF), Earliest Dynamic Virtual Deadline First (EDVDF) and credit scheduling policy for the real vehicles. EVDF is shown to minimize the tardiness. Under EVDF, we identify a worst case arrival process maximizing tardiness. We show in simulation that abstracting real vehicles such as cars or planes to <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicles</b> enables <b>virtual</b> <b>vehicles</b> to move in space like real vehicles with guaranteed tardiness (e. g. ≤ 1 %) while being hosted by significantly fewer, e. g. 1 -for- 7. 5, shared real vehicles.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of introducing environmental road tax for motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in the Czech Republic. The article analyses requirements to be met by this type of tax and reviews its functions. Further it analyses practical aspects {{in the sense of}} existence of data that is needed for accomplishing the task to find an ideal form of environmental tax. Based on these foundations, the authors identified a suitable model of taxation of motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in 2000 and after. Another aim was finding proper variables as regards the need of calculation of theoretical emission data in motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> in the Czech Republic before 2000. The proposed model is expected to use emission limits as declared in technical documentation of motor <b>vehicles</b> <b>registered</b> after 2000 and theoretical limits calculated by means of variables of engine capacity and time in older motor vehicles despite the fact that these variables provide explanation for the analysed emission effect just in case of 58 % diesel engines, more precisely in case of 82 % petrol engines...|$|R
