5|$|Concorde {{was under}} Captain John Cramer, {{probably}} from February 1806. She {{was still in}} the East Indies in 1807, where in July she captured the 2-gun privateer <b>Vigilant.</b>|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Vigilant</b> was a {{merchantman}} {{converted into}} a warship during the American Revolution. After serving as a transport in North American waters from 1775, she was purchased by the Royal Navy (RN) and modified for shore bombardment duties in 1777. She {{was instrumental in the}} eventual British success during the siege of Fort Mifflin that same year and supported British operations in Georgia and South Carolina in 1779–80. Her heavy armament proved to be more than <b>Vigilant</b> was designed to handle and she was condemned and disposed of in 1780.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vigilant</b> Eagle 2012 was {{a command}} post {{exercise}} (CPX) held in 2012 that, {{for the first}} time, did not include live-flying aircraft, instead using computer simulations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vigilant</b> was {{generally}} inactive while the British occupied Philadelphia, but she sailed to New York City when the British evacuated {{the city in}} June 1778. She joined the small British squadron there upon the approach of a French squadron {{under the command of}} the Comte d'Estaing in July, but the French declined to engage the British ships. The ship accompanied the British squadron to Newport, Rhode Island as it attempted to lift the Franco-American siege, but <b>Vigilant</b> was badly damaged when a storm interrupted the planned battle on 13 August. Despite the damage, she supported British troops on 29–30 August as they pursued the retreating Americans who had abandoned the siege after the French ships sailed to Boston for repairs. A few days later, on 4 September, the ship collided with the sloop-of-war Raven during the British raid on New London, Connecticut and had her bow stove in by the other ship. <b>Vigilant</b> was quickly repaired in New York and participated in the attack on Little Egg Harbor River in October.|$|E
5|$|A planned <b>Vigilant</b> Eagle 2014 was {{suspended}} due to {{tensions between the}} United States and Canada on one side, and the Russian Federation on the other, over the War in Donbass. The exercise would have involved, for the first time, the Japan Air Self Defense Force. According to American and Canadian officials, the exercises were canceled at their initiative.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more <b>vigilant</b> than juveniles, and males more <b>vigilant</b> than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Swinefield was {{concerned}} {{to ensure that}} his clergy were well treated. He worked to ensure that churches within his diocese were not misappropriated through the granting of custody to unworthy candidates, and was <b>vigilant</b> over monastic houses. His main efforts, though, went toward securing the canonisation of his predecessor Thomas de Cantilupe. This did not however take place until 1320, after Swinefield's death.|$|E
5|$|Emus are diurnal {{birds and}} spend their day foraging, {{preening}} their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds {{apart from the}} breeding season, and while some forage, others remain <b>vigilant</b> to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.|$|E
5|$|Exercise <b>Vigilant</b> Eagle is {{a series}} of trilateral {{military}} exercises involving the armed forces of Canada, Russia, and the United States. The exercise is designed to prepare the Russian Air Force and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to undertake coordinated air intercept missions against hijacked civilian aircraft. Four such exercises have been held.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1779, Lowestoffe {{captured}} the <b>Vigilant,</b> near the Bite (or Bight) of Leogan. The 70 ton sloop was sailing from Dominique to Philadelphia with a cargo of sugar, rum, molasses, coffee, cotton and salt. John English was her master {{and she had}} a crew of five men.|$|E
5|$|The adult robin is preyed upon by hawks, cats, and snakes, {{but when}} feeding in flocks, {{it can be}} <b>vigilant</b> and watch other birds for {{reactions}} to predators. Brown-headed cowbirds lay eggs in robin nests (see brood parasite), but robins usually reject the cowbird eggs.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy for a few hours, {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever <b>vigilant.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, <b>vigilant</b> {{fans would}} have noticed the names years earlier. Hitler-Barassi was photographed in 1993 at the opening night of Madame Butterfly, which was {{published}} on 4 April 1993; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack, who later released a book of his own (Campaigning With Grant) in 2000, which was about the American Civil War. The book contains thin references to TISM. In interviews about his book, Minack revealed he was a teacher, his father fought in World War II for the Germans {{and that he is}} fanatical about the Richmond Football Club, explaining his stage moniker.|$|E
5|$|II (Sturm)./JG 4 {{took off}} for Le Culot at 08:08. Getting lost, they {{stumbled}} upon Asch airfield and claimed one P-47 destroyed and two twin-engine aircraft damaged, {{as well as two}} trains and trucks destroyed. The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. The machine was probably a Stinson L-1 <b>Vigilant</b> of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.|$|E
5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more <b>vigilant</b> against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be <b>vigilant</b> in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain <b>vigilant</b> for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E
5|$|The Marines {{began their}} attack, codenamed Operation <b>Vigilant</b> Resolve, on 5 April. The overall ground {{commander}} in Anbar, 1st Marine Division commander General James Mattis, initially {{planned to use}} his only available units, 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion 1st Marines. They would push in from {{the east and west}} and methodically contain the insurgents. This plan was underway when on 9 April, General Sanchez ordered an immediate halt.|$|E
5|$|The {{central office}} in Washington, which {{evolved into the}} National Meteorological Center and Weather Prediction Center (formally known as the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center), assumed {{hurricane}} warning/advisory responsibility at that time. This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, {{and the concept of}} the Atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a <b>vigilant</b> lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year. Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the <b>vigilant</b> parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
5|$|In the Sixth Round {{they faced}} Third Division South club Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road, as 8,000 Vale fans {{made up a}} 31,000 crowd. In {{the days leading up}} to the game thieves had stolen 1,200 matchday tickets and police were <b>vigilant</b> to catch out anyone who tried to enter the stadium with these stolen tickets. The only goal of the game came from Leake – who struck the ball into the net after {{controlling}} the ball from a Hayward knock-down from an Askey corner – put Vale into the semi-finals, with the team 'delightedly mobbed' by supporters after the finish. Ray King made a name for himself in the dying moments of the game after making a save from a George Poulton shot.|$|E
5|$|Sea lions are preyed on by {{killer whales}} and large sharks. At Monterey Bay, California sea lions {{appear to be}} the more common food items for {{transient}} mammal-eating killer whale pods. The sea lions may respond to the dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain <b>vigilant,</b> even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters are more likely to survive and make it to the shore.|$|E
5|$|The Machias {{community}} expected retaliation by the British Empire, {{and immediately}} petitioned to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for guidance, supplies, and assistance. The Provincial Congress organized {{the defense of}} Machias and remained <b>vigilant.</b> Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted {{one of the three}} captured vessels with breastwork, and armed it with guns and swivels that were taken from the Margaretta, and changed its name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, the Diligent and the Tatamagouche. The ships' officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbor. The Provincial Congress formally recognized O'Brien and Foster's efforts by commissioning both the Machias Liberty and the Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy with O'Brien as their commander in August 1775. Retaliation from the British did not occur until October 18, 1775, with the Burning of Falmouth.|$|E
5|$|By early July, {{the sick}} at Kermanshah had {{recovered}} and rejoined the expedition. Camels and water bags were purchased, and the parties left Isfahan separately on 3 July 1915 {{for the journey}} through the desert, hoping to rendezvous at Tebbes, halfway to the Afghan border. Von Hentig's group travelled with twelve pack horses, twenty-four mules, and a camel caravan. Throughout the march, {{efforts were made to}} throw off the British and Russian patrols. False dispatches spread disinformation on the group's numbers, destination, and intention. To avoid the extreme daytime heat, they travelled by night. Food was found or bought by Persian messengers sent ahead of the party. These scouts also helped identify hostile villages and helped find water. The group crossed the Persian desert in forty nights. Dysentery and delirium plagued the party. Some Persian guides attempted to defect, and camel drivers had to be constantly <b>vigilant</b> for robbers. On 23 July, the group reached Tebbes– the first Europeans after Sven Hedin. They were soon followed by Niedermayer's party, which now included explorer Wilhelm Paschen and six Austrian and Hungarian soldiers who had escaped from Russian prisoner of war camps in Turkestan. The arrival was marked by a grand welcome by the town's mayor. However, the welcome meant the party had been spotted.|$|E
5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not <b>vigilant</b> enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained <b>vigilant</b> on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E
5|$|In Baldwin County, Alabama, a local {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared on November9 as Ida neared landfall. Voluntary evacuations were declared for residents living along coastal areas or in mobile homes. All government offices were closed until November10 due to the storm. The Baldwin County Coliseum was converted into a shelter to house possible evacuees during the storm as well. In Mississippi, officials advised residents to remain <b>vigilant</b> and discussed possible evacuations. Residents living near Pensacola Beach, Florida, and nearby Perdido Key were urged to evacuate. On November8, emergency officials declared a {{state of emergency}} in Escambia County. The following day, Walton County was also placed under a state of emergency ahead of Hurricane Ida's arrival. Voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in low-lying areas and all non-emergency offices were closed until November10. The Freeport High School gymnasium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, tengu {{came to be}} feared as the <b>vigilant</b> protectors {{of certain}} forests. In the 1764 {{collection}} of strange stories , a tale tells {{of a man who}} wanders into a deep valley while gathering leaves, only to be faced with a sudden and ferocious hailstorm. A group of peasants later tell him {{that he was in the}} valley where the guhin live, and anyone who takes a single leaf from that place will surely die. In the , written in 1849, the author describes the customs of the wood-cutters of Mino Province, who used a sort of rice cake called kuhin-mochi to placate the tengu, who would otherwise perpetrate all sorts of mischief. In other provinces a special kind of fish called okoze was offered to the tengu by woodsmen and hunters, in exchange for a successful day's work. The people of Ishikawa Prefecture have until recently believed that the tengu loathe mackerel, and have used this fish as a charm against kidnappings and hauntings by the mischievous spirits.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the gyrfalcon, and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain <b>vigilant</b> and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{dampening}} {{of public}} enthusiasm for freak shows and human oddities continued {{and the police}} and magistrates became increasingly <b>vigilant</b> in closing shows down. Merrick remained a horrifying spectacle for his viewers and Roper grew nervous about the negative attention the Elephant Man drew from local authorities. Merrick's group of managers decided that he should go on tour in Continental Europe, {{with the hope that}} authorities there would be more lenient. Merrick's management was assumed by an unknown man (possibly named Ferrari) and they left for the Continent. The Elephant Man was no more successful there than in Britain, and similar action was taken by authorities to move him out of their jurisdictions. In Brussels, Merrick was deserted by this new manager, who stole Merrick's £50 (2015 equivalent £) savings. Abandoned, Merrick made his way by train to Ostend, where he attempted to board a ferry for Dover but was refused passage. He travelled to Antwerp and was able to board a ship bound for Harwich in Essex. From there, he travelled by train to London and arrived at Liverpool Street station.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} issuing a {{convective}} watch {{begins with a}} conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. If after collaboration a watch is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue a watch approximation product which {{is followed by the}} local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public of the meaning behind the watch and to be <b>vigilant</b> of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E
5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to be <b>vigilant</b> against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers have {{suggested}} that the Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E
5|$|Livestock {{depredation}} {{has been}} one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves, and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation: as well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found. Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance. Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have evolved under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well. Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted: in Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidences are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored. The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation. The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), domestic reindeer (northern Scandinavia), goats (India), horses (Mongolia), cattle and turkeys (North America). The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus. Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures. In some cases, wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it: the stress livestock experiences in being <b>vigilant</b> for wolves may result in miscarriages, weight loss and a decrease in meat quality.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 1758, James Abercromby {{attacked}} Fort Carillon on Lake Champlain, but was repelled {{with heavy}} losses. In August, Montgomery and the 17th foot sailed to Boston, marched {{to join with}} Abercromby's forces in Albany and then moved to Lake George. On November 9, Abercromby was recalled; Amherst replaced him as commander-in-chief. The British high command, for the 1759 campaign, developed {{a plan for a}} three-pronged attack into Canada, in which forces including the 17th foot would assault Fort Carillon and also capture Fort St. Frédéric, near Crown Point, New York. Under Amherst's command, Montgomery and the 17th Foot participated in the capture of Fort Carillon. While the army was gathering prior to the battle, Montgomery's company was on guard duty; he ordered his men to remain <b>vigilant</b> for French and Indian ambush parties. On May 9 his suspicions proved correct when 12 men from the 17th were attacked. Montgomery and the 17th met stiff resistance at first. Montgomery ordered that his men were not to fire at night, fearing they would shoot their comrades. On July 21, the army began its movement toward Fort Carillon; by the 26th they were in position outside the fort's walls, from which the French had already withdrawn most of their forces to Fort St. Frédéric. That night, after some exchange of cannon fire during the day, the French blew up Carillon's powder magazine, and Fort St. Frédéric the next day, and withdrew {{to the far end of}} Lake Champlain.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a <b>vigilant</b> lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E
