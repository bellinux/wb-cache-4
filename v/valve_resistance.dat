40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the utility of aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> in assessing the severity of aortic stenosis. Background. Assessment of the severity of aortic stenosis has traditionally employed hemodynamic data and the Gorlin formula to calculate the area of the aortic valve. Recently, flow dependence of the Gorlin formula has been identified and the accuracy of the formula challenged. Aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance,</b> the quotient of gradient and cardiac output, has been advanced as potentially useful in assessing the severity of valve stenosis. Methods. We studied 48 symptomatic patients with an initial diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis based on a calculated aortic valve area of ≤ 0. 8 cm 2 by the Gorlin formula. Forty of these patients (Group I) were confirmed to have severe stenosis, whereas 8 (Group II) were subsequently proved no severe aortic stenosis. The 18 patients in Group I with a severe area of 0. 6 to 0. 8 cm 2 (Group IA) were directly compared with Group II patients who had a similar valve area. Results. Aortic valve area was nearly identical in Group IA and Group II patients (0. 69 ± 0, 05 and 0. 71 ± 0. 06 cm 2, respectively, p = NS). However, aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> was much less in Group II patients (212 ± 6 vs. 316 ± 11 dynes· s· cm− 5, p < 0. 0001). In this small cohort, aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> achieved nearly complete separation of patients in Groups IA and II. Conclusions. In some patients with relatively mild aortic stenosis, the calculated valve area may indicate that the stenosis is severe. The use of aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> in conjanction with the Gorlin formula helps separate patients with truly severe aortic stenosis from those with milder disease...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of altering transvalvular volume flow rate on indexes of aortic stenosis severity (valve area, <b>valve</b> <b>resistance,</b> percent left ventricular stroke work loss) derived by using Doppler echocardiography. Background. Assessment of hemodynamic severity in aortic stenosis has been limited by the absence of an index that is independent of transvalvular flow rate. The traditional measurement of valve area by the Gorlin equation has been shown to vary with alterations in transvalvular flow. Recently, <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> and percent stroke work loss have been proposed as indexes that are relatively independent of flow. Although typically derived with invasive measurements, <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> and percent stroke work loss (in addition to continuity equation valve area) can be determined noninvasively with Doppler echocardiography. Methods. We performed 110 symptom-limited exercise studies in 66 asymptomatic patients with valvular aortic stenosis. Continuity equation valve area, <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> (the ratio between mean transvalvular pressure gradient and mean flow rate) and the steady component of percent stroke work loss (the ratio between mean transvalvular pressure gradient and left ventricular systolic pressure) were assessed by Doppler echocardiography at rest and immediately after exercise.

Mean transvalvular volume flow rate increased 24 % (from [mean ± SD] 319 ± 80 to 400 ± 140 ml/s, p 1. 0 cm 2 or reduced transvalvular flow rate (rest cardiac output 1. 0 cm 2 and in the presence of both normal and low transvalvular flow states.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess CSF dynamics of different shunt constructions in patients with adult hydrocephalus syndrome and correlate these findings to clinical outcome, neuroradiology, and the specifications of the shunts provided by the manufacturer. Thirty four patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus (normal pressure hydrocephalus) syndrome were included in a prospective, consecutive case series. A differential pressure valve (Cordis Hakim standard system) was used in 28 patients and a variable <b>resistance</b> <b>valve</b> (Cordis Orbis-Sigma) in six. A constant pressure infusion method was used; CSF pressure and conductance were determined before surgery. Three months after shunt placement CSF pressure, the "pressure v flow" curve, and gravity induced flow were measured. There {{was no difference between}} mean preoperative and postoperative resting CSF pressures in patients with Hakim shunts. The opening pressures of the Hakim shunts were higher than the value proposed by the manufacturer. A pronounced gravity effect induced CSF flow and decrease of the CSF pressure. In functioning variable <b>resistance</b> <b>valves,</b> CSF dynamics normalised postoperatively. There was no gravity effect and the characteristics shaped "pressure v flow" curve was sometimes seen. Six patients (three differential pressure <b>valves,</b> three variable <b>resistance</b> <b>valves)</b> had non-functioning shunts.

In all patients, there was no relation between the width of the ventricles and clinical improvement or CSF pressure. In conclusion, the differential pressure valve system does not behave according to the specifications provided by the manufacturer. A decrease in CSF pressure in patients with this shunt was solely due to the effect of gravity.

40|$|The six-chamber {{cardiovascular}} system model of Burkhoff and Tyberg {{has been used}} in several theoretical and experimental studies. However, this {{cardiovascular system}} model (and others derived from it) are not identifiable from any output set. In this work, two such cases of structural non-identifiability are first presented. These cases occur when the model output set only contains a single type of information (pressure or volume). A specific output set is thus chosen, mixing pressure and volume information and containing {{only a limited number of}} clinically available measurements. Then, by manipulating the model equations involving these outputs, it is demonstrated that the six-chamber cardiovascular system model is structurally globally identifiable. A further simplification is made, assuming known cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>resistances.</b> Because of the poor practical identifiability of these four parameters, this assumption is usual. Under this hypothesis, the six-chamber cardiovascular system model is structurally identifiable from an even smaller dataset.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 12 patients with combined aortic and mitral stenosis who had undergone balloon dilatation of the mitral valve {{over a period of}} 9 years. SETTING: Tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS: Twelve (8 women, 4 men; mean (SD) age 37 (9) of 227 consecutive patients with critical mitral stenosis undergoing transvenous balloon dilation of the mitral valve in the centre also had aortic stenosis, defined as a transaortic pressure gradient of more than 25 mm Hg measured at a catheterisation study before valvuloplasty. INTERVENTIONS: Echocardiographic variables (mitral valve area measured by the pressure half-time method and planimetry, and the aortic valve area derived from the continuity equation) and haemodynamic measurements (cardiac output, left ventricular mean systolic pressure, aortic mean pressure, transaortic valve pressure gradient, mitral valve and aortic valve areas derived from the Gorlin formula, and aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance)</b> were assessed before and after transvenous balloon dilatation of the mitral valve. Follow up catheterisation to measure haemodynamic variables was performed one week after mitral valvuloplasty. RESULTS: Mean transaortic flow rate increased 33 % after mitral valvuloplasty (from 198 (68) to 254 (41) ml/s, P = 0. 002). Aortic valve areas derived from the Gorlin formula were significantly increased from 0. 57 (0. 12) to 0. 73 (0. 14) cm 2 (P = 0. 006) after mitral valvuloplasty. However, aortic valve area and <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> derived from the continuity equation were independent of the increase in flow rate after mitral valvuloplasty (from 1. 29 (0. 35) to 1. 30 (0. 29) cm 2 and from 317 (65) to 259 (75) dyn. s. cm- 5, both P = NS). CONCLUSION: The Gorlin-derived aortic valve area tends to be flow-dependent, and continuity equation-derived aortic valve area and catheterisation-derived <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> seem to be less flow-dependent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{medium-term}} hemodynamic {{performance of}} stentless valves {{has not been}} widely reported, particularly in comparison with in vitro studies. Therefore, we have assessed prospectively the hemodynamics of the Edwards Prima valve in its fifth year after implantation in the aortic position, and compared the results with those at 1 month after implantation and also with in vitro data. METHODS: Thirty-five patients (age, 77 +/- 6 years; 19 men) were prospectively studied by Doppler echocardiography at 1 month and 52 +/- 8 months after implantation of a Prima stentless valve. Valve hemodynamics were assessed by measuring the mean pressure gradient, mean <b>valve</b> <b>resistance,</b> and effective orifice area. Left ventricular systolic function was quantified by ejection fraction, the degree of hypertrophy by ventricular mass index, and the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to cavity radius {{as a measure of}} ventricular geometry. RESULTS: With a mean valve size of 24. 6 +/- 2. 2 mm in the fifth year after implantation, the mean pressure gradient was 6. 2 +/- 3. 5 mm Hg, the mean <b>valve</b> <b>resistance,</b> 29 +/- 16 dyne x s(- 1) x cm(- 5)), and the effective orifice area was 2. 05 +/- 0. 50 cm 2. Compared with 1 month after operation, there was a 47 % decrease in mean <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> (p = 0. 002) and a 39 % increase in effective orifice area (p = 0. 001). Furthermore, both effective orifice area and mean <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> in the fifth year did not differ from their in vitro counterparts, whereas the left ventricular ejection fraction (0. 64 +/- 0. 14), the left ventricular mass index (119 +/- 49 g/m 2), and the ratio of ventricular wall thickness to cavity radius (0. 44 +/- 0. 13) were within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the Prima valve is a reliable stentless aortic bioprosthesis.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to evaluate the use}} of synthesized ascending aorta pressure, calculated from femoral artery pressure using an aortofemoral transfer function, in the assessment of aortic valve stenosis. Background. Measurement of an accurate aortic valve gradient in patients with aortic stenosis often requires simultaneous recordings of ascending aorta and left ventricular pressures. The use of femoral artery pressure {{is considered to be a}} poor substitute for ascending aorta pressure. However, the aortic pressure wave can be calculated from the femoral artery pressure if the aortofemoral transfer function has been determined. Method. Femoral artery pressure from the side arm of an introducer sheath and ascending aorta pressure are recorded simultaneously and the data stored in a personal computer. An aortofemoral transfer function is determined from the ratio of the Fourier components of aortic and femoral pressures. Left ventricular and femoral artery pressures are then recorded. Using the previously determined transfer function, the simultaneous ascending aorta pressure is calculated from the femoral pressure. Results. Ascending aorta pressure waveforms estimated from femoral artery pressure closely resembled the simultaneously recorded ascending aorta pressure. Mean aortic valve gradients calculated from the synthesized aortic pressure correlated well with the gradient measured from direct recordings of aortic pressure (r = 0. 98). There was also a good relation between valve areas (r = 0. 93) and <b>valve</b> <b>resistances</b> (r = 0. 98) calculated using the two methods. Conclusions.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} assess the {{diagnostic}} implications of the flow dependence of Doppler echocardiographic indexes of aortic valve stenosis. Background. Although valve area {{has been shown to}} change with alterations in flow rate, the diagnostic consequences of this phenomenon remain unknown. <b>Valve</b> <b>resistance</b> has been suggested as a more stable index for evaluating aortic stenosis. Methods. A low dose dobutamine protocol was performed in 35 patients with aortic stenosis. Hemodynamic indexes were obtained by Doppler echocardiography at baseline and at each dobutamine dose. Results. As a result of the shortening of the systolic ejection period, flow increased from (mean ± SD) 164 ± 48 to 229 ± 102 ml/s (p < 0. 0001). At peak flow, valve area increased by 28 % (from 0. 5 ± 0. 2 to 0. 6 ± 0. 3 cm 2, p < 0. 0001), whereas <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> decreased by 4 % (from 498 ± 252 to 459 ± 222 dynes·s·cm− 5, p = 0. 04). This observed change in resistance was smaller than that for valve area (p < 0. 01). The flow dependence of valve area varied among individual patients (p < 0. 0001). Multivariate analysis identified calcific degenerative etiology (beta 0. 29, p = 0. 002), left ventricular velocity of fiber shortening (beta 0. 22, p = 0. 01), baseline flow (beta − 0. 28, p = 0. 04) and amount of flow increase induced by dobutamine (beta 0. 90, p < 0. 0001) as factors related to valve area flow dependence.

40|$|Background. Speech valves {{help restore}} speech after {{surgical}} {{removal of the}} larynx (laryngectomy). Laryngectomized Patients breathe through an artificial opening (tracheostoma) in the neck. A shunt valve is routinely inserted between oesophagus and trachea to restore speech. At closure of the stoma with a finger, exhaled air is rerouted into the oesophagus, which will vibrate and form the new voice. Manual closure of the stoma attracts attention, requires one free hand and is unhygienic. Therefore automatic, hands-free speech valves are preferred. Present valves automatically close upon strong exhalation and open again when the pressure drops. This method wastes valuable air during closure and pressure should be maintained during speech, making long sentences or pauses impossible. The new iValve closes at strong inhalation. In speech mode, inhalation mid sentence is now made possible. The patient can speak almost as natural, pausing and whispering at will. The iValve automatic inhalation valve is a full silicone rubber, hands-free speech valve. The switching mechanism consists of a silicone rubber bi-stable valve shell. A prototype was tested in vitro. Method. 6 iValve prototype versions were tested in vitro at different settings. Closing flows, Opening pressures and air flow resistances were measured and compared with physiological values and the air flow resistance of two commercially available valves. Results. The iValve operates within physiological pressures and flows. Air flow resistance in breath mode was good, yet higher than the two commercial <b>valves.</b> <b>Resistance</b> in speech mode was above physiological air flow resistance. Conclusions. The iValve works and can be adjusted within physiological ranges. Pressures and flows can be independently controlled. Air flow resistance in speech mode should, and can, be decreased.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess which hemodynamic index best accounts for clinical severity of aortic stenosis (AS) and to analyze the value of low-dose dobutamine testing. BackgroundPressure gradient and valve area are suboptimal because they depend on flow rate, correlate poorly with symptoms, and provide limited prognostic information. Recently, new indices and low-dose inotropic stimulation have been introduced, but their clinical value remains uncertain. MethodsA total of 307 consecutive patients with AS were included in an ambispective study design (71 ± 12 years old; peak jet velocity: 3. 7 ± 1. 1 m/s). Clinical and Doppler-echocardiographic data were obtained, as well as results of low-dose dobutamine infusion (47 patients). Using receiver-operator-characteristic curve analysis, we evaluated jet velocity, pressure gradient, valve area, resistance, stroke-work loss (SWL), and dobutamine-induced increase in area for predicting 1) symptomatic status at entry, 2) early (≤ 3 months) cardiovascular death or aortic valve replacement, and 3) long-term outcome. Logistic regression and Cox models were designed multivariate and adjusted by bootstrapping. ResultsOnly 28 % of patients were alive without valve replacement {{at the end of the}} follow-up period (22 ± 4 months). The decision for valve replacement was made by the referring physician, blinded to the SWL, <b>valve</b> <b>resistance,</b> and dobutamine results. Non–flow-corrected indices performed better than valve area and <b>valve</b> <b>resistance.</b> Among them, SWL best predicted the defined end points. Odds/hazard ratios associated with a SWL Δ = 17 % were 5. 14 for presenting AS symptoms, 4. 68 for early events, and 2. 31 for late outcome. A cutoff value of SWL > 25 % best discriminated clinical end points. Other independent predictors of prognosis were symptomatic status and left ventricular ejection fraction. Dobutamine testing added no value to baseline models. ConclusionsNon–flow-corrected indices show the highest clinical efficacy in aortic stenosis.

This {{approach is}} applied to the NIFTE, a novel low temperature difference heat utilization technology currently under development. Starting from a first-order linear dynamic model of the NIFTE that consists of a network of interconnected spatially lumped components, the effects of various component variables (geometric and other) on the thermodynamic efficiencies of the device are investigated parametrically. Critical components are highlighted that require careful design for the optimization of the device, namely the feedback valve, the power cylinder, the adiabatic volume and the thermal resistance in the heat exchangers.

The relationship between pressure and flow rate through the valve was determined from pressure measurements. The orifice discharge coefficient of the orifice was then calculated and the parameters of a variable resistor model were identified. Radiated sound pressure produced from the change in flow rate at the valve orifice was then compared to the original voice output to assess the accuracy of the design prototype. Results showed that the forced oscillating valve prosthesis model has lower power efficiency but can produce better sound quality than the electrolarynx...|$|R
40|$|An {{in-vitro}} (hydrodynamic) {{model of}} the circulatory system was developed. The model consisted of a pump, compliant tubing, and <b>valves</b> for <b>resistance.</b> The model is used to simulate aortic pressure and flow. These parameters were measured using a Konigsburg Pressure transducer and a Triton ART 2 flow probe. In addition, venous pressure and flow were measured on the downstream side of the resistance. The system has a known compliance and resistance. Steady and pulsatile flow tests were conducted to determine {{the resistance of the}} model. A static compliance test was used to determine the compliance of the system. The aortic pressure and flow obtained from the hydrodynamic model will be used to test the accuracy of parameter estimation models such as the 2 -element and 4 -element Windkessel models and the 3 -element Westkessel model. Verifying analytical models used in determining total peripheral resistance (TPR) and systemic arterial compliance (SAC) is important because it provides insight into hemodynamic parameters that indicate baroreceptor responsiveness to situations such as changes in gravitational acceleration...|$|R
40|$|The present {{series of}} {{investigations}} {{was designed to}} supply information on in vivo pressureflow relationships and to analyse the incidence of regurgitation in different heart valve prostheses in the aortic position. Patients and methods: The study population comprised 185 patients with mechanical Björk-Shiley Monostrut prostheses, 54 patients with Biocor stented porcine bioprostheses, 50 patients with extended Biocor stentless bioprostheses and 59 patients with cryopreserved aortic homografts. Transvalvular pressure differences and volume flow estimates were derived noninvasively from Doppler measurement of blood velocity across the prosthesis and in the left ventricular outflow tract. Measurements were performed at rest and during supine symptom-limited bicycle exercise. Aortic regurgitation was evaluated semi-quantitatively using colour flow Doppler and continuous-wave Doppler. Patients were investigated after surgery, prior to hospital discharge (baseline) and approximately every year postoperatively. Results: Reference values for baseline Doppler echocardiographic variables for normally functioning prostheses in the aortic position were established. The newly-developed extended Biocor stentless bioprosthesis showed low pressure differences associated with a significant regression of left ventricular hypertrophy {{during the first six}} months after aortic valve replacement, and low incidence of aortic regurgitation. A decrease of 40 % in pressure differences from baseline to six-month examination was observed in patients with stentless prostheses, partly depending on different haemodynamic states of patients early after the operation. Subcoronarily implanted cryopreserved aortic homografts. demonstrated excellent haemodynamic performance with low pressure differences and large effective orifice areas. Timerelated increasing risk of progression of aortic regurgitation observed during follow-up justifies more frequent echocardiographic monitoring in patients with homograft valves, especially when aortic regurgitation is detected on baseline examination. Different types of prosthesis of similar size were compared at rest and during exercise. The lowest pressure differences and the largest effective orifice areas were demonstrated in homograft valves, followed by extended Biocor stentless bioprostheses. With a 65 - 70 % increase in cardiac output induced by exercise, pressure differences and <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> increased significantly while effective orifice area remained unchanged in all four prosthesis types studied. Doppler-derived haemodynamic variables can be obtained at rest and during supine symptom- limited exercise with low variability. The exercise performed in this study was interrupted at a high level of subjective exertion; thus the exercise pressure differences obtained are likely to represent maximal values for pressure differences occurring in the patients' daily activities. Conclusions: In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, Doppler echocardiography at rest provides basic information on prosthetic valve function. In addition, exercise Doppler echocardiography provides further valuable insight into valve haemodynamics during physiologically increased volume flow. These results can be obtained with low variability. The stentless porcine bioprostheses and cryopreserved aortic homograft valves exhibit low <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> to flow at rest and exercise, reflecting the low haemodynamic load imposed by these valves on the left ventricle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt was {{recently}} suggested that valvular resistance, {{defined as the}} pressure gradient/flow rate ratio, may better depict the hemodynamic impairment in aortic stenosis than does valve area. The relation between aortic <b>valve</b> <b>resistance</b> and left ventricular mechanics was studied with Doppler echocardiography in 13 patients (mean age 85 years) with severe aortic stenosis who underwent percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. The Doppler-estimated peak valvular resistance, defined as the ratio of peak transvalvular pressure gradient to peak valvular flow rate, decreased front 510 ± 190 dynes·s·cm− 5 before valvuloplasty to 300 ± 110 dynes·s·cm− 5 after the procedure (p = 0. 0001). There was a close linear relation between valvular resistance measured at catheterization and Doppler-derived peak valvular resistance (r = 0. 91). After valvuloplasty, left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 53 ± 13 % to 62 ± 11 % (p = 0. 0001). The percent increase in ejection fraction was linearly related to the percent decrease in end-systolic wall stress (r = 0. 56), which was in turn related to the percent decrease in peak valvular resistance (r = 0. 75). No such linear relation existed between the percent changes in valve area and those in end-systolic wall stress. In conclusion, hemodynamic improvement after valvuloplasty is {{more closely related to}} changes in valvular resistance than to changes in valvular area. It is suggested that valvular resistance can be estimated accurately by Doppler echocardiography with use of a simple method and should be a primary consideration in assessing the hemodynamics of aortic stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Impedance {{characteristics}} of hydraulic components have a signifcant efect on pressure ripple levels in hydraulic circuits. These pressure ripples lead to vibration of pipework and associatedfittings {{and are a}} source of unreliability and noise. This paper describes an experimental investigation of restrictor and flow control valves using a specially designed circuit. For a restrictor valve, {{it was found that the}} impedance characteristics were influenced by fluid compressibility, fluid inertia, valve vibration and downstream impedance effects. When these effects were taken into account, the valve could be modelled as a simple orijice. The impedance {{characteristics of}} a flow control valve were found to be more complex and wave propagation within the valve fluid passageway had a dominant effect on behaviour.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} current and {{magnetization}} fluctuations and dissipation in layered-ferromagnetic-normal-metal nanostructures is investigated. We use scattering theory and magnetoelectronic circuit theory to calculate charge and spin-current fluctuations. Via the spin-transfer torque, spin-current noise causes a significant enhancement of magnetization fluctuations. A special {{focus is on}} spin valves in {{which one of the}} ferromagnets is pinned. We find that the magnetization noise and damping are tensors that depend on the magnetic configuration. For symmetric spin valves in which both layers fluctuate, dynamic cross-talk between the layers becomes important, causing a possibly large difference in noise level between the parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations. Due to giant magnetoresistance (GMR), the magnetization fluctuations in spin <b>valves</b> induce <b>resistance</b> noise, which is identified as a prominent source of electric noise at relatively high current densities. The resistance noise is shown to vary considerably with the magnetic configuration, partly due to the dependence of the angular GMR. The contribution from spin-current fluctuations to the resistance noise is shown to be significant. Resistance noise is an experimentally accessible quantity that can be measured to verify our results. Kavli Institute of NanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|Strophomenid brachiopods {{have long}} been {{interpreted}} as ‘‘snowshoe’’ strategists, with their flattened concavoconvex <b>valves</b> providing <b>resistance</b> to foundering in very soft sediments. There has been a sharp difference of opinion in whether the shells were oriented with their convex or their concave surface {{in contact with the}} sediment. This study, along with independent evidence from sedimentology, ichnology, and morphology, indicates that the strophomenids lived with their shells concave down (convex up). Experiments indicate the force required to push shells into soft cohesive muds is much greater for the convex up than for the convex down orientation. Forces also increase with shell curvature. All measured forces greatly exceed estimates of the downward force exerted by the weight of the shell, indicating that foundering resistance {{may not have been the}} key functional requirement. Instead, a convex up orientation would have provided resistance to overturning in currents, in particular if the valves gaped widely. The ‘‘snowshoe’’ may not be the relevant paradigm for the shell morphology of these forms. An alternative is that they functioned more as a tip-resistant base, similar to those of garden umbrellas or stanchions...|$|R
