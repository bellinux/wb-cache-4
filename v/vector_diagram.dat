40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{usefulness}} and limitations of <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams,</b> consisting of lines with arrows representing variables, in statistical training. Nineteen undergraduates learned advanced level statistics either with <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> or in the conventional way and solved three problems. <b>Vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> sometimes helped the students understand descriptions in the text which were difficult in conventional explanations, but caused other difficulties. <b>Vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> were useful for solving one of the three problems, but not the other two. It is concluded that a property of diagrams or formulae can be a double-edged sword. Students who are majoring in psychology or other relevant disciplines have to study statistics. Despite substantial effort by teachers, understanding statistics is often difficult for many students. This paper reports the results of a practical experiment in which the students learned to employ either “vector diagrams” or a conventional formula-based approach to the basics of regression analysis. The students were then asked to solve three problems using the given technique they learned. Unlike many previous studies on using diagrams in educational settings, which focus only on the usefulness of diagrams, this study also investigates limitations of diagrams. Research on diagrammatic reasoning has found many “good ” properties of diagram...|$|R
40|$|In three {{different}} events (national climbing Championship, sport climbing world cup, and training session), one hold was instrumented with two 3 -D force transducers. Subsequently, the mechanical parameters of climbing were defined and analyzed, {{and the force}} <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> visualized for quantification of performance. The more experienced a climber is, the smaller the contact force, the shorter the contact time, the smaller the impulse, the better the smoothness factor, the higher the friction coefficient, the more continuous {{the movement of the}} center of pressure (in specific holds), and the smaller the Hausdorff dimension (less chaotic force time graph). The Hausdorff dimension correlates highly with all other parameters and with the appearance of the <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and is thus suited to serve as the most important performance parameter. Training improves the mechanical parameters. The measurement and analysis of mechanical parameters and their visualization in terms of force <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> are a useful tool for quantifying the performance of a climber on a specific instrumented hold...|$|R

40|$|Subject review Analyses of {{alternating}} {{electrical circuits}} {{in electrical engineering}} are usually based on assumption that currents and voltages are sinusoidal values. Such assumption allows analysis of electrical networks by symbolic mathematical calculation. It also allows the application of <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> in representing relationship of the analyzed electrical values. In practice, periodic non sinusoidal values are sometimes found. For solving such values symbolic mathematical calculation and <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> cannot be used. In this paper is shown how such non sinusoidal periodic values can be separated, by applying Fourier series, into infinite series which contains a constant term and infinitely many harmonic components. That way allows all the acquired knowledge and methods for solving sinusoidal periodic values to still be used...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes the {{development}} of dodecagonal (12 -sided) space <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> from cascaded H-Bridge inverters. As already reported in literatures, dodecagonal space <b>vector</b> <b>diagrams</b> have many advantages over conventional hexagonal ones.

In this paper, a new power circuit is proposed for generating multiple dodecagons in the space vector plane. It consists of two cascaded H-Bridge cells fed from asymmetric dc voltage sources. It is shown that, with proper PWM timing calculation and placement of active and zero vectors, a very high quality of sine-wave can be produced. At the same time, the switching frequency of individual cells can be reduced substantially. Detailed PWM analysis, one design example and an elaborate simulation study is presented to support the proposed idea...|$|R

Conservation of {{momentum}} applies to velocity terms, usually described in a two dimensional plane with a <b>vector</b> <b>diagram.</b> A vector representing velocity has both direction and magnitude. A requirement for determining conservation of momentum is that an inertial frame or frame of reference for the observer be fixed. Inertial frames are well defined for constant velocity and conservation of momentum holds for all such frames.
