40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to examine the rhetorical ways that <b>virtual</b> <b>assistants</b> {{perpetuate}} western (American) gender stereotypes with users. While other literature has studied gender stereotypes with online service chatbots, scholarly research related to <b>virtual</b> <b>assistants</b> on standalone devices (e. g. Siri, Cortana, Alexa) is lacking. To conduct this study, I have relied upon a combination of the theories of identification and gender performance theory to show how the <b>virtual</b> <b>assistants</b> enact gender with users. The findings of this analysis demonstrate that the <b>virtual</b> <b>assistants</b> easily enact harmful gender stereotypes because the <b>virtual</b> <b>assistants</b> are disembodied representations of femininity. As evidence, media reviewers of the technology hoping to demonstrate their abilities have used language to ask questions that would be inappropriate for face-to-face communication...|$|R
