40|$|Wild-type {{measles virus}} (MV) {{isolated}} from B 95 a cells has a restricted host cell specificity and hardly replicates in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas the laboratory strain Edmonston (Ed) replicates {{in a variety}} of <b>cell</b> types including <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> To investigate the role of H protein in the differential MV host cell specificity and cell fusion activity, H proteins of wild-type MV (IC-B) and Ed were coexpressed with the F protein in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> Cell-cell fusion occurred in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> when Ed H protein, but not IC-B H protein, was expressed. To analyze the role of H protein in the context of viral infection, a recombinant IC-B virus bearing Ed H protein (IC/Ed-H) and a recombinant Ed virus bearing IC-B H protein (Ed/IC-H) were generated from cloned cDNAs. IC/Ed-H replicated efficiently in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> and induced small syncytia in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating that Ed H protein conferred replication ability in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> on IC/Ed-H. On the other hand, Ed/IC-H also replicated well in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> and induced small syncytia, although parental Ed induced large syncytia in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicated that an MV protein(s) other than H protein was likely involved in determining cell fusion and host cell specificity of MV in the case of our recombinants. SLAM (CDw 150), a recently identified cellular receptor for wild-type MV, was not expressed in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> and a monoclonal antibody against CD 46, a cellular receptor for Ed, did not block replication or syncytium formation of Ed/IC-H in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> It is therefore suggested that Ed/IC-H entered <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> through another cellular receptor...|$|R
40|$|Mice were immunized with {{measles virus}} to {{determine}} whether an auto-anti-idiotypic antireceptor response could be generated as a probe for measles virus receptors. Mice initially responded to viral antigens (days 11 to 18) and subsequently developed antibodies to a putative measles virus receptor (peak at day 30 to 35) by three criteria: the sera (1) agglutinated erythrocytes which virus agglutinates, (2) reacted with <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> and (3) inhibited virus attachment to <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, select sera inhibited virus infection of <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> The cell-reactive activity was identified as immunoglobulin G antibody and was neutralized by sera reacting with virus (idiotype). The application of this anti-idiotypic antibody to identify measles virus-binding sites on <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> was revealed by the ability of sera to immunoprecipitate 20 - and 30. 5 -kilodalton proteins from metabolically labeled ([35 S]methionine) <b>Vero</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigated}} the replication kinetics {{of the four}} dengue virus serotypes (DEN- 1 to DEN- 4), including dengue virus type 4 (DEN- 4) recovered from an infectious cDNA clone, in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> and in MRC- 5 cells grown on Cytodex 1 microcarriers. DEN- 1 strain Hawaii, DEN- 2 strain NGC, DEN- 3 strain H- 87, and DEN- 4 strain H- 241, and DEN- 4 strain 814669 derived from cloned DNA, were used to infect <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> and MRC- 5 cells grown in serum-free or serum-containing microcarrier cultures. Serum-free and serum-containing cultures were found to yield comparable titers of these viruses. The cloned DNA-derived DEN- 4 started genetically more homogeneous was used to investigate the genetic stability of the virus propagated in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> and MRC- 5 cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the DEN- 4 propagated in MRC- 5 cells maintained a high genetic stability, compared to the virus propagated in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> Amino acid substitutions of Gly 104 Cys and Phe 108 Ile were detected at 70 %, 60 %, respectively, in the envelope (E) protein of DEN- 4 propagated in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas a single mutation of Glu 345 Lys was detected at 50 % in E of the virus propagated in MRC- 5 cells. Sequencing of multiple clones of three separate DNA fragments spanning 40 % of the genome also indicated that DEN- 4 propagated in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> contained a higher number of mutations than the virus growing in MRC- 5 <b>cells.</b> Although <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> yielded a peak virus titer approximately 1 to 17 folds higher than MRC- 5 cells, cloned DEN- 4 from MRC- 5 cells maintained a greater stability than the virus from <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> Serum-free microcarrier cultures of MRC- 5 cells offer a potentially valuable system for the large-scale production of live-attenuated DEN vaccines...|$|R

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that canine signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; {{also known as}} CD 150) acts as a cellular receptor for canine distemper virus (CDV). In this study, we established <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> stably expressing canine SLAM (<b>Vero.</b> DogSLAMtag <b>cells).</b> Viruses were isolated in <b>Vero.</b> DogSLAMtag <b>cells</b> one day after inoculation with spleen samples from five out of seven dogs with distemper. By contrast, virus isolation with reportedly sensitive marmoset B 95 a cells was only successful from three diseased animals at 7 to 10 days after inoculation, and no virus was recovered from any dogs when <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> were used for isolation. The CDV strain isolated in <b>Vero.</b> DogSLAMtag <b>cells</b> did not cause cytopathic effects in B 95 a and human SLAM-expressing <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> whereas the strain isolated in B 95 a cells from the same dog did so in canine or human SLAM-expressing <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> as well as B 95 a cells. There were two amino acid differences in the hemagglutinin sequence between these strains.

Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that glutamic acid to lysine substitution at position 530 of the hemagglutinin was required for the adaptation to the usage of marmoset SLAM.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} carried out to {{examine the effect of}} <b>vero</b> <b>cells</b> {{co-culture}} on developmental competence of immature oocytes. Materials and Methods: Bovine cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COCs) were matured in either presence or absence of <b>vero</b> <b>cells.</b> Matured oocytes were inseminated and cultured for up to nine days. Cleavage percentages were recorded on day two post insemination (pi). Embryos were evaluated on daily basis till 9 pi.

Results: The results indicated a significantl increase in the cleavage number in oocytes matured in the presence of <b>vero</b> <b>cells</b> than that of the control (86 % vs. 76 %). The percentages of advanced embryos appear to be greater on a daily basis in COCs matured in the presence of <b>vero</b> <b>cells</b> compared to those of the control.

Blastocysts derived from COCs matured in the presence of <b>vero</b> <b>cells</b> had a significantly higher number of inner cell mass, trophectoderm and total cell number in expanding/expand and hatching/hatched embryos in comparison to those of the control. Conclusion: Results confirm that co-culture of bovine COCs, during in vitro maturation,enhances the potential for cleavage and for producing blastocysts with higher quality...|$|R

40|$|A mutational {{and genetic}} {{analysis}} of the poliovirus protein 3 A {{has led to the}} identification of a single amino acid mutant virus with a restrictive phenotype to form plaques in <b>Vero</b> <b>cells.</b> This mutant (I 46 T 3 A) can be grown and amplified in HeLa cells, where virus replication takes place at wild-type levels. However, <b>Vero</b> <b>cells</b> infected with this virus cannot complete the growth cycle. I 46 T 3 A virus has a defect in the ability to kill <b>Vero</b> <b>cells,</b> as estimated by FACS analysis of propidium iodide uptake by dead cells.

The virus strain used was a field virus isolated from sick camels in eastern Sudan in 1992.
