INTRODUCTION: <b>Von</b> <b>Hippel-Lindau</b> (VHL) <b>disease</b> is a dominantly inherited condition associated with tumors in multiple organs, whose treatment requires heightened multidisciplinary teamwork. Therefore, a document summarizing all the pertinent knowledge is needed to enhance coordination of care. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic {{review of the literature}} from the Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central databases was performed. From 1970 to 2017, all articles meeting specific inclusion criteria were included by at least one specialist physician for each field. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 95 articles, mostly dealing with genetics or management of VHL associated tumors in one organ system. There were no papers discussing the manifestations of VHL altogether, which was the aim of our paper. CONCLUSIONS: VHL requires a multidisciplinary management to provide the highest quality of care.
