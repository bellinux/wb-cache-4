5|$|Whitefish and <b>vendace</b> are {{the most}} common fish species in Lake Inari, the latter having been accidentally naturalized. Lake trout can be caught in creeks. Other fish found in the park include Arctic char, grayling, pike, perch, burbot, three-spined stickleback, ninespine stickleback and minnow. Stocking with fish has {{resulted}} in the introduction of Atlantic salmon, <b>vendace</b> and lake trout.|$|E
25|$|The lakes of the Lake District support three {{rare and}} {{endangered}} species of fish: the <b>vendace,</b> {{which can be found}} only in Derwent Water and until 2008 in Bassenthwaite Lake. <b>Vendace</b> have struggled in recent years with naturally occurring algae becoming a threat and the lakes gradually getting warmer.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat was {{designed}} to Air Ministry Specification 5/24 for an RAF advanced trainer and Fleet Air Arm deck-landing trainer. It was specified that the aircraft should be readily convertible to a seaplane, again {{to be used as}} a trainer. The specification produced contracts for three machines, the Vickers <b>Vendace,</b> the Parnall Perch and the Sprat.|$|E
50|$|In October 1928, {{the three}} Bolivian <b>Vendaces</b> entered service with the Escuela Militar de Aviación. They {{experienced}} engine problems, blamed on dusty {{conditions in the}} Bolivian summer, but remained in service until 1933.|$|R
50|$|In the north, Mikołajskie Lake is {{connected}} with the Tałty Lake under the road bridge in Mikołajki. To one of the pillars of the bridge, on a spring, is chained the King of <b>Vendaces</b> (Fish King, in Polish: Król Sielaw, Rybi Król, legendary king of Masuria). In the south-east, Mikołajskie Lake {{is connected}} with the Śniardwy Lake by the Przeczka strait within Dybowski Róg and Popielski Róg. In the south-west, Mikołajskie Lake {{is connected with}} the Bełdany Lake. On the west bank extends the Pisz Forest.|$|R
25|$|In {{the open}} waters of Vänern, {{the most common}} fish is the smelt, {{dominating}} in the eastern Dalbosjön, where the average is 2,600 smelt per hectare. The second most common is the <b>vendace</b> (Coregonus albula), also most prominently in Dalbosjön, with 200–300 fish per hectare. The populations may vary greatly between years, depending on temperature, water level and quality.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat first flew at Blackburn's {{works at}} Brough Aerodrome, {{then went to}} Martlesham Heath for {{comparative}} trials {{with the other two}} contenders. In the end, though the <b>Vendace</b> was selected as the best aircraft for the specification, no orders were placed with any manufacturer because of economy cuts. The Sprat last appeared in public at the Hendon RAF display in July 1926.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vendace</b> {{have been}} moved to higher lakes {{on a number of}} {{occasions}} to preserve the species, notably in 2005 and 2011. The Lakes are also home to two other rare species: the schelly, which lives in Brothers Water, Haweswater, Red Tarn and Ullswater, and the Arctic charr, which can be found in Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Thirlmere, Wast Water, and Windermere.|$|E
25|$|The most commons {{species of}} fish in the river are Coregonus lavaretus, European perch and {{northern}} pike, all three which have been the basis for sustenance fishing. Less commons species include burbot, grayling and brown trout. Five thousand trouts are set out each year to sustain the population. Especially the lake Kaskamajärvi has a large trout population. The lower portion of the river previously had some Atlantic salmon, but these have all but disappeared since the hydroelectric stations were installed. Uncommon fish species include European river lamprey, three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback and common minnow. <b>Vendace</b> is an introduced species in Lake Inari and has spread to the reserve.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of non-native fish {{can lead to}} the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with ruffe. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of <b>vendace,</b> which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example roach, are only at risk for as little as three days.|$|E
500|$|The {{area has}} a short growing season, cold winters, little {{precipitation}} and poor soil quality {{created by the}} gneiss bedrock. Lake Inari has been affected by acid rain and loss of fish from the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants. The reserve is an important habitat of the brown bear and also has a large moose population; [...] reindeer husbandry is practiced by the Samis. Whitefish and <b>vendace</b> {{are the most common}} species of fish, the latter being an introduced species.|$|E
2500|$|Fish {{species of}} the gulf include Atlantic salmon, {{viviparous}} eelpout, gobies, belica, loach, European chub, minnow, silver bream, common dace, ruffe, Crucian carp, stickleback, European smelt, common rudd, brown trout, tench, pipefish, burbot, perch, gudgeon, lumpsucker, roach, lamprey, <b>vendace,</b> garfish, common whitefish, common bream, [...] zander, orfe, pike, spined loach, sprat, Baltic herring, sabre carp, common bleak, European eel and Atlantic cod. Commercial fishing is carried out in spring and autumn. Gray seal and ringed seal are met in the gulf, but the latter is very rare.|$|E
2500|$|The Perch {{made its}} first flight from Parnall's base at Yate on 10 December 1926. [...] The pilot was Frank Courtney, who had become their test pilot in 1925. [...] After test flying from Yate, the Perch went to the A at RAF Martlesham Heath on 5 April 1927, its {{designer}} Harold Bolas travelling as a passenger. [...] After contractor's trials there, it went on later that month to the MAEE at Felixstowe for sea trials. [...] At {{the end of the}} trials, the <b>Vendace</b> I was judged best to have met the specifications, but none of the competitors received a contract to build more.|$|E
2500|$|The cuisine of Aix-les-Bains {{is typical}} of Savoy, based on {{products}} of the local soil and mountain meadows, essentially the Bauges. In addition to its famous fondue, there is the pleasing main course of potato doughnuts, and also , péla, tartiflette, diots, polenta and [...] For dessert, there are bugnes, confiture de lait and blueberry pie. Aix tables feature Savoy cheeses such as Abondance, Beaufort, the , , , , Reblochon, Abbaye de Tamié, Tomme de Savoie and still many others. However, {{the presence of the}} Lac du Bourget, and the rivers such as the Tillet and the Sierroz, offer a variety of freshwater fish, to Aix cooks, which make up good number of local dishes. The local trout, Arctic char and the <b>vendace</b> are pleasing to eat. Also fishing and frying pike delights the taste buds of the inhabitants of Aix-les-Bains. The surrounding forests and mountains of average altitude, such as Mont Revard, offer very popular produce. There are fungi, for instance, and the reputation of , boletes of Revard, continues unabated. Several vineyards around the Aix-les-Bains commune produce wines used in many specialities, such as Savoy fondue, by the use of white wine. Thus, the vineyards of Saint-Innocent and of Saint-Baldoph are found near Aix-les-Bains, and the area generally enjoys most of the wines of Savoy.|$|E
60|$|Among the {{remarkable}} instances of limited distribution afforded by these fishes, {{we have the}} Loch Stennis trout confined to the little group of lakes in the mainland of Orkney, occupying altogether an area of about ten miles by three; the Welsh charr confined to the Llanberris lakes, about three miles in length; Gray's charr confined to Lough Melvin, about seven miles long; while the Loch Killin charr, known only from a small mountain lake in Inverness-shire, and the <b>vendace,</b> from the equally small lakes at Loch Maben in Scotland, are two examples of restricted distribution which can hardly be surpassed.|$|E
60|$|Exactly the {{opposite}} fate {{has happened to}} the eels. The salmonoids as a family are freshwater fish, and by far the greater number of kinds--trout, char, whitefish, grayling, pollan, <b>vendace,</b> gwyniad, and so forth--are inhabitants of lakes, steams, ponds, and rivers, only a very small number having taken permanently or temporarily to a marine residence. But the eels, as a family, are a saltwater group, most of their allies, like the congers and murænas, being exclusively confined to the sea, and only {{a very small number of}} aberrant types having ever taken to invading inland waters. If the life-history of the salmon, however, has given rise to as much controversy as the Mar peerage, the life-history of the eel is a complete mystery. To begin with, nobody has ever so much as distinguished between male and female eels; except microscopically, eels have never been seen in the act of spawning, nor observed anywhere with mature eggs. The ova themselves are wholly unknown: the mode of their production is a dead secret. All we know is this: that eels never reproduce in fresh water; that a certain number of adults descend the rivers to the sea, irregularly, during the winter months; and that some of these must presumably spawn with the utmost circumspection in brackish water or in the deep sea, for in the course of the summer myriads of young eels, commonly called grigs, and proverbial for their merriment, ascend the rivers in enormous bodies, and enter every smaller or larger tributary.|$|E

50|$|Within the <b>vendace,</b> taxonomic subdivisions {{have been}} {{suggested}} both on geographical grounds and between sympatric ecotypes.FishBase lists the British populations of <b>vendace</b> as a separate species, Coregonus vandesius, but this distinction is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vendace</b> is {{traditionally}} {{the most important}} target of freshwater fisheries in parts of Fennoscandia and Russia. <b>Vendace</b> roe is considered a delicacy, which has been granted a PDO status in the Swedish Bothnian Bay archipelago (Kalix löjrom).|$|E
50|$|Along {{the path}} by Castle Loch in Lochmaben {{there is a}} {{sculpture}} trail which is worth looking out for in its own right. However, look out for the sculpted seat with the fish {{on the back of}} it and the name <b>Vendace</b> carved into the wood above the fish. The <b>vendace</b> has been under serious threat of extinction in Britain and conservation bodies have been making considerable efforts to save the species. It is thought that the once thriving population of <b>vendace</b> in the Lochmaben lochs is now extinct. However, there is a thriving population of <b>vendace</b> in Loch Skeen in the Moffat hills close-by. They were introduced there as fry from Bassenthwaite Lake in the Lake District of England in 1997 and 1999 and so far this is a success story for conservation. Unfortunately the Bassenthwaite <b>vendace</b> are now thought to be extinct.|$|E
