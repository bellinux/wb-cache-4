During this period, the agricultural and ranching frontier in Antioquia expanded and Medellin, with a growing population, started to become a pole of economic development and the principal livestock market in Colombia. To assist this process, national, departmental, and municipal authorities regulated animal health, veterinary instruction, and encouraged the growth of the livestock industry. Primary sources, such as correspondence and official newspapers, show that the hygienist discourse was initiated by economic and political elites from Antioquia and that the sanitary problems regarding meat and milk were resolved in Medellin by having the city take over the companies charged with providing these foodstuffs...|$|R

40|$|In the Czech Republic, bovine {{tuberculosis}} in cattle was controlled in 1968. The last outbreak was diagnosed in cattle and domestic pigs in 1995. During the <b>veterinary</b> <b>hygiene</b> inspection of pigs slaughtered in slaughterhouses, however, tuberculous lesions {{were still being}} found above all {{in the head and}} intestinal lymph nodes. In the decade monitored a total of 45 873 318 pigs were slaughtered and examined according to <b>veterinary</b> <b>hygiene</b> standards. Apart from 1991, when results of tuberculous findings were not obtained, tuberculous lesions were found in 134 088 (0. 32 %) of the 41 458 565 pigs examined in the remaining nine years. During a detailed analysis of the pathological anatomical examination of 190 940 pigs slaughtered in one district, tuberculous lesions in lymph nodes were found in 4 107 (2. 2 %) pigs: mesenteric (65. 3 % pigs), submandibular (18. 6 % pigs), inguinal (0. 1 % pigs) and simultaneously intestinal and head lymph nodes (15. 9 % pigs). Miliary tuberculosis was found only in the parenchymatous organs of four (0. 1 %) pigs. The following financial losses resulted: 6 % for confiscating the head, intestines and stomach, and 22 to 24 % for assessing meat as conditionally edible after processing, i. e. intended only for heat-processed products. Mycobacteria were isolated from 7 246 (41. 8 %) pigs through the cultivation of tissue samples from 17 326 pigs. Mycobacterium bovis was detected in only five (0. 07 %) animals which originated from the last outbreak of {{bovine tuberculosis}} in cattle in the Czech Republic in 1995. M. avium complex (MAC) isolates came from 6 870 (94. 8 %) animals: 55. 7 % M. a. avium isolates were mainly of serotypes 2 and 3 and genotype IS 901 + and IS 1245 + and 39. 2 % M. a. hominissuis isolates were mainly of serotypes 4, 8 and 9 and genotype IS 901 - and IS 1245 +.

30|$|Disinfectants are {{chemicals}} that {{are able to}} reduce the amount of germs on objects to be disinfected. They are regulated mainly in the EU Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR) 528 / 2012 [1]. They are used in several sectors by professional and non-professional users. The BPR separates disinfectants in five product types (Annex V): human <b>hygiene,</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and algaecides not intended for direct application to humans or animals, <b>veterinary</b> <b>hygiene,</b> food and feed area and drinking water [1]. In the professional sector, the use of disinfectants is very important to avoid infections, e.g. in hospitals or the food industry. The use of disinfectants in private homes by non-professional users however is intensely debated amongst scientists: In Germany, it is widely accepted that disinfectants should only be used by private persons if there are medical indications [2]. These might be infectious diseases of family members or if people in need of care are living in the household. The limitation of uses is due to the fact that disinfectants do not only inherit benefits but also might pose risks to humans and the environment [2]. Studies show that the use of disinfectants is only significantly reducing bacterial contamination in households if users follow a strict cleaning protocol [3, 4]. In a setting where households were not informed how to use a disinfectant, the prevalence of bacterial contamination was not reduced [3]. A study on the effects of antibacterial products on infectious disease symptoms showed that using antibacterial products did not result in a reduction of the primarily viral infectious disease symptoms [5]. Reports of resistances are often accompanied by reports of wrong uses or insufficient cleaning [6]. This may also cause cross-resistances to antibiotics [7]. For example, it is under discussion whether a resistance to benzalkonium chloride, a disinfectant, might lead to a resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin [8]. For many disinfecting substances, data on possible cross-resistances is not available; and for this reason, it is unclear which active substances pose the highest risks of these cross-resistances [7]. However, quaternary ammonium compounds, biguanides (i.e. surface active agents) and phenolics are considered as high-risk biocides concerning resistance problems [7]. For several substances (isothiazolones, anilides, diamidines, inorganic acids and their esters, alcohols), little information is available on resistance or tolerance [7]. Due to ‘the nature of their interaction with the bacterial cell and their antimicrobial efficacy’ [7], the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) considers them as medium-risk biocides. Several disinfectants have irritating or sensitising properties. A study showed that concentrations of the sensitising substances CMI/MI, glutardialdehyde, formaldehyde and chloroacetamide in disinfectants are in the same order of magnitude that leads to sensitising effects in laboratory tests [9]. Risks for the human health were especially high for spray applications or the use of concentrates for the cleaning of surfaces [9]. Some disinfectants or their metabolites can reach the environment. For example, the metabolite of triclosan, methyl-triclosan, was detected in surface waters [10] and biota [11]. Triclosan is also used in cosmetic products and in these cases does not fall under the BPR. Especially disinfection-by-products (DBP) which result from the reaction of halogenated oxidising substances with organic matter might pose risks that we are not aware of at the moment [12].|$|R

Biocidal products marketed as insecticides {{are used in}} many different applications.

The emission scenarios of insecticides for manure storage systems and for stables are connected closely to those of <b>veterinary</b> <b>hygiene</b> biocidal products (the EU “product type 3 ”). For this product type and for veterinary medicinal products, several reports have been published already (Montfoort et al., 1996; Montforts, 1999; Van der Linden, 2000). In specific cases, there may be borderline cases with food and feeding area disinfectants (the EU “product type 4 ”), veterinary medicinal products (the EU “product type 3 ”) or wood preservatives (the EU “product type 8 ”). This can occur if a biocide is used for more than one purpose. This is, for example, the case when a biocide is often used as an insecticide in animal housings, as a preservative in feed (disinfectant) and as a medicinal product against external parasites for chickens. ...|$|R

The rate of Salmonella contamination was 29. 2 % for the cloacal swab, 40. 6 % for carcasses, 2. 9 % for rinse water, 80. 6 % for waste water, 30. 6 % for slaughter floor and 63. 9 % for tools. Among the isolates from the most noticeable contamination carcasses, it was important to note that there were present of 2 serotype (S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium) that belong to the high risk group of food poisoning, originated from poultry during slaughtering processes. The Salmonella isolates had the antimicrobial resistance properties to most common antimicrobials, readily spreading along with the poultry meat chain. Water source and waste were both the highest risk factors leading to the Salmonella contamination for carcasses. There were two main recommendations to improve the hygiene condition at the time being, which were (i) to make awareness of high risk of bacterial contamination to the owners and butchers, (ii) improve the quality of water source as well as the waste treatment...|$|R

The regional trade implications of Russia’s membership of the World Trade Organisation and of the Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan, will also be considered. Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus would benefit from the harmonisation of sanitary and phytosanitary as well as technical barriers to trade measures and a lot of work in that respect has been done during the past few years. However, all three countries still use the system of state mandatory standards (the so-called “GOST” – to use the Russian abbreviation) and transition to international standards would facilitate trade and increase private sector participation. The impressive recovery of production in Russia is notable, {{but at the same time}} further growth depends increasingly on product safety, quality and diversification of production. It is evident that the traditional approach to risk management and “GOST”-based systems (including sanitary regulations or “SanPin” from the Russian for “sanitary rules”) of the Russian Federation impose serious constraints on the competitiveness of production as matters regarding food safety, animal and plant health outcomes are not satisfactory. Consequently, sanitary and phytosanitary measures not based on risk assessment and science may become barriers to trade, as is illustrated by the case studies on the fisheries sector presented here. status: publishe...|$|R

Thus, in the frame of the review process, the risk assessment of each active substance plays a fundamental role and providing technical guidance to the assessments that must be performed ensures a correct and uniform implementation of the Directive for the different Member States. According to Annex VI of Directive 98 / 8 /EC the risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product together with a ‘realistic worst case scenario’. The aim of this Emission Scenario Document (ESD) is to set up methods for the estimation of the emission of disinfectants, used for the disinfection of vehicles used for animal transport, for <b>veterinary</b> <b>hygiene</b> and in hatcheries. 	 The present ESD is intended to be used by Member States as a basis for assessing applications submitted with a view to include existing active substances used in PT 3 in Annex I or IA of Directive 98 / 8 /EC or for assessing applications for product authorisation.
