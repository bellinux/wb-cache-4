5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand years past lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E

Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{efforts and}} fervor of the {{erstwhile}} Anti-colonial {{leader of the}} Dervish state of Somalia, who {{by the time of}} his death had reclaimed and united large swathes of the lands historically territorial to the Somali peoples, to this day inspires and mobilizes the autochthonous peoples of Somalia to form a consolidated bulwark against imperialism (namely that of Ethiopia) as captured in the struggles of the Islamic Courts Union, the Ogaden National Liberation Front, and the former Western Somali Liberation Front. Hassan has thus become more than just a token of pride for the various sectional groups in Somalia, but has also been seen by some as icon of Pan-Somalism, at times even distinguished as one of the great revolutionaries of the turn of the 20th century by notable Pan-Africanist movements, who led the Senussid resistance against the Italians. Hassan's reputation thus transcends the very borders he sought to liberate from foreign rule and domination, the <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of the Pan-Africanist movement.|$|E

However, with each passing year, {{the images of the}} lead men become farther removed from their original humanity. From Converse to cake, this book examines how their 'brands' lend credibility to commerce, while the increasing worth placed on the singers provides a modern example of a secular belief system propelled by media, technology and the value of immediacy in the 2. 0 world. Journeys to spaces and places associated with the two singers are akin to pilgrimages, sacred trips that hope to capture and connect with the <b>very</b> <b>essences</b> that the men have been stripped of in their ever-widening appeal. Within this context, Curtis and Cobain become guides and anglicised role models in the search for personal identity and community in the modern, uncertain world...|$|R

25|$|The {{structure}} of the three realms follows a common numerical pattern of 9 plus 1, {{for a total of}} 10: 9 circles of the Inferno, followed by Lucifer contained at its bottom; 9 rings of Mount Purgatory, followed by the Garden of Eden crowning its summit; and the 9 celestial bodies of Paradiso, followed by the Empyrean containing the <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of God. Within each group of 9, 7 elements correspond to a specific moral scheme, subdivided into three subcategories, while 2 others of greater particularity are added to total nine. For example, the seven deadly sins of the Catholic Church that are cleansed in Purgatory are joined by special realms for the Late repentant and the excommunicated by the church. The core seven sins within Purgatory correspond to a moral scheme of love perverted, subdivided into three groups corresponding to excessive love (Lust, Gluttony, Greed), deficient love (Sloth), and malicious love (Wrath, Envy, Pride).|$|E
25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E

[...] Among the lighter pieces, one of the composer's most popular songs is a setting of Les Chemins de l'amour for Jean Anouilh's 1940 play as a Parisian waltz; by contrast his [...] "monologue" [...] "La Dame de Monte Carlo", (1961) a depiction of an elderly woman addicted to gambling, shows the composer's painful understanding of the horrors of depression.|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky {{worked through}} the winter of 1909–10, in close {{association}} with Fokine who was choreographing The Firebird. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand, Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>essence</b> of a great personality". The Firebird was premiered on 25 June 1910, with Tamara Karsavina in the main role, and was a great public success.
