40|$|Broadband Access Networks (ANs) is a {{field of}} major {{activity}} in telecommunications technology. The V-B 5 interface was introduced to support interconnection between these ANs and Service Nodes (SNs) that may be operated by different providers. The first version of V-B 5 was V-B 5. 1, which provided static (provisioned) resource allocation in the AN. However, {{the need for more}} effective resource allocation became more and more demanding. The evolution of the V-B 5. 1 to the V-B 5. 2 was mainly a result of the Broadband Bearer Connection Control Protocol (B-BCCP). This protocol allows dynamic (on-demand) point-to-point or point-to-multipoint bearer connection establishment, modification and release at <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>level,</b> under the control of SN. Implementation and simulation were performed to evaluate the performance of the B-BCCP and to establish the guidelines for its development. Various architectures of this system were examined and the results were compared and commended in this paper. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the use of}} slow-silent <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to reduce the switching power of on-chip networks while keeping the leakage power small. Adding <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to a network improves the throughput until each link bandwidth is saturated. This enables us to reduce the switching power of on-chip networks by decreasing their operating frequency and supply voltage. However, adding <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> increases the leakage power of routers {{as well as the}} area due to their large buffers; so the runtime power gating is applied to individual <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to eliminate this problem. We evaluate the performance of slow-silent <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> by using real application traces, and their power consumption (switching and leakage) is evaluated based on the detailed design of a virtual-channel router placed and routed with a 90 nm technology. These evaluation results show that a network with three or four <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> achieves the best energy efficiency in a uniform traffic. In the cases of neighboring communications, a network with two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> is better than the other networks with more <b>virtual</b> <b>channels,</b> because the performance improvement from no <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> to two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> is the largest and their frequency and supply voltage can also be reduced well in these cases. ...|$|R

The physical priority {{is composed of}} the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> (VC) identifier bit, the Priority bits, and the Critical Request Flow (CRF) bit. The VC bit determines if the Priority and CRF bits identify a <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> from 1 to 8, or are used as the priority within <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> 0. <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channels</b> are assigned guaranteed minimum bandwidths. Within <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> 0, packets of higher priority can pass packets of lower priority.

XETV became the only channel 6 in Mexico, because the IFT reserved channel 6 for a potential fourth national network. <b>Virtual</b> <b>channel</b> 5 is not available to XETV because of signal overlap between XETV and KTLA (owned by Tribune, and broadcasting on <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> 5), primarily around Oceanside, California; most Tijuana stations face similar signal overlap issues in this area to Los Angeles stations that preclude them from using the <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> that correspond to their networks.|$|R

40|$|Multiple <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} and implemented as a powerful mechanism for obtaining high performance in modern interconnection networks. However, the effective use of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> in distributed shared memory (DSM) systems is non-trivial. In this paper we present two simple techniques for exploiting the promising performance benefit of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> in DSM systems. First, we propose to use unequal number of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> in the request and reply networks to harness performance benefit from the inherent unbalanced traffic in DSM systems. Next, we apply the <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> mechanism to injection and consumption channels to alleviate the performance bottleneck at the network interface.

40|$|Existing MAC {{protocols}} for wireless LANs employ CSMA/CA that avoids collisions by {{preserving the}} wireless medium exclusively within 2 -hop network. This medium reservation obstructs neighboring nodes at both sides from concurrent transmission. This problem reduces medium utilization and overall throughput in Wireless LANs. In this work, we offer parallel data transfers using concurrent <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> over same physical channel by distributed transmit/receive synchronization. Each <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> {{is used by}} a transmitter/receiver pair and all <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> within 2 -hop network utilize the medium and avoid inter <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> interference. This <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> based protocol eliminates the exclusive medium reservation and improves the performance in terms of latency and overall network throughput. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> {{required}} for deadlock-free routing {{is important for}} cost-effective and high-performance system design. The planar adaptive routing scheme is an effective deadlock avoidance technique using only three <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> for each physical channel in 3 D or higher dimensional mesh networks with a very simple deadlock avoidance scheme. However, there exist one idle <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> for all physical channels along the first dimension and two idle <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> for channels along the last dimension in a mesh network based on the planar adaptive routing algorithm. A new deadlock avoidance technique is proposed for 3 D meshes using only two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> by {{making full use of}} the idle channels. The deadlock-free adaptive routing scheme is then modified to a deadlock-free adaptive fault-tolerant routing scheme based on a planar network (PN) fault model. The proposed deadlock-free adaptive routing scheme is also extended to n-dimensional meshes still using two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels.</b> Sufficient simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multichannel {{solutions}} are increasingly used {{to cope with}} the problem of low capacity in sensor networks resulting from high contention during wake-up periods of nodes. We can consider wake-up schedules as <b>virtual</b> <b>channels,</b> because nodes using different schedules cannot communicate with each other.

40|$|In our {{previous}} work, a Multi-Path Routing (MPR) scheme was proposed {{to maximize the}} data throughput for torus-based NoCs by utilizing multiple paths for concurrent data transmission. In this paper, a deadlock-free <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> model is proposed for the MPR scheme. In this <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> model, every physical channel on the network is split into about 3. 5 <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> on average. It is proved that any minimal routing algorithm (including the MPR scheme) using this model is deadlock-free. The MPR scheme employing this new <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> model is still a fully adaptive one. The performance of the MPR scheme using the proposed <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> model is evaluated through simulations and compared with the fully adaptive Single-Path minimal Routing (SPR) scheme with the same <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> model.

40|$|Abstract—Simultaneous {{electrical}} stimulation of neighboring electrodes in cochlear prosthesis systems generates channel interaction. However, intermediate <b>channels,</b> or <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> between the neighboring electrodes {{can be created}} through controlled channel interaction. This effect may be exploited for sending new information to the hearing nerves by stimulating in a suitable manner. The actual stimulation sites are therefore {{not limited to the}} number of electrodes. Clinical experiments, however, show that <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> are not always perceived. In this paper, electrical simulation with finite element analysis on a half turn human cochlea model is adopted to model the <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> effect, and the conditions for generating <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> are discussed. Five input current ratios (100 / 0, 70 / 30, 50 / 50, 30 / 70, 0 / 100) are applied to generate <b>virtual</b> <b>channels.</b> Three electrode arrays parameters are taken into consideration: distance between electrode contact and modiolus, spacing between adjacent electrode contacts and scale of electrode contact size.

Among these standards, TM Space Data Link protocol is a data communication and transmission protocol, which is mainly used in packet telemetry system to transmit packet telemetry data from space to ground[3][4]. In order to better transmit those information, <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> scheduling mechanism is widely used in packet telemetry system. <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channels</b> are a group of logic channels formed by dividing the physical channel by time slots.
