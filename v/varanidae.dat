25|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} {{has been}} identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a unisexual diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta). In captivity, Komodo dragons (<b>Varanidae)</b> have reproduced by parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} than 700 species of lizards in Australia with representatives of five families. There are over 130 species in 20 genera of gecko found {{throughout}} the Australian continent. The Pygopodidae is a family of limbless lizards endemic to the Australian region; all 39 species from seven genera occur in Australia. The Agamidae or dragon lizards are represented by 70 species in 14 genera, including the thorny devil, bearded dragon and frill-necked lizard. There are 30 species of monitor lizard, family <b>Varanidae,</b> in Australia, where they {{are commonly known as}} goannas. The largest Australian monitor is the perentie, which can reach up to 2m in length. There are about 450 species of skink from more than 40 genera, comprising more than 50% of the total Australian lizard fauna; this group includes the blue-tongued lizards.|$|E
2500|$|Biliverdin is {{also present}} in the green blood, muscles, bones, and mucosal lining of skinks of the genus Prasinohaema, found in New Guinea, and {{in a number of}} other reptiles, in {{particular}} arboreal snakes, and members of the <b>Varanidae.</b> It is uncertain whether this presence of biliverdin is an ecological or physiological adaptation of any kind, but green blood that gives terrestrial animals a green color seems to occur nearly exclusively in species that inhabit green vegetation, which is highly suggestive at the least. [...] It has been suggested that accumulation of biliverdin might deter harmful infection by Plasmodium malaria parasites, though no statistically significant correlation has been established. The Cambodian frog, Chiromantis samkosensis also exhibits this character along with turquoise bones.|$|E
2500|$|As for {{the types}} of pollinators, reptile pollinators are known, but they form a {{minority}} in most ecological situations. They are most frequent and most ecologically significant in island systems, where insect and sometimes also bird populations may be unstable and less species-rich. Adaptation {{to a lack of}} animal food and of predation pressure, might therefore favour reptiles becoming more herbivorous and more inclined to feed on pollen and nectar. Most species of lizards in the families that seem to be significant in pollination seem to carry pollen only incidentally, especially the larger species such as <b>Varanidae</b> [...] and Iguanidae, but especially several species of the Gekkonidae are active pollinators, and so is at least one species of the Lacertidae, Podarcis lilfordi, which pollinates various species, but in particular is the major pollinator of Euphorbia dendroides on various Mediterranean islands.|$|E
50|$|Lee (1997) {{created a}} {{different}} definition of <b>Varanidae,</b> defining {{it as the}} clade containing Varanus and all taxa {{more closely related to}} Varanus than to Lanthanotus; this definition explicitly excludes the earless monitor lizard from <b>Varanidae.</b> Whether Lanthanotus borneensis is included in or excluded from <b>Varanidae</b> depends on the author: for example, Vidal et al. (2012) classify the earless monitor lizard {{as a member of a}} separate family Lanthanotidae, while Gauthier et al. (2012) classify it as a member of <b>Varanidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Varanidae</b> {{was defined}} by Estes, de Queiroz and Gauthier (1988) as the clade {{containing}} the most recent common ancestor of Lanthanotus and Varanus {{and all of its}} descendants. A similar definition was formulated by Conrad et al. (2008), who defined <b>Varanidae</b> as the clade containing Varanus varius, Lanthanotus borneensis, and all descendants of their last common ancestor. Using one of these definitions leads to the inclusion of the earless monitor lizard (Lanthanotus borneensis) in the family <b>Varanidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|Palaeosaniwa is {{a member}} of the Platynota, a group that {{includes}} the monitor lizards (<b>Varanidae)</b> and Gila monsters (Helodermatidae). Originally, it was thought to be a member of the <b>Varanidae,</b> but has also been interpreted as a relative of the Helodermatidae. The most recent analysis places Palaeosaniwa outside of either <b>Varanidae</b> or Helodermatidae, as a stem member of the Varanoidea. Its precise affinities remain poorly understood, but it may be related to other Late Cretaceous, North American carnivorous lizards such as Parasaniwa, Paraderma, Labrodioctes, and Cemeterius.|$|E

50|$|Aiolosaurus was {{initially}} {{classified as a}} basal member of Varanoidea, the superfamily that includes monitor lizards, helodermatids, and mosasaurs. Cherminotus, another Late Cretaceous varanoid from Mongolia, was also classified in this way. In a 2008 phylogenetic analysis, Aiolosaurus was classified {{as a member of}} <b>Varanidae.</b> It was placed in the subfamily Lanthanotinae along with Cherminotus and the living Earless monitor lizard. Another 2008 analysis supported the placement of Aiolosaurus in <b>Varanidae</b> but did not find it {{to be a member of}} Lanthanotinae. Instead, it was found to be a more basal varanid. As some of the earliest monitor lizards, Aiolosaurus, Cherminotus, and the related Ovoo are representative of the first evolutionary radiation of varanids.|$|E
50|$|The Hamersley Range rock monitor (Varanus hamersleyensis) is a dwarf {{member of}} the <b>Varanidae</b> family.

50|$|Varanoidea is a {{superfamily}} of lizards, {{including the}} well-known family <b>Varanidae</b> (the monitors or goanna). Also {{included in the}} Varanoidea are such extinct marine and semi-aquatic forms as mosasaurs and dolichosaurus, the venomous helodermatids (Gila monsters and beaded lizards), the Lanthanotidae (earless monitor lizards), and the extinct Necrosauridae.|$|E
50|$|Varanus kordensis, the Biak tree monitor, is {{a member}} of the <b>Varanidae</b> family found on Biak Island in Indonesia. It is also known as the Kordo tree monitor.

50|$|The black tree monitor or Beccari's monitor (Varanus beccarii) is a {{relatively}} small member of the <b>Varanidae</b> family, growing to about 90 - 120 cm in length. They inhabit the Aru Islands off New Guinea, living in an arboreal habitat. Their skin color is completely black, lending them their name.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to these}} recent studies {{investigating}} venom glands in squamates, lizards {{that were previously}} thought of as being nonvenomous are now being classified by some scientists as venomous because they possess a venom gland. This hypothetical clade, Toxicofera, includes all venomous squamates: the suborders Serpentes and Iguania and the families <b>Varanidae,</b> Anguidae, and Helodermatidae.|$|E
5000|$|Telmasaurus {{was first}} {{classified}} in the family <b>Varanidae,</b> making it a close relative of living monitor lizards. In a 1998 phylogenetic analysis, Telmasaurus {{was placed in a}} more basal position within Varanoidea. Under this placement, it was an intermediate form between helodermatids and the group containing monitor lizards and snakes. Below is a cladogram from the 1998 anaylis: ...|$|E
5000|$|The earless monitor lizard was {{described}} in 1878 by Franz Steindachner. The genus name Lanthanotus means [...] "hidden ear" [...] and the species name borneensis refers to its home island of Borneo. The uniqueness of the species was recognized from the start and Steindachner placed it in its own family, Lanthanotidae. In 1899 George Albert Boulenger relegated it to the family Helodermatidae, together with the beaded lizards and gila monster. Further studies were conduced in the 1950s where {{it was found that}} although it is related to Helodermatidae, this relationship is relatively distant, the similarity is in part the result of convergent evolution and they should be recognized as separate families. Both are part of a broader Anguimorpha, but the relationship among the various families has been a matter of dispute. Several earlier studies have placed the earless monitor lizard together with Helodermatidae and <b>Varanidae</b> (true monitor lizards) in Varanoidea. More recent genetic evidence has found that the nearest relative of the earless monitor lizard is <b>Varanidae.</b> Most authorities continue to recognize them as separate families as the divergence between them is deep, but some have suggested that the earless monitor lizard should be included as a subfamily, Lanthanotinae, of the <b>Varanidae.</b> Together they form a clade and its sister group is Shinisauridae; at a higher level the sister groups of these three are Helodermatidae and others families in Anguimorpha. The most recent common ancestor diverged in the mid-Cretaceous.|$|E
50|$|The Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus) {{is a large}} {{member of}} the monitor lizard family (<b>Varanidae)</b> found {{throughout}} much of Africa, but is absent from the west, where it is replaced by Varanus stellatus. Other common names include the African small-grain lizard, water leguaan or river leguaan (leguan, leguaan, and likkewaan mean monitor lizard in South African English, {{and can be used}} interchangeably).|$|E
50|$|The family <b>Varanidae</b> {{probably}} {{originated in}} Asia at least 65 million years ago, although some estimates are {{as early as}} the late Mesozoic (112 million years ago). Monitor lizards probably expanded their geographic range into Africa between 49 and 33 million years ago, possibly via Iran, and to Australia and the Indonesian archipelago between 39 and 26 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Femoral {{pores are}} present in all genera in the {{families}} Cordylidae, Crotaphytidae, Hoplocercidae, Iguanidae, Phrynosomatidae, and Xantusiidae. [...] They are absent in all genera in the Anguidae, Chamaeleonidae, Dibamidae, Helodermatidae, Scincidae, Xenosauridae, and <b>Varanidae</b> families. [...] They {{are present in}} other lizards and amphisbaenians quite variably, some geckoes, Phelsuma, for example have these pores, others {{in the same family}} do not.|$|E
5000|$|Ovoo {{is one of}} many Late Cretaceous lizards {{belonging}} to a group called Varanoidea, which includes the living monitor and helodermatid lizards and the extinct mosasaurs. Features linking it with these lizards include a rounded snout and a lack of contact between the maxillae and frontal bones. A phylogenetic analysis conducted with its first description placed it within the monitor subfamily Varaninae. Ovoo is the oldest known member of Varaninae. Of the other Mongolian varanoids, Aiolosaurus was placed as a basal member of <b>Varanidae</b> (the family to which Varaninae belongs) and Cherminotus was placed in Lanthanotinae (another subfamily within <b>Varanidae).</b> Because of their age, Ovoo, Aiolosaurus, and Cherminotus may be representatives of the first radiation of monitor lizards. The Late Cretaceous varanoids Saniwides and Telmasaurus are just as old as these lizards and have traditionally been viewed as the oldest monitors, but they were placed outside the monitor family in the 2008 analysis. Below is a cladogram from the analysis: ...|$|E
50|$|Lizards are {{the most}} common reptile in Qatar. There are more than 21 species of lizards, with the most common family being Gekkonidae (9 species).

50|$|In the description, Estesia was {{assigned}} to Varanoidea, as the sister group to <b>Varanidae,</b> based on skull characters. However, the new material found in 1993 provided evidence that Estesia was not closely related to modern varanids, but rather a distant relative of Gila monsters. The phylogenetic analysis presented by Norell and Gao (1997) actually supported {{the creation of a}} new group that included modern Gila monsters and extinct pre-historic forms, the Monstersauria.|$|E
