40|$|A new {{miniature}} hydro-energy generator for harnessing {{energy from}} Kàrmàn vortex street behind a bluff {{body in a}} water flow is developed. The flow energy is converted into electrical energy by an assembly of a cantilevered piezoelectric beam and a flexible diaphragm. An analytical model for the energy harvester is developed. Prototypes of the energy generator are fabricated and tested. Experimental results show that an open-circuit output <b>votage</b> of 120 mVpp and an instantaneous output power of 0. 7 nW are generated when the pressure oscillates with an amplitude of nearly 0. 3 kPa and a frequency of about 52 Hz...|$|E

The proposed rail-to-rail folded cascaded single stage OPA is design and implemented using the TSMC 0. 35 μm CMOS 2 P 4 M process. Based on simulated and measured results, the chip size is 2534. 0740. 0 mm × with power dissipation about 1. 6 mW, input common mode <b>votage</b> range from 0 V to 3. 3 V, maximum DC gain 82 dB, 114 dB CMRR and 86 dB PSRR...|$|E
40|$|In the {{persistent}} photoconductivity (PPC) phenomenon, illumination of a YBCO thin film junction with a 1 mW He-Ne laser {{leads to the}} decrease of the critical critical voltage (similar to the threshold voltage). The decrease of the critical <b>votage</b> was reversed by illumination with incadenscent light. The critical voltage across the junction was experimentally decreased and increased by alternating illumination between He-Ne laser and incandescent light. We also observed visible quenching of the photo-induced state using a 5 mW He-Ne laser. Finally, the threshold behavior of the junction was destroyed by illuminating it with incadenscent light.

40|$|The passive matrix {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} (LCDs), multiplexing {{is achieved by}} using the intrinsic non-linear characteristics of the liquid-crystal material. If the electro-optic charateristic is steeper than necessary for the matrix display, the selection ratio need not be maximized. Instead, the selection ratio {{can be reduced to}} match the electro-optic characteristics of the display. This leads to the reduction in the supply voltage of the drive electronics. We have considered the possibility of using addressing techniques with low hardware complexity along with dispalys having steep electro-opticcharacteristics. Supply voltage for these techniques are compared with that of multi-line addressing (MLA). The supply <b>votages</b> of the Hybrid Addressing Technique (HAT), Improved Hybrid Addressing Technique- 53 (IHAT- 53), and Improved Hybrid Addressing Technique-S 4 (IHAT-S 4) are lower than that of MLA for the lower range of N. These hybrid addressing techniques with lower hardware complexity are a better choice for driving passive-matrix LCDs, especially in portable equipment...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{transport}} {{through a}} double Aharonov-Bohm-interferometer {{in the presence}} of Andreev reflection is investigated in terms of the nonequilibrium Green function method with which the reflection current is obtained. Tunable Andreev reflection probabilities depending on the interdot coupling strength and magnetic flux as well are analysised in detail. It is found that the oscillation period of the reflection probability with respect to the magnetic flux for the double interferometer depends linearly on the ratio of two parts magnetic fluxes n, i. e. 2 (n+ 1) pi, while that of a single interferometer is 2 pi. The coupling strength not only affects the height and the linewidth of Andreev reflection current peaks vs gate <b>votage</b> but also shifts the peak positions. It is furthermore demonstrated that the Andreev reflection current peaks can be tuned by the magnetic fluxes. Comment: 13 pages, 12 figur...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} TiO 2 {{nanotube}} arrays were fabricated by anodic oxidation method in different electrolyte solution. The morphology {{of the film}} and {{the diameter of the}} nanotubes were observed by scanning electronic microscope (SEM). The crystal type of the film before and after heattreatment were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Laser Raman. The results show that the electrolyte solution and applied <b>votage</b> have great effect on microstructure of the films. High order-aligned TiO 2 nanotube arrays of 110 nm in outer diameter are prepared at 20 V in the 0. 24 wt% HF aqueous solution. Films of nanotube arrays of 100 nm in outer diameter are prepared at 20 V in 0. 5 wt％NaF+ 2. 7 wt% Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution and 0. 88 wt% NH 4 F glycerol-water (vol ratio 1 ∶ 1) mixture solution. The outer diameter (d) of nanotubes increase linearly with applied voltage (U) in the range of 0 - 25 V which can be described as d=k×U+b with k= 5. 2 nm/V and b= 2. 2 nm. TiO 2 nanotube arrays with amorphous structure is transformed to anatase after annealed at 450 ℃ for 2 h...|$|E
40|$|The {{deleterious}} effects of spacecraft charging are well known, {{particularly when the}} charging leads to arc events. The damage that results from arcing can severely reduce system lifetime and even cause critical system failures. On a primary spacecraft system such as a solar array, {{there is very little}} tolerance for arcing. Motivated by these concerns, an experimental investigation was undertaken to determine arc thresholds for a high voltage (200 - 500 V) solar array in a plasma environment. The investigation was in support of a NASA program to develop a Direct Drive Hall-Effect Thruster (112 HET) system. By directly coupling the solar array to a Hall-effect thruster, the D 2 HET program seeks to reduce mass, cost and complexity commonly associated with the power processing in conventional power systems. In the investigation, multiple solar array technologies and configurations were tested. The cell samples were biased to a negative voltage, with an applied potential difference between them, to imitate possible scenarios in solar array strings that could lead to damaging arcs. The samples were tested in an environment that emulated a low-energy, HET-induced plasma. Short duration "trigger" arcs as well as long duration "sustained" arcs were generated. Typical current and voltage waveforms associated with the arc events are presented. Arc thresholds are also defined in terms of <b>vo!tage,</b> (current and power. The data will be used to propose a new, high-voltage (> 300 V) solar array design for which the likelihood of damage from arcing is minimal...|$|E
