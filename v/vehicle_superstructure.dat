5000|$|During the Battle of France, in May 1940 the swiftly deteriorating {{situation}} led to {{an order}} being issued to arm all available tracked chassis {{and send them to}} the front. This included the available FT-17 hulls from which the turret had been removed to turn them into utility vehicles, the Renault ZT 4s that had not yet received their turrets, and also the Renault UE Modèle 37s produced from that moment. On 25 May the Direction d'Infanterie requested that Renault produce a prototype on the lines of his Chinese UEs, with a machine-gun armed superstructure. Another existing 200 vehicles were to be refitted with a simpler external MAC 31 [...] "Reibel" [...] machine-gun mount.

40|$|Among {{environmental}} factors affecting railway infrastructure management {{that have to}} be taken into account at design level, vibrations play an important role. Because of dynamic interaction between <b>vehicle</b> and railway <b>superstructure</b> due to irregularities of surfaces coming to contact (wheel and rail) and to vehicle motion anomalies, a set of vibration type are generated propagating from superstructure through subgrade and surrounding soil up to ultimate receptors. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures prescribe quantitative and qualitative evaluation of vibration annoyance in these receptors, but, to date, few models available in literature allow an effective assessment of frequency content and very few of these have been experimentally validated. In the present paper a vibration level prediction model for a railway superstructure on an embankment has been developed. This model, that has been also validated through field test, can be effectively used to study construction solutions, within railway superstructure, aimed at mitigating vibration annoyance...|$|R

40|$|A waste {{container}} vehicle for waste glass, building rubble and houshold refuse containers etc. was developed under the research project. The noise emitted by this vehicle amounting to a {{sound intensity level}} of 99 dB (A) during operation (raising and depositing operations) is roughly 10 dB (A) lower than comparable conventional vehicles. This substantial reduction in noise required the following complementary measures: Use of a chassis which fulfils the criteria under paragraph 49 of the regulations authorising the use of vehicles for road traffic (StVZO) for low-noise trucks. Reduction in the operating speed of the engine while retaining the working speed and performance (depositing and raising operations). Provision of additional engine and gearbox surrounds. Use of low-noise-units - (ancillary drive, hydraulic pump, control valve) - and reduction in the operating speeds. Reduction in the noise transmission of the hydraulic system to the <b>vehicle</b> and <b>superstructure</b> through solid-borne sound insulation. Optimisation of the hock control to reduce the impact noises of the containers (control of the lifting speed). Special measures on vehicle and containers to prevent screeching noises (roller guidance with ball bearings and central lubrication). Special measures on containers (building rubble, household refuse and waste glass containers) to reduce the noise emission (sandwich design, rubber inlays, sound-absorbing mats). The noise emitted while the containers are being deposited and raised has been reduced so much with these measures that 100 of these vehicles {{would have to be}} operated simultaneously in order to generate the same sound level as one conventional vehicle. A characteristic feature of the overall concept is that only units and components readily available on the market were used and it is possible to transfer the measures implemented to other container vehicle designs. The noise reduction measures do not limit the operation reliability, possible applications and performance compared with conventional vehiclesSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 024) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the fall}} of France a number of S 35s (297 were {{captured}} according to some sources) were taken into service with the Wehrmacht as the Panzerkampfwagen 35-S 739(f). The Germans modified the cupola by cutting its top off and installing a simple hatch. On 10 December 1940 the first German tank unit equipped with French Beutepanzer was formed: 201. Panzerregiment with 118 tanks; 36 of these were S 35s, the rest [...] "38Hs". On 10 February 1941, 202. Panzerregiment was established; both regiments were united into Panzerbrigade 100. On 27 January the independent 301. Panzerabteilung was formed with French vehicles; total S 35 organic strength in the Wehrmacht was thus ninety. On 22 March this independent battalion replaced the Second Battalion of 201. Panzerregiment, which battalion was renamed Panzer-Abteilung 211 and sent to Finland in June, the only major German unit with S 35s that would fight on the Eastern Front; some were deployed by 22. Panzerdivision near Sevastopol in 1942. The 21st and 25. Panzerdivision in 1943 used some S 35s when reforming after having been largely destroyed. Some <b>vehicles</b> had their <b>superstructure</b> removed and were used for driver-training, while others were used for security duties. Some of these units fought in Normandy in 1944, such as 100. Panzer Ersatz und Ausbildungs-Abteilung and 206. Panzer-Abteilung, while others were used in Yugoslavia for anti-partisan duties (7. SS-Freiwilligen-Gebirgs-Division [...] "Prinz Eugen", 12. Panzer-Kompanie z.b.V. and I./Panzer-Regiment 202). There were still twelve S 35s listed as in German service on 30 December 1944.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays heavy {{vehicles}} constitute a considerable volume in the transportation flow on {{the territory of}} the Republic of Belarus and bridge inequalities significantly increase a load on their bearing elements and cause a vibration in bridge superstructures. This leads to rapid wear and reduction in time between bridge repairs. The given problem has been insufficiently studied and it is considered as an actual one. Revision of analytical models is required in order to make prediction and evaluation of bridge structure wear. These models must take into account a dynamic impact of {{heavy vehicles}} caused by their movement on bridge rough riding surface. The purpose of scientific investigations is to develop a dynamic interactional model of a vehicle and a bridge plate. The paper proposes such dynamic model that permits to investigate impact forces of a heavy <b>vehicle</b> on bridge <b>superstructures</b> which have been initiated by bridge traffic-way inequalities. Weight of an vehicle and plate, rigidity and viscous damping of vehicle suspensions, a plate and piers have been taken into account while making the required calculations. An analysis of free oscillatory motions of the plate and vehicle have been carried out with due account of viscous damping. A dynamic interactional calculation for a vehicle and a plate has been made in the paper. Character of plate oscillatory motions has been determined at various parameters of the dynamic model. In this case non-linearity of reinforced concrete plate deformation has been taken into account and its calculation has been executed in accordance with the norms of the Republic of Belarus. The calculations have made it possible to obtain dynamic interaction coefficients of front axle wheels and bridge plate at various bench heights and also investigate its influence on maximum bending moments in plate sections. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Grand Carnivals; carnivals {{during the}} Tang period were lively events, with great {{quantities}} of eating, drinking, street parades, and sideshow acts in tents. [...] Carnivals had no fixed dates or customs, but were merely celebrations bestowed by the emperor {{in the case}} of his generosity or special circumstances such as great military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, sacrifices to gods, or the granting of grand amnesties. This type of carnival as a nationwide tradition was established long before the Tang by Qin Shihuang in the 3rd century BC, upon his unification of China in 221. Between 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty nine different carnivals, seventeen of which were held under Empress Wu. These carnivals generally lasted 3 days, and sometimes five, seven, or nine days (using odd numbers due so that the number of days could correspond with beliefs in the cosmos). The carnival grounds were usually staged in the wide avenues of the city, and smaller parties in attendance in the open plazas of Buddhist monasteries. However, in 713, a carnival was held in the large avenue running east to west between the West Palace walls and the government compounds of the administrative city, an open space that was [...] long and [...] wide, and was more secure since the guard units of the city were placed nearby and could handle crowd control of trouble arose. Carnivals of the Tang Dynasty featured large passing wagons with high poles were acrobats would climb and perform stunts for crowds. Large floats during the Tang, on great four-wheeled wagons, rose as high as five stories, called 'mountain carts' or 'drought boats'. These <b>superstructure</b> <b>vehicles</b> were draped in silken flags and cloths, with bamboo and other wooden type frames, foreign musicians dressed in rich fabrics sitting on the top playing music, and the whole cart drawn by oxen that were covered in tiger skins and outfitted to look like rhinoceroses and elephants. An official in charge of the Music Bureau in the early 7th century set to the task of composing the official music that was to be played in the grand carnival of the year. On some occasions the emperor granted prizes to those carnival performers he deemed to outshine the rest with their talents.|$|R
40|$|Kontejnerska vozila predstavljaju novitet među vatrogasnim vozilima. Osnovna karakteristika ovih vozila je u tome da se vatrogasni kontejner postavlja na specijalno podvozje pomoću trajno ugrađenog hidrauličnog krana. Tako se vatrogascima omogućuje efikasna zašita ili gašenje požara sa samo jednim podvozjem i s nekoliko specijalnih kontejnera u vatrogasnoj postrojbi. Broj i vrsta kontejnera koji se mogu «navlačiti « na isto podvozje ograničeni su samo nosivošću podvozja i «navlakača», a određuju ih iskustvo stručnjaka postrojbe (sukladno procjeni ugroženosti od požara područja koje štiti postrojba) i vatrogasna znanja proizvođača. Kontejneri s opremom ili sredstvom za gašenje mogu biti trajno smješteni u postrojbi ili na mjestima očekivane vatrogasne intervencije. Također se mogu neposredno prije očekivane katastrofe premjestiti na poziciju koja vatrogascima najviše odgovara. Ovaj članak upravo predstavlja jednu takvu nadogradnju hrvatskog proizvođača vatrogasnih vozila ZIEGLER d. o. o. Hrvatska. Recently, roll on/off {{container}} vehicles {{have been}} increasingly included in firefighting vehicle manufacturing program given that they imply a new {{aspect of the}} vehicle design and construction. The basic feature of the roll on/off firefighting container vehicles distinguishing them from the standard firefighting vehicles is their mobile superstructure, which, according to its design and construction, is in short called ‘a container’. Therefore, the firefighting vehicle of this type basically includes a standard constructed truck chassis adequate capacity with loader crane for containers and a firefighter container. In relation to buyer’s demands, the container may incorporate different firefighting technical details, devices and equipment, thus determining each container’s technical and functional characteristics. Hence, depending on the equipment, roll on/off container vehicles {{may be used for}} both technical and firefighting interventions. Furthermore, the advantage of the roll on/off container vehicles over the standard firefighting vehicles is the chassis which can support a container of any type and purpose, so any firefighting intervention can be performed with only one chassis and several different containers. Roll on/off container vehicles are controlled by the German standard DIN 14505 : 2004 Fire fighting and rescue service vehicles - Vehicles for roller containers - General requirements. DIN 14530 - 21 : 2011 Firefighting vehicles - Part 21 : Pump water tanker TLF 4000 standard applies as well for the construction and design of roll on/off container <b>vehicles.</b> This container <b>superstructure</b> described herein is equipped with fire techniques and equipment with the sole purpose of fire extinguishing in refining plants. In addition this container with integrated water/foam monitor the kit included containers superstructure with foam pump and foam tank volume 15. 000 l. Bearing in mind special technical characteristics, the container of this vehicle includes fire techniques and equipment of higher technical quality than in most standard firefighting vehicles. Thus, there is strong Caterpillar diesel drive motor, designed for eternally operation, integrated in a separate, sound-insulated space of the container’s superstructure. This motor drives the KSB centrifugal pump flow 22. 500 l/min as well as the Edwards gear pump for foam agent. Foam agent dosage rate is proportional within the fixed water flow rate. Pipeline system is similar in design to the most firefighting vehicles and is equipped with ‘storz’ coupling adapters with female thread at the user endings. The coupling adapters are closed with sealed cap. Water/foam monitor of a special manufacturer Williams Ambasador is of high range and stream water and foam capacity. The article presents the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles for water and foam fire extinguishing in refining plants, which is designed by manufacturer ZIEGLER d. o. o. Croatia, Zagreb in cooperation with company TOTAL. At the moment of the release of this article, the container with monitor and other containers with foam agent tank are in finally phase of construction and are in start production. The vehicles are being constructed for TOTAL company from Netherlands, and will be delivered under the name as Roll on/off extinguishing container with monitor (SBH Unit) and Roll on/off foam container (SVH Unit). The entire design and construction of the vehicle with all technical characteristics are owned by ZIEGLER d. o. o. The author of the article presented the above mentioned firefighting vehicle {{for the sole purpose of}} introducing the operational technical characteristics and application of the roll on/off container vehicles in firefighting.
