40|$|Background: If {{the effects}} of {{alveolar}} recruitment are beneficial, but of short duration, repetitive recruitment maneuvers (RMs) {{will be necessary to}} maintain oxygenation. This study was performed to assess the effect of repetitive alveolar recruitment, with high-sustained inflation pressure on oxygenation and compliance of the respiratory system, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Methods: Ten adult patients on <b>ventilator</b> support, <b>with</b> <b>controlled</b> mechanical ventilation, received three repetitive RMs with a high-sustained inflation pressure. The time intervals from the first to second RM and from the second to third RM were 8. 42 ± 0. 56 hours and 12. 43 ± 1. 45 hours, respectively. Recruitment was conducted by setting the ventilator mode to a continuous positive airway pressure of 40 cmH 2 O for 40 seconds. After each alveolar recruitment, the previous ventilator settings in the pressure control mode were re-established with a high positive end expiratory pressure. The FIO 2, PaO 2 /FIO 2 and lung compliance (tidal volume/[plateau pressure- PEEP]) were recorded with reference to the arterial blood gas analysis at both 30 minutes pre and post recruitment. Results: The FIO 2 was able to be decreased from 0. 9 to 0. 5 while maintaining the PaO 2 at higher than 80 mmHg after three recruitments. The PaO 2 /FIO 2 improved from 98 to 288 and the compliance of the respiratory system improved from 26 to 41 ml/cmH 2 O after three recruitments.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Volume {{targeted}} pressure support ventilation (VT-PSV) is {{a hybrid}} mode increasingly used {{to maintain a}} minimal tidal volume (VT) by automatically adjusting the level of inspiratory pressure. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the ability of home ventilators to maintain the preset minimal VT during unintentional leaks in a VT-PSV mode. METHODS: Seven ventilators were tested on a lung bench with different circuit configurations and with different levels of unintentional leaks. Unintentional leaks were generated using calibrated holes. RESULTS: All the studied <b>ventilators</b> <b>with</b> a single-limb circuit with intentional leak (n =  5) were able to maintain the minimal preset VT during unintentional leaks.

Methods: The database was from the National Health Insurance hospital claims data in Taiwan from 2004 to 2009.

Mechanical ventilation (MV) weaning rate was 18. 25 %, intensive care unit (ICU) readmission rate was 5. 75 %, and ICU mortality rate was 74. 52 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ventilator exhalation-valve {{performance}} during the expiratory phase has been stud-ied in depth. An active exhalation valve uses servo-control technology that allows gas {{to be released}} from the exhalation valve during the inspiratory phase if the patient makes an expiratory effort. We con-ducted a bench study of active exhalation valve response to expiratory effort during the inspiratory phase. METHODS: We studied 4 ventilators that have active exhalation valves (Maquet Servo-i, New-port e 500, Puritan Bennett 840, and Evita XL) and one that does not (Puritan Bennett 7200 ae). With an active test lung we simulated various magnitudes of expiratory effort {{during the middle of the}} inspira-tory phase. We measured the exhalation resistance and pressure over-shoot during the expiratory effort, and we measured the pressure under-shoot after the expiratory effort. The exhalation resistance of the 7200 ae could not be determined because this ventilator did not allow any gas-release through the exhalation valve during the expiratory effort. RESULTS: The exhalation resistance of the Evita XL (6. 61. 8 cm H 2 O/L/s) was higher than that of the Servo-i (3. 01. 3 cm H 2 O/L/s), e 500 (2. 60. 8 cm H 2 O/ L/s), and 840 (3. 5 0. 8 cm H 2 O/L/s) (all P <. 001). The magnitude of pressure over-shoot during the expiratory efforts was not significantly different among the 4 <b>ventilators</b> <b>with</b> active exhalation valves. Pressure over-shoot was significantly higher with the 7200 ae than with any of other ventilators (all P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in exhalation resistance between the Evita XL and the other 3 <b>ventilators</b> <b>with</b> active exhalation valves.

We evaluated the feasibility and precision of an intensive care unit (ICU) <b>ventilator</b> <b>with</b> an in-built nitrogen washout/washin technique in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. Methods: Duplicate EELV measurements were performed in 30 patients between 5 kg and 43 kg after cardiac surgery (age, median + range: 26, 3 - 141 months). All measurements were taken during pressure-controlled ventilation at 0 cm H 2 O of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Results: Linear regression between duplicate measurements was excellent (R 2 = 0. 99). Also, there was good agreement between duplicate measurements, bias ± SD: - 0. 3 % (- 1. 5 mL) ± 5. 9 % (19. 2 mL). Mean EELV ± SD was 19. 6 ± 5. 1 mL/kg at 0 cm H 2 O PEEP. EELV correlated with age (p < 0. 001, r = 0. 92, R 2 = 0. 78), body weight (p < 0. 001, r = 0. 91, R 2 = 0. 82) and height (p < 0. 001, r = 0. 94, R 2 = 0. 75).
