40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{sought to}} (1) {{characterize}} the temporal pattern of T-cell panel reactive antibody during <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support,</b> (2) identify predictors of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support,</b> and (3) determine whether device type remained a predictor after accounting for nonrandom device selection. MethodsBetween December 1991 and August 2000, 239 patients received implantable ventricular assist devices, of whom 231 had T-cell panel reactive antibody measured. Panel reactive antibody was measured before implantation of the assist device, approximately 2 weeks after device implantation, irregularly thereafter depending on clinical events {{and length of}} support, and at transplantation. Longitudinal mixed modeling was used to characterize the temporal pattern of sensitization and its predictors during <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support.</b> To account for nonrandom factors in device selection when comparing HeartMate (Thermo Cardiosystems, Inc, Woburn, Mass) and Novacor (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Novacor Div, Oakland, Calif) devices, we propensity-matched patients according to baseline characteristics. ResultsT-cell panel reactive antibody increased rapidly after implantation of the ventricular assist device and then immediately began to decrease. Predictors of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during support with the assist device were a shorter interval from device implantation to T-cell panel reactive antibody measurement (P <. 0001), female sex (P =. 0004), younger age (P =. 01), higher T-cell panel reactive antibody before device implantation (P =. 03), more perioperative red blood cell transfusions (P =. 006), and an earlier date of device implantation (P =. 001). In matched patients, device type was not a predictor of higher T-cell panel reactive antibody during <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> (P =. 8). ConclusionsHLA sensitization during <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> is not constant but increases rapidly at implantation and then decreases.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{elucidate}} the incidence {{and timing of}} myocardial recovery in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy during prolonged support with a left ventricular assist system and to characterize the factors influencing this phenomenon. MethodsSince 2000, 11 patients (mean age, 27. 9 years) with end-stage heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy were supported with a left ventricular assist system for more than 6 months. All patients had aggressive pharmacologic treatment, including β-blockers, together with unloading {{by means of a}} left ventricular assist system. ResultsDuring 239 to 663 days (mean, 453 days) of left <b>ventricular</b> assist system <b>support,</b> 5 patients had significant recovery of cardiac function and successfully underwent left ventricular assist system removal. All of these patients have remained in New York Heart Association class 1 during 8 to 29 months of follow-up. The improvement of left ventricular function started at various times. In particular, 2 of 5 recovered patients started to show improvement after 1 year of left <b>ventricular</b> assist system <b>support.</b> The myocardial fibrosis did not resolve but rather worsened in all patients during left <b>ventricular</b> assist system <b>support.</b> However, myocardial fibrosis was less severe in the recovered group (17. 7 % ± 8. 2 % at left ventricular assist system implantation vs 20. 1 % ± 5. 2 % at explantation) in comparison with that in the nonrecovered group (30. 5 % ± 13. 2 % vs 48. 4 % ± 5. 1 %) both before and after use of the left ventricular assist system.

40|$|ObjectiveIt is {{generally}} accepted that patients who require biventricular assist device support have poorer outcomes than those requiring isolated left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support.</b> However, {{it is unknown}} how the timing of biventricular assist device insertion affects outcomes. We hypothesized that planned biventricular assist device insertion improves survival compared with delayed conversion of left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> to biventricular assist device support. MethodsWe reviewed and compared outcomes of 266 patients undergoing left ventricular assist device or biventricular assist device placement at the University of Pennsylvania from April 1995 to June 2007. We subdivided patients receiving biventricular assist devices into planned biventricular assist device (P-BiVAD) and delayed biventricular assist device (D-BiVAD) groups based on the timing of right ventricular assist device insertion. We defined the D-BiVAD group as any failure of isolated left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support.</b> ResultsOf 266 patients who receivd left ventricular assist devices, 99 (37 %) required biventricular assist device support. We compared preoperative characteristics, successful bridging to transplantation, survival to hospital discharge, and Kaplan–Meier 1 -year survival between the P-BiVAD (n = 71) and D-BiVAD (n = 28) groups. Preoperative comparison showed that patients who ultimately require biventricular support have similar preoperative status. Left ventricular assist device (n = 167) outcomes in all categories exceeded both P-BiVAD and D-BiVAD group outcomes. Furthermore, patients in the P-BiVAD group had superior survival to discharge than patients in the D-BiVAD group (51 % vs 29 %, P <. 05). One-year and long-term Kaplan–Meier survival distribution confirmed this finding. There was also a trend toward improved bridging to transplantation in the P-BiVAD (n = 55) versus D-BiVAD (n = 22) groups (65 % vs 45 %, P =. 10).

The cannula {{is inserted}} through a straight 18 mm collagen coated Dacron tube anastomosed to the anterior {{aspect of the}} ascending aorta.

The cannula was evaluated in vivo in 3 adult pigs by the institution of a centrifugal pump for left <b>ventricular</b> <b>support.</b> Optimal flow varied between 5 and 6 L/min and mean aortic pressure between 55 and 70 mm Hg throughout the 3 days of left <b>ventricular</b> <b>support.</b> Recently, we employed this cannula in a patient who {{was not able to}} be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass for the institution of left <b>ventricular</b> <b>support</b> using a centrifugal pump.

40|$|ObjectiveLeft <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> for {{patients}} with chronic heart failure can significantly improve β-adrenergic receptor signaling, which is likely critical to myocardial recovery. The mechanism underlying the restoration of β-adrenergic receptor signaling is unclear. This study investigates our hypothesis that restoration of cardiac β-adrenergic receptor signaling by left ventricular assist devices results from inhibition of the G protein–coupled receptor kinase- 2, a G protein–coupled receptor kinase that specifically phosphorylates and desensitizes agonist-occupied β-adrenergic receptors. MethodsLeft ventricular β-adrenergic receptor signaling was assessed in biopsy specimens taken from patients with chronic heart failure (n = 12) {{at the time of}} left ventricular assist device implantation (heart failure group) and again at the time of heart transplantation (left ventricular assist device group). Signaling was also studied in left ventricular biopsy specimens from nonfailing control (n = 8) hearts (nonfailing control group). Signaling was assessed by measuring sarcolemmal membrane β-adrenergic receptor density, adenylyl cyclase activity, G protein expression, and G protein–coupled receptor kinase- 2 expression and activity. ResultsLeft ventricular β-adrenergic receptor signaling was severely decreased in the heart failure group versus that seen in the nonfailing control group, as demonstrated by adenylyl cyclase activity. G protein–coupled receptor kinase- 2 expression and activity was increased 3 -fold in the heart failure group versus that seen in the nonfailing control group. After left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support,</b> β-adrenergic receptor signaling was restored to levels similar to those seen in the nonfailing control group. G protein–coupled receptor kinase- 2 expression and activity were markedly diminished after left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> compared with that seen in the heart failure group and were not different from that seen in the nonfailing control group. ConclusionIn chronic heart failure left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> leads to restoration of cardiac β-adrenergic receptor signaling. The primary mechanism appears to be diminished myocardial G protein–coupled receptor kinase- 2 activity. This demonstrates the potentially beneficial effects of G protein–coupled receptor kinase- 2 inhibition on β-adrenergic receptor signaling in heart failure and might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for this disease process...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Recent {{advances}} in technology {{as well as new}} indications for implantation have appeared in the field of ventricular assist devices. Progress has also been made in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of myocardial recovery after <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: Technological progress includes the development of fully implantable pulsatile and continuous flow pumps, either axial flow or centrifugal, for left ventricular and total heart assistance. Among the new indications for <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support,</b> the most important is the use of the device as permanent treatment for end-stage cardiac failure patients. Increased knowledge has been acquired regarding the effects of mechanical assistance and of unloading of the heart on haemodynamics, {{as well as on the}} cellular, molecular and electrophysiological characteristics of the failing heart. All these findings suggest that depressed myocardial function can sometimes recover with ventricular assist device therapy. <b>Ventricular</b> assist device <b>support,</b> however, still carries a high rate of complications: the device itself can fail, bleeding and thromboembolism are common, immunity is disturbed and the incidence of infection remains high. SUMMARY: In patients with end-stage heart failure, ventricular assist devices can be used as a bridge to transplantation or to recovery, but they are now also considered as a long-term myocardial replacement therapy. Which device is the most appropriate for each indication, however, remains to be defined. Even if the underlying mechanisms of myocardial recovery are progressively clarified, the use of ventricular assist devices as a bridge to recovery still has limited clinical success. Clinical trials with the fully implantable devices are in their early stages, but these pumps appear promising in terms of efficacy, reliability and complication rate, as well as being easy to implant. Because more patients will benefit from ventricular assist device placement in the future, anaesthesiologists must be prepared to manage patients undergoing ventricular assist device placement or presenting for noncardiac surgery while under <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support...</b>|$|R

However, data on long-term post-transplant survival for these patients are limited. We evaluated the effect of continuous-flow {{left ventricular}} assist devices on postcardiac transplant survival in the current era. MethodsAll patients who received a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant at a single center from June 2005 to September 2011 were evaluated. ResultsOf the 167 patients who received a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device as a bridge to transplant, 77 (46 %) underwent cardiac transplantation, 27 died before transplantation (16 %), and 63 (38 %) remain listed for transplantation and continued with left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support.</b> The {{mean age of the}} transplanted patients was 54. 5  ±  11. 9 years, 57 % had an ischemic etiology, and 20 % were women. The overall mean duration of left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> before transplantation was 310  ±  227 days (range, 67 - 1230 days). The mean duration of left <b>ventricular</b> assist device <b>support</b> did not change in patients who had received a left ventricular assist device in the early period of the study (2005 - 2008, n =  62) compared with those who had received a left ventricular assist device later (2009 - 2011, n =  78, 373 vs 392 days, P = NS). In addition, no difference was seen in survival between those patients supported with a left ventricular assist device for fewer than 180 days or longer than 180 days before transplantation (P = NS). The actuarial survival after transplantation at 30 days and 1, 3, and 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 98. 7 %, 93. 0 %, 91. 1 %, and 88. 0 %, respectively.

In these cases, the beating heart could be supported by a mechanical device, preferably a device with minimal invasive features to fit in this new approach. For this purpose, two intravascular blood pumps were developed: the Intracardiac Pump LV for left <b>ventricular</b> <b>support</b> and the Intracardiac pump RV for right <b>ventricular</b> <b>support.</b> (Impella Cardiotechnik, Aachen, Germany) The Impella pumps are rotary blood pumps of the axial flow type and produce 4. 2 L/min at physiological pressure differences and a rotational speed of 32, 500 rotations/min.
