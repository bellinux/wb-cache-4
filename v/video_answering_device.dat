40|$|<b>Video</b> Question <b>Answering</b> is a {{challenging}} problem in visual information retrieval, which provides {{the answer to}} the referenced video content according to the question. However, the existing visual question answering approaches mainly tackle the problem of static image question, which may be ineffectively for <b>video</b> question <b>answering</b> due to the insufficiency of modeling the temporal dynamics of video contents. In this paper, we study the problem of <b>video</b> question <b>answering</b> by modeling its temporal dynamics with frame-level attention mechanism. We propose the attribute-augmented attention network learning framework that enables the joint frame-level attribute detection and unified video representation learning for <b>video</b> question <b>answering.</b> We then incorporate the multi-step reasoning process for our proposed attention network to further improve the performance. We construct a large-scale <b>video</b> question <b>answering</b> dataset. We conduct the experiments on both multiple-choice and open-ended <b>video</b> question <b>answering</b> tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comment: Accepted for SIGIR 201...|$|R

Video-QA is different from Image-QA since the information and the events are scattered among multiple frames. In order to better utilize the temporal structure of the videos and the phrasal structures of the answers, we propose two mechanisms: the re-watching and the re-reading mechanisms and combine them into the forgettable-watcher model.

Methods: Four volunteers were <b>videoed</b> <b>answering</b> an identical sport-specific clinical scenario. Recordings were initially scored by two experienced assessors (gold standard).

50|$|A small device, {{about the}} size of a home {{wireless}} router, contains the necessary electronics which allow plain old telephone service to be provided to one or two telephone jacks on the back of the unit, as well as having a small radio antenna and a transceiver for the wireless side of the connection.

The devices usually cannot provide enough ringing current for more than one phone and one externally powered device, such as a telephone <b>answering</b> <b>device</b> or the base station for a cordless phone. For this reason, it is not recommended to connect these devices to a home's wiring (which also requires the disconnection of the wiring at the network interface device, just as when a cable telephone or other whole-home VoIP service is installed).
