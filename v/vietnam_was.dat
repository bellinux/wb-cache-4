5|$|After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed frequently. As the {{southern}} governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, as only {{the centre of}} <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter of Catholic missionaries, while Minh Mạng was a staunch Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished and the region was put under direct control.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which {{was in the process of}} seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the ‘friendship’ between the Khmer Rouge and China.|$|E

5|$|Regiment 95 survived Operation Camargue {{and resumed}} ambushes in 1954, {{as well as}} assaulting a Vietnamese {{garrison}} near Hué. The regiment remained in the area, taking part in General Giáp's 1954 campaign season, until <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> split into North and South Vietnam by the cease-fire, whereupon it infiltrated back to the north along Route One during broad daylight, leaving small cells of guerillas in the area. The regiment returned to resume ambushes of the South Vietnamese Army in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{reached the}} last stage of its {{operational}} evolution during 1967 and 1968.

500|$|The {{politics}} of the Socialist Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>are</b> defined by a single-party socialist republic framework, where the President of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>is</b> {{the head of state}} and the Prime Minister of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>is</b> the head of government, in a one-party system led by the Communist Party of <b>Vietnam.</b> Executive power <b>is</b> exercised by the government and the President of <b>Vietnam.</b> Legislative power <b>is</b> vested in the National Assembly of Vietnam (...) [...] The Judiciary is independent of the executive. The parliament adopted the current Constitution of Vietnam; its fifth, on 28 November 2013.|$|R
50|$|Although South Korea and <b>Vietnam</b> <b>are</b> run {{under two}} totally {{different}} systems, when South Korea is mostly pro-US and a republic, while <b>Vietnam</b> <b>is</b> a one-party state espousing communism; nonetheless, South Korea is being {{considered as a}} major ally of <b>Vietnam.</b> <b>Vietnam</b> <b>is</b> also the only communist country to ally with South Korea. Due to the Chinese factor in both two countries, they have been aiming to work further together.|$|R
50|$|Luxembourg-Vietnam {{relations}} are the bilateral relations between Luxembourg and Vietnam. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1973. Luxembourg's representation in <b>Vietnam</b> <b>is</b> through its Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand. <b>Vietnam</b> <b>is</b> represented through its embassy in Brussels, Belgium.|$|R
5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took place within the party. The role of the Central Committee in decision-making was strengthened, {{and the role of the}} Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened. Inner-party accountability was strengthened. The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E
5|$|Through intrigue, Thảo {{also helped}} destabilise and {{ultimately}} unseat two South Vietnamese regimes—Diem's {{and the military}} junta of Khánh. As the Diệm regime began to unravel in 1963, Thảo {{was one of the}} officers planning a coup. His plot was ultimately integrated into the successful plot and his activities promoted infighting which weakened the government and distracted the military from fighting the Viet Cong insurgency. Throughout 1964 and 1965, as South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> struggling to establish a stable state after the ouster of Diệm, Thảo was involved in several intrigues and coup plots which diverted the government from implementing its programs. In 1965, he went into hiding after a failed attempt to seize power from Khánh and was sentenced to death in absentia. Although this coup also failed, the subsequent chaos forced Khánh's junta to collapse. Thảo died the same year he was forced into hiding; it is believed that he was murdered after a bounty was placed on his head. After <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> reunified {{at the end of the}} Vietnam War, the victorious communists claimed Thảo as one of their own and posthumously made him a one-star general.|$|E
5|$|Until the 17th century, {{what is now}} {{southern}} <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> not {{inhabited by}} ethnic Vietnamese but by Khmer people. What is now central Vietnam had been {{the seat of the}} kingdom of Champa, which fought the kingdom of Đại Việt over many centuries. The 1471 Vietnamese conquest of Champa saw the destruction of the Cham capital and heralded the ultimate decline of Champa. The Vietnamese continually expanded south in {{what is known as the}} nam tien (southward march). Central <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> ruled by the Nguyễn lords, who had broken away in the early 17th century from the Trịnh lords, who ruled the north. The Nguyễn continued the southward expansion that eventually saw Vietnamese encroach into what had been Khmer territory in the Mekong Delta. The southern edge of Vietnam, being further away from the Nguyễn power base in the centre, was loosely governed.|$|E

5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making forest regeneration difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
5|$|Although the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 were {{supposed}} {{to end the war}} in Vietnam, fighting continued between South Vietnam and North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. Despite a pledge of support from U.S. President Richard Nixon, military aid to South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> sharply reduced. By the end of 1972 the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was the fourth largest air force in the world, with 2,075 aircraft and over 61,000 personnel. However, Republic of Vietnam Air Force operations were severely affected by cutbacks in military aid, flying hours had to be reduced by 51% and bomb loads on fighter aircraft halved from four to two pieces of ordnance.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E

5|$|Clinton's November 2000 {{visit to}} <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> the first by a U.S. {{president}} {{since the end}} of the Vietnam War. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform. Clinton also oversaw a boom of the U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the Nguyễn Dynasty, {{little is known about}} Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which {{was in the process of}} colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858, beginning the colonisation of southern Vietnam. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on the best strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>was</b> not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
