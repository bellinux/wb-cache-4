The fresco became a source of numerous engravings circulating in Georgia {{at that time and}} inspired the poet Grigol Orbeliani to dedicate a romantic poem to it. Furthermore, the Georgian literati, reacting to Russian rule in Georgia and the suppression of national institutions, contrasted Tamar's era to their contemporary situation, lamenting the irretrievably lost past in their writings. Hence, Tamar became a personification of the heyday of Georgia, a perception that has persisted down to the present time.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically <b>very</b> <b>differently</b> from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. This paper {{is about the}} ontological {{politics}} and possibilities of the mobile microbe. It seeks to foreground a link that exists between current understandings of the mobile microbe and the conditions of possibility structuring the production of such a microbe in the medical microbiological sciences. When the microbial world is brought into the field of medical perception, it is a monadic microbe, isolated and alone, that appears. But why is this? Because out there, in the microbial world, things travel alone? Working through {{a case study of}} the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, this paper suggests not. That SARS was caused by one viral agent, a coronavirus (CoV), is now microbiological fact. But the argument here is that this fact is an effect; that various medical microbiological practices and interventions, whilst establishing the visibility of this monadic human coronavirus, were serving, at the same time, to suppress any possibility of a <b>very</b> different, and <b>differently</b> mobile, human coronavirus becoming similarly visible. And that is where the politics comes in. For if politics, the realm of the political, can be taken to arise in situations where various possibilities exist but not all possibilities can be chosen, then it follows that there is a politics bound up with the practical production of the mobile microbe in the medical microbiological sciences...|$|R

5|$|The classic view {{of water}} in cells is that about 5% of this water is {{strongly}} bound in by solutes or macromolecules as water of solvation, while the majority has the same structure as pure water.

The process of smelling works <b>very</b> <b>differently</b> {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air.

While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially.

All triphylite-lithiophilite spectra show the following features: (i) a nearly unpolarized absorption edge at around 30000 cm- 1, which shifts slightly towards higher energies on increasing xFe, (ii) very weak and sharp bands at 24200 and 23800 cm- 1 (c 8 b 8 a) typical of spin-forbidden dd-bands in Mn 2 +, {{and a series}} of <b>very</b> weak, <b>differently</b> polarized bands in the range 19000 – 15000 cm- 1, (iii) an intense band system in theNIR typical of spin-allowed dd-transitions in octahedral Fe 2 +, consisting of two strongly polarized bands, I. at around 9100 – 9400 cm- 1 (c 8 8 a 8 b) and II. at around 7400 – 7200 cm- 1 (c 8 8 a » b) attached as a strong shoulder to I.

40|$|Synthesis and {{characterization}} {{of a new}} macrocyclic compound, composed by a triethylentetraamine chain linking the 4 and 5 positions of an acridine moiety, are reported. The molecule, devised as a fluorescent chemosensor for anions, has revealed an intriguing pH-dependent spectroscopic behavior, whose features are the specific object of this article. Ligand protonation in aqueous solution has been analyzed by means of potentiometric, 1 H NMR, UV−vis, and fluorescence emission measurements. The molecule binds up to four protons in the pH range 2 − 11. Protonation takes place on the aliphatic tetraamine chain, while the acridine nitrogen does not participate to proton binding even at <b>very</b> low pH. <b>Differently</b> from acridine, the UV−vis spectra are almost unaffected by the pH. On the opposite, the emission spectra are strongly pH-dependent. In fact, at low pH values, the spectra show a blue-shifted emission, resembling that of unprotonated acridine, while at slightly acidic and alkaline pH the fluorescence features a red-shifted band {{similar to that of}} acridinium cation. This unusual behavior occurs in the mono-, bi-, and triprotonated forms of the compound and is interpreted as due to an excited state proton transfer from an aliphatic ammonium group adjacent to the acridine moiety to the acridine nitrogen. In the fully protonated state, this process is prevented owing to unfavorable molecular arrangements mainly determined by electrostatic repulsions. This interpretation is supported by quantum mechanical calculations as well as molecular dynamics simulations...|$|R
5|$|The kakapo {{was a very}} {{successful}} species in pre-human New Zealand, {{and one of the}} reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same behaviours have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave <b>very</b> <b>differently</b> from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually (with the exception of owls) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.|$|E
5|$|Because A Trip to the Moon {{preceded the}} {{development}} of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith, it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed, a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles, intercutting, juxtapositions of shots, and other filmic ideas. Rather, each camera setup in Méliès's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing, an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed. Similarly, film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice: first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing {{in the eye of}} an anthropomorphic moon; then, in a much closer shot, the landing occurs <b>very</b> <b>differently,</b> and much more realistically, with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain. This kind of nonlinear storytelling—in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal—is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers; before {{the development of}} continuity editing, however, other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time. (Porter, for instance, used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman.) Later in the twentieth century, with sports television's development of the instant replay, temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences.|$|E

Although mechanisms of segment specification have been elucidated in a few model organisms, we know very little about how the number of segments is determined and controlled during ontogeny. In spite of this, morphological data can indicate what arthropod developmental systems must be able {{to do in order to}} produce the observed segmental patterns, in other words, their performances in segmentation. Arthropod segmentation performances can be evaluated looking at the results of segmentation processes, i. e. at the observed range of developmental trajectories that in turn produces the variety of arthropod segmental arrangements. Even limiting the inspection to the number of segments produced, considerable differences in segmentation performances across taxa emerge. These involve a) the number of segments per se, b) the level of developmental precision for the number of segments produced, c) the developmental schedule of segmentation, and d) the possible pattern of intra-specific variation. Patterns of intra-specific variation for the number of segments and for the post-embryonic developmental schedule can be related to sexual dimorphism and geographic variation. For some species that exhibit intra-specific variability in segmentation, there is evidence for a relevant hereditary component, but there is no information on the genetic mechanism eventually involved. Developmental performances in segmentation, being related to the mechanisms of segmentation and their genetic control, can suggest possible developmental constraints on the evolution of segmental patterns...|$|R

The different partners and the game itself were presented on a computer screen. Results showed that praise and punishment were used the same way for computer and human partners. Yet robots, which are essentially computers with a different embodiment, were treated <b>differently.</b> <b>Very</b> machine-like robots were treated just like the computer and the human; robots very high on anthropomorphism / zoomorphism were praised more and punished less. However, barely any of the participants believed that they actually played together with a robot. After this first study, we refined the method and also tested if {{the presence of a}} real robot, in comparison to a screen representation, would influence the measurements. The robot, {{in the form of an}} AIBO, would either be present in the room or only be represented on the participants' computer screen (presence). Furthermore, the robot would either make 20 % errors or 40 % errors (error rate) in the collaborative game. We automatically measured the praising and punishing behavior of the participants towards the robot and also asked the participant to estimate their own behavior. Results show that even the presence of the robot in the room did not convince all participants that they played together with the robot. To gain full insight into this human-robot relationship it might be necessary to directly interact with the robot. The participants unconsciously praised AIBO more than the human partner, but punished it just as much. Robots that adapt to the users' behavior should therefore pay extra attention to the users' praises, compared to their punishments...|$|R
