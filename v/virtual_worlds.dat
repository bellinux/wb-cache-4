5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds,</b> thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} system that {{automatically}} generates a 3 D <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> from a <b>virtual</b> institution (VI) specification, namely of activities that {{will take place in}} the <b>virtual</b> <b>world.</b> A <b>virtual</b> institution is an interaction environment where both human and software agents participate in a joint 3 D <b>virtual</b> <b>world.</b> A VI is visualized as a 3 D building composed of rooms representing the different activities defined in its specification. To support the generation of the 3 D scene, we propose an extension of shape grammars called <b>virtual</b> <b>world</b> grammar (VWG). A VWG incorporates information about the definition of the activities, properties of the different shapes (i. e spaces), functions to evaluate and validate the generated design, and a set of heuristics to guide the generation process.

25|$|One of Dourish's most {{recognized}} contributions {{has been}} bringing sociological and phenomenological understandings {{of human activity}} {{to the design of}} technological systems. For example, his work on spatiality in <b>virtual</b> <b>worlds</b> and computer mediated communication has emphasized how people—in interaction with systems and with one another—evolve new understandings of space, media, and relationships. He also drew on Schutzian phenomenology to argue that tangible computing and social computing share an underlying emphasis on people as embodied, social actors. Emphasizing people as social and embodied points to the importance of how individuals are constituted through their interactions and movements in space with other people. This model is counterposed to models of the person in Human-Computer Interaction that focus exclusively on people's cognitive capabilities.|$|E
