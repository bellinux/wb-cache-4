30|$|In {{this case}} the initial {{physician}} was deceived {{by the fact that}} the patient did not have the typical symptoms and signs of a perforated <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer,</b> but instead presented with acute chest pain. As a part of the secondary evaluation of the patient, a FATE was performed. The intention was to diagnose or exclude obvious cardiac and pulmonary/pleural pathology. Instead, as an incidental finding, it gave the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum. Had the patient not been examined with FATE, the correct diagnosis and treatment would probably had been delayed for several hours since the patient had not yet developed the classical signs of a perforated <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} assay (PCR) for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori in human gastric biopsies from 44 dyspeptic patients was developed. From endoscopic diagnosis, {{the sample consisted of}} 4 patients with gastric cancer, 4 patients with duodenal ulcer, 3 patients with <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer,</b> 3 patients with both <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer</b> and duodenal ulcer and 31 patients with chronic gastritis. The H. pylori infection was diagnosed using nested PCR, which consisted of two primers of the urease gene fragment. From 44 specimens with urease positive, 39 specimens were positive for cagA strain (88, 6 %). This reflects a very high frequency of the cagA gene in the Helicobacter pylori infection. The meaning of this is still unclear. There {{was no significant difference in}} the cagA status of ulcer dyspeptic patient and non- ulcer dyspeptic patients...|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{findings}} from the subcostal view, a conventional X-ray image of the abdomen with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position was taken. The X-ray confirmed the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum. The patient was transferred to a surgical unit where he was operated for a perforated <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{the text}} was written over 40 years ago, the topics {{covered in the}} text are quite {{similar to those that}} would be covered in a {{contemporary}} voice textbook, which shows how much further along the study of phoniatry was compared to other subdivisions of Speech Language Pathology at the time. For example, topics covered in this text included: speech acoustics, observational methods, treatment of laryngeal electromyography, physiology of respiration and voice production, genetic factors in voice, development of voice throughout the lifespan, professional voice, voice therapy; pathology of the larynx, nodules, asymetries, genetic defects of voice and laryngeal web, sulcus glottides, voice related endocrine problems, the effects of peripheral nerve lesions, the sympathetic nervous system; laryngeal myopathy, central lesions of the nervous system, laryngeal trauma, cordectomy, joint disorders, alaryngeal voice, vasomotor effects on vocal fold function, functional dysphonias, contact <b>ulcers,</b> <b>ventricular</b> voice, and psychogenic voice disorders.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{illustrate}} the {{close association between}} a disturbed psychosocial up-bringing, frequent physical illness, and medical interventions. Method: We report {{a case of a}} 44 -year-old woman with anorexia nervosa (AN) and Sheehan's syndrome who {{died as a result of}} a toxic cardiac arrest. Results: The patient presented with a BMI of 13. 6 kg/m 2. She refused any intensive-care treatment and died from toxic cardiac arrest. Postmortem examination revealed an acute gastroenterocolitis. Discussion: The history of this patient illustrates how psychological deprivation led to eating disturbances, early pregnancy, and the life-threatening delivery of twins. This resulted in a diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome, hepatitis C, and a <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer.</b> A psychosocial event triggered a late exacerbation of her AN. A helpful alliance between patient and staff did not occur as she rejected it...|$|E
40|$|SBU {{performed}} a systematic review concerning dyspepsia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The review included {{the perspective of}} managing patients in primary care. Dyspepsia is a common condition but varies from one geographic area to another. Despite presenting symptoms of dyspepsia, a majority of patients may not have an ulcer diagnosis (non-ulcer dyspepsia [NUD]). For undiagnosed GERD and diagnosed erosive GERD, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide better relief of symptoms than histamine-H 2 antagonists. When it comes to long-term treatment of erosive GERD, continued use of PPIs leads to better patient outcomes than PPIs on demand. PPIs are safe for long-term treatment and indicated even for young patients. Adverse effects are rare. Eradication of H. pylori {{reduces the risk of}} duodenal ulcer and <b>ventricular</b> <b>ulcer.</b> Eradication of H. pylori is more effective than acid suppression alone for preventing a new episode of bleeding. Eradication of H. pylori for patients with NUD may provide minor relief of symptoms. But because the majority of patients with NUD are not infected with H. pylori, the treatment will have no effect on them. PPIs may provide some relief of NUD symptoms, but studies that analyzed the effectiveness of PPIs for NUD symptoms also included patients with GERD. As a result, it is difficult to draw any conclusions in that regard. Patients with Barrett's esophagus are at increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. However, published studies offer no evidence that screening or surveillance will detect cancer at an early stage. There is a need for independent dyspepsia research, including health economic studies...|$|E
