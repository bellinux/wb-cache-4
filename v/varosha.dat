5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and <b>Varosha,</b> Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and other life forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E

25|$|With the British takeover, Famagusta regained its {{significance}} as a port and an economic centre and its development was specifically targeted in British plans. As {{soon as the}} British took over the island, a Famagusta Development Act was passed that aimed at the reconstruction and redevelopment of the city's streets and dilapidated buildings as well as better hygiene. The port was developed and expanded between 1903 and 1906 and Cyprus Government Railway, with its terminus in Famagusta, started construction in 1904. Whilst Larnaca continued {{to be used as}} the main port of the island for some time, after Famagusta's use as a military base in World War I trade significantly shifted to Famagusta. The city outside the walls grew at an accelerated rate, with development being centred around <b>Varosha.</b> <b>Varosha</b> became the administrative centre as the British moved their headquarters and residences there and tourism grew significantly {{in the last years of}} the British rule. Pottery and production of citrus and potatoes also significantly grew in the city outside the walls, whilst agriculture within the walled city declined to non-existence. New residential areas were built to accommodate the increasing population towards the end of the British rule, and by 1960, Famagusta was a modern colonial port city extending far beyond <b>Varosha</b> and the walled city.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Ottoman rule, Latins lost their privileged status in Famagusta and were {{expelled}} from the city. Greek Cypriots were at first allowed to own and buy property in the city, but were banished from the walled city in 1573-74 and had to settle outside in the area that later developed into <b>Varosha.</b> Turkish families from Anatolia were resettled in the walled city but could not fill the buildings that previously hosted a population of 10,000. This caused a drastic decrease in the population of Famagusta. Merchants from Famagusta, who mostly consisted of Latins that had been expelled, resettled in Larnaca and as Larnaca flourished, Famagusta lost its importance as a trade centre. Over time, <b>Varosha</b> developed into a prosperous agricultural town thanks to its location away from the marshes, whilst the walled city remained dilapidated.|$|E
25|$|The mayor-in-exile of Famagusta is Alexis Galanos. İsmail Arter {{heads the}} Turkish Cypriot {{municipal}} administration of Famagusta, which remains legal as a communal-based body under the constitutional {{system of the}} Republic of Cyprus. Since 1974, Greek Cypriots submitted a number of proposals {{within the context of}} bicommunal discussions for the return of <b>Varosha</b> to UN administration, allowing the return of its lawful inhabitants, requesting also the opening of Famagusta harbour for use by both communities.|$|E
25|$|The second Turkish {{offensive}} {{began on}} August 14, 1974, as Greek and Turkish Cypriot representatives met in Geneva {{to discuss the}} situation on the island. Turkish pleas for international intervention having failed and very slow diplomatic progress, in addition to being confined to an undefensible and non-viable region in Cyprus, Turkish Armed forces took action again. Despite a UN ceasefire in place (several had already been disregarded), the Turkish Army, massively reinforced from weeks of build-up, launched an all-out surprise attack on ill-prepared Greek Cypriot and Greek units. With little answer to the masses of armour, mechanised units, artillery and air support that the Turks could bring to bear, virtually all Greek Cypriot defences collapsed in a matter of days, and by August 16, 1974, Turkish forces, spearheaded by the 28th and 39th Infantry Divisions, had extended to capture some 37% of the island, including the towns of Famagusta, <b>Varosha</b> and Morphou.|$|E
25|$|From {{independence}} in 1960 to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus of 1974, Famagusta developed toward the south west of <b>Varosha</b> {{as a tourist}} centre. In the late 1960s Famagusta {{became one of the}} world's best-known entertainment and tourist centres. The contribution of Famagusta to the country's economic activity by 1974 far exceeded its proportional dimensions within the country. It possessed over 50% of the total hotel accommodation of Cyprus. Whilst its population was only about 7% of the total of the country, Famagusta by 1974 accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus, concentrating mainly on light industry compatible with its activity as a tourist resort and turning out high-quality products ranging from food, beverages and tobacco to clothing, footwear, plastics, light machinery and transport equipment. It contributed 19.3% of the business units and employed 21.3% {{of the total number of}} persons engaged in commerce on the island.|$|E

Akıncı promised a vision about the ghost town of <b>Varosha</b> favoring a settlement to the issue by saying, [...] "Instead of living side by side a corpse let <b>Varosha</b> become a lively city where people live, contractors from both communities do business together and young people can find jobs".|$|E

Regarding his vision for <b>Varosha,</b> he elaborated that the quarter should be opened to public under United Nations administration {{in a way that would}} [...] "benefit both communities". He expressed his vehement opposition to any discrimination against LGBT individuals. He also promised to bring women to the table of negotiations if he elected, and said that communal gender equality should be a [...] "way of life".|$|E
2500|$|Eroğlu {{held his}} Famagusta {{rally in the}} Namık Kemal Square on 15 April; the rally was {{attended}} by people from Famagusta, İskele and the Karpass Peninsula. He attacked other candidates regarding the issue of <b>Varosha,</b> saying that opening the area under Turkish Cypriot jurisdiction would end the negotiations, and opening the area under the United Nations would amount to [...] "handing over Famagusta". His Nicosia rally was held on 17 April in the Sarayönü Square. The rally was attended by [...] "thousands" [...] who came from Nicosia, Morphou and Kyrenia, and Eroğlu said that [...] "the victory [...] belong to {{those who believe in}} the TRNC, in freedom and in sovereignty". He said that he was asking for duty [...] "one last time".|$|E

5000|$|During his campaign, he put {{his voice}} forward {{regarding}} the ghost town <b>Varosha,</b> {{which is a very}} lively topic regarding the Cyprus problem.

50|$|The main {{features}} of <b>Varosha</b> included John F. Kennedy Avenue, a street which ran from {{close to the}} port of Famagusta, through <b>Varosha</b> and parallel to Glossa beach. Along JFK Avenue, there were many well known high rise hotels including the King George Hotel, The Asterias Hotel, The Grecian Hotel, The Florida Hotel, and The Argo Hotel which was the favourite hotel of Elizabeth Taylor. The Argo Hotel is located {{near the end of}} JFK Avenue, looking towards Protaras and Fig Tree Bay. Another major street in <b>Varosha</b> was Leonidas (Λεωνίδας), a major street that came off JFK Avenue and headed west towards Vienna Corner. Leonidas was a major shopping and leisure street in <b>Varosha,</b> consisting of bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and a Toyota car dealership.|$|E

The UN Security Council Resolution 550 of 1984 ordered for <b>Varosha</b> to be handed over to the administration of the United Nations, and was to be resettled by no other people than the inhabitants who were forced out.
