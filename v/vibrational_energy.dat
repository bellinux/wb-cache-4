25|$|In {{a report}} {{published}} in 1926 in Transactions of the Faraday Society, James Franck {{was concerned with}} the mechanisms of photon-induced chemical reactions. The presumed mechanism was the excitation of a molecule by a photon, followed by a collision with another molecule during the short period of excitation. The question was whether {{it was possible for}} a molecule to break into photoproducts in a single step, the absorption of a photon, and without a collision. In order for a molecule to break apart, it must acquire from the photon a <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy</b> exceeding the dissociation energy, that is, the energy to break a chemical bond. However, as was known at the time, molecules will only absorb energy corresponding to allowed quantum transitions, and there are no vibrational levels above the dissociation energy level of the potential well. High-energy photon absorption leads to a transition to a higher electronic state instead of dissociation. In examining how much <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy</b> a molecule could acquire when it is excited to a higher electronic level, and whether this <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy</b> could be enough to immediately break apart the molecule, he drew three diagrams representing the possible changes in binding energy between the lowest electronic state and higher electronic states.|$|E
40|$|We observe large, reversible, bias driven {{changes in}} the <b>vibrational</b> <b>energies</b> of PCBM, based on {{simultaneous}} transport and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements on PCBM-gold junctions. A combination of linear and quadratic shifts in <b>vibrational</b> <b>energies</b> with voltage is analyzed and compared with similar measurements involving C 60 -gold junctions. A theoretical model based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggests that both a vibrational Stark effect and bias-induced charging of the junction contribute to the shifts in <b>vibrational</b> <b>energies.</b> In the PCBM case, a linear vibrational Stark effect is observed due to the permanent electric dipole moment of PCBM. The vibrational Stark shifts shown here for PCBM junctions are comparable to or larger than the charging effects that dominate in C 60 junctions. Comment: 16 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{shape of}} the JT-split APES has specific consequences for the nuclear dynamics, here considered in the fully quantum sense. For sufficiently strong JT coupling, the minimum points are sufficiently far (at least by a few <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy</b> quanta) below the JT intersection. Two different energy regimes are then to be distinguished, those of low and high energy.|$|E
25|$|As already stated above, the {{distinction}} of low and high energy regimes is valid only for sufficiently strong JT couplings, that is, when several or many <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy</b> quanta fit into the energy window between the conical intersection and the minimum of the lower JT-split APES. For the many cases of small to intermediate JT couplings this energy window and the corresponding adiabatic low-energy regime does not exist. Rather, the levels on both JT-split APES are intricately mixed for all energies and the nuclear motion always proceeds on both JT split APES simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|In general, emitted {{fluorescent}} light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, {{is due to}} energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed {{and when it is}} emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy</b> level of the excited state. Another factor is that the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.|$|E
25|$|The third law of {{thermodynamics}} {{states that}} the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero, or 0 kelvin is zero. This means that in a perfect crystal, at 0 kelvin, nearly all molecular motion should cease {{in order to achieve}} ΔS=0. A perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure is the same at all times; in other words, it is fixed and non-moving, and does not have rotational or <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy.</b> This means {{that there is only one}} way in which this order can be attained: when every particle of the structure is in its proper place.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the {{rotational}} constant B is {{much smaller than the}} vibrational one νo, such that a much smaller amount of energy is required to rotate the molecule; for a typical molecule, this lies within the microwave region.

40|$|Vibrational {{modes of}} {{molecules}} are fundamental properties determined by intramolecular bonding, atomic masses, and molecular geometry, and often serve as important channels for dissipation in nanoscale processes. Although single-molecule junctions have been employed to manipulate electronic structure and related functional properties of molecules, electrical control of <b>vibrational</b> mode <b>energies</b> has remained elusive. Here we use simultaneous transport and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy measurements to demonstrate large, reversible, voltage-driven shifts of <b>vibrational</b> mode <b>energies</b> of C 60 molecules in gold junctions. C 60 mode energies {{are found to}} vary approximately quadratically with bias, but in a manner inconsistent with a simple vibrational Stark effect. Our theoretical model suggests instead that the mode shifts are a signature of bias-driven addition of electronic charge to the molecule. These results imply that voltage-controlled tuning of vibrational modes is a general phenomenon at metal-molecule interfaces and {{is a means of}} achieving significant shifts in <b>vibrational</b> <b>energies</b> relative to a pure Stark effect.

25|$|The {{applicability}} of the Franck–Condon principle in both absorption and fluorescence, along with Kasha's rule leads to an approximate mirror symmetry shown in Figure 2. The vibrational structure of molecules in a cold, sparse gas is most clearly visible due {{to the absence of}} inhomogeneous broadening of the individual transitions. Vibronic transitions are drawn in Figure 2 as narrow, equally spaced Lorentzian lineshapes. Equal spacing between vibrational levels is only the case for the parabolic potential of simple harmonic oscillators, in more realistic potentials, such as those shown in Figure 1, energy spacing decreases with increasing <b>vibrational</b> <b>energy.</b> Electronic transitions to and from the lowest vibrational states are often referred to as 0–0 (zero zero) transitions and have the same energy in both absorption and fluorescence.|$|E
