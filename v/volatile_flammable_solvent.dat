40|$|A {{quantitative}} methodology {{was developed}} {{in order to assess}} the possible hazards connected with the vegetable oil storage facilities and process plants. The main criticalities in these plants are due to the presence of residual <b>volatile</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>solvents</b> deriving from the extraction processes. The residual solvent may accumulate in the storage tanks generating flammable vapour mixtures. On the same time, the presence of volatile substances in the refining process feed may cause operative problems in the sections operating at high temperature and low pressure. The methodology allowed a preliminary assessment of the possibility of explosion hazard in storage conditions. Moreover, the implementation of the refining process model, allowed simulating undesired process deviations, and determining the effective control measures able to restore the operations. © 2011, AIDIC Servizi S. r.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a methodology {{for the assessment}} of hazards due to the formation of flammable mixtures in edible oil refineries, with particular focus on storage tanks. Safety issues in these plants are due to the presence of residual <b>volatile</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>solvents</b> deriving from the extraction processes, which may accumulate in the storage tanks and generate flammable vapour mixtures. The methodology, based on the application of a thermodynamic model for the estimation of vapour phase composition in oil storage tanks as a function of operating conditions (i. e. temperature and residual solvent content), allows the identification of potential hazards due to formation of flammable mixtures inside the tanks. The model was first validated using available experimental data and then extended to case-studies representative of state-of-the-art industrial storage applications. The results of the case-studies were then used to calculate specific hazard indexes, providing a quick tool for preliminary assessment of hazards due to the formation of flammable mixtures in edible oil storage plants.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{method for}} aluminium deposition was proposed by using AlCl(3) /[bmim]Cl (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride) ionic liquid as electrolyte. By using this novel method, the <b>volatile</b> and <b>flammable</b> organic <b>solvent</b> {{systems and the}} high corrosive inorganic molten salts with high temperature can be substituted, and the deposit microstructure can be easily adjusted by changing the current density, temperature and electrolyte composition. The study was performed by means of galvano-static electrolysis and the optimum operating conditions were determined based oil the systematic studies {{of the effects of}} current density, temperature, molar ratio of AlCl(3) to [bmim]Cl, stirring speed and deposition time Oil the quality of deposited coatings. The electrical conductivities of electrolytes were also investigated as a function of temperature (298 - 358 K) and molar ratio of AlO(3) to [bmim]Cl (from 0. 1 : 1 to 2. 0 : 1). Dense, bright and adherent aluminium coatings were obtained over a wide range of temperature (298 - 348 K), current densities (8 - 44 mA/cm(2)) and molar ratio (1. 6 : 1 - 2. 0 : 1). Results from the analysis of crystal structure shou, that all of the electrodeposits exhibit a preferred (200) crystallographic orientation. Temperature has significant influence on the crystallographic orientation and there does not appear to he an apparent impact of current density oil it. Analyses of the chronoamperograms indicate that the deposition process of aluminium on stainless steel was controlled by three-dimension nucleation with diffusion-controlled growth and there is a conversion from progressive nucleation to instantaneous nucleation.
