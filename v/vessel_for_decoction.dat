50|$|In large breweries, {{in which}} optimal {{utilization}} of the brewery equipment is economically necessary, {{there is at least}} one dedicated <b>vessel</b> <b>for</b> mashing. In <b>decoction</b> processes, there must be at least two. The vessel has a good stirring mechanism, a mash rake, to keep the temperature of the mash uniform, and a heating device that is efficient, but will not scorch the malt (often steam), and should be insulated to maintain rest temperatures for up to one hour. A spray ball for clean-in-place (CIP) operation should also be included for periodic deep cleaning. Sanitation is not a major concern before wort boiling, so a rinse-down should be all that is necessary between batches.|$|R
50|$|In {{decoction}} mashing, {{part of the}} mash {{is taken}} out of the mash tun and placed in a cooker, where it is boiled for a period of time. This caramelizes some of the sugars, giving the beer a deeper flavor and color, and frees more starches from the grain, making for a more efficient extraction from the grains. The portion drawn off <b>for</b> <b>decoction</b> is calculated so that the next rest temperature is reached by simply putting the boiled portion back into the mash tun. Before drawing off <b>for</b> <b>decoction,</b> the mash is allowed to settle a bit, and the thicker part is typically taken out <b>for</b> <b>decoction,</b> as the enzymes have dissolved in the liquid, and the starches to be freed are in the grains, not the liquid. This thick mash is then boiled for around 15 minutes, and returned to the mash tun.|$|R
50|$|A common {{example of}} an {{infusion}} is tea; most varieties of tea call for steeping the leaves in hot water, although some variants (e.g. Moroccan mint tea) call <b>for</b> <b>decoction</b> instead. Many herbal teas are prepared by infusion, as well; lemon, chamomile, senna, apple, ginger, rooibos, and a great many other plants are used individually or in combination. Herbal infusions in water and oil are both commonly used as herbal remedies. Coffee can also be made through infusion (as in a French press), but is more often made through percolation.|$|R
40|$|The {{gathering}} of ingredients <b>for</b> <b>decoctions</b> of traditional Chinese herbs still relies on manual dispensation, {{due to the}} irregular shape of many items and inconsistencies in weights. In this study, we developed an automatic dispensing system <b>for</b> Chinese herbal <b>decoctions</b> {{with the aim of}} reducing manpower costs and the risk of mistakes. We employed machine vision in conjunction with a robot manipulator to facilitate the grasping of ingredients. The name and formulation of the decoction are input via a human-computer interface, and the dispensing of multiple medicine packets is performed automatically. An off-line least-squared curve fitting method was used to calculate the amount of material grasped by the claws and thereby improve system efficiency as well as the accuracy of individual dosages. Experiments on the dispensing of actual ingredients demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system...|$|R
