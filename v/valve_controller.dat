5000|$|From the mid-1980s, Akai {{developed}} {{a range of}} wind synths. Their EWI-1000 wind controller and EVI-1000 <b>valve</b> <b>controller,</b> like the Lyricon, were paired with a dedicated analog, voltage-controlled voice module, the EWV-2000. The EWV-2000 had no MIDI IN, though it did have MIDI OUT. The EWI-1000/EWV-2000 pair were actually a hybrid digital/analog system. Analog signals were derived from the various sensors (e.g., key, bite, bend, etc.) on the EWI-1000 controller unit, then converted to digital signals by a front-end microprocessor in the EWV-2000. These digital signals were then altered by the microprocessor and D/A converted to internal analog control voltages appropriate for the analog synthesizer IC's within the EWV-2000. The D/A used within the EWV-2000 used a very high resolution and conversion rate, such that the responsiveness to the player felt immediate, i.e. [...] "analog." [...] The subsequent EWI-3000 and EWI-3020 systems also used this A/D/A scheme within their dedicated tone modules, though these later models of the EWI would support MIDI IN and OUT.|$|E
50|$|RoadRailers {{were built}} by the Bi-Modal Corporations in the early 1980s located in West Chester Pennsylvania. The {{trailers}} were {{built by the}} Budd Corporation locally with {{the integration of the}} wheelsets and railroad braking system done at the nearby Bi-Modal factory. This was a modern up-date of C&O's Railvan used in the 1950s. The railroad wheelsets attached to the aft portion of the trailer were lowed pneumatically by activating a simple <b>valve</b> <b>controller</b> on the left rear of the trailer. To transfer from highway mode to rail mode the trailer driver would position the trailer over tracks inlaid into a paved rail yard. First the operator would activate the valve to remove the air from the airbags that supported the trailer in the highway mode. In the fully lowered or squat position, hooks which held the railwheel set up above the road surface released. Then the operator would move the valve to inflate the two large airbags used for rail mode. These rail air bags were similar to those used in passenger rail cars at this time. After being fully transferred, the trailer would be fully level and ready for connection to the next trailer in the train. A similar system was trialed in the UK, though the concept did not prove successful, partly due to the reduction in load volume required to fit inside the UK's smaller loading gauge but also due to objections by the powerful rail and road transport unions.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a coordinated}} {{controller}} for multimachine power system transient stability enhancement is proposed. The controller {{consists of a}} nonlinear excitation controller and a fast <b>valving</b> <b>controller</b> for each generator. By employing the direct feedback linearization (DFL) technique, a decentralized nonlinear controller is found for multimachine power system excitation control. The excitation controller design problem for an n-machine system is converted to designing n controllers for n linearized and decoupled plants. Then, an optimal fast <b>valving</b> <b>controller</b> is designed to reduce the mechanical power input when sever fault occurs. In {{order to reduce the}} control cost, the fast valving loop is switched on for only a certain period after fault occurs. By the coordinated action of the two control inputs, transient stability of the system can be greatly enhanced. The proposed scheme is applied to a three-machine system. Simulation results show that power angle oscillations after large disturbance can be damped out rapidly. Simulation results also indicate that the performance of the proposed controller is robust against fault location, network variation and power transfer conditions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{diesel engine}} {{requires}} close tolerances {{to achieve its}} compression ratio. The air entering the engine must be clean, free of debris and as cool as possible. Also to improve engine’s efficiency, the compressed air must be cooled after being compressed. Development of Variable Countercurrent Distribution Control (VCDC) technology ensures proper air intake and exhaust system. In this regard, design of <b>valve</b> <b>controller</b> and most importantly valve mixer mechanism with fin arrangements has taken into consideration. <b>Valve</b> <b>controller</b> controls the intake airflow at a significant level and the valve mixture distributes the air {{to a form of}} streamline through the fin arrangements. There is no possibility of vortex generation which is important for smooth and linear flow of air inside the engine cylinder. A swirl combustion inside the combustion chamber take place that results uniform combustion, increase the flame propagation speed, overcoming the differences of turbulent flow, reduce the flame to burn, improves the function of the flame diffusion and serves to reduce the airflow noise. Pressure distribution ensures greater combustion pressure that results higher compression ratio as the air is compressed first and then the fuel injected which allow the IC diesel engine to be efficient...|$|E
