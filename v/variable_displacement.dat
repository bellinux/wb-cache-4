2500|$|In 1981 Alfa Romeo {{developed}} {{in collaboration with}} the University of Genoa a semi-experimental Alfetta version, fitted with a modular <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> engine and an electronic engine control unit. Called Alfetta CEM (Controllo Elettronico del Motore, or Electronic Engine Management), it was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The [...] 2.0-litre modular engine featured fuel injection and ignition systems governed by an engine control unit, which could shut off two of four cylinders as needed in order to reduce fuel consumption. An initial batch of ten examples were assigned to taxi drivers in Milan, to verify operation and performance in real-world situations. According to Alfa Romeo during these tests cylinder deactivation was found to reduce fuel consumption by 12% in comparison to a CEM fuel-injected engine without <b>variable</b> <b>displacement,</b> and almost by 25% in comparison to the regular production carburetted 2.0-litre. After the first trial, in 1983 a small series of 1000 examples was put on sale, offered to selected clients; 991 examples were produced. Despite this second experimental phase, the project had no further developments.|$|E
2500|$|Design {{changes to}} make the {{instrument}} more sensitive, simpler to read, and easier to transport resulted in variations such as the basin, siphon, wheel, cistern, Fortin, multiple folded, stereometric, and balance barometers. Fitzroy barometers combine the standard mercury barometer with a thermometer, {{as well as a}} guide of how to interpret pressure changes. [...] Fortin barometers use a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> mercury cistern, usually constructed with a thumbscrew pressing on a leather diaphragm bottom. [...] This compensates for displacement of mercury in the column with varying pressure. [...] To use a Fortin barometer, the level of mercury is set to the zero level before the pressure is read on the column. [...] Some models also employ a valve for closing the cistern, enabling the mercury column to be forced {{to the top of the}} column for transport. [...] This prevents water-hammer damage to the column in transit.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the static analysis of multilayered piezoelectric plates subjected to mechanical pressures and to ﬁeld loads such as electric potential and temperature. The Principle of Virtual Displacements {{has been extended}} to thermo-electro-mechanical cases by including the virtual internal electric and thermal works and by writing the opportune constitutive relations. The governing equations are given in terms of three main primary <b>variables</b> (<b>displacements,</b> electric potential and temperature) and they are solved in a closed-form solution. The primary variables are expanded in the thickness direction in both Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) and Layer-Wise (LW) form with higher orders of expansion. The models proposed enable to obtain a quasi- 3 D description of the static thermo-electro-mechanical analysis of multilayered plates and to analyze the effects of each physical ﬁeld involved. The limitations of classical theories for such analyses have also been discussed...|$|R

The basic constituents of these models are algebraic product/minimum AND, bounded sum/algebraic sum/maximum OR, algebraic product inference, three linear fuzzy control rules, and Center of Sums (CoS) defuzzification. Properties of all these models are investigated. It is shown that all these controllers are different nonlinear PI/PD controllers with their proportional and derivative gains changing with the inputs. The proposed models are significant and useful to control community as they are completely new and qualitatively different from those reported in the literature...|$|R

50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked pulleys, wheels or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> pump and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a fixed displacement pump and a <b>variable</b> <b>displacement</b> motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|E

The displacements can be modelled in both Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) or Layer Wise (LW) form, the temperature and the electric potential are always considered in LW form because of their higher spatial gradients. Independently of the multilayer approach, each variable can be expanded from linear to fourth order in the thickness direction. Comparisons between these reﬁned 2 D models and the classical ones are also proposed to show the main advantages and limitations.

The Carrera Unified Formulation {{has been used in}} order to generate refined models of any order, and both equivalent single layer (ESL) and layer-wise (LW) schemes have been adopted. A Navier-type solution has been employed and, as a result, only simply supported orthotropic plates have been considered. A linear temperature distribution along the thickness direction is considered. The purpose of this work is to establish the relevance of the <b>displacement</b> <b>variables</b> and to discard the irrelevant terms in order to obtain refined models with the same accuracy as full theories, but with a lower computational cost. The axiomatic/asymptotic technique has been employed. The effectiveness of each <b>displacement</b> <b>variable</b> has been measured considering the influence of several parameters, such as the length-to-thickness ratio (a/h), the stacking sequence and the kind of material (isotropic and orthotropic). The "best" reduced models have been proposed and their relative stress and displacement components distributions along the thickness direction have been discussed. It has been found that the relevance of each <b>displacement</b> <b>variable</b> is affected to a great extent by the problem considered. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the nature of the load (mechanical or thermal) leads to the necessity of retaining different <b>displacement</b> <b>variables</b> for a given problem...|$|R
