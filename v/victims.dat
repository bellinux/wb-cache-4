The hag tends to leave the <b>victim</b> alive, so as to use them again for their energy. However, if the <b>victim</b> struggles, the hag may take their skin, leaving the <b>victim</b> to suffer.

40|$|Background: The {{objectives}} were (a) {{to compare the}} general empathy abilities of men with intellectual disabilities (IDs) who {{had a history of}} sexual offending to men with IDs who had no known history of illegal behaviour, and (b) to determine whether men with IDs who had a history of sexual offending had different levels of specific <b>victim</b> empathy towards their own <b>victim,</b> in comparison to an unknown <b>victim</b> of sexual crime, and a <b>victim</b> of non-sexual crime, and make comparison to non-offenders. Methods: Men with mild IDs (N = 35) were asked to complete a measure of general empathy and a measure of specific <b>victim</b> empathy. All participants completed the <b>victim</b> empathy measure in relation to a hypothetical <b>victim</b> of a sexual offence, and a non-sexual crime, while additionally, men with a history of sexual offending were asked to complete this measure in relation to their own most recent <b>victim.</b> Results: Men with a history of sexual offending had significantly lower general empathy, and specific <b>victim</b> empathy towards an unknown sexual offence <b>victim,</b> than men with no known history of illegal behaviour. Men with a history of sexual offending had significantly lower <b>victim</b> empathy for their own <b>victim</b> than for an unknown sexual offence <b>victim.</b> <b>Victim</b> empathy towards an unknown <b>victim</b> of a non-sexual crime did not differ significantly between the two groups.

40|$|Past {{research}} on <b>victim</b> blaming {{has focused on}} (a) individual difference variables that may make a person more likely to endorse <b>victim</b> blame and (b) characteristics of the <b>victim</b> or situation that may elicit variations in <b>victim</b> blame. Little {{research has focused on}} examining the perceiver 2 ̆ 7 s motivation to blame a <b>victim,</b> which would elucidate the thought process that makes people blame others. The primary aim of the current project was to extend the <b>victim</b> blaming literature to assess different threats that may motivate a person to endorse <b>victim</b> blame. Bridging various theoretical perspectives (just world, terror management, and system justification), I examined the role of threats to a person 2 ̆ 7 s well-being (i. e., personal threat) and threats to a person 2 ̆ 7 s way of life (i. e., system threat) on perceptions of <b>victim</b> blame. It was hypothesized that making a threat salient would result in increases in <b>victim</b> blame, particularly when the type of <b>victim</b> reaffirmed the salient threat. Study 1 provided initial support for the link between threats to a person 2 ̆ 7 s way of life and blaming a wife for her husband 2 ̆ 7 s abuse. Study 2 tested specific conditions related to system threat and <b>victim</b> blame. This study was a between subjects experiment in which participants were primed with one type of threat (system threat, personal threat, control) and then asked to rate a <b>victim</b> that either reaffirmed the threat (system noncompliant <b>victim)</b> or was not related to the threat (system compliant <b>victim).</b> When a threat to the current system was made salient, a perceiver was more likely to blame the system noncompliant <b>victim.</b> Study 3 found similar results by assessing conditions related to personal threat. When a personal threat was made salient, a <b>victim</b> that reaffirmed the threat (a personally similar <b>victim)</b> was blamed more than a <b>victim</b> that was not related to the threat (a personally dissimilar <b>victim).</b> All three studies found that type of threat to a perceiver is an important variable that should be considered when assessing <b>victim</b> blame.
