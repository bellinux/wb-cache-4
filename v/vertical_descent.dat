25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed on}} 10 January 1964, on its 125th sortie, during a low-altitude hover. During a <b>vertical</b> <b>descent</b> the aircraft experienced uncontrollable divergent wing oscillations, the port wing eventually striking {{the ground at}} an acute angle with the aircraft rolling over because of the continued lift engine thrust. The loss was attributed to loss of control because the stabilising limits of the three-axis autostabilisation system's 'puffer pipes' were exceeded in roll. Although airframe damage was relatively light, the Centre D'Essai en Vol test pilot, Jacques Pinier, did not eject and died in the crash.|$|E

40|$|Data storage tags (DSTs) {{were applied}} to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) smolts during their seaward {{migration}} {{in the spring of}} 2002 at a fish counting fence on Campbellton River, Newfoundland. Our objectives were to discover whether or not salmon smolts could carry DSTs and survive, whether or not useful data on thermal habitat could be obtained and interpreted, and whether or not salmon smolts moved vertically in the water column. Data were downloaded from 15 of the recovered tags and revealed the hourly water temperatures experienced by the fish for periods of 3 to 71 days. The data on the DSTs were analyzed for temperature patterns in relation to migration behavior and diurnal movement of the fish. While in the sea, the DSTs recorded night temperatures of 12. 5 °C, which were higher than day temperatures of 11. 6 °C; the record from moored recorders, however, indicated that sea temperatures actually declined at night.

40|$|From the 1680 s onwards, Ferdinando Galli Bibiena (1657 - 1743) {{revolutionized}} {{the art of}} stage design by experimenting with a so-called “manner of seeing scenes from an angle”. The scena per angolo substituted the traditional, single-point perspective with two distance points and worm’s-eye views that rendered architectures in more monumental fashion than ever before. At the same time, the new system’s reliance on backdrops and wings that were placed irregularly, instead of symmetrically, restricted the illusionary compass of perspective to enclosed spaces, rather than ‘infinite’ vistas. It reduced the theater’s optical scope by limiting itself to horizontal slices of earthly reality, devoid of the celestial and infernal. Especially noteworthy {{is the fact that}} <b>vertical</b> <b>descents,</b> especially of dei ex machina, could only be implemented in Bibiena’s schemes at the cost of upsetting vertical proportions. Not that this defect complicated stagings of contemporary Italian opera.

Yet, operatic genres hinging on the marvelous through the deployment of machinery, most notably the tragédie en musique and the various forms of feste, held on to central perspective so as to allow divine descents. Evidence for this intriguing development can be gleaned from a rich array of visual and textual sources...|$|R
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{region of}} roughness, {{associated}} with the airflow conditions of the vortex-ring state, occurs when a helicopter is operating in vertical or near <b>vertical</b> <b>descents</b> {{in the range of}} about 500 and 1, 500 ft/min. The turbulent circulating air and the rapid changes in ~ local velocities in this flow pattern can cause serious helicopter handling difficulties. This could cause concern in a slow steep approach, particularly under instrument-flying conditions. This report describes flight experience in the vortex-ring conditions with the Sikorsky R- 4 B, R- 6 and S- 51, Bell 47 and Bristol 171 helicopters. It is shown that the helicopter behaviour varies from a mild wallowing on the best type to a complete loss of control on the worst case. These effects are due to the turbulent-flow changes in the vortex ring and the loss of control is thought to be caused by large changes in pitching moments on the fuselage with small displacements of the helicopter relative to the unusual flow pattern. 1. Introduction. [...] During descent of the helicopter in vertical flight or at very low forward speeds, Some peculiar stability and control phenomena have been observed, This behaviour appears to be {{associated with the}} type of airflow pertaining to these flight conditions in the vortex-ring state.

40|$|Flight {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} with a single-rotor helicopter {{to determine the effects}} of partial-power descents with forward speed, high-speed level turns, pull-outs from autorotation, and high-forward-speed high-rotor-speed autorotation on the flapwise bending and torsional moments of the rotor blade. One blade of the helicopter was equipped at 14 percent and 40 percent of the blade radius with strain gages calibrated to measure moments rather than stresses. The results indicate that the maximum moments encountered in partial-power descents with forward speed tend to be generally reduced from the maximum moments encountered during partid-power descents at zero forward speed. High-speed level turns and pull-outs from auto-rotation caused retreating-blade stall which produced torsional moments (values up to 2, 400 inch-pounds). at the 14 -percent-radius station that were as large as those encountered during the previous investigations of retreating-blade stall (values up t o 2, 500 inch-pounds). High-forward- speed high-rotor-speed autorotation produced flapwise bending moments (values up to 7, 200 inch-pounds) at the 40 -percent-radius station which were as large as the flapwise bending moments (values up to 7, 800 inch-pounds) a t the 14 -percent-radius station encountered during partial - power <b>vertical</b> <b>descents.</b> The results of the present investigation (tip-speed ratios up to 0. 325 and an unaccelerated level-flight mean lift coefficient of about 0. 6), in combination with the related results of at zero forward speed produce the largest rotor-blade vibratory moments. However, inasmuch as these large moments occur only during 1 percent of the cycles and 88 percent of the cycles are at moment values less than 70 percent of these maximum values in partial-power descents, other conditions, such as high-speed flight where the large moments are combined with large percentages of time spent,must not be neglected in any rotor-blade service-life assessment...|$|R

40|$|Any {{satellite}} launch {{mission is}} a complex and expensive process and great care and precautions {{need to be taken}} for a safe and successful launch. A lightning stroke can be hazardous to the satellite launch system. Therefore extensive care has to be taken to protect the satellite launch pad against lightning. The paper aims at evaluating the efficacy of the aerial receptor system of the lightning protection scheme employed for protecting the Indian satellite launch pad. Significant upward leader activities are expected from tall objects during the approach of the descending leader and therefore any method that is employed for evaluating their attractive radii must take into account the different process involving and connected with the breakdown of air. Among such models the Rizk model, originally developed for isolated towers and conductors, was found to be very appropriate for the present work. To apply it to the present problem many modifications were necessary; all the simulations were carried out using this modified model. The charge simulation method has been used for the computation of the electric field. Simulations with inclined downward leaders indicated that the <b>vertical</b> leader <b>descent</b> represents the worst case scenario, and hence all the calculations were carried out with a <b>vertical</b> leader <b>descent</b> only. The maximum current in a bypass stroke was found to be 14 kA and this occurs for a stroke descending vertically along a straight line directly above the launch vehicle. The total probability of bypass strokes was found to be in the range of one flash per 1095 - 510 years (for the value of Td which is reported to be between 50 - 90 thunderstorm-days per year). Similarly, the total number strokes to the protection system in an year was estimated to be less than two flashes per year. Further, some sensitivity analysis was also carried out to determine the dependency of bypass stroke on height of the protection system and total length of the descending leader. An attempt was also made to arrive at a rough estimate of maximum bypass current under positive lightning...|$|R

In the United States and Europe, these efforts are defined within the architectures of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Program and Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) Program respectively. Both programs have identified Airborne Spacing as a critical component, with Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) as a key enabler. Increased interest in reducing airport community noise and the escalating cost of aviation fuel {{has led to the}} use of Continuous Descent Arrival (CDA) procedures to reduce noise, emissions, and fuel usage compared to current procedures. To provide these operational enhancements, arrival flight paths into terminal areas are planned around continuous <b>vertical</b> <b>descents</b> that are closer to an optimum trajectory than those in use today. The profiles are designed to be near-idle descents from cruise altitude to the Final Approach Fix (FAF) and are typically without any level segments. By staying higher and faster than conventional arrivals, CDAs also save flight time for the aircraft operator. The drawback is that the variation of optimized trajectories for different types and weights of aircraft requires the Air Traffic Controller to provide more airspace around an aircraft on a CDA than on a conventional arrival procedure. This additional space decreases the throughput rate of the destination airport. Airborne self-spacing concepts have been developed to increase the throughput at high-demand airports by managing the inter-arrival spacing to be more precise and consistent using on-board guidance. It has been proposed that the additional space needed around an aircraft performing a CDA could be reduced or eliminated when using airborne spacing techniques...|$|R
