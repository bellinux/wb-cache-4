5|$|At the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships, with Bor as her guide, Perrine won {{a silver}} medal in the vision-impaired {{downhill}} event, the first one ever earned by an Australian woman at the event. She also earned bronze medals in the women’s vision impaired Super Combined and super-G events. At an August 2011 competition in Mt Hutt, New Zealand, she finished first in the women's super G <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> event. At the Winter Games IPC event at Coronet Peak that same month, she and Bor finished first in the women's slalom <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> event.|$|E
5|$|Bor is a {{guide for}} <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> skiers. In this role, he skis {{in front of the}} <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> skier and gives him or her {{direction}} to get down the course using speakers and a microphone. At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Bor served as an Australian assistant coach. In 2009, following those Games, he shifted his role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced further in the sport. He first skied with Perrine at a World Cup event in January 2010 where they finished fourth.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1871 in London as the Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind, {{the college}} {{had a number}} of homes before moving to its campus in Hereford; it was renamed the Royal National College for the Blind in the late 1970s. It has been a pioneer in the {{education}} of <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> people in Britain since the Victorian era, and, as of 2010, is the only college for <b>visually</b> <b>impaired</b> students in the United Kingdom to have been awarded Beacon Status in recognition of its outstanding teaching and learning.|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{visual acuity}} {{inability}} to distinguish {{detail in the}} distance (eg recognising bus numbers or watching TV) or close up viewing. Inability to read small print. Reduced contrast sensitivity inability to see well or read in dim light, increased glare. The consequences of reduced visual function, such as falls or depression/social isolation-which can be severe- should also be recognised. Symptoms of glare are especially relevant to drivers. 1. 2 Incidence & Prevalence The N London Eye Study provides prevalence data specifically for <b>visually</b> <b>impairing</b> cataract (i. e.

50|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, {{refractive}} clear lens exchange has become a more common procedure for correcting presbyopia. Refractive clear lens exchange is basically the same surgery as that was previously only designated for eyes with <b>visually</b> <b>impairing</b> cataract, however it is now performed in eyes without cataract (i.e. a clear lens) {{for the purposes of}} gaining independence from glasses. A significant advantage of Laser Blended Vision {{is that it does not}} involve a surgery that requires entering the inside of eye, a requirement for all other intraocular lens alternatives that involve either intraocular lens monovision or the use of multifocal intraocular lenses. In contrast, Laser Blended Vision is generally more accurate at hitting the refractive target than intaocular lenses, and if target is not achieved, it is adjustable by a simple enhancement procedure (again, without entering the eye).|$|R
40|$|Significant {{risks for}} visual {{impairment}} {{associated with increased}} intracranial pressure (VIIP) are incurred by microgravity spaceflight, especially long-duration missions. Impairments include decreased near visual acuity, posterior globe flattening, choroidal folds, optic disc edema and cotton wool spots. We hypothesize that microgravity-induced fluid shifts result in pathological changes within the retinal blood vessels that precede development of visual and other ocular impairments. Potential contributions of retinal vascular remodeling to VIIP etiology are therefore being investigated by NASAs innovative VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) software for two studies: (1) head-down tilt in human subjects before and after 70 days of bed rest, and (2) U. S. crew members before and after ISS missions. VESGEN analysis in previous research supported by the US National Institutes of Health identified surprising new opportunities to regenerate retinal vessels during early-stage, potentially reversible progression of the <b>visually</b> <b>impairing</b> and blinding disease, diabetic retinopathy...|$|R

40|$|Colobomata {{represent}} <b>visually</b> <b>impairing</b> ocular closure defects {{that are}} associated with a diverse range of developmental anomalies. Characterization of a chromosome 8 q 21. 2 -q 22. 1 segmental deletion in a patient with chorioretinal coloboma revealed elements of nonallelic homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining. This genomic architecture extends the range of chromosomal rearrangements associated with human disease and indicates that a broader spectrum of human chromosomal rearrangements may use coupled homologous and nonhomologous mechanisms. We also demonstrate that the segmental deletion encompasses GDF 6, encoding a member of the bone-morphogenetic protein family, and that inhibition of gdf 6 a in a model organism accurately recapitulates the proband’s phenotype. The spectrum of disorders generated by morpholino inhibition and the more severe defects (microphthalmia and anophthalmia) observed at higher doses illustrate the key role of GDF 6 in ocular development. These results underscore the value of integrated clinical and molecular investigation of patients with chromosomal anomalies...|$|R

5000|$|Tornadoes and {{outbreaks}} in the Dixie Alley region {{tend to have}} distinct characteristics {{than the}} more well known Tornado Alley. Tornadic storms in Dixie Alley are most often high precipitation supercells due to an increase of moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico. The Dixie Alley tornadoes accompanying the HP supercells are often partially or fully wrapped in rain <b>visually</b> <b>impairing</b> the tornadoes to storm chasers, law enforcement, and the public. Increases of warmth and instability in the Dixie Alley region impacts the times when tornadoes form. In the traditional tornado Alley, tornadoes often form {{in the late afternoon}} and early evening. Dixie Alley's instability can be maintained long after sunset due to being adjacent to the Gulf, increasing the frequency of nighttime strong tornadoes. There is a lack of a focused tornado season which can lead to complacency among residents of the region. The region occasionally has tornadoes much earlier than the general national peak from May and June, usually from February to Mid-April, and several notorious outbreaks have struck during the late winter and early spring and also in late fall. The complacency situation was noted after the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in February 2008 that hit the Dixie Alley killing 57 people, many people indicated that they had underestimated the threat of severe weather on that day since it was well before the peak of tornado season.|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} and {{contrast}} the uses and gratifications (sought and obtained) of the Internet for blind/visually impaired and deaf/hearing impaired individuals. The uses and gratifications approach integrates the different issues that surround disabled persons’ Internet use into one rich and coherent framework and therefore allows {{a better understanding}} of the relationship between benefits obtained from Internet use, underlying needs and the barriers that create gaps between the gratifications sought and obtained. Based on 21 in-depth interviews, our study shows that both <b>visually</b> and hearing <b>impaired</b> individuals use the Internet mostly for gathering information and for communicating with friends and family; meeting new people online was not a priority need. To a great extent these Internet uses are driven by the underlying need for independence and active agency. Although our <b>visually</b> and hearing <b>impaired</b> informants share this need, the two groups differ in the gratifications obtained from the Internet due to differential barriers that hinder their use. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Research by NASA has {{established}} that significant risks for visual impairment {{in association with}} increased intracranial pressure (VIIP) are incurred by microgravity spaceflight, especially long-duration missions. Impairments include decreased near visual acuity, posterior globe flattening, choroidal folds, optic disc edema, and cotton wool spots. Much remains to be learned about the etiology of VIIP before effective countermeasures can be developed. Contributions of retinal vascular remodeling to the etiology of VIIP {{have not yet been}} investigated, primarily due to the current lack of ophthalmic tools for precisely measuring progressive pathophysiological remodeling of the retinal microvasculature. Although ophthalmic science and clinical practice are now highly sophisticated at detecting indirect, secondary signs of vascular remodeling such as cotton wool spots that arise during the progression of retinal vascular diseases, methods for quantifying direct, primary vascular changes are not yet established. To help develop insightful analysis of retinal vascular remodeling for aerospace medicine, we will map and quantify by our innovative VESsel GENeration Analysis (VESGEN) software the remodeling status of retinal blood vessels in crew members before and after ISS missions, and in healthy human subjects before and after head-down tilt bed rest. For this proof-of-concept study, we hypothesize that pathophysiological remodeling of retinal blood vessels occurs in coordination with microgravity-induced fluid shifts prior to development of visual impairments. VESGEN analysis in previous research supported by the US National Institutes of Health identified surprising new opportunities to regenerate retinal vessels during early-stage progression of the <b>visually</b> <b>impairing,</b> potentially blinding disease, diabetic retinopathy...|$|R
