25|$|Ethyl acetate {{is formed}} in wine by the {{esterification}} of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels {{are more likely}} to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity.</b> It is a common microbial fault produced by wine spoilage yeasts, particularly Pichia anomala or Kloeckera apiculata. High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid in wine, often {{referred}} to as <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> (VA) or vinegar taint, can be contributed by many wine spoilage yeasts and bacteria. This can be from either a by-product of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera Acetobacter and Gluconobacter produce high levels of acetic acid. The sensory threshold for acetic acid in wine is >700mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|Most wine-producing {{countries}} have laws regulating the amount <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> permitted for wine available {{for sale and}} consumption.

The sensory attributes (initial foam, foam area persistence, bubble size, foam collar, and overall foam quality) improved with aging time. Likewise, the yeast strain positively influenced the assessment of initial foam, foam area persistence, number of bubble chains, and overall foam quality.

25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and browning of the wine's color. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that {{are not meant to}} be sparkling can be a sign of refermentation or malolactic fermentation happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive copper, iron or proteins that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration or as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> that can make a wine seem out of balance.|$|E
25|$|The {{acids in}} wine are an {{important}} component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine {{as well as the}} growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, butyric, lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity.</b> Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking.|$|E

The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and recognition threshold of the wine taster.

40|$|Abstract Emulsions, {{thermodynamically}} unstable mixtures, are dispersed {{systems in}} which one liquid is dispersed as droplets in a second immiscible phase. In most natural and processed foods, the immiscibility of water with lipids is overcomed by dispersing one phase as droplets into the other phase. The oil-in-water emulsions are highly stable. This is because some water-soluble surface-active agents and fine solid mineral particles are often adsorbed onto the oil droplets so that the emulsions are difficult to demulsify. In the present study we have determined some characteristics of oil-in-water emulsions obtained by three different types of oils: sun flower oil, olive oil and corn oil, and we have investigated the stabilization of these emulsions fortified with iron in the presence or {{in the absence of}} casein.

Olive pastes {{may be an}} interesting alternative to use this kind of raw material, helping companies to minimize losses and reduce the economic and environmental impact. Simultaneously to answer to this challenge and to the modern consumer demand of innovative products, the present study intended to develop an olive paste using as raw material fruits from a regional variety, Negrinha de Freixo (PDO). In order {{to develop a new}} olive paste with higher sensorial and nutritional value, several commercial olive pastes bought in Portuguese market were studied. Five green pastes and four black pastes were purchased: PV – Casa da Prisca (green); PP – Casa da Prisca (black); M – Maçarico; GV- Gallo(green); D – Despensa; S- Sacla; SO – Santa Olaia; T – Tojeira; GP- Gallo (black). To be noted that a great part of this samples were collected in the gourmet market. Physical, chemical and sensory properties were assessed. Physical parameters evaluated were: color, texture and syneresis. CIELab parameters were evaluated by using a colorimeter and results were expressed as the calculated c* and h*. Texture was determined by performing a TPA test using a TAXT 2 texture analyser. Texture measurements were taken as firmness (maximum force attained), cohesiveness and adhesiveness. Chemical parameters analysed were: pH, moisture content, total and <b>volatile</b> <b>acidities,</b> total phenols, fat content and ash. Descriptive and preference sensory tests were performed in the sensory laboratory of the Department of Food Science and Technology, ISA/UTL. The sensory evaluation was performed by a total of ten semi-trained judges (food engineering students and staff). All of them were non-smokers and their age ranged from 21 to 68 years old. The room, at 20 °C, was equipped with six isolated sensory booths. Panellists performed a descriptive test and were asked to analyse the samples for: olive taste, off taste, spreadability, homogeneity, particle size and general appearance. Sensory test results were subjected to the Friedman test. Physical, chemical and sensory results were submitted to the multivariate analysis, Principal Component (PCA) and Cluster analysis (CA) using “Statistica” v. 6. 1 software from Statsoft,Inc. As the variability of the results was too high It was not possible to establish a characteristic profile for this kind of products. The principal factors of differentiation between samples are the texture parameters. The two samples with higher score in descriptivesensorial analysis are the Tojeira and Casa da Prisca (black). Those pastes are characterized by medium (c. a 1 mm) to big particle size and marked olive taste. Aiming to improve the antioxidant value of the olive paste, fruits without elimination of oleuropein were used. However, the result is a product excessively bitter. So, sweetened olive fruits Negrinha de Freixo were used as raw material to produce the new paste, having as guide lines, the characteristics of the commercial preferred pastes. The formulation of the new product includes the same ingredients of Tojeira paste (olives, garlic and oregano) however the Tojeira paste, and all of others commercial samples studied include the addition of olive oil that was not necessary in the new paste, because Negrinha de Freixo used as raw material has a fat content high enough. The developed paste was characterized for the all the parameters analyzed for the commercial ones and microbial count for molds, yeasts, mesophiles and psychrophiles. All the sample of developed paste showed no microbial count, indicating that it is a stable product. This paste presents a lower salt content than the commercial pastes with higher sensorial score and was chosen by 80 % of the tasters...|$|R

The results demonstrated that acid tars are capable of leaching Significant levels of contaminants if disturbed, while the leaching level is Significantly lower under simulated groundwater flow in a model soil. The time scale to leaching stabilization was of the order of months in the model soil and is expected to significantly exceed that in the natural environment. To support this work a nubmber of analytical methods for determining physical and chemical properties of acid tars had to be adapted from standard techniques. These modified techniques are described in detail together with recommendations for data integration and correlation of all analyses to form a better understanding of acid tars and their potential environmental impact.

5000|$|Acetic acid - Considered a main {{component}} of <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> {{that can make}} a wine taste unbalanced and overly acidic. While acetic acid is the main volatile acid produced by yeast, trace amounts of butyric, formic and propionic acids can also be formed depending on the yeast strain. Most countries have wine laws setting the legal limit of <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity,</b> usually expressed as acetic acid, to 1200-2000 mg/L. Acetic acid can also lead {{to the development of the}} wine fault ethyl acetate which is characterized by a [...] "nail polish remover" [...] smell. However, small amounts of acetic acid are actually beneficial for the yeast as they use them to synthesis lipids in the cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|<b>Volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> test verifies {{if there}} is any steam distillable acids in the wine. Mainly present is acetic acid (the {{dominant}} component of vinegar), but lactic, butyric, propionic, and formic acid can also be found. Usually the test checks for these acids in a cash still, but there are other methods available such as HPLC, gas chromatography and enzymatic methods. The amount of <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> found in sound grapes is negligible, because it is a by-product of microbial metabolism. Because acetic acid bacteria require oxygen to grow, eliminating any air in wine containers as well as addition of sulfur dioxide will limit their growth. Rejecting moldy grapes also prevents possible problems associated with acetic acid bacteria. Use of sulfur dioxide and inoculation with a low-V.A. producing strain of Saccharomyces may deter acetic acid producing yeast. A relatively new method for removal of <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> from a wine is reverse osmosis. Blending may also help—a wine with high V.A. can be filtered (to remove the microbe responsible) and blended with a low V.A. wine, so that the acetic acid level is below the sensory threshold.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Film yeast like Candida (pictured) and Pichia {{can cover}} {{the surface of}} a wine with a film layer that not only {{consumed}} most of the free sulfur dioxide available to protect the wine but also produces high levels of acetic acid that will contribute to <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> in a wine.|$|E
5000|$|In wine tasting, {{there is}} a big {{distinction}} made between what is considered a flaw and a fault. Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive sulfur dioxide, <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity,</b> Brettanomyces or [...] "Brett aromas" [...] and diacetyl or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and recognition threshold of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> and Brettanomyces can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include acetaldehyde (except when purposely induced in wines like Sherry and Rancio), ethyl acetate and cork taint.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, wine {{used for}} the Eucharist must be valid and licit. Invalid wine would be any wine {{containing}} high levels of <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity</b> (vinegar) or made of non-grape fruits. Valid but illicit wines would be any containing water (amelioration), non-grapes sugars such as corn syrup, cane sugar, beet sugar and non-grape flavorings, and those wine fortified with grain alcohol and other non-grapes distilled spirits.|$|E
50|$|Ethyl acetate {{is formed}} in wine by the {{esterification}} of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels {{are more likely}} to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the <b>volatile</b> <b>acidity.</b> It is a common microbial fault produced by wine spoilage yeasts, particularly Pichia anomala or Kloeckera apiculata. High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.|$|E
