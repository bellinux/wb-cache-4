To {{understand why the}} viscosity is independent of pressure, consider two adjacent boundary layers (A and B) moving with respect to each other. The internal friction (the viscosity) of the gas {{is determined by the}} probability a particle of layer A enters layer B with a corresponding transfer of momentum. Maxwell's calculations show that the <b>viscosity</b> <b>coefficient</b> is proportional to the density, the mean free path, and the mean velocity of the atoms. On the other hand, the mean free path is inversely proportional to the density. So an increase in density due to an increase in pressure doesn't result in any change in viscosity.|$|E
