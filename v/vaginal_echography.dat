40|$|Aim of the study: We studied {{ovulation}} and pregnancy rates following follicular maturation by {{administration of}} pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{in women with}} hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA). Material and methods: A total of 31 patients presenting documented HA were treated between January 1989 and December 1995. One to six cycles {{for a total of}} 103 cycles were stimulated by GnRH administrated at a dose of 20 µg/pulse every 90 minutes in follicular phase, and every 120 minutes 3 - 5 days after the ovulation. Luteal phase was supported by 1000 IU HCG/ 48 h (Profasi, Serono). Each cycle was monitored using estradiol (E 2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH) assays and <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography.</b> Ovulation was confirmed when E 2 level > 0, 8 nmol/l was observed in the presence of an LH peak and when a follicle > 18 mm in diameter was observed by <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography.</b> When no male factor was observed (n= 18) sexual intercourse was recommended. In case (n= 13) of associated male infertility (number of normal or motile spermatozoa recovered < 5. 106) one insemination was performed 24 to 36 hours after the ovulation criteria have been observed. Results: Ovulation and pregnancy rates were respectively 81 % (n= 84) and 21 % (n= 22). Six (6 %) biochemical pregnancies were observed. Spontaneous abortion occurred in 7 (7 %) cases. Fourteen full term deliveries were obtained (15 %) and one pregnancy is ongoing. Conclusion: In our opinion, pulsatile GnRH is an efficient and safe treatment of anovulation in HA patients. Neither multiple pregnancy nor ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) have been observed. Pulsatile GnRH administration allows to obtain high rates of ovulation and conception...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report the}} {{diagnosis}} and management of an ectopic pregnancy (EP) developing in a caesarean section scar. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University medical school. PATIENT(S) : A patient with a previous history of two caesarean sections developing an EP. INTERVENTION(S) : Methotrexate (MTX) was administered locally under ultrasonographic guidance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Weekly screening of blood hCG levels and yolk sac resorption by endovaginal sonography. RESULT(S) : The diagnosis was suspected by <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography</b> and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Local injection of KCl and MTX provoked a progressive resorption of the pregnancy. Human chorionic gonadotropin was undetectable on day 82. CONCLUSION(S) : To prevent uterine rupture in cases of an EP developing in a caesarean section scar, a medical approach can be proposed...|$|E
40|$|Ovarian {{pregnancy}} {{is a rare}} condition. In article we report a case of ovarian pregnancy in a 42 -years old woman who had already undergone an ipsylateral tubectomy because of an extrauterine pregnancy. Even though the patient showed no symptoms, the inadequate rise of β hCG and the ultrasound scan were suspicious for an ovarian pregnancy which was later confirmed, intrapoeratively as well as patohistologically. Some repeated values of β hCG did not show enough rise up and <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography</b> revealed atypical anechoic mass placed on or in the right ovary. The anechoic mass seen at right ovary {{become more and more}} tipical for gestational sac. In combination with the fact, that the uterine cavity was empty, without echo-signs of  intrauterine pregnancy and becouse of her past experiance of extrauterine pregnancy, we soon decided to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy, which confirmed our suspicion. Gestational sac was laparoscopicaly removed. The ovary and ovarian tube on her left side were normal and without any changes of chronical inflamatory disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Ovulation and {{pregnancy}} rates following follicular maturation by {{administration of}} pulsatile gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) were studied {{in women with}} hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA). Nine patients were treated {{for a total of}} 32 cycles. Pulse of GnRH was administered at a dose of 20 µg/ 90 min during the follicular phase and 20 µg/ 120 min after ovulation for up to 5 days. Follicular growth was monitored using estradiol (E 2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH) assays and <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography.</b> Ovulation was confirmed by E 2 level > 0. 8 nmol/l, a follicle diameter ≥ 20 mm and a LH peak. The couples were proposed to have sexual intercourses during the next days; after several unsuccesful cycles some patients were inseminated with washed sperm. Ovulation occurred in 24 / 32 cycles (75. 0 %); seven pregnancies (29. 1 %) were achieved and five full term deliveries (5 / 7 = 57. 3 %). In conclusion, HA patients treated with a 20 µg pulse dose reach ovulation in 75. 0 % of the cycles. Compared to lower pulse doses, the stimulation length is reduced without leading to either multiple pregnancies or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) ...|$|E
40|$|The lifesaving {{treatment}} endured by {{cancer patients}} leads, in many women, to early menopause and subsequent infertility. In clinical situations for which chemotherapy {{needs to be}} started, ovarian tissue cryopreservation {{looks to be a}} promising option to restore fertility. In 1997, biopsy samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with stage IV Hodgkin's lymphoma and cryopreserved before chemotherapy was initiated. After her cancer treatment, the patient had premature ovarian failure. METHODS: In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy. FINDINGS: 5 months after reimplantation, basal body temperature, menstrual cycles, vaginal ultrasonography, and hormone concentrations indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Laparoscopy at 5 months confirmed the ultrasonographic data and showed the presence of a follicle at the site of reimplantation, clearly situated outside the ovaries, both of which appeared atrophic. From 5 to 9 months, the patient had menstrual bleeding and development of a follicle or corpus luteum with every cycle. 11 months after reimplantation, human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations and <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography</b> confirmed a viable intrauterine pregnancy, which has resulted in a livebirth. INTERPRETATION: We have described a livebirth after orthotopic autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue. Our findings suggest that cryopreservation of ovarian tissue should be offered to all young women diagnosed with cancer...|$|E
40|$|Intravenous pump {{administration}} (Zyklomat, Ferring) of GnRH (Lutrelef, Ferring) {{has been}} used to induce ovulation in 16 patients suffering from hypothalamic amenorrhea between January 1989 and December 1991. One to 6 cycles were performed for a total of 47 cycles. GnRH pulses were set at 20 micrograms/pulse every 90 min up during the follicular phase and decreased to 1 pulse/ 120 min during the 3 - 5 days following ovulation. Thereafter, the luteal phase was supported by 1000 IU HCG/ 48 h up {{to the end of the}} 5 th week. Response to the treatment was monitored with seriC E 2, P and LH and <b>vaginal</b> <b>echography.</b> Cycles (N = 3) were cancelled when E 2 did not reach at least 0. 25 nmol/l after 30 days. An E 2 level > 0. 8 nmol/l, associated with a mature follicle (> 20 mm), and the presence of a LH peak or an increased progesterone level were used to determine the day of ovulation. In case of normozoospermy (N = 9), sexual intercourse was recommended to the patients (27 cycles), whereas an intrauterine insemination was performed in case of a male factor (N = 7, 20 cycles). Results can be summarized as follows: 39 (83 %) cycles were ovulatory and led to 9 (19 %) clinical and 6 (13 %) biochemical pregnancies. Five (8. 5 %) pregnancies aborted and 5 (11 %) came to full term. After exclusion of the male factors, the pregnancy rate reaches 26 %/initiated cycle, 28 %/ovulatory cycle and 56 %/patient. No patient developed a hyperstimulation syndrome or a multiple pregnancy. Three cycles (6. 3 %) were interrupted due to 2 superficial phlebitis and 1 pump failure.
