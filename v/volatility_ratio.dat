To take an extreme example, something may have a beta of zero {{even though it is}} highly volatile, provided it is uncorrelated with the market.

50|$|The {{relative}} <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio</b> {{described above}} is actually known as Total Beta (at least by appraisers who practice business valuation). Total beta {{is equal to}} the identity: beta/R or the standard deviation of the stock/standard deviation of the market (note: the relative volatility). Total beta captures the security's risk as a stand-alone asset (because the correlation coefficient, R, has been removed from beta), rather than part of a well-diversified portfolio. Because appraisers frequently value closely held companies as stand-alone assets, total beta is gaining acceptance in the business valuation industry. Appraisers can now use total beta in the following equation: total cost of equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta&middot;equity risk premium. Once appraisers have a number of TCOE benchmarks, they can compare/contrast the risk factors present in these publicly traded benchmarks and the risks in their closely held company to better defend/support their valuations.|$|E

Weekly index prices are collected spanning from January 5, 2001 to January 27, 2012, a total of 578 observations. Current study firstly used the best-fitted ARMA-GARCH model on each stock market and then utilized the diagonal AG-DCC model to derive the dynamic conditional correlations. The empirical finding suggests an overall regional factor denoted by PIIGS volatility (or <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio)</b> and a global factor by the U. S. counterpart during the Eurozone debt crisis. The finding of negative correlation between correlations and volatilities (or <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio),</b> mainly attributed to the PIIGS, is not in line with that of Cappiello, Engle, and Sheppard (2006). Moreover, the correlations of Germany with the other equity markets are not explained by the regional factor but by the global factor.

40|$|Illiquidity is at {{the core}} of the various {{currency}} and banking/financial crises of the 1990 s. In the wake of the Asian crisis of 1997 / 98 the term "systemic liquidity" has been coined to refer to adequate arrangements and practices which permit efficient liquidity management and which provide a buffer during financial distress. A constructed balance-sheet-based variable that captures the essence of the risk from systemic liquidity is funding <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio,</b> FVR. Using data covering January 1990 to July 2003 and employing cointegration techniques, this study attempts to quantify the purported link between FVR and the measurable determinants of a balanced liquidity infrastructure for Indonesia, the country that suffered the most from the Asian crisis. A good fit is obtained for the dynamic regression model and estimates of short-run and long-run impacts and elasticities are computed. FVR is shown to be increasing in the rupiah-US dollar exchange rate, the Jakarta stock market index, interest rate and the number of banks, and decreasing in capital:asset ratio and foreign liabilities: total asset ratio. The best option for lowering the FVR in the short run is increasing bank capital; over the long term enduring increases in foreign-currency accounts and reduction in the number of banks seem to hold the best prospect for lowering the FVR. autoregressive distributed lag model, cointegration, funding <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio,</b> systemic liquidity, Financial Economics, C 22,...|$|E

40|$|As {{has been}} widely observed, the {{volatility}} of GDP has declined since the mid- 1980 s compared with prior years. One leading explanation for this decline is that monetary policy improved significantly in the later period. We utilize a cross-section of 2 -digit manufacturing and trade industries to further investigate this explanation. Since a major channel through which monetary policy operates is variation in the federal funds rate, we hypothesized that industries that are more interest sensitive should have experienced larger declines in the variance of their outputs in the post- 1983 period. We estimate interest-sensitivity measures for each industry {{from a variety of}} VAR models and then run cross-sectional regressions explaining industry <b>volatility</b> <b>ratios</b> as a function of their interest-sensitivity measures.

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, an {{extensive}} empirical literature has investegated {{the relationship between}} the US fiscal and trade deficits without reaching any consensus. Two elements may account for these conflicting results. First, considering data in levels versus stationarized data has an impact on conclusions. Moreover, the link between the US next exports and govenment balance, whether stationarized or not, is unsteady. This lack of robustness may stem from changes in the relative contribution of demand and supply shocks in the US economy : demand shocks generate a positive correlation between trade and fiscal deficits while supply shocks imply a negative relationship between both series. In order to check empirical relevance of this intuition, I use a standard Real Business Cycle model. With varying estimated <b>volatility</b> <b>ratios</b> of supply and demand shocks, the model succeeds in matching the switching magnitude of the correlation between the US balance of trade and fiscal deficits over each sub-sample except the 1990 s. ...|$|R

The contribution {{of this research is}} giving investors a comprehensive analysis of ETFs in emerging markets by comparing the performance of ETFs in three periods including before, during, and after the financial crisis. In our analysis, we employ four approaches to discover the return characteristics and main source of volatility of emerging-market ETFs by analyzing <b>volatility</b> <b>ratios,</b> return and <b>volatility</b> correlations, asymmetric comovement and the impact on location of trade. Results indicate that emerging-market ETF returns are more volatile during exchange trading hours than during non-trading hours. The results of higher overnight volatility of Asian market ETFs and higher daytime volatility of American market ETFs provide evidence that the main source of volatility of emerging-market ETFs is public information released in each local market. Furthermore, during financial crisis, the emerging-market ETF returns are relatively stable and the correlations between emerging-market ETFs and U. S. market ETFs are significantly high. Moreover, there is no asymmetric comovement between emerging market ETFs and U. S. market ETFs in the complete sample period. In addition, U.

40|$|Abstract. Prediction of {{isobaric}} vapour ^ liquid equilibria (VLE) {{of solvent}} (1) solvent (2) salt (3) ternary systems {{is carried out}} with a semi-empirical model proposed by Häla. The value of the exponent b in Häla's equation is treated as a fixed common value defined {{by the kind of}} salt (CaCl 2, NaI, and NH 4 I). The b values are determined by isothermal VLE data of fifteen ternary systems containing salt. Other constants in the Häla equation are also determined from the data of VLE and vapour pressure of three binary mixtures, constructing a ternary system. Iso-baric VLE of five ternary systems are predicted within the average deviation of 4 : 2 % in vapour phase composition and 1 : 0 % in temperature. The linear relationship between the ratio of the short-range interaction constant of the Wilson parameter [ln (L 23 =L 13) ] and the relative <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio</b> [ln (as=a) ] of a binary mixture containing salt are observed; the relationship is independent of the kind of salt. ...|$|E

40|$|New {{evidence}} is provided {{to assess the}} recent controversy regarding the volatility of real economic activity before 1929 relative to the period since World War II. Some recent work claims that the longstanding stylized fact of greater prewar volatility is "spurious". In contrast, this paper reconfirms the greater amplitude of business fluctuations prior to the Great Depression. The basic technique is the regression method, which estimates equations for real GNP during 1909 - 38, {{with one or more}} explanatory variables for components of GNP, and then uses the estimated coefficients to "backcast" real GNP or the period 1869 - 1908. The paper contains an extensive examination of the sensitivity of these regression indexes to alternative dependent variables, sample periods, detrending methods, and the inclusion of alternative explanatory variables. Particular attention is paid to the conflicting evidence regarding the amplitude of cycles in construction activity between 1870 and 1890. The resulting prewar/postwar volatility ratios, for 1869 - 1928 as compared to 1950 - 1980, range from 1. 43 to 2. 16. The paper concludes by suggesting that this range of volatility ratios is more likely to understate than overstate the prewar/postwar <b>volatility</b> <b>ratio.</b> ...|$|E
