5000|$|According to <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> enthusiasts, Parker Quink is {{generally}} considered to be [...] "safe <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> ink"; this means that it should not stain or clog <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> very easily.|$|R

50|$|The dip pen {{has certain}} {{advantages}} over a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b> It can use waterproof, pigmented, particle-and-binder-based inks, such as India ink, drawing ink, and acrylic inks—each {{of which would}} destroy a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> by clogging it—and the traditional iron gall ink, which can corrode <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b> Dip pens are also more sensitive to variations of pressure and speed, producing a line that naturally varies in thickness; and they can also produce a finer line than any <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b>|$|R

50|$|In <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> the nib is an {{important}} element. But {{the quality of the}} <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> also primarily depends {{on the quality of the}} other parts. According to experience, more repairs are made on the holder than on the nibs for the <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b> For this reason, consumers pay attention not only to the quality of the nib but also to the quality of the holder (the feed system, the ink regulating system). That is why these parts of a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> are not considered subsidiary parts. Thus, a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> may not be marked as a Swiss product if only the nib has been manufactured in Switzerland.|$|R
5000|$|While {{no longer}} the primary writing {{instrument}} in modern times, <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> are still used for important official works such as signing valuable documents. Today, <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> are often treated as luxury goods and sometimes as status symbols. <b>Fountain</b> <b>pens</b> may serve as an everyday writing instrument, much like the common ballpoint pen. Good quality steel and gold pens are available inexpensively today, particularly in Europe and China, where there are [...] "disposable" [...] <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> such as the Pilot Varsity. In France, in particular, the use of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> is well spread. To avoid mistakes, special ink can be used {{that can be made}} invisible by applying an ink eraser.|$|R

5000|$|De La Rue {{claims to}} have {{developed}} the first practical <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> in 1881 and was a leading manufacturer of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> in Britain. Products were marketed under the [...] "Onoto" [...] brand. Production of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> by De La Rue ceased in Britain in 1958 but continued {{for a few more}} years in Australia.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, {{refinements}} in {{ballpoint pen}} production gradually ensured its dominance over the <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> for casual use. Although cartridge-filler <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> {{are still in}} common use in France, Italy, Germany, Austria, India, and the United Kingdom, and are widely used by young students in most private schools in England {{and at least one}} private school in Scotland, a few modern manufacturers (especially Montblanc, Graf von Faber-Castell and Visconti) now depict the <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> as a collectible item or a status symbol, rather than an everyday writing tool. However, <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> continue to have a following among many who view them as superior writing instruments due to their relative smoothness and versatility. Retailers continue to sell <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> and inks for casual and calligraphic use.|$|R
50|$|While {{a student}} in Paris, Romanian Petrache Poenaru invented the <b>fountain</b> <b>pen,</b> which the French Government {{patented}} in May 1827. <b>Fountain</b> <b>pen</b> patents and production then increased in the 1850s.|$|R
50|$|Traditional iron gall inks {{intended}} for dip pens are {{not suitable for}} <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> that operate {{on the principle of}} capillary action. Ferrogallic deposit accumulation in the feed system can clog the small ink passages in <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> feeds. Further, very acidic traditional iron gall inks {{intended for}} dip pens can corrode metal pen parts (a phenomenon known as redox reaction/flash corrosion). These phenomena can destroy the functionality of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{pigmented}} inks {{do exist}} for <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> {{but these are}} uncommon. Normal India ink cannot be used in <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> because it contains shellac as a binder which would very quickly clog such pens.|$|R
50|$|The Waterman pen {{company is}} a major {{manufacturer}} of luxury <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b> Established in 1884 in New York City by Lewis Edson Waterman, {{it is one of}} the few remaining first-generation <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> companies, as Waterman S.A..|$|R
50|$|<b>Fountain</b> <b>pens</b> {{can serve}} various artistic {{purposes}} such as expressive penmanship and calligraphy, {{pen and ink}} artwork, and professional art and design. Many users also favor the air of timeless elegance, personalization and sentimentality associated with <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> which computers and ballpoint pens seem to lack, and often state that once they start using <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> ballpoints become awkward to use due to the extra motor effort needed and lack of expressiveness.|$|R
50|$|Graf von Faber-Castell {{offers a}} variety of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b> Graf von Faber-Castell <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> employ a cartridge/converter filling system, which allows the pen to be filled with ink using either an ink bottle or with self-contained, hassle free cartridges. The models offered {{come in a variety of}} finishes, such as wood, {{lacquered}} metal, amongst other finishes. <b>Fountain</b> <b>pen</b> nibs are either 18K gold nibs, or polished stainless steel with a hard-wearing iridium metal tip.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> {{manufacturers}} {{also provide}} a brand of ink. For example, Parker sells 'Quink', and Sheaffer sells 'Skrip', while manufacturers like Waterman, Lamy, Pelikan, and MontBlanc sell ink under the same branding as their <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b> The recent resurgence of <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> use has also created a market for companies that specialize in ink, such as the British company Diamine and the American company Noodler's Ink. These manufacture ink in dozens of different colours.|$|R

500|$|Iridium–osmium alloys {{were used}} in <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> nib tips. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold. Since 1944, the famous Parker 51 <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> was fitted with a nib tipped by a {{ruthenium}} and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> is still conventionally called [...] "iridium", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as ruthenium, osmium and tungsten have taken its place.|$|R
5000|$|News outlets report that, {{rather than}} declining, <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> {{sales have been}} {{steadily}} rising over the last decade. [...] There is a clear resurgence in the appeal {{and culture of the}} <b>fountain</b> <b>pen,</b> whether for purposes of collection, enjoyment or as a [...] "lifestyle item". Many agree that the [...] "personal touch" [...] of a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> has led to such a resurgence with modern consumers looking for an alternative in a world of digital products and services.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fountain</b> <b>pens</b> are not {{as tightly}} coupled with their inks as ballpoints or gel pens are, yet some {{care must be taken}} when {{selecting}} their inks. Contemporary <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> inks are almost exclusively dye-based because pigment particles usually clog the narrow passages.|$|R

50|$|In 1964, Pilot Corporation {{introduced}} the Capless. Unlike other <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> during its time, the Pilot Capless featured a fully retractable nib.

5000|$|Traditional iron gall inks {{intended}} for dip pens are {{not suitable for}} <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> as they will corrode the pen (a phenomenon known as flash corrosion) and destroy the functionality of the <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b> [...] Instead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for <b>fountain</b> <b>pens.</b> These modern iron gall inks contain {{a small amount of}} ferro gallic compounds, but are gentler for the inside of a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen,</b> but can still be corrosive if left in the pen for a long period. To avoid corrosion on delicate metal parts and ink clogging a more thorough than usual cleaning regime - which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water - is sometimes advised by manufacturers or resellers.|$|R

50|$|Many Lamy <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> models {{share the}} same type of feed and nib. Most use Fe-Ni-Cr {{stainless}} steel alloy Z 50 nibs which can be interchanged by the user.The feeds are made of ABS plastic and after injection molding are chemically etched with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The etching process causes micro surface scratches by removing styrene from the feed surface and ink channels. This roughening optimizes ink flow characteristics over the feed surface.The 2000 <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> model uses nibs of another type which is incompatible with Lamy's other <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> models.|$|R
