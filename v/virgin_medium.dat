40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the development of recycled HDPE blends with improved SCR for low pressure pipe containing the maximum possible portion of post consumer recycled HDPE. A post consumer recycled High Density Polyethylene (R-HDPE) was blended with <b>virgin</b> <b>Medium</b> Density Polyethylene (MDPE), over the composition range of 0 - 100 %. The recycled HDPE has limited post-consumer applications due to its poor stress crack resistance (SCR). Resistance to SCR of the compositions was determined by the Notched Constant Tensile Stress Test (NCLS). Results indicate that there is potential to incorporate the use of Post consumer HDPE in low pressure pipe applications at composition greater than 50 %...|$|E
40|$|We have {{monitored}} the behaviour of different polyethylene foils including <b>virgin</b> <b>medium</b> density polyethylene (MDPE), MDPE containing pro-oxydative additives (238, 242) and MDPE with pro-oxydative additives and thermoplastic starch (297) {{in the soil}} {{for a period of}} one year. A foil based on a blend of polyester and polylactic acid (BASF Ecovio) served as degradable control. The experiment was carried out by weekly measurements of conductivity and capacity of the soil, since the setup was analogous to a condenser, of which the insulating layer was the foil itself. The twelve replications allowed monthly sampling; the specimen taken out from the soil each month were tested visually for thickness, mechanical properties, morphological and structural changes, and molecular mass. Based on the obtained capacity values, we found that among the polyethylene foils, the one that contained thermoplastic starch extenuated the most. This foil had the greatest decrease in tensile strength and elongation at break due to the presence of thermoplastic starch. The starch can completely degrade in the soil; thus, the foil had cracks and pores. The polyethylene foils that contained pro-oxydant additives showed smaller external change compared to the virgin foil, since there was no available UV radiation and oxygen for their degradation. The smallest change occurred in the virgin polyethylene foil. Among the five examined samples, the commercially available BASF foil showed the largest extenuation and external change, and it deteriorated the most in the soil...|$|E
40|$|Background: Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) – Healthy co. {{have a lot}} of {{saturated}} fatty acid, dominated with Medium Chain Fatty Acid (MCFA) especially lauric acid. In body, MCFA directly enter to portal circulations and convert into energy Adenosin Tri Phosphate (ATP). The objective {{of this study is to}} prove if virgin coconut oil can influence the trigliseride and total cholesterol serum of wistar after induction of atherogenesis. Method: An experimental study using post test only control group design. The sample were 16 male aged 20 weeks Wistar, with simple random sampling allocated into two groups (group I and II). Group I as control and group II that was treatment group, given vco with a dose of 0, 00345 ml/gr BW. On the 56 th day, the blood were taken from all wistar then have measured. The collected data was primary data from the result of measurement of trigliseride serum with GPO methode and total cholesterol with CHOD-PAP method. This data were analyzed by independent T-test. Result: It was shown in this study that the trigliseride and total cholesterol serum of the treaten group was significantly lower than control (p< 0, 01). Conclusion: The administering of vco in 4 weeks can decrease the trigliseride and cholesterol total serum of wistar by the dose of 0, 00345 ml/grBW/day.

40|$|Microemulsions are optical {{transparent}} {{or slightly}} opalescent colloidal systems {{with a mean}} droplet diameter between 10 and 100 nm. They can be prepared by using low energy methods, {{such as that of}} phase inversion temperature (PIT). Microemulsions have been indicated as an efficient tool to delivery lipophilic molecules, such as colorant or bioactive molecules, into foods due to their capacity to improve the solubility and the stability of the loaded compound. This research was addressed to develop transparent microemulsions by PIT method delivering curcumin and β-carotene. To this aim, different oils (i. e. extra <b>virgin</b> olive oil, <b>medium</b> chain triacylglycerols and peanut oil) were considered as bioactive molecule carrier into microemulsions. The systems were characterized by recording the visual transparency and by determining the mean droplet size. Afterwards, the photostability of curcumin and β-carotene in microemulsions was studied during storage at 20 °C under increasing light intensity from 0 to 6000 lx. Data were elaborated by using the most appropriate kinetic models. Results evidenced that the lipid type greatly affected the emulsion physical stability as well as the photostability of β-carotene and curcumin. In particular, the photostability of β-carotene was higher than that of curcumin in all considered systems. Moreover, the presence of extra virgin olive oil in the emulsion allowed to decrease the degradation rate of oxidation of both bioactives probably due to the presence of natural antioxidants. These findings appear of considerable interest in the attempt to design efficient delivery systems to be exploited in food formulations...|$|R
