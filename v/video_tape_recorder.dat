The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 video switcher all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogue}} {{audio recording}} a tachometer is {{a device that}} measures the speed of audiotape as it passes across the head. The reel-to-reel format {{was used in the}} very earliest magnetic tape sound recorders, including the pioneering German Magnetophon machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic tape recorders used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape cartridges or cassettes such as the endless loop cartridge, Fidelipac, developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the full size cassette, developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the compact cassette developed by Philips in 1962, originally for dictation. Reel-to-reel tape was also used in early tape drives for data storage on mainframe computers, <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> (VTR) machines, and high quality analog audio recorders, which have been in use from the early 1940s, up until the present.|$|E
2500|$|Television {{also was}} under early {{development}} during these decades (1890s–1920s), {{but even after}} commercial TV began widespread adoption after World War II, it remained a live-only medium for a time. In the mid-1950s, a commercialized ability to capture the moving pictures of television onto magnetic tape (with a <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder)</b> was developed. This soon led to {{the addition of the}} [...] prefix to the words fluorography and fluoroscopy, with the words videofluorography and videofluoroscopy attested since 1960. In the 1970s, video tape moved from TV studios and medical imaging into the consumer market with home video via VHS and Betamax, and those formats were also incorporated into medical video equipment.|$|E

50|$|In general, a live {{television}} program was more common for broadcasting content produced specifically for commercial {{television in the}} early years of the medium, before technologies such as <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> appeared. As <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> (VTR) became more prevalent, many entertainment programs were recorded and edited before broadcasting rather than being shown live.|$|R

50|$|Video {{technology}} was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing {{one of the first}} practical <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> (VTR). In 1951 the first <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> captured live images from television cameras by converting the camera's electrical impulses and saving the information onto magnetic video tape.|$|E

5000|$|Videotape is {{magnetic}} tape used for storing video and usually sound in addition. Information stored {{can be in}} the form of either an analog signal or digital signal. Videotape is used in both <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> (VTRs) or, more commonly, videocassette recorders (VCRs) and camcorders. Videotapes are also used for storing scientific or medical data, such as the data produced by an electrocardiogram.|$|R
25|$|For the {{magnetic}} tape sound recording Kornél Tolnai used magnetic tape {{as a medium}} for magnetic recording, made of a thin magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic. Most audio, video and computer data storage is this type. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and <b>video</b> using magnetic <b>tape</b> are <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> and later on <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recorders.</b> A device that stores computer data on magnetic tape is a tape drive (tape unit, streamer).|$|R
