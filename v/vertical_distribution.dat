Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their composition is still unknown. In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{study has}} been made of the <b>vertical</b> <b>distributions</b> and migrations {{of a large number of}} {{zooplankton}} species at Weather Station "P" in the Subarctic Pacific. Simultaneously towed horizontal opening-closing nets were used for the study. The distributions and migrations of 104 taxa have been subjectively grouped into seven basic patterns. A few taxa could not be so grouped. Examination of hydrographic features reveals correlations between animal distributions and strong hydrographic gradients. It is concluded that: 1.

The ageostrophic wind component is the difference between actual and geostrophic wind, which is responsible for air [...] "filling up" [...] cyclones over time. The gradient wind is similar to the geostrophic wind but also includes centrifugal force (or centripetal acceleration).|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Wijnberg {{and colleagues}} {{reported}} {{the presence of}} several structurally related antifungal compounds called benzoxepines in the latex of Mycena galopus. One of these compounds, 6-hydroxypterulone, is a derivative of pterulone, a potent antifungal metabolite first isolated from submerged cultures of Pterula species in 1997. The antifungal activity of pterulone is based on selective inhibition of the NADH dehydrogenase enzyme of the electron transport chain. A 2008 publication reported that fatty acid esters of benzoxepine serve as precursors to wound-activated chemical defense. When the fruit body is injured and the latex is exposed, an esterase enzyme (an enzyme that splits esters into an acid and an alcohol in a chemical reaction with water called hydrolysis) presumably cleaves the inactive esterified benzoxepines into their active forms, where they can help defend the mushroom against yeasts and parasitic fungi. In nature, the mushroom is rarely attacked by parasitic fungi, however, it is prone to infection by the [...] "bonnet mold" [...] Spinellus fusiger, which is insensitive to the benzoxepines of M.galopus. In an English field study, where the two fungi M.galopus and Marasmius androsaceus made up over 99% of the fruit bodies in a site under Sitka spruce, the fungivorous collembolan arthropod Onychiurus latus preferred to graze on the mycelium of M.androsaceus. This selective grazing influences the <b>vertical</b> <b>distribution</b> of the two fungi in the field.|$|E

Dust modulates the thermal structure of the atmosphere and thus greatly influences atmospheric circulation. Clouds provide radiative forcing and control the net hemispheric transport of water through the alteration of the <b>vertical</b> <b>distributions</b> of water and dust. Recent advancements in the quality and sophistication of both climate models and observations enable an increased understanding of how the coupling between the dust and water cycles (through cloud formation) impacts the dust and water cycles.
