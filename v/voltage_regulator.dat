5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process of finding a {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in a marginal branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. If {{a new class of}} locomotives was to be built, it would have to satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started investigating whether any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the train weight to increase to , but the train had the steps for the <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be prioritized for branch lines.|$|E
5|$|Herta retired on lap 55 when {{he slowed}} on the frontstrech after his car {{developed}} a <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> problem which caused his engine to cut out. Da Matta moved back into first {{place on the}} next lap, but Gidley reclaimed the position four laps later. Tracy slowed on the backstraight on lap 64 and drove to pit road to retire {{with a loss of}} engine power. On the 72nd lap, Vasser took over the lead from Papis. Franchitti lost engine power after leaving turn one and drove down the backstraight to retire, necessitating the second caution. All drivers chose to make pit stops under caution. The race resumed on lap 80 with da Matta passing Castroneves to move back into first place. Da Matta fell to fourth after he was passed by Vasser around the outside of turn one and Castroneves moved into second five laps later. Papis retook the first position on lap 86. Castroneves pulled off the track at turn four and stopped at the pit road exit to retire with an engine failure on the following lap. Mears moved into the lead on lap 87, but lost it to Papis two laps later. Da Matta and Papis traded the first position over laps 91 to 98. Tagliani took over the lead on the 99th lap.|$|E

25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> or voltage doubler circuits, {{low-cost}} metallized {{polyester film}} capacitors provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, film capacitors with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, film capacitors {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|E
25|$|A {{varistor}} {{provides no}} equipment protection from inrush current surges (during equipment startup), from overcurrent (created {{by a short}} circuit), or from voltage sags (also known as a brownout); it neither senses nor affects such events. Susceptibility of electronic equipment to these other power disturbances is defined by {{other aspects of the}} system design, either inside the equipment itself or externally by means such as a UPS, a <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> or a surge protector with built-in overvoltage protection (which typically consists of a voltage-sensing circuit and a relay for disconnecting the AC input when the voltage reaches a danger threshold).|$|E
25|$|Many simple DC power {{supplies}} regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a shunt regulator {{such as a}} Zener diode, avalanche breakdown diode, or <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate and evaluate the thermal implications of high power density on-chip <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators.</b> This paper is a first attempt to high-light the importance of the number, size, and location of on-chip <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> on the thermal hotspots and thermal gradient. The physical location of on-chip <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> is explored to distribute the hotspot locations and achieve spatial low pass filtering of the hotspots. A new thermal-aware physical design and power management technique are proposed to spatially and temporally distribute the hotspot locations over the cooler areas within an integrated circuit.

25|$|Early {{automobile}} {{generators and}} alternators had a mechanical <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> using one, two, or three relays and various resistors {{to stabilize the}} generator's output at slightly more than 6 or 12 V, independent of the engine's rpm or the varying load on the vehicle's electrical system. Essentially, the relay(s) employed pulse width modulation to regulate {{the output of the}} generator, controlling the field current reaching the generator (or alternator) and in this way controlling the output voltage producing back into the generator and attempting to run it as a motor. The rectifier diodes in an alternator automatically perform this function so that a specific relay is not required; this appreciably simplified the regulator design.|$|E
25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would see too small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
