[...] Most aerosols, however, as polydisperse colloidal systems, exhibit a range of particle sizes. Liquid droplets are almost always nearly spherical, but scientists use an equivalent diameter to characterize the properities of various shapes of solid particles, some very irregular. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a spherical particle with the same value of some physical property as the irregular particle.

The density of snow is derived from measurements of particle fall velocity and PSD, provided by a particle video imager, and weighing gauge measurements of precipitation rate. Validity of the retrieved density values is checked against snow depth measurements. A relation retrieved for the ensemble mean snow density and median <b>volume</b> <b>diameter</b> is in general agreement with previous studies, but it is observed to vary significantly from one winter to the other.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from {{a case study}} in which coincident 35 and 94 GHz radars located at Chilbolton, England, were used to measure crystal size in cirrus. In the presence of larger crystals the 94 GHz radar scatters sufficiently beyond the Rayleigh regime that the difference in reflectivity factor measured by the two can be directly related to size. This enables more accurate estimation of ice water content than would be possible using a single radar. The small crystals {{at the top of the}} cloud scatter in the Rayleigh regime at both wavelengths, which provides a valuable method of calibration, but also means that sizing is not possible in this part of the cloud. Ice water content and median <b>volume</b> <b>diameter</b> were derived and compared with the analyses of the UK Meteorological Office Unified Model. The smallest measurable median <b>volume</b> <b>diameter</b> in this case study was around 200 m, although it is believed that with both radars sensitive down to 35 dBZ, it should be possible to measure median diameters of 100 m. Scattering calculations have been carried out to determine the sensitivity of these measurements to crystal density, crystal aspect ratio and the shape of the size distribution. Density is found to be the most significant source of uncertainty, possibly introducing errors of 20 % into retrieved diameter. 1...|$|E

The results are as follows. (1) The count of erythrocytes begin to increase rapidly from the late stage of pregnancy and the count reaches maximum level at the 25 th day of pregnancy. But thereafter the count of them very decrease and reaches minimum level at parturiton. It recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The amount of hemoglobin does not show a marked change during pregnancy, parturition and lactation, but it decreases slightly from before to after parturition. The hematocrit, volume of packed red cells decrease rapidly from the late stage of pregnancy and the volume reaches minimum level at parturition, but thereafter it increases gradually and recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The mean corpuscular diameter and volume become small gradually from the late stage of pregnancy and it reaches minimum level at the 25 th day of pregnancy, but thereafter it becomes large in size and recovers to a nomal value on one month after parturition. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin decrese gradully from the late stage of pregnancy and it reaches minimum level at the 25 th day of pregnanancy, but thereafter it increases and recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration increase rapidly from the late stage of pregnancy and it reaches maximum level atparturion, but thereafter it decreases and recovers to a normal value on one month after parturition. The proportion of reticulocytes, the count of leucocytes and differential count of leucocytes remain a fairy constant during pregnancy, parturition and lactation. (2) It is found that the red cell count, hemoglobin, volume of packed red cells, the white red cell count and lymphocyte count are in very younger fetus very low as compared with those of the mother, whereas the proportion of reticulocytes, mean corpuscular <b>volume,</b> <b>diameter,</b> hemoglobin and hemoglobin concentration and neutrophile polynuclear leucocyte count are very high.

Tests include varying cloud LWC (0. 5 to 5 au gm), cloud median <b>volume</b> <b>diameter</b> (MVD) (15 to 26 microns), temperature (- 29 to 20 C), and air speeds (50 to 285 mph).

Variations of plus or minus 10 % and plus or minus 5 % in LWC and MVD, respectively, were determined of spray clouds between test made at given tunnel settings (fixed LWC, MVD, and air speed) indicating cloud conditions were highly reproducible. Although LWC measurements from JW and Leigh devices were consistent with tunnel values, individual probe measurements either consistently over or underestimated tunnel values by factors ranging from about 0. 2 to 2.
