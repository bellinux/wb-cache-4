25|$|The J75 was {{somewhat}} {{larger than the}} J57 in the F-102A, and had greater mass flow. This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and {{this led to the}} further refinement of using a <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>inlet</b> duct to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. This change also led to the ducts being somewhat shorter. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine's 2-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control. The nozzle was held open reducing idle thrust by 40% giving slower taxiing and less brake wear.|$|E
25|$|F-106A : (Convair Model 8-24) Improved {{version of}} the F-102. Fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE datalink, J-75 {{afterburning}} turbojet, enlarged intake, <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>inlet</b> ramps and shortened intake ducts, refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin; tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at high thrust settings including afterburner. Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least 57,000ft. Many were fitted with a conically-cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft's range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay.|$|E

The improved design, in which the proposed Curtiss-Wright J67 jet engine was eventually replaced by a Pratt & Whitney J75, underwent so many aerodynamic changes (including <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>inlets)</b> that it essentially became an entirely new aircraft and hence was redesignated and produced as the F-106 Delta Dart.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of inlet-turbojet-engine matching {{for a range}} of Mach numbers up to 2. 0 indicates large performance penalties when fixed-geometry inlets are used. Use of <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>inlets,</b> however, nearly eliminates th The analysis was confirmed experimentally by investigating at Mach numbers of 0, 0. 63, and 1. 5 to 2. 0 two single oblique-shock-type inlets of different compression-ramp angles, which simulated a variable-geometry configuration. The experimental investigation indicated that total-pressure recoveries comparable withose attainable with well designed nose inlets were obtained with the side inlets when all the boundary layer ahead of the inlets was removed. Serious drag penalties resulted at a Mach number of 2. 0 from the use of blunt-cowl leading edges. However, sharp-lip inlets produced large losses in thrust for the take-off condition. These thrust penalties which are associated with the the low-speed operation of the sharp-lip inlet designs can probably be avoided without impairing the supersonic performance of the inlet by the use of auxiliary inlets or blow-in doors...|$|R
40|$|Version 3. 1 of the NPARC {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} flow solver introduces a capability to solve unsteady flow on moving multi-block, structured grids with nominally second-order time accuracy. The grid motion is due to segments of the boundary grid that translate and rotate in a rigid-body manner or deform. The grid is regenerated at each time step to accommodate the boundary grid motion. The flow equations and computational models sense the moving grid through the grid velocities, which are computed from a time-difference of the grids at two consecutive time levels. For three-dimensional flow domains, {{it is assumed that}} the grid retains a planar character with respect to one coordinate. The application and accuracy of NPARC v 3. 1 is demonstrated for flow about a flying wedge, rotating flap, a collapsing bump in a duct, and the upstart / restart flow in a <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>inlet.</b> The results compare well with analytic and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation of}} the effactiveness of water injection for engine-inlet matching and thrust augmentation was mgde at Mach num-bers from 1. 5 to 2. 0. One-dimensional equations for complete evaporation in a constant-mea channel were a~lied to a fixed-geometry inlet, and its flight performance was compared with bypass and translating-spike inlets. no-spillage engine-inlet matching was achieved over the Mach number range studied with msximum liquid-air ratios of about 0. 03. Augmented thrust due to injection ranged from 17 to 56 percent high = {{than that of the}} best performing <b>variable-geometry</b> <b>inlet.</b> However, the specific im-pulse (thrust/(lb) (sec of liquid consumption)) of the water-injection in-let configuration was considerably lower than that of the bypass inlet and about equal to that of a fixed-geometry configuration without water injection. The total liquid consumed by the water-in~ection system, at matching, was one-half to two and one-half times greater than the bypass inlet configuration. Because of the cooling effect on the air entering the turbojet en-gine, {{it was found that the}} maximum allowable flight speed of a temperature-limited turbojet engine (Mach 2. 0 in tropopause) could be increased by 25 percent, while the cruise sLtitude of the bypass inlet system could be increased from 55, 000 to 60, 000 feet and for a fixed in-let, from 55, 000 to 67,(XI 0 feet...|$|E

40|$|A {{brief summary}} {{is made of}} the {{performance}} of a series of <b>variable-geometry</b> type scoop <b>inlets</b> investigated at the Lewis Laboratory on a model of the X- 3 airplane fuselage. Data are presented for a range of inlet mass-flow ratios over a Mach number range from 0 to 2 and from 0 degrees to 12 degrees angle of attack. Rounded-lip inlets are found to give satisfactory performance to a Mach number of 1. 5. Use of sharp rather than blunt lip configurations is shown to provide considerable gains in available thrust at Mach number 2. 0 but penalize take-off performance to the extent that auxiliary air intakes may be required. No one inlet type was found to be superior over the entire range of operating variables. Thus, the choice of a specific inlet design will be influenced by structural and mechanical as well as aerodynamic considerations...|$|R
