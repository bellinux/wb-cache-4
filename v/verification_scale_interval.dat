40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the discrete scale invariant (DSI) processes is the invariance of their finite dimensional distributions by dilation for certain scaling factor. DSI process with piecewise linear drift and stationary increments inside prescribed <b>scale</b> <b>intervals</b> is introduced and studied.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{recursive}} multiscale new white top-hat (NWTH) filter for small target detection {{in the infrared}} (IR) images. At first, NWTH filter based on white top-hat (WTH) transformation is performed for three scales (structure elements) with wide <b>scale</b> <b>interval.</b> For the discrimination of candidate target and background region, Threshold is calculated by using maximum value of the summation image by NWTH filter. By using this threshold, a structure element is selected by candidate target clutter ratio (CTCR), modification of signal to clutter ratio gain (SCRG). Based on the selected structure element, the other two structure elements are updated with middle <b>scale</b> <b>interval.</b> Through recursive process of procedure mentioned above, optimum three structure elements are obtained. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method is robust and effective than existing morphological methods for the small target detection.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the number of <b>scale</b> <b>intervals</b> of a {{continuous}} variable on the results of principal components factor analysis was investigated. Analyses were performed for seven different numbers of <b>scale</b> <b>intervals.</b> The general effect was a decrease {{in the size of the}} eigenvalues, communalities, and factor loadings as the number of scale divisions was reduced. The magnitude of the effect was, however, not large and the pattern of the rotated factor loadings was not appreciably affected. IN recent years, there has been widespread interest in, and application of, factor analysis in a number of fields. One considera-tion that confronts the researcher is that the model underlying factor analysis seldom matches precisely the characteristics of the data being analyzed. One problem that has concerned investigators is the {{effect of the}} number of intervals along the measurement scale of a, continuous variable on the results of the analysis. In its extreme form it is desired to know what effect reducing a continuous measurement scale to a dichotomy has on the analysis where the Pearson product moment correlation is used to represent the re-lationships between dichotomous variables (Carroll, 1961; Henrys-son and Thunberg, 1965) ...|$|R

It is asked, therefore, how suboptimal scale quality affects the results of parameter estimation in structural equation models in which judgment scales serve as indicator variables. Based on a general psychophysical judgment model it is shown that the measurement theoretical properties of magnitude scales of individual respondents account for large proportions of the variation of estimated coefficients and of goodness of fit. For category-rating scales the effects scale properties have on parameter estimation cannot be determined because of nonhomogeneous judgment functions. " (author's abstract...|$|R
