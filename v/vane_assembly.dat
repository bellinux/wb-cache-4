50|$|Depending on the {{required}} coal fineness, {{there are two}} types of classifier that may be selected for a vertical roller mill. The dynamic classifier, which consists of a stationary angled inlet <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> surrounding a rotating <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> or cage, is capable of producing micrometer-fine pulverized coal with a narrow particle size distribution. In addition, adjusting the speed of the rotating cage can easily change the intensity of the centrifugal force field in the classification zone to achieve coal fineness control real-time to make immediate accommodation for a change in fuel or boiler load conditions. For the applications where a micrometer-fine pulverized coal is not necessary, the static classifier, which consists of a cone equipped with adjustable vanes, is an option at a lower cost since it contains no moving parts. With adequate mill grinding capacity, a vertical mill equipped with a static classifier is capable of producing a coal fineness up to 99.5% or higher <50 mesh and 80% or higher <200 mesh, while one equipped with a dynamic classifier produces coal fineness levels of 100% <100 mesh and 95% <200 mesh, or better.|$|E

5000|$|In former Trim-Tab servo systems, {{the pivot}} {{movement}} of the servo blade around its vertical axis {{has been carried out}} by a trim tab Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the trim tab is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade.The same holds for a trim trim tab, which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called [...] "The Saye's Rigg". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a trim tab hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the trim tab in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the trim tab with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a trim tab can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the trim tab needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.) ...|$|E

40|$|Five-Hole Probes (FHP), being a {{dependable}} {{and accurate}} aerodynamic tool, {{are an excellent}} choice for measuring three-dimensional flow fields in turbomachinery. To improve spatial resolution, a subminiature FHP with a diameter of 1. 68 [*]mm is employed. High length to diameter ratio of the tubing and manual pitch and yaw calibration cause increased uncertainty. A new FHP calibrator is designed and built to reduce the uncertainty by precise, computer controlled movements and reduced calibration time. The calibrated FHP is then placed downstream of the nozzle guide <b>vane</b> (NGV) <b>assembly</b> of a low-speed, large-scale, axial flow turbine. The cold flow HP turbine stage contains 29 vanes and 36 blades. A fast and computer controllable traversing system is implemented using an adaptive grid method for the refinement of measurements in regions such as vane wake, secondary flows, and boundary layers. The current approach increases the possible number of measurement points in a two-hour period by 160 %. Flow structures behind the NGV measurement plane are identified with high spatial resolution and reduced uncertainty. The automated pitch and yaw calibration and the adaptive grid approach introduced {{in this study are}} shown to be a highly effective way of measuring complex flow fields in the research turbine...|$|R

The radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) was manufactured after the completion of beam dynamics and 3 D electromagnetic simulation studies. The vanes were machined using a three axis CNC machine. A CMM was used for both the acceptance tests of the <b>vanes</b> and their <b>assembly.</b> Production and assembly errors were found acceptable for this cavity, the very first one developed in Turkey. The aluminum vanes were copper coated by electroplating. The coated vanes were bolted and bonded with eight screws, eight pins and two different adhesives. A silver paste was used for RF sealing and a low vapor pressure epoxy was used for vacuum isolation. First LLRF tests of the RFQ were performed using the phase shift method with a bead-pull setup, a VNA, an N-type RF coupler and a pick-up loop.

40|$|One {{possible}} {{technique for}} obtaining longitudinal control on a tilt-nacelle V/STOL aircraft {{is the use}} of a variable attitude <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> mounted in the propulsion system exhaust.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demands for energy world-wide has prompted research into {{and implementation of}} devices to harvest power from renewable sources of energy, such as hydroelectricity. Large-scale hydroelectric plants have existed for over a century, and are capable of producing over 10000 MW of power. However, such facilities are expensive and generally {{have a significant impact}} on the local ecosystem; as such, there are relatively few locations and communities that can support their construction. Small-scale hydroelectric facilities, which produce power up to 30 MW, are increasing in popularity since they do not divert the natural flow of the river and are capable of harnessing energy from smaller sources than their large-scale cousins one of the main concerns being the negative effects they can have on the local fauna. Specifically, fish inadvertently passing through the facility can be hurt or killed by the inlet guide <b>vanes</b> or rotor <b>assembly</b> through a variety of mechanisms, including striking the structure, being caught between rotating and stationary parts, or through dramatic changes in fluid pressure. In order to mitigate injury to fish passing through small-scale hydroelectric facilities, AlphaStar Hydro has developed a novel vaneless swirl injector to replace current inlet guide vane stages, which allows the fish to travel through with minimal damage, while still imparting the necessary swirl component onto the flow for proper turbine operation. This swirl injector is made up of a single spiral flighting wrapped around a central shaft. The main focus of this work is on quantifying and optimizing the flow through the vaneless swirl injector. Of primary concern is the axisymmetry of the flow exiting the injector, the pressure drop across it, and the swirl that it provides, all of which directly impact rotor performance. Based upon a preliminary patented design provided by AlphaStar Hydro, the flow field generated by the injector was determined through a computational fluid dynamics study. This provided the foundation for a geometric optimization study to maximize flow axisymmetry and swirl, while minimizing pressure loss. A 5 by 4 grid was setup using number of revolutions and pitch angle as variables. Four metrics were measured: axial axisymmetry, tangential axisymmetry, swirl number and pressure loss. Using the four metrics, an objective function was created and was subsequently optimized using a line search algorithm. The study concluded that the number of revolutions is not as important as the pitch angle and that the optimal geometry is 4 revolutions at a pitch angle of 25 degrees. A test rig was designed and constructed in order to test the newly optimized design with the addition of the nose cone. The setup is composed of a reservoir, a pump, a gate valve, a circle-to-rectangle transition, flow conditioning elements, the swirl injector, a test section and return plumbing. The rig was commissioned and initially characterized by measuring the velocity drift with time, the change in temperature with time, and the inlet velocity profile upstream of the injector. The experimental facility was coupled with numerical simulations to explore the flow field downstream of the optimized swirl injector with an attached nose cone, as would be the case upon rotor installation. The pressure, axial velocity and tangential velocity contours were analyzed to assess the performance of the swirl injector in its operational configuration, in preparation for rotor installation. A recirculation zone on the nose cone was observed, which was due to the flow separation on the nose cone. The swirl numbers and the axisymmetry metrics were compared between the optimization model and the nose cone model, revealing that there were no significant differences between the two. The experimentally measured velocity profiles were found to match well with the numerical profiles, as did the pressure distributions within the test section. This provided cross-validation of the experimental and numerical studies. The experimental data exhibited relatively high fluctuations in the velocity signals, however...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Aviation Administration {{recently}} {{released a statement}} that personal and homemade aircraft accidents could be reduced significantly {{with the addition of}} Angle of Attack information for the pilot. Installing most available devices on modern aircraft requires extensive fitting and modification at great expense. Furthermore, modification of older and vintage aircraft may not be desirable. The introduction of a simple, non-invasive device that provides the same information would increase safety and be marketable. Utilizing this opportunity and setting a range of requirements including cost, weight, ease of installation, and reliability, analysis was performed on different methods purposed to accomplish the stated design requirements. The solution selected uses a Hall Device switch (a magnetically actuated electronic switch), a 100 decibel buzzer contained by an interior component, and a <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> with magnetic base for position reference on the exterior component. The device transmits airflow information outside the cockpit to the pilot and mounts non-invasively. Adhering the two components to opposite sides of the canopy provides reliable data to the pilot in glider type aircraft, multiengine aircraft, and some single engine aircraft. The Icarus angle of attack indicator proves that the concept of a non-invasive angle of attack indicator is viable and serves its purpose as an experimental aviation device. Further development of the concept should strive to reduce size, increase adjustability, and decrease manufacturing difficulty...|$|E
40|$|Turbine vanes are {{typically}} assembled as a section containing single or double airfoil units in an annular pattern. First stage guide <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> results in two common mating interfaces - {{a gap between}} combustor and vane endwall while another from the adjacent sections, called slashface. High-pressure coolant could leak through these gaps to reduce the ingestion of hot gas and achieve certain cooling benefit. As vane endwall region flow field is already very complicated due {{to the presence of}} highly three-dimensional secondary flows, then a significant influence on endwall cooling can be expected due to the gap leakage flows. The entire study is divided into two parts. The first part of this dissertation investigates the endwall film cooling from gap leakage flows with the multiple rows of discrete film cooling holes inside the passages. The later part studies the film cooling performance of multiple endwall cooling designs including inlet leakage jet. Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) technique is used to obtain the detailed film cooling effectiveness distributions on the endwall of a scaled up mid-range industrial turbine vane geometry. Experiments are performed in a blow-down wind tunnel cascade facility at the isentropic exit Mach number of 0. 5 corresponding to Reynolds number of 3. 8 x 105 based on inlet conditions and axial chord length. Passive turbulence grid is used to generate freestream turbulence level about 19 % with an integral length scale of 1. 7 cm.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the effect of}} inlet pressure, corrected engine speed, and turbine temperature level on turbine-inlet gas temperature distributions was conducted on a J 40 -WE- 6, interim J 40 -WE- 6, and prototype J 40 -WE- 8 turbojet engine in the altitude wind tunnel at the NAC. 4 Lewis laboratory. The engines were investigated over a range of simulated pressure altitudes from 15, 000 to 55, 000 feet, flight Mach numbers from 0. 12 to 0. 64, and corrected engine speeds from 7198 to 8026 rpm, The gas temperature distribution at the turbine of the three engines over the range of operating conditions investigated was considered satisfactory from the standpoint of desired temperature distribution with one exception - the distribution for the J 40 -WE- 6 engine indicated a trend with decreasing engine-inlet pressure for the temperature to exceed the desired in the region of the blade hub. Installation of a compressor-outlet mixer <b>vane</b> <b>assembly</b> remedied this undesirable temperature distribution, The experimental data have shown that turbine-inlet temperature distributions are influenced in the expected manner by changes in compressor-outlet pressure or mass-flow distribution and by changes in combustor hole-area distribution. The similarity between turbine-inlet and turbine-outlet temperature distribution indicated only a small shift in temperature distribution imposed by the turbine rotors. The attainable jet thrusts of the three engines were influenced in different degrees and directions by changes in temperature distributions with change in engine-inlet pressure. Inability to match the desired temperature distribution resulted, for the J 40 -WE- 6 engine, in an 11 -percent thrust loss based on an average turbine-inlet temperature of 1500 F at an engine-inlet pressure of 500 pounds per square foot absolute. Departure from the desired temperature distribution in the Slade tip region results, for the prototype J 40 -WE- 8 engine, in an attainable thrust increase of 3 to 4 percent as compared with that obtained if tip-region temperature limitations were observed...|$|E
