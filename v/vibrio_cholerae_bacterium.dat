40|$|Small {{effector}} molecules play {{an important}} role in bacterial physiology. There are many types of them in the bacterial cell. One group are small signalling molecules which participate in quorum sensing, enabling bacterial cell-cell communication as part of a extracellular signalling. These molecules mediate information about the cell density and different qualities of the extracellular matrix. Next group of small effector molecules are modified nucleotides. They participate in intracellular signalling pathways which regulate the switch of bacterial lifestyle according to changing environment. Best studied are signalling pathways using the molecules - c-di-GMP and (p) ppGpp. Detail studies were done in case of gram positive (Bacillus subtilis) and gram negative (Escherichia coli, <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae)</b> <b>bacteria,</b> where was proved the connection between c-di-GMP signalling pathways and quorum sensing (<b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae,</b> Xanthomonas campestris).

40|$|The <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacterium</b> is {{the agent}} of cholera. The {{capacity}} to produce the cholera toxin, {{which is responsible for}} the deadly diarrhea associated with cholera epidemics, is encoded in the genome of a filamentous phage, CTXφ. Rolling-circle replication (RCR) is central to the life cycle of CTXφ because amplification of the phage genome permits its efficient integration into the genome and its packaging into new viral particles. A single phage-encoded HUH endonuclease initiates RCR of the proto-typical filamentous phages of enterobacteriaceae by introducing a nick at a specific position of the double stranded DNA form of the phage genome. The rest of the process is driven by host factors that are either essential or crucial for the replication of the host genome, such as the Rep SF 1 helicase. In contrast, we show here that the histone-like HU protein of V. cholerae is necessary for the introduction of a nick by the HUH endonuclease of CTXφ. We further show that CTXφ RCR depends on a SF 1 helicase normally implicated in DNA repair, UvrD, rather than Rep. In addition to CTXφ, we show that VGJφ, a representative member of a second family of vibrio integrative filamentous phages, requires UvrD and HU for RCR while TLCφ, a satellite phage, depends on Rep and is independent from HU...|$|E

40|$|In August, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{published}} alarming {{data on the}} re-emergence {{of cholera}} in many African and Asian countries, noting that the outbreaks run “parallel with the ever-increasing proportion of vulnerable populations living in unsanitary conditions. ” A total of 236, 896 cases were notified to the WHO in 2006 from 52 countries, a case level not seen since the, 90 s and representing an increase of 79 % over 2005. Deaths reached more than 6, 000, a three-fold increase from 2005. However, the WHO has long warned that cholera is widely under-reported, and in August renewed its description of the disease as “a global threat to public health {{and one of the}} key indicators of social development. ”[1] Until social determinants drastically improve for millions, oral cholera vaccines (OCV’s) may provide a life-saving opportunity to stem outbreaks – especially in high-risk areas where the case-fatality rate (CFR) reaches up to 30 % – when they are used in conjunction with effective public health and clinical strategies in epidemic-prone settings. This is the current position of the WHO, a reversal of earlier thinking that doubted the value of cholera vaccines. However, due to several catastrophic epidemics in the 90 s and new research, the WHO reassessed the vaccines ’ potential in 2002.

40|$|Following the {{consumption}} of contaminated food or water by a human host, the <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacterium</b> produces virulence factors, including cholera toxin (CT), which directly causes voluminous diarrhea, producing cholera. A complex regulatory net-work controls virulence gene expression and responds to various environmental signals and transcription factors. Ultimately, ToxT, {{a member of the}} AraC/XylS transcription regulator family, is responsible for activating the transcription of the virulence genes. ToxT-regulated promoters all contain one or more copies of the toxbox, a 13 -bp DNA sequence which ToxT recognizes. Nucleotides 2 through 7 of the toxbox sequence are well conserved and contain an invariant tract of four consecutive T nucleo-tides, whereas the remainder of the toxbox sequence is not highly conserved other than being A/T rich. The binding of ToxT to toxboxes is required to activate the transcription of virulence genes, and toxboxes in several virulence gene promoters have been characterized. However, the toxboxes required for the activation of transcription from the cholera toxin promoter PctxAB have not been identified. PctxAB contains a series of heptad repeats (GATTTTT), each of which matches the 5 = end of the toxbox con-sensus sequence and is a potential binding site for ToxT. Using site-directed mutagenesis and high-resolution copper-phenanth-roline footprinting, we have identified the functional toxboxes required for the ToxT activation of PctxAB. Our findings suggest that ToxT binds to only two toxboxes within PctxAB, despite the presence of several other potential ToxT binding sites within the promoter. Both toxboxes are essential for DNA binding and the full activation of ctxAB transcription.

This placed him at odds with Pettenkofer's broader approach to disease that involved many other environmental factors in addition to the activity of the germ of a disease. The two scientists conflicted most notably over the subject of cholera. In one specific case, Pettenkofer obtained bouillon laced with a large dose of <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacteria</b> from Robert Koch, the proponent of the theory that the bacteria was the sole cause of the disease. He consumed the bouillon in a self-test in the presence of several witnesses on 7 October 1892. He also took bicarbonate of soda to neutralise his stomach acid to counter a suggestion by Koch that the acid could kill the bacteria. Pettenkofer suffered mild symptoms for nearly a week but claimed these were not associated with cholera. The modern view is that he did indeed have cholera, but was lucky to just have a mild case and he possibly had some immunity from a previous episode.|$|R

40|$|Terrorism {{is defined}} as use of {{unlawful}} violence or threat of unlawful violence to indulge fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies {{in the pursuit of}} goals that are generally political, social or religious. Bioterrorism is terrorism by intentional release or dissemination of biological agents, mainly bacteria or viruses. Use of biological weapons is attractive from the terrorists’ point of view because of low production costs, major range and easiness of transmission. The first mention of the use of primitive biological weapons date back to the 6 th century. Use of plague-infested corpses as offensive means in the 14 th century caused a spread of bubonic plague through the whole Europe. The biggest development of biological weapons took place in the interwar period and in the cold war era. Biological weapon trails and research were conducted by super powers such as USSR, UK, USA and Japan. At the beginning of the 20 th century a new form of bioterrorism occurred, which put humanity {{in the face of a}} terrifying threat. Cholera is a deadly disease that has caused a worldwide phenomenon throughout history. Its imperative weapon, the <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacterium,</b> has allowed cholera to seize control and wipe out a huge percentage of the human population. V. cholerae’s toxins are the primary causes of cholera’s lethal symptoms. The bacterium contains toxins that help it accomplish its job of invading the human system and defeating the body’s powerful immune system. With its sibling bacterium Escherichia coli, V. cholerae has become one of the most dominant pathogens in the known world. V. cholerae’s strategies in causing the infamous deadly diarrhea have been widely studied, from the irritation of the intestinal epithelium to the stimulation of capillary leakage, as well as the internal effects of the disease such as the Peyer’s patches on the intestinal walls. Overall, the Vibrio cholera bacterium has made cholera a tough disease to overcome, and because of its deadly virulence factors, cholera has become one of the most frightening diseases a human body could ever encounter. Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative, comma-shaped bacterium. Some strains of V. cholerae cause the disease cholera. V. cholerae is facultatively anaerobic and has a flagellum at one cell pole. V. cholerae was first isolated as the cause of cholera by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini in 1854, but his discovery was not widely known until Robert Koch, working independently 30 years later, publicized the knowledge and the means of fighting the disease. V. cholerae pathogenicity genes code for proteins directly or indirectly involved in the virulence of the bacteria. During infection, V. cholerae secretes cholera toxin, a protein that causes profuse, watery diarrhea. Colonization of the small intestine also requires the toxin coregulated pilus (TCP), a thin, flexible, filamentous appendage on the surface of bacterial cells...|$|E

40|$|Most {{vaccines}} {{today are}} liquid formulations for parental administration. However, {{there are several}} drawbacks connected to these vaccines. Since injectable vaccines only induce systemic antibody responses, they are not effective against the various pathogens that affect mucosal surfaces with poor permeability for serum-derived antibodies, e. g. the small intestine. Further disadvantages of liquid injectable vaccines are the need for medical personnel for the administration, cold chain requirements and large packaging sizes, which all are especially negative factors in developing countries. Solid and preferably mucoadhesive vaccine formulations that are administered via mucosal surfaces would offer a good alternative to many of these problems. The aim of this thesis was therefore to study the influence of excipients {{in the design of}} such formulations regarding i) formulation-related properties (mucoadhesion and antigen release) and ii) antigen-functionality preservation during freeze-dying. Mechanistic and immunological investigations using mucoadhesive hydrophilic matrix tablets as potential formulations for sublingual immunization were performed. The effect of osmotic pressure differences on the adhesiveness of hydrophilic swelling matrix tablets was investigated and it was found that a decrease in the osmotic pressure difference resulted in a decrease in the adhesive force, i. e. the force required to detach the tablet from a wet surface. Release of the model antigen ovalbumin from hydrophilic matrix tablets and a fast releasing formulation was characterized. The Bradford Assay used for the protein quantification was found to be disturbed by the hydrophilic polymer Carbopol and a correction method was set up. Sublingual immunizations in BALB/c mice indicated a poor potential of all ER tablets to evoke intestinal immune responses, whereas an immediate release resulted in high antibody titres. Thus it was concluded that the latter formulation type should be preferred in sublingual immunization. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the stabilizing potential of different excipients during freeze-drying was tested on killed whole-cell <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacteria</b> as a model vaccine for pathogens causing mucosal infections. Sucrose showed great potential to avoid bacterial aggregation, preserve important antigen structures and to maintain the immunogenicity of the bacteria.

40|$|Cholera {{has been}} known since ancient times, yet {{there is still no}} cure. <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> <b>bacteria</b> cause <b>cholera</b> by {{producing}} cholera toxin. Cholera toxin production is regulated by the protein ToxT, which itself is regulated by two membrane-bound proteins, TcpP and ToxR, that work together to bind DNA and activate transcription of toxT. The molecular-scale details of this unusual membrane-bound transcription activation mechanism are unclear and cannot be observed using traditional light microscopy due to the diffraction limit of light. In this thesis, we use single-molecule tracking and super-resolution localization microscopy to overcome the diffraction limit and directly observe the motions and interactions of TcpP labeled with the fluorescent proteins Dendra 2, mCherry and PAmCherry in live V. cholerae cells. We describe methods developed–and obstacles encountered–in the course of our studies of these protein fusions, and find, of the three fluorescent proteins examined, PAmCherry is the best choice for tracking TcpP motion. By using mean squared displacement and cumulative probability distribution analyses of single-molecule trajectories, we compare TcpP-PAmCherry motions across three V. cholerae strains. In each strain, the native copy of TcpP is removed and replaced with TcpP-PAmCherry expressed ectopically. We find TcpP motion can be categorized into three populations: fast, slow and immobile; and TcpP-PAmCherry moves faster when both binding partners (ToxR and the toxT promoter) are present than when either is lacking. Our findings support a mechanism for TcpP [...] ToxR [...] toxT promoter interaction in which ToxR recruits TcpP to the toxT promoter. Although PAmCherry is adequate for our single-molecule microscopy experiments, it is not an ideal fluorophore. A brighter fluorescent label that resists photobleaching would enable faster imaging and longer measured trajectories. We present a protocol for enhancing PAmCherry fluorescence by coupling TcpP-PAmCherry in the membrane of live V. cholerae cells to extracellular gold nanoisland films and nanotriangle arrays to achieve plasmon-enhanced fluorescence. We can detect single-molecule fluorescence above background scatter on both nanostructured gold surfaces, which is promising for further live cell studies. Greater understanding of the ToxR regulon may lead to novel therapeutics to combat cholera, and enhanced fluorescence will help us observe such interactions with greater detail...|$|R
40|$|Cholera {{has been}} very rare in industrialized nations for the last 100 years; however, the disease is still common today {{in other parts of}} the world, {{including}} the Indian subcontinent and sub-Saharan Africa. Cholera is an acute, diarrhoeal illness caused by infection of the intestine by the <b>bacterium</b> <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae.</b> The infection is often mild or without symptoms, but it sometimes can be severe. Approximately one in 20 infected persons have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these persons, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the <b>cholera</b> <b>bacterium.</b> In an epidemic, the source of the contamination is usually the faeces of an infected person. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water. In an effort to curb the spread of the disease, Rand Water routinely monitors for <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae.</b> The number of isolates identified as <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 over a three-year period was evaluated to determine seasonal trends. <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> non-O 1 was predominant in the warmer seasons. This may be due to the higher temperatures experienced which favourably influences V. cholerae. In addition, rainfall generally increases the numbers of V. cholerae isolated, as run-off from farms and abattoirs enter rivers and streams. The seasons with lower temperatures found V. cholerae non-O 1 numbers much lower. In a developing country like South Africa, monitoring for <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> is of great significance as large numbers of the population are exposed to water systems that may potentially hold the <b>cholera</b> <b>bacterium...</b>|$|R
40|$|We studied {{microorganisms}} {{associated with}} infant diarrhea {{in a group}} of 256 children admitted to a public pediatric hospital in Montevideo, Uruguay. Diagnostic procedures were updated to optimize detection of potential pathogens, which were found in 63. 8 % of cases, {{and to be able to}} define their characteristics down to molecular or antigenic type. Coinfection with two or more agents was detected in more than one-third of positive studies. Escherichia coli enteric virotypes, especially enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), were shown to be prevalent. Rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter (mainly Campylobacter jejuni), and Shigella flexneri were also often identified. Enterotoxigenic E. coli, Salmonella, and Giardia lamblia were sporadically recognized. Unusual findings included two enteroinvasive E. coli strains, one Shigella dysenteriae 2 isolate, and a non-O: 1 <b>Vibrio</b> <b>cholerae</b> culture. EPEC <b>bacteria</b> and S. flexneri (but not Salmonella) showed unusually frequent antimicrobial resistance, especially towards beta-lactam antibiotics, which is the subject of ongoing work...|$|R
