5|$|Aquaculture {{systems for}} H.gammarus are under development, and {{production}} rates are still <b>very</b> <b>low.</b>|$|E
5|$|Developmental effects {{occur at}} <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses in animals. They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs {{may be even}} more sensitive: <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{decompression}} schedule {{does not}} completely protect against DCS. The algorithms used {{are designed to}} reduce the probability of DCS to a <b>very</b> <b>low</b> level, but do not reduce it to zero.|$|E

50|$|The upper {{slopes of}} the {{mountain}} are covered in spruce, the <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> with beech trees. It lies entirely within the Harz National Park.|$|R
5|$|Germany ranked 20th in {{the world}} in life {{expectancy}} with 77 years for men and 82 years for women, and it had a <b>very</b> <b>low</b> infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births).|$|E
5|$|In some {{locations}} in Pennsylvania {{the quality of}} the ore was quite good, with relatively deep veins containing 45% iron, and <b>very</b> <b>low</b> sulfur.|$|E
5|$|Tanaka et al. (2013) {{studied the}} neurobehavioral effects of feeding formula {{supplemented}} with sphingomyelin-enriched phospholipid in 24 <b>very</b> <b>low</b> birth weight preterm infants (birth weight <1500 g).|$|E

50|$|Grades (especially {{expressed}} numerically) {{might be}} suffixed with + (plus) or - (minus). On rare occasions the = (double minus) is used, especially as 2= {{to express the}} <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> passing grade.|$|R

5|$|A {{commemorative}} half {{dollar for}} {{the battle was}} produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for the coin was <b>very</b> <b>low,</b> just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, the America the Beautiful quarters released a 25-cent coin commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse {{side of the coin}} depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.|$|E
5|$|A. b. swaynei (Sclater, 1892) : Known as Swayne's hartebeest. Restricted to the {{southern}} Rift Valley in Ethiopia. It formerly occurred throughout the Rift Valley, and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia. It has disappeared from Somalia by 1930. Its populations are <b>very</b> <b>low</b> and on the decline.|$|E
50|$|Trough: The {{opposite}} of a crest, so {{the minimum value}} or height in a wave. It is the location at the <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> point of a wave cycle also shown in picture to right.|$|R
25|$|Ultraviolet {{light can}} be {{generated}} by some light-emitting diodes, but wavelengths below 380nm are uncommon and the emission peaks are broad, so only the <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> energy UV photons are emitted, within predominantly visible light.|$|R
5000|$|The element {{which is}} moved {{does not have}} to be the <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> of its set; it merely has to have a value that lies between the means of the two sets. Consider this example: ...|$|R
5|$|An unusual triad {{is found}} in seldolisin proteases. The low pKa of the {{glutamate}} carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at <b>very</b> <b>low</b> pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an adaptation to specific environments like acidic hot springs (e.g. kumamolysin) or cell lysosome (e.g. tripeptidyl peptidase).|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as having a <b>very</b> <b>low</b> extinction risk.|$|E
5|$|Breeding convicts is {{as simple}} as having a male and a female in the same tank with {{adequate}} water quality and feeding. There is no special conditioning required. Due to their prolific breeding in captivity, there is a <b>very</b> <b>low</b> demand for Convict fry, and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an inbreeding population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{hope the}} world will make you happy, Beatrix,” says Esmond, with a sigh. “You’ll be Beatrix till you are my lady duchess—will you not? I shall then make your grace my <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> bow.” ...|$|R

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light can}} be {{generated}} by some light-emitting diodes, but wavelengths below 380 nm are uncommon and the emission peaks are broad, so only the <b>very</b> <b>lowest</b> energy UV photons are emitted, within predominantly visible light.|$|R
5|$|Cape series (Ia) {{diamonds}} have {{a visible}} absorption spectrum (as seen through a direct-vision spectroscope) {{consisting of a}} fine line in the violet at 415.5nm; however, this line is often invisible until the diamond has been cooled to <b>very</b> <b>low</b> temperatures. Associated with this are weaker lines at 478nm, 465nm, 452nm, 435nm, and 423nm.|$|E
5|$|Cone {{production}} varies a {{great deal}} from year to year, but, {{as a result of its}} low flowering rate, is generally <b>very</b> <b>low.</b> However, there are typically a very high number of follicles per cone, leading to relatively high seed counts. There is some seed predation, primarily from the curculionid weevil Cechides amoenus.|$|E
5|$|Even though plasma {{concentration}} of APOA5 is <b>very</b> <b>low,</b> {{some studies have}} focused on the analysis of the potential association of this biochemical parameter with cardiovascular disease (CVD). This relationship remains controversial, as higher plasma levels of APOA5 in individuals with CVD disease have been found in some, but not in all studies.|$|E

5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, the slender smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's <b>very</b> <b>low</b> fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|Important {{national}} and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey. The Abbey {{is not to}} be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, which is the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales. Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is <b>very</b> <b>low</b> within the Anglican denomination. Church attendance continues on a long, slow, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 Puddletown {{was one of}} {{the places}} in Dorset where {{agricultural}} labourers took part in the Captain Swing riots of southern England, protesting against <b>very</b> <b>low</b> wages and long working hours. Threshing machines were damaged and ricks burned. Wages were raised from about six or seven shillings per week to ten as a result.|$|E
