5000|$|The Supreme Court reversed. Justice White noted [...] "Accepting {{the premise}} of the Court of Appeals that the case was {{essentially}} a possessory action, we are of the view that the complaint asserted a current right to possession conferred by federal law, wholly independent of state law." [...] The Court distinguished Taylor v. Anderson on these groundsHere, the right to possession itself is claimed to arise under federal law in the first instance. Allegedly, aboriginal title of an Indian tribe guaranteed by treaty and protected by statute has never been extinguished. In Taylor, the plaintiffs were individual Indians, not an Indian tribe; and the suit concerned lands allocated to individual Indians, not tribal rights to lands.... In the present case, however, the assertion of a federal controversy does not rest solely on the claim of a right to possession derived from a federal grant of title whose scope will be governed by state law. Rather, it rests on the not insubstantial claim that federal law now protects, and has continuously protected {{from the time of the}} formation of the United States, possessory rights to tribal lands, wholly apart from the application of state law principles which normally and separately protect a <b>valid</b> right of <b>possession.</b>|$|R
