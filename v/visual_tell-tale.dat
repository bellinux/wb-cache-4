International UN Regulations require that all turn signals flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side turn signal functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or <b>visual</b> <b>tell-tale</b> indicator is required, to advise the driver when the turn signals are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically.
