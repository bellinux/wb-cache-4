5000|$|How to {{properly}} measure Revere Ware diameters: Pot and pan diameters are measured {{from the interior}} of the walls. Measurements taken from the exterior of the walls often include the extra material of the rolled lip, giving the illusion of an additional quarter inch of width. As an example, re-sellers and collectors of vintage Revere Ware may measure a utensil as being 9.25" [...] or 9 1/4", when in fact the pot should properly be measured 9". Skillets may also be improperly measured, as the cooking surface is slightly smaller than the marked or measured size. The marked skillet dimensions refer to interior circumference at the top most part of the flared walls, as the pans are designed to use a lid that coincides with this diameter. Lid Diameters can also lend to confusion, as the correct Stainless Steel lids of vintage (pre-Corning) Revere Ware have belled lips. These belled lips facilitate the oft-advertised <b>Vapor</b> <b>Seal,</b> a method of locking in moisture, which some believe retain nutrients. Re-sellers and collectors, when measuring the inner circumference of the bell flange, often measure the lids an eighth to a quarter of an inch narrower than proper size, or conversely, measure the outside of the bell flair, adding an additional 1/4" [...] to 3/8" [...] of an inch of diameter. A good rule of thumb is knowing all lids and utensils are designed to be measured at whole-inch increments, with the exception of 5.5" [...] sauce pans and lids.|$|E

30|$|How is {{the state}} change of the activation-gate {{translated}} into instantaneous channel opening? In the open state of the channel, {{the movement of the}} substrate ions inside the channel is driven by ∆Ψ′. The central pore can be considered as an electric circuit of two resistors of the activation-gate and selectivity-filter. The voltage-drop on each part of the circuit is proportional to its resistance (i.e., reciprocal of the conductance) relative to the overall resistance of the series-connected circuit. In the dry state, the activation-gate has a very large resistance, practically approaching to infinity. Thus, the voltage-drop applied to the selectivity-filter is zero, because the activation-gate draws all of ∆ΨM. In this case, an induced electric dipole is formed by both cations trapped inside the selectivity-filter and anions attracted locally on the positive side of ∆ΨM. While this induced dipole cancels the electrical field of ∆ΨM inside the selectivity-filter, it also strengthens the field across the activation-gate. Therefore, the electric current passing the selectivity-filter is zero, and consequently the channel is closed. Importantly, this closure functions only in the sense of electric conduction, because the physical size of the activation-gate may remain sufficiently large to hold a hydrated ion (though unable to do so because of the <b>vapor</b> <b>seal).</b> In contrast, in the wet state, the activation-gate is filled with solvent exhibiting a high dielectric constant. Water molecules inside the activation-gate become polarized by the external electrical field of ∆ΨM, and their induced dipoles (partially) cancel the external electrical field. Consequently, the total electrical field inside the activation-gate approaches to zero, and nearly the entire ∆ΨM is focused on the selectivity-filter, driving the ion movement. Because of this electric nature of the gating process, a small structural change around the critical radius of Po(r) instantaneously reshapes the electrostatic field of ∆ΨM, and thus generates a quick response of the channel current to the activation cues that regulate the pore size.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Under normal sealing {{and storage}} conditions, Nylon- 6, poly-caprolactam-based plastic {{laminates}} may release impurities to packaged foods and liquids {{and the application}} of heat for cooking often increases the rate of migration. Epsilon-caprolactam {{is one of the main}} contaminates found to migrate from a Nylon- 6 poly-caprolactam plastic film. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of solvent, transportation and storage time on the migration of ε-caprolactam from a Nylon- 6 -based lidding material into water or a white wine substitute (12 % ethanol). Polypropylene plastic cups were filled, sealed, packaged, stacked and exposed to a simulated 3 -day cross-country shipment. Cups were sampled with or without simulated shipment after 0, 7, 14 and 28 days at 20. 6 °C. Epsilon-caprolactam was determined using a GC equipped with FID and a Restek Rtx 1301 megabore column. Results of the study indicated migration of ε-caprolactam into containers at the time of sealing with significantly higher levels (4. 42 ppm average) occurring in cups containing 12 % ethanol vs. water (0. 01 ppm average). After the cups were sealed, neither simulated cross-country shipment nor storage increased levels of ε-caprolactam in either solvent. The results indicate that wine sealed in packages lined with Nylon- 6 -based plastic could contain significant amounts of ε-caprolactam. However, it is not understood how the alcohol, whether as liquid or vapor, interacted with the lidding material to increase migration at the time of sealing. No delamination of the polypropylene layer in the lidding material was observed after sealing. Future research needs to be conducted to study the effects of alcohol, alcohol <b>vapor,</b> <b>sealing</b> time and temperature on ε-caprolactam migration...|$|R

This gas fill pressure represents roughly 1/100th of the pressure of the atmosphere. The required pressure depends on the gas used and the diameter of the tube, with optimal values ranging from [...] (for a long 20 mm tube filled with argon/mercury) to [...] (for a short 8 mm diameter tube filled with pure neon). Neon or argon are the most common gases used; krypton, xenon, and helium are used by artists for special purposes but are not used alone in normal signs. A premixed combination of argon and helium is often used in lieu of pure argon when a tube is to be installed in a cold climate, since the helium increases voltage drop (and thus power dissipation), warming the tube to operating temperature faster.

40|$|RATIONALE The {{choice of}} {{containers}} for storage of aqueous samples between their collection, transport and water hydrogen (2 H) and oxygen (18 O) stable isotope analysis {{is a topic}} of concern {{for a wide range}} of fields in environmental, geological, biomedical, food, and forensic sciences. The transport and separation of water molecules during water vapor or liquid uptake by sorption or solution and the diffusive transport of water molecules through organic polymer material by permeation or pervaporation may entail an isotopic fractionation. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the extent of such fractionation. METHODS Sixteen bottle-like containers of eleven different organic polymers, including low and high density polyethylene (LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and perfluoroalkoxy-Teflon (PFA), of different wall thickness and size were completely filled with the same mineral water and stored for 659 ?days under the same conditions of temperature and humidity. Particular care was exercised to keep the bottles tightly closed and prevent loss of water <b>vapor</b> through the <b>seals.</b> RESULTS Changes of up to + 5 parts per thousand for d 2 H values and + 2. 0 parts per thousand for d 18 O values were measured for water after more than 1 ?year of storage within a plastic container, with the magnitude of change depending mainly on the type of organic polymer, wall thickness, and container size. The most important variations were measured for the PET and PC bottles. Waters stored in glass bottles with Polyseal (TM) cone-lined PP screw caps and thick-walled HDPE or PFA containers with linerless screw caps having an integrally molded inner sealing ring preserved their original d 2 H and d 18 O values. The carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen stable isotope compositions of the organic polymeric materials were also determined. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study clearly show that for precise and accurate measurements of the water stable isotope composition in aqueous solutions, rigorous sampling and storage procedures are needed both for laboratory standards and for unknown samples.

However, the mechanism by which canines respond to explosive vapors is not well understood, leading to difficulties in canine training and testing. It is known {{that the amount of}} vapor generated from explosive compounds is dependent upon several factors including sample amount, vapor pressure, and the degree of confinement. Underlying these factors is the basic process of evaporation of an unconfined explosive, which is crucial to understanding how explosive vapors behave in other, more confined, systems. In Stage One of this study, evaporation rates were determined for several explosive liquids using an analytical balance. These rates were compared to one another as well as to theoretical models for the evaporation of liquids. In general and as expected, mass decreased linearly with time and evaporation rates decreased logarithmically as boiling point increased. Several examples of solvent 2 ̆ 2 pinning 2 ̆ 2 on a metal surface were also observed. ^ While an empirical model for the evaporation of unconfined explosive liquids was developed, a comprehensive model for the escape of explosive <b>vapors</b> from <b>sealed</b> containers (i. e., a suitcase, knapsack, or IED container itself) is needed. The second part of Stage One {{of this study was to}} determine that the flow rate of explosive vapors escaping from relatively large orifices does not conform to Fick 2 ̆ 7 s Law of Diffusion. Fick 2 ̆ 7 s model states that the flow rate is linearly dependent upon the cross sectional area of the orifice and the material 2 ̆ 7 s diffusion coefficient. Instead, the flow rate was found to be linearly dependent upon the diameter of the orifice due to the tendency of the flow to diffuse outwards from its circular edge. A clear relationship between flow rate and diffusion coefficient was seen, however. ^ Additional uncertainty arises concerning the complexity of the odor generated from explosive compounds. Because explosive vapors are often complex (they consist of multiple chemical compounds), confusion exists regarding the cause of canine alert; that is the 2 ̆ 2 odor compound 2 ̆ 2 that allows for canine detection of various explosives. Although 2, 4 - dinitrotoluene (DNT) has been explored as a potential odor compound, the possibility of a nitrated explosive inherently producing nitrated gas upon decomposition has not. Stage Two of this study focused on evaluating nitrate as a potential cause of canine alerts. An LC/MS method for the detection of nitrate ions in Composition C- 4 and flake trinitrotoluene (TNT) was developed and tested. Instrumental analysis was not successful in detecting nitrate ions in any of the explosives tested. The lack of nitrate was confirmed using a diphenylamine color test for nitrates, thus eliminating nitrate as an odor compound and cause of canine alert to nitroaromatic compounds. ^ 2, 4 -DNT has been introduced as a potential odor compound of TNT, however, the mechanisms behind its vapor emission have not been thoroughly explored.

In particular, whether the amount of material lost to surface adhesion is significant enough to effect canine detection of TNT. A second focus of Stage Two explored this concern. A GC/MS method for the detection and separation of TNT and DNT isomers in liquid extracts was developed and the amount of 2, 4 -DNT residues adhering to container walls was quantified. These values, compared to the amount 2, 4 -DNT expected to saturate each container (determined by the Ideal Gas Law), showed a significant preference of 2, 4 -DNT in the solid phase as opposed to in the gas phase.

40|$|Plants {{subjected}} to biotic or abiotic stress factors can respond with adjustments in their biochemical and physiological processes. These adjustments are {{often accompanied by}} changes in reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance at leaf and canopy level. This contribution aims to understand how optical signals linked to plant physiology changes after the application of two different chemical agents: an herbicide blocking the electron-transfer mechanisms in the photosynthetic apparatus (Chlortoluron) and an anti-transpirant chemical known to reduce plant transpiration (<b>Vapor</b> Gard) by <b>sealing</b> the stomata. The chemicals have been applied on 9 grass plots with different concentrations. Three plots have been kept not-treated and used as control. Canopy high resolution spectral measurements and CO 2 fluxes have been collected daily on the same sampling area in each plot for the entire duration of the experiment to monitor the temporal evolution of the stress effects. Spectral measurements {{have been used to}} estimate the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence in both the red (SIF 687) and far-red region (SIF 760), the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) linked to the xanthophyll-related heat dissipation and several traditional vegetation indices related to canopy greenness and chlorophyll concentration. SIF 687 and SIF 760 were estimated with spectral fitting methods spectrally modeling the radiance collected with very high resolution spectrometers in the oxygen absorption O 2 -A and O 2 -B bands. The applied treatments induced a variation of plant photosynthetic functioning modulated according to the level of herbicide concentration. Both SIF 687 and SIF 760 measured in Chlortoluron-treated grass plots were significantly higher than in the control plots. The highest dose caused fluorescence values to double in less than 3 hours while the reflectance signal at the same time was not affected confirming that the increase in fluorescence emission was only related to variations in the plant functional status not associated to changes in pigment content and composition. F 687 and F 760 values of treated plots decreased steeply in the following days. Fluorescence decline was accompanied by a decrease in chlorophyll content. Grass photosynthesis began to decline immediately after the herbicide application and continued in the following days. This result implies that fluorescence was negatively correlated to plant photosynthesis in an early phase of stress reaction and then the relation became positive in the following days. Thus the translation of fluorescence values to photosynthesis is not straightforward in this experiment. Lower doses affected fluorescence signal similarly but with a different temporal dynamic in both the initial rise and the recovery. Chlortoluron also caused an initial increase of PRI values followed by a gradual decline associated to the degradation of the pigment pool. The application of the anti-transpirant agent only slightly affected fluorescence emission and PRI probably because the photosynthetic system was not directly compromised. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence allowed to monitor the temporal dynamics of plants’ functioning and recovery after the application of temporarily blocking photosynthesis agents. Further studies are ongoing to better understand the effects of stress on the fluorescence signal and the link to heat dissipation and photosynthesis...|$|R

Although 2, 4 - dinitrotoluene (DNT) has been explored as a potential odor compound, the possibility of a nitrated explosive inherently producing nitrated gas upon decomposition has not. Stage Two of this study focused on evaluating nitrate as a potential cause of canine alerts. An LC/MS method for the detection of nitrate ions in Composition C- 4 and flake trinitrotoluene (TNT) was developed and tested. Instrumental analysis was not successful in detecting nitrate ions in any of the explosives tested. The lack of nitrate was confirmed using a diphenylamine color test for nitrates, thus eliminating nitrate as an odor compound and cause of canine alert to nitroaromatic compounds. 2, 4 -DNT has been introduced as a potential odor compound of TNT, however, the mechanisms behind its vapor emission have not been thoroughly explored. More specifically, due to the “sticky” nature of the 2, 4 -DNT isomer, the effects of surface adhesion to container walls are of concern. In particular, whether the amount of material lost to surface adhesion is significant enough to effect canine detection of TNT. A second focus of Stage Two explored this concern. A GC/MS method for the detection and separation of TNT and DNT isomers in liquid extracts was developed and the amount of 2, 4 -DNT residues adhering to container walls was quantified. These values, compared to the amount 2, 4 -DNT expected to saturate each container (determined by the Ideal Gas Law), showed a significant preference of 2, 4 -DNT in the solid phase as opposed to in the gas phase. The amount of residue adhering to the walls of a gallon can differed from expected values by nearly 70 %. The amount of material extracted from a quart can exceeded expected values by 137 %. The apparent sticky nature of 2, 4 -DNT resulted in a significant loss of material needed to fully saturate a container and thus canine detection success may be affected. In the final stage of this study, theories regarding odor compounds and odor availability of nitromethane, TNT, and Composition C- 4 were tested using certified explosives-detecting canines. These trials included thirty-three canine-handler teams from eight government agencies. The odor availability of nitromethane was tested by placing varying volumes of nitromethane in containers with differing degrees of confinement and studying the effects on canine detection success. The odor availability trial showed no significant effect of sample amount or degree of confinement on canine detection so long as the sample volume was sufficient to saturate its container. In this study that volume was determined to be < 1 mL. Detection of 2, 4 -DNT, TNT-NESST (Non-Hazardous Explosives for Security Training and Testing), and flake TNT were also studied using certified canines. The purpose of this was to identify the odorant responsible for canine alert to the explosive TNT. These trials showed a significant response to 2, 4 -DNT compared to TNT and its training aid; this suggests that 2, 4 -DNT is the primary cause of canine alerts to TNT. Additionally, Composition C- 4 and RDX-NESTT were tested along with potential odor compounds that included the manufacturing solvent, cyclohexanone, the energetic “taggant” 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2. 3 -dinitrobutane (DMNB), the plasticizer dioctyladipate (DOA) and its degradation product 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol. While some response to DMNB and cyclohexanone was seen, the most significant response was to the actual Composition C- 4. This suggests that the cause of canine alert to Composition C- 4 is the explosive mixture as a whole and not a single chemical component of the mixtur...|$|R
