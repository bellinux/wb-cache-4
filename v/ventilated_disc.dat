25|$|The American Crosley Hot Shot {{is often}} {{given credit for}} the first {{production}} disc brakes. For six months in 1950, Crosley built a car with these brakes, then returned to drum brakes. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads. Drum brake conversions for Hot Shots were quite popular. The Crosley disc was a Goodyear development, a caliper type with <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc,</b> originally designed for aircraft applications.|$|E
25|$|The City Turbo's {{suspension}} {{was more}} refined {{than that of}} the ordinary City. The four-wheel independent system used progressive rate coil springs, with stabilizers at both the front and the rear. Tires were the 165/70HR12 radials, and stopping power was provided by <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> brakes at the front and semi-metallic shoes at the rear. The Turbo II's flared fenders weren't just cosmetic, but were necessary to accommodate a 30mm (20mm in the rear) wider track and bigger 185/60 R13 tires.|$|E
2500|$|The Audi V8 came {{equipped}} with {{rack and pinion}} power assisted steering (PAS) as standard. An electronically controlled variable assisted 'servotronic' version was also available. It was fitted with a high-performance brake system, which included radially <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> brakes front and rear. [...] The fronts were rather unusual – designed by Continental AG and sized at [...] in diameter by [...] thick, but the caliper was mounted inside the disc.

2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod with coil springs and stabilizer bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear <b>ventilated</b> <b>disc</b> brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E
