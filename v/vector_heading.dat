40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimal solu-tions {{to the maximum}} endurance subsonic by the application of Pontryagin's maximum principle. The gliding vehicle {{is assumed to be}} carried by an aeroplane which has a velocity <b>vector</b> <b>heading</b> along the line connecting aeroplane and target. Then at a certain point when the aeroplane is ap-proaching, directly above, or leaving the target, the vehicle is released. The vehicle then glides to the target in the horizontal plane with a maximum flight time. The formulation is reduced to a minimum number of aerodynamic characteri-stics by the use of a set of dimensionless variables so that the results are appli-cable to a whole class of vehicles. Bank angle is the control variable. There are two constraints on the turning maneuver-ability, one is the load factor and the 4 other is the maximum lift coefficient. These two constraints are discussed in detail. Several optimal trajectories with different points of release are computed. For a specified altitude, it is found that there are a maximum radius of penetration and an absolute maximum endurance. Also, the influence of the altitude on the glid-ing flight in a horizontal plane is dis-cussed. gliding trajectories in a horizontal plane Nomenclature co,c 1,C 2,c 3 constants of integration CD drag coefficient zero lift drag coefficient lift coefficient lift coefficient for maximum lift-to-drag rati...|$|E

Distance measurement or relative position estimation is not required. In theory, the proposed control law verifies that distance information is redundant in rendezvous control tasks though the objective of rendezvous is to decrease the inter-robot distances. In practice, the control law provides a simple solution to vision-based rendezvous tasks where bearings can be measured by visual sensing. Moreover, we generalize the proposed control law by introducing an additional <b>heading</b> <b>vector</b> into the control law.

The body louse is the primary vector that transmits the bacterial agents of louse-borne relapsing fever, trench fever, and epidemic typhus. The genomes of the bacterial causative agents of several of these aforementioned diseases have been sequenced. Thus, determining the body louse genome will enhance studies of host-vector-pathogen interactions. Although not important as a major disease <b>vector,</b> <b>head</b> lice are of major social concern. Resistance to traditional pesticides used to control head and body lice have developed. It is imperative that new molecular targets be discovered {{for the development of}} novel compounds to control these insects. No complete genome sequence exists for a hemimetabolous insect species primarily because hemimetabolous insects often have large (2000 Mb) to very large (up to 16, 300 Mb) genomes. Fortuitously, we determined that the human body louse has one of the smallest genome sizes known in insects, suggesting it may be a suitable choice as a minimal hemimetabolous genome in which many genes have been eliminated during its adaptation to human parasitism. Because many louse species infest birds and mammals, the body louse genome-sequencing project will facilitate studies of their comparative genomics.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} anticipates {{the future of}} smart buildings by developing algorithms that categorize the movements of individuals based on such characteristics as motion <b>vectors,</b> velocity <b>vectors,</b> <b>head</b> orientation <b>vectors</b> and predetermined positions. The intended applications include detecting intrusions, helping lost visitors, and changing the artwork on virtual posters to reflect an individual's presumed interests. The vectors we capture represent trajectories in a multi-dimensional space. To {{make sense out of}} these, we first segment a trajectory into sub-trajectories, typically based on time. To describe each sub-trajectory, we use primitive patterns of body movement and additional information, e. g., average speed during this interval, head movement and place or object nearby. That is, for each subtrajectory, we use a tuple of the following form: (interval_ID, body_movement, avg_speed, head_movement, places_passed). Since trajectories may have many outliers introduced by sensor failures or uneven human movement, we have developed a neural network-based pattern extraction subsystem that can handle intervals with noisy data. The choice of these attributes and our current classification of behaviors do not imply that these are the only or best ways to categorize behaviors. However, we do not see that as the focus of the research reported here. Rather, our goal is to show that the use of primitive attributes (low level), neural networks to identify categories of recognizable simple behaviors (middle level) and a regular expression-based means of describing intent (high level) is sufficient to provide a means to convert observable low-level attributes into the recognition of potential intents...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{questions}} about the role of the hippocampal formation in spatial cognition and spatial navigation. Specifically, Study 1 and Study 2 show that patients with unilateral language nondominant anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) show impairments on tasks assessing cognitive mapping. Study 3 shows that the ability of these patients to navigate a virtual environment (VE) by means of cognitive maps is disrupted. Study 4 shows that, under normal circumstances, healthy adults have a choice of at least two spatial navigation strategies (navigation by means of <b>heading</b> <b>vectors,</b> or navigation by means of cognitive mapping), and that they will likely choose the optimal strategy for task solution. Study 5 suggests that patients with unilateral language nondominant ATL are able to successfully navigate by means of <b>heading</b> <b>vectors.</b> The data from these studies are generally consistent with predictions derived from cognitive mapping theory (O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978).

40|$|Abstract: A {{system for}} driver {{drowsiness}} monitoring is proposed, using multi-sensor data acquisition and investigating two decision-making algorithms, namely a fuzzy inference system (FIS) and an {{artificial neural network}} (ANN), to predict the drowsiness level of the driver. Drowsiness indicator signals are selected allowing non-intrusive measurements. The experi-mental set-up of a driver-drowsiness-monitoring system is designed {{on the basis of}} the sought-after indicator signals. These selected signals are the eye closure via pupil area measurement, gaze <b>vector</b> and <b>head</b> motion acquired by a monocular computer vision system, steering wheel angle, vehicle speed, and force applied to the steering wheel by the driver. It is believed that, by fusing these signals, driver drowsiness can be detected and drowsiness level can be predicted. For validation of this hypothesis, 30 subjects, in normal and sleep-deprived conditions, are involved in a standard highway simulation for 1. 5 h, giving a data set of 30 pairs. For designing a feature space to be used in decision making, several metrics are derived using histograms and entropies of the signals. An FIS and an ANN are used for decision making on the drowsiness level. To construct the rule base of the FIS, two different methods are employed and compared in terms of performance: first, linguistic rules from experimental studies in literature and...|$|R
40|$|The {{vestibular}} organs {{can feed}} perceptual processes that build {{a picture of}} our route as we move about in the world. However, raw vestibular signals do not define the path taken because, during travel, the head can undergo accelerations unrelated to the route and also be orientated in any direction to vary the signal. This study investigated the computational {{process by which the}} brain transforms raw vestibular signals for the purpose of route reconstruction. We electrically stimulated the vestibular nerves of human subjects to evoke a virtual head rotation fixed in skull co-ordinates and measure its perceptual effect. The virtual head rotation caused subjects to perceive an illusory whole-body rotation that was a cyclic function of head-pitch angle. They perceived whole-body yaw rotation in one direction with the head pitched forwards, the opposite direction with the head pitched backwards, and no rotation with the head in an intermediate position. A model based on vector operations and the anatomy and firing properties of semicircular canals precisely predicted these perceptions. In effect, a neural process computes the vector dot product between the craniocentric vestibular <b>vector</b> of <b>head</b> rotation and the gravitational unit vector.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a head pose estimation approach using a single camera {{in order to identify}} driver inattention. Our approach is based on a robust fusion of multiple significant descriptors (SF, HOG, Haar, and SURF) in order to construct an efficient feature <b>vector</b> representing <b>head</b> pose variations. Then, two SVMs are learned to classify the feature vectors according to pitch and yaw angles. Our head pose estimator is not restricted to monitoring driver inattention level and can also be used by diverse applications requiring knowledge of human activity such as human-machine interfaces and game industry. Before applying our estimator, it is important to identify the number of poses that must be estimated for each angle depending on the application requirements. In our paper, we use three classes for both pitch and yaw angles since we deal with the problem of estimating driver head pose to determine its inattention level. Since no public database is available for estimating driver head pose, we perform several experiments on the public database Pointing’ 04 to validate our approach and compare it with the recent and the most cited state-of-the-art techniques. We have also acquired a video sequence using a cheap visible spectrum camera representing a driver in various attention levels and we find that our head pose estimator can achieve an accuracy of 97.5 % for pitch and 98.2 % for yaw.|$|R

However, while the derivation of the decoders is well documented for regular speaker arrangements [1], optimising the decoders for irregular layouts is not a simple task, where optimisation requires the solution of a set of non linear simultaneous equations, complicated further by the fact that multiple solutions are possible [2]. Craven [3] extended the system to use higher order circular harmonics and presented a 4 th order Ambisonic decoder (9 input channels), although the derivation method used was not presented.
