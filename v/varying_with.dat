5|$|Adult great spotted {{woodpeckers}} have {{a complete}} moult after the breeding season which takes about 120days. Northern D. m. major starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like D. m. pinetorum are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern D. m. hispanicus starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the wing coverts but replacing body, tail and primary feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing <b>varying</b> <b>with</b> latitude as with the adults.|$|E
5|$|Flowering {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate <b>varying</b> <b>with</b> the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging is also at its peak.|$|E

5|$|Most Apus swift species nest {{in rocky}} areas, and the {{majority}} will accept human habitations {{as a substitute for}} natural sites. The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal clutch, the number <b>varying</b> <b>with</b> geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5x16–17mm (0.95–1.08x0.63–0.67in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which fledge in an average 40.5days.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and {{for a day or}} two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy that reduces the individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, <b>varying</b> <b>with</b> the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 In {{this thesis}} we {{introduce}} and study Brownian motion {{with or without}} drift on state spaces <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dimension. Starting <b>with</b> a concrete such state space that is the plane with an infinite pole on it, we construct a Brownian motion on it and derive sharp two-sided global estimates on its transition density functions (also called heat kernel). These two-sided estimates are of Guassian type. However, we show that the parabolic Harnack inequality fails for such process and the measure on the underlying state space does not satisfy volume doubling property. Brownian motion on some other state spaces <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dimensions are also studied in this thesis. For instance, we study Brownian motion on a plane with multiple lines and Brownian motion on a plane with an arc. Similar to Brownian motion <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dimension, drifted Brownian motion <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dimension can be characterized by infinitesimal generators and by non-symmetric Dirichlet forms. By establishing and using Duhamel's formula, we show the transition density of Brownian motion with drift on spaces <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dimension is {{comparable to that of}} Brownian motion <b>with</b> <b>varying</b> dimension without drift. We also derive the Green function estimates for this process on bounded smooth domains and establish H"{o}lder regularity for its parabolic functions...|$|R

25|$|Pectins, {{also known}} as pectic polysaccharides, are rich in galacturonic acid. Several {{distinct}} polysaccharides have been identified and characterised within the pectic group. Homogalacturonans are linear chains of α-(1–4)-linked D-galacturonic acid. Substituted galacturonans are characterized {{by the presence of}} saccharide appendant residues (such as D-xylose or D-apiose in the respective cases of xylogalacturonan and apiogalacturonan) branching from a backbone of D-galacturonic acid residues. Rhamnogalacturonan I pectins (RG-I) contain a backbone of the repeating disaccharide: 4)-α-D-galacturonic acid-(1,2)-α-L-rhamnose-(1. From many of the rhamnose residues, sidechains of various neutral sugars branch off. The neutral sugars are mainly D-galactose, L-arabinose and D-xylose, with the types and proportions of neutral sugars <b>varying</b> <b>with</b> the origin of pectin.|$|E
