40|$|ABSTRACT: Multichannel {{auditory}} brainstem implants (ABI) {{are currently}} indicated {{for patients with}} neurofibromatosis type II (NF 2) involving both <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> The ABI helps bypass the damaged cochlear nerves and restores a level of auditory sensation via the electrical stimulation of the cochlear nucleus. The implant is usually placed in the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle {{at the time of}} tumor resection to stimulate the cochlear nucleus.

5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> (VIII) splits {{into the}} {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie otoliths, tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these otoliths shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose Unexpected {{clinical}} outcomes following transection of single nerves {{of the internal}} acoustic meatus have been reported. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate interneural connections between the nervus intermedius and the adjacent nerves in the cerebellopontine angle. Methods On 100 cadaveric sides, dissections were made of the facial/vestibulocochlear complex in the cerebellopontine angle with {{special attention to the}} nervus intermedius and potential connections between this nerve and the adjacent facial or <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves.</b> Results A nervus intermedius was identified on all but ten sides. Histologically confirmed neural connections were found between the nervus intermedius and either the facial or <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> on 34 % of sides. The mean diameter of these small interconnecting nerves was 0. 1 mm. The fiber orientation of these nerves was usually oblique (anteromedial or posterolateral) in nature, but 13 connections traveled anteroposteriorly. Connecting fibers were single on 81 % of sides, doubled on 16 %, and tripled on 3 %, six sides had connections both with the facial nerve anteriorly and the vestibular nerves posteriorly. On 6. 5 % of sides, a connection was between the nervus intermedius and cochlear nerve. For vestibular nerve connections with the nervus intermedius, 76 % were with the superior vestibular nerve and 24 % with the inferior vestibular nerve. Conclusions Knowledge of the possible neural interconnections found between the nervus intermedius and surrounding nerves may prove useful to surgeons who operate in these regions so that inadvertent traction or transection is avoided. Additionally, unanticipated clinical presentations and exams following surgery may be due to such neural interconnections...|$|R
5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve.</b> Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the vestibulo–ocular reflex.|$|E
25|$|Abnormalities of the {{cranial nerves}} are present 50-70% of cases. The most common {{abnormality}} is {{involvement of the}} facial nerve, which may lead to reduced power on one or {{both sides of the}} face (65% resp 35% of all cranial nerve cases), followed by reduction in visual perception due to optic nerve involvement. Rarer symptoms are double vision (oculomotor nerve, trochlear nerve or abducens nerve), decreased sensation of the face (trigeminal nerve), hearing loss or vertigo (<b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve),</b> swallowing problems (glossopharyngeal nerve) and weakness of the shoulder muscles (accessory nerve) or the tongue (hypoglossal nerve). Visual problems may also be the result of papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) due to obstruction by granulomas of the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation.|$|E
500|$|The {{facial nerve}} (VII) and <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> (VIII) both enter the {{internal}} auditory canal in the temporal bone. [...] The facial nerve then reaches {{the side of the}} face by using the stylomastoid foramen, also in the temporal bone. [...] Its fibers then spread out to reach and control all of the muscles of facial expression. [...] The <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> reaches the organs that control balance and hearing in the temporal bone, and therefore does not reach the external surface of the skull.|$|E
50|$|The AICA {{branches}} off {{the lateral}} {{portion of the}} basilar artery, just superior to the junction of the vertebral arteries. From its origin, it branches along the inferior portion of the pons at the cerebellopontine angle before reaching the cerebellum. This artery supplies blood to the anterior portion of the inferior cerebellum, the middle cerebellar peduncle, and to the facial (CN VII) and <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> (CN VIII). Obstruction of the AICA can cause paresis, paralysis, and loss of sensation in the face; it can also cause hearing impairment. Moreover, it could cause an infarct of the cerebellopontine angle. This could lead to hyperacusia (dysfunction of the stapedius muscle, innervated by CN VII) and vertigo (wrong interpretation from the vestibular semi-circular canal's endolymph acceleration caused by alteration of CN VIII).|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the space}} demands in the cerebellopontine angle lie extra-axially. Important {{structures}} run within the cisterns of the cerebellopontine angle, such as the trigeminal, facial and <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> {{as well as the}} anterior inferior and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and the veins which lead to the petrosal sinus.

Less common are epidermoid and other schwannomas as well as metastases, paragangliomas and arachnoidal cysts. Intra-axial tumours {{in the area of the}} cerebellopontine angle include the medulloblastoma, astrocytoma and the ependymoma, which occurs predominantly in children, in addition to the uncommon choroid plexus papilloma. Nearby, there are also space demands around the petrous bone, such as cholesterol granuloma, malignant otitis media, paraganglioma and metastases.

500|$|The {{inner ear}} houses the {{apparatus}} necessary {{to change the}} vibrations transmitted {{from the outside world}} via the middle ear into signals passed along the <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> to the brain. The hollow channels of the inner ear are filled with liquid, and contain a sensory epithelium that is studded with hair cells. The microscopic [...] "hairs" [...] of these cells are structural protein filaments that project out into the fluid. The hair cells are mechanoreceptors that release a chemical neurotransmitter when stimulated. Sound waves moving through fluid flows against the receptor cells of the organ of Corti. The fluid pushes the filaments of individual cells; movement of the filaments causes receptor cells to become open to receive the potassium-rich endolymph. This causes the cell to depolarise, and creates an action potential that is transmitted along the spiral ganglion, which sends information through the auditory portion of the <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerve</b> to the temporal lobe of the brain.|$|E

40|$|Disequilibrium, {{ranging from}} {{lightheadedness}} to severe vertigo, is frequently {{of great concern}} to the patients {{with a variety of}} inner ear diseases, and may cause occupational and social disability. Vestibular nerve section may be considered when vestibular symptoms are resistant to medical therapy and associated with serviceable hearing in the involved ear. During the last century, numerous authors described several routes for intracranial section of the eighth nerve, such as lateral suboccipital craniotomy, middle cranial fossa approach, and retrolabyrinthine approach to the vestibular fossa. Control of vertigo by all routes to the vestibular nerve has a success rate of 80 % to 90 %. The potential for endoscopic approach to intracranial cavities was recognized early in this century but, due to technical limitations, was largely abandoned after a few attempts. Advances in optics, and the introduction of very fine instruments made endoscopy worth reconsideration. Since the early 1980 s, rigid endoscopes have been used in otorhinolaryngology for paranasal sinus surgery and the visualization of the facial and <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves</b> during acoustic tumor surgery. We performed endoscopic section of the vestibular nerve through a retrolabyrinthine approach in two cadavers and in two patients with the symptoms of disequilibrium. In the literature survey, we could find no reports on vestibular neurectomy performed by endoscopic technique.

40|$|Objective: Bone-conducted {{vibration}} (BCV) in the midline at the hairline (Fz), {{results in}} short latency potentials recorded by surface electrodes beneath the eyes - the ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP). The early negative {{component of the}} oVEMP, n 10, is due to vestibular stimulation, however it {{is similar to the}} early R 1 component of the blink reflex. Here we seek to dissociate n 10 from R 1. Methods: Surface potentials were recorded from the infraorbital electromyogram of 10 healthy subjects, 6 patients with bilateral vestibular loss, 2 with unilateral vestibular loss, 4 with facial palsy and 3 with facial and vestibular nerve lesions on the same side. BCV was delivered at Fz, the inion, the glabella or the supra-orbital ridge using a tendon hammer or a bone-conduction vibrator. Results: Onset latencies of the n 10 evoked by taps at Fz or inion were significantly shorter than the R 1 components of blink responses to supraorbital and glabellar stimuli. Upward gaze increased the amplitude of The n 10 was absent bilaterally in patients with bilateral vestibular loss and beneath the contralesional eye in patients with unilateral vestibular loss, but in both these groups of patients R 1 was preserved. In severe facial palsy the R 1 component was absent or delayed and attenuated ipsilesionally, but n 10 was preserved bilaterally. In subjects with unilateral facial and vestibular nerve lesions (Herpes Zoster of the facial and <b>vestibulocochlear</b> <b>nerves)</b> the dissociation was complete - the ipsilesional R 1 was absent or attenuated whereas the ipsilesional n 10 was preserved. Conclusions: n 10 is distinguished from R 1 by its earlier onset, laterality, modulation by gaze position and dissociation in patient groups. Significance: The n 10 component evoked by BCV at Fz is not the R 1 component of the blink reflex. (C) 2009 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. Neuroprosthetics is a {{relatively}} new topic but it has already shown its potential. Since the application of this science, it has already significantly improved {{the quality of life of}} over 60, 000 individuals who previously suffered from severely impaired hearing or total deafness. Today, through use of cochlear implants, children born totally deaf can enjoy going to regular schools and communicating normally. Individuals suffering from dizziness and balance disorders can also benefit from the progress made in cochlear prosthetics. The inner ear's vestibular system provides cues about self-motion and help stabilise vision during movement. Damage to this system can result in dizziness, imbalance, blurred vision and instability in locomotion, a leading cause of death in the elderly. We propose a hybrid CMOS/MEMS platform for bypassing a dysfunctional pathway in individuals that suffer from balance-related disorders. Combining MEMS-based inertia sensing with CMOS-based neural monitoring and processing electronics, this prosthesis aims to deliver a corrective artificial stimulus to the <b>vestibulocochlear</b> (VIII) <b>nerve.</b> We describe a novel system outlining the architectural aspects and implementation methodology used in the design...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Symptomatic early neurosyphilis with isolated acute multiple {{cranial nerves}} palsy as initial manifestation of HIV infection is very rare. It {{is caused by}} direct invasion of {{the central nervous system}} by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Case Report: A 31 -year-old African-American homosexual man presented with bilateral hearing loss, constant vertigo, inter-mittent horizontal diplopia, and bilateral facial droop, which was associated with occipital headache without fever. Neurological examination revealed bilateral <b>vestibulocochlear</b> and facial <b>nerve</b> palsy. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after administration of gadolinium, he was found to have extensive iso-lated basilar meningeal enhancement involving the midbrain, pons along the seven and eight nerves complex bilaterally, consistent with basal meningoencephalitis. Conclusions: Neurosyphilis can present as initial manifestation of HIV infection with early involvement of basal meninges and cranial nerves. It is important to understand that neurosyphilis is still a significant disease with complex neurological presentation. Early diagnosis and treatment of neurosyphilis is crucial due to potential persistent disabilities that can be easily treated or even prevented...|$|R
