However, he discovers that a local welder named Llewelyn Moss, who chanced upon the money while hunting, has taken it and left town. Chigurh tracks Moss down to a motel using a receiver that connects to a transponder hidden in the satchel of money. However, Moss has hidden the money in a <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct,</b> and when he returns to the motel, suspecting (correctly) that someone is in his room, he retrieves the money from the connected vent in a second rented room on the backside of the motel. His original room is in fact being occupied by a group of Mexican gangsters sent to ambush him. When Chigurh enters this room, he kills the Mexicans and searches for the money, but it is nowhere to be found. Moss, meanwhile, has already fled after hearing the subsequent gunfire.|$|E

500|$|Dr. No {{is set in}} London, England, Kingston, Jamaica and Crab Key, {{a fictional}} island off Jamaica. Filming began on {{location}} in Jamaica on 16 January 1962. The primary scenes there were the exterior shots of Crab Key and Kingston, where an uncredited Syd Cain acted as art director and also designed the Dragon Tank. They shot {{a few yards from}} Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the author would regularly visit the filming with friends. Location filming was largely in Oracabessa, with additional scenes on the Palisadoes strip and Port Royal in St Andrew. On 21 February, production left Jamaica with footage still unfilmed due to a change of weather. Five days later, filming began at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, England with sets designed by Ken Adam, which included Dr. No's base, the <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct</b> and the interior of the British Secret Service headquarters. The studio would later be used on the majority of later Bond films.

After 58 days of filming, principal photography completed on 30 March 1962.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{the complex}} status of fluid flow in stator radial <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> of large turbo-generator, the {{temperature}} distribution of stator is dramatically {{affected by the}} flow status of cooling medium in stator ventilating ducts. In this paper, a new ventilating ducts structure in stator is investigated. According to fixing a wind deflector on the stator teeth adjacent to the <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts,</b> the fluid flow status of cooling air is changed flowing in stator <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts.</b> For this reason, the effect of heat transfer in stator is changed. Taking an air-cooled turbo-generator as an example, considering the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in turbo-generator ventilation system, the three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer coupling model is established. Using finite volume method, three-dimensional fluid field and temperature field control equations are coupling solved. Based on this, the velocity distribution in ventilating ducts is obtained. Besides that, the velocity distribution is studied with the cooling air flows into radial <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> at different incident angles. The influences of wind deflector and incident angles on the fluid velocity and temperature distribution are analyzed. Based on that, some useful conclusions are obtained...|$|R

40|$|This paper briefly reviews {{prediction}} {{techniques for}} determination of leakage and friction along auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems. In order to compare various prediction techniques {{that have been}} developed over the past, a macroscopic investigation of air leakage and friction resistance of auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems has been undertaken. Measurements were conducted on 450 and 915 mm diameter fabric ducting over 100 m duct length to determine frictional resistances and the extent of leakage. Due to the high degree of accuracy required and the large volume of data that needed to be collected, electronic pressure transducers were used with computer for data recording. Conceptual models that describe the leakage characteristics of auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems were developed based on this information. It was found that these models provided good correlation with most of the existing prediction techniques. The experimental methodology relying on computer data acquisition has allowed the accuracy of measured values to be treated {{with a high degree of}} confidence. The reliability of the developed models allows prediction of leakage, frictional impedance and airflow with enhanced confidence...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to propose}} and explore natural ventilation schemes {{for the design}} of high-performance, non-residential buildings in hot and humid climates. Three such schemes were applied toward retrofitting the existing Hawai‘i Institute of Geophysics buildings on University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa (UHM) campus in Honolulu. The results were investigated by using parametric study and Airflow Network (AN) model, coupled with thermal model in EnergyPlus. Meanwhile, the number of discomfort hours, during the time the buildings are occupied and based on the adaptive thermal comfort, was used as a quantitative index for the performance of the natural ventilation design schemes. The results revealed that pure cross-ventilation is not a feasible mode to deliver adequate thermal comfort to the occupants, per an acceptable number of discomfort hours. However, with the supplementation of vertical <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> (shafts), the performance of natural ventilation design schemes significantly improved. In these cases, it was found that either <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> or <b>ventilation</b> windows can be completely closed, thus eliminating the need of one or the other in natural ventilation designs and therefore mitigating the potential for outdoor noise traveling into spaces through <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> and/or <b>ventilation</b> windows’ openings.

After the scheme is chosen, the actual geometry of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> and <b>ventilation</b> windows, appropriate louvers and duct fittings, as well as their optimal aspect ratios, should be taken into consideration.
