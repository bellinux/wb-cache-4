25|$|The use of full cutoff {{fixtures}} help {{to reduce}} sky glow by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal. Full cutoff typically reduces the <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>lamp</b> and reflector within a luminaire, so {{the effects of}} glare are also reduced. Campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures, since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground. However, full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other types of luminaires, corresponding to lower luminaire efficiency, suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary.|$|R

However, {{few studies}} have addressed the <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> rear fog <b>lamps</b> in daytime fog. The present study evaluates the contrasts <b>of</b> tail <b>lamps,</b> brake lamps and rear fog lamps. An experiment was performed in 2001 at a parking lot on Mt. Fuji Parkway in Japan. A vehicle equipped with a data-recording system {{was used as the}} data measurement station. Luminance, illuminance and transmissivity in fog were simultaneously recorded at intervals of 2 minutes. Three types <b>of</b> tail <b>lamp,</b> three types <b>of</b> brake <b>lamp</b> and two types <b>of</b> rear fog <b>lamp</b> were used, with an observation distance of 50. 0 m. The recorded data showed the background luminance in fog to be affected by illuminance and transmissivity in the daytime. A multiple regression model was applied to determine the background luminance. Contrasts were calculated using this model. Tail lamp visibility was low in deep fog in daytime. Under the same conditions, the rear fog lamps had higher visibility than both the tail lamps and the brake lamps. It was found that the rear fog lamps could provide sufficient visibility in daytime fog...|$|R
40|$|Light {{pollution}} due to {{exterior lighting}} is a rising concern. While glare, light trespass and general light pollution {{have been well}} described, there are few reported studies {{on the impact of}} light pollution on insects. By studying insect behavior in relation to artificial lighting, we suggest that control of the UV component of artificial lighting can significantly reduce its attractiveness, offering a strong ability to control the impact on insects. Traditionally, the attractiveness <b>of</b> a <b>lamp</b> to insects is calculated using the luminous efficiency spectrum of insect rhodopsin. This has enabled the development <b>of</b> <b>lamps</b> that emit radiation with wavelengths that are less visible to insects (that is, yellow lamps). We tested the assumption that the degree <b>of</b> <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> a <b>lamp</b> to insects can predict its attractiveness by means of experimental collections. We found that the expected lamp's visibility is indeed related {{to the extent to which}} it attracts insects. However, the number of insects attracted to a lamp is disproportionally affected by the emission of ultraviolet radiation. UV triggers the behavior of approaching lights more or less independently of the amount of UV radiation emitted. Thus, even small amounts of UV should be controlled in order to develop bug-free lamps...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance of low-beam headlamps. The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, <b>lamp</b> voltage, number <b>of</b> functioning <b>lamps,</b> vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> pedestrians, <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> road delineation, <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> vehicle reflex reflectors, <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> rettoreflective traffic signs, <b>visibility</b> <b>of</b> targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, glare reflected from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance of low-beam headlamps. The second most important factor is the number <b>of</b> functioning <b>lamps.</b> The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use of longer-life headlamps...|$|R

Fluorescent lamps work {{in the same way as}} incandescent bulbs, back-lighting both sides of an exit fixture from within. LED signs combine a large number of bright light-emitting diodes to illuminate the sign from inside. An exit sign is constantly lit; fluorescent bulbs need to be changed more often than LEDs, although the absence of frequent on/off cycles extends the life <b>of</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> significantly. Generally, LEDs have a very long life, and may last for 10 years or more of continuous use, although their brightness may gradually diminish.|$|R

30|$|The third {{advantage}} is the higher specificity and sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>LAMP</b> over PCR. Unlike common PCR, performed using one pair <b>of</b> primer, <b>LAMP</b> requires {{at least two}} pairs of primer and, thus, increases the chance of specific recognition and amplification of target DNA compared to PCR. Higher sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>LAMP</b> originates from the unique mechanism of amplification, known as loop-mediated amplification, which produces huge amplicons consisting of repeated loop-shaped and dumbbell-like DNA structures. This type of amplicons allows easier detection of positive results and lowers the limit for detection. Therefore, it increases sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>LAMP</b> in comparison with PCR. The fourth advantage <b>of</b> <b>LAMP</b> is its speed over PCR. The overall time for carrying out LAMP is about 1  h compared with 2 to 4  h in PCR [21, 23 – 25] Moreover, the rate <b>of</b> <b>LAMP</b> reaction can be increased by using two additional primers, called loop primers [27]. Therefore, LAMP is considered a more rapid molecular technique compared with PCR.|$|R
