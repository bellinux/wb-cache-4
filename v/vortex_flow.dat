500|$|Aerodynamic {{studies in}} the 1960s {{demonstrated}} that the [...] "vortex lift" [...] phenomenon could be harnessed by highly swept wing configurations to reach higher angles of attack, using leading edge <b>vortex</b> <b>flow</b> off a slender lifting surface. As the F-16 was being optimized for high combat agility, GD's designers chose a slender cropped-delta wing with a leading edge sweep of 40° and a straight trailing edge. To improve maneuverability, a variable-camber wing with a NACA 64A-204 airfoil was selected; the camber is adjusted by leading-edge and trailing edge flaperons linked to a digital flight control system (FCS) regulating the flight envelope. The F-16 has a moderate wing loading, reduced by fuselage lift. The vortex lift effect is increased by leading edge extensions, known as strakes. Strakes act as additional short-span, triangular wings running from the wing root (the juncture with the fuselage) to a point further forward on the fuselage. Blended into the fuselage and along the wing root, the strake generates a high-speed vortex that remains attached {{to the top of}} the wing as the angle of attack increases, generating additional lift and allowing greater angles of attack without stalling. Strakes allow a smaller, lower-aspect-ratio wing, which increases roll rates and directional stability while decreasing weight. Deeper wingroots also increase structural strength and internal fuel volume.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>vortex</b> <b>flows</b> around solid {{obstacles}} is of considerable interest from both a {{theoretical and practical}} perspective. One geometry that has attracted renewed attention recently is that of <b>vortex</b> <b>flows</b> past a circular cylinder placed above a plane wall, where a stationary recirculating eddy can form {{in front of the}} cylinder, in contradistinction to the usual case (without the plane boundary) for which a vortex pair appears behind the cylinder. Here we analyze the problem of <b>vortex</b> <b>flows</b> past a cylinder near a wall through the lenses of the point-vortex model. By conformally mapping the fluid domain onto an annular region in an auxiliary complex plane, we compute the vortex Hamiltonian analytically in terms of certain special functions related to elliptic theta functions. A detailed analysis of the equilibria of the model is then presented. The location of the equilibrium in front of the cylinder is shown to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the thrust-induced longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of three fighter-type configurations is presented. A brief discussion of the take-off and landing requirements {{for the next generation}} fighter aircraft leads to the conclusion that advances in lift coefficient and thrust reversing will be required to allow short-field operation. Typical power-on longitudinal aerodynamic data for the three fighter configurations, indicating different approaches to meeting the high-lift coefficient requirement, are discussed. Thrust reversing is not addressed in this paper. The power-on data are analyzed to determine what power effects are present, that is, direct thrust, boundary-layer control, <b>vortex</b> <b>flows,</b> or supercirculation. The results of the analysis indicate, for the configurations studied, that induced effects are small compared to direct thrust and that boundary-layer control, rather than leading-edge <b>vortex</b> <b>flows</b> or supercirculation, is the only significant thrust-induced effect...|$|R
50|$|Tornadoes {{and dust}} devils display {{localised}} <b>vortex</b> <b>flow.</b> Their fluid motion {{is similar to}} tropical cyclones but on a much smaller scale so that the Coriolis effect is not significant. The primary flow is circular around the vertical axis of the tornado or dust devil. As with all <b>vortex</b> <b>flow,</b> {{the speed of the}} flow is fastest {{at the core of the}} vortex. In accordance with Bernoulli's principle where the wind speed is fastest the air pressure is lowest; and where the wind speed is slowest the air pressure is highest. Consequently, near the center of the tornado or dust devil the air pressure is low. There is a pressure gradient toward the center of the vortex. This gradient, coupled with the slower speed of the air near the earth’s surface, causes a secondary flow toward the center of the tornado or dust devil, rather than in a purely circular pattern.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to examine the periodic laminar flow and heat transfer characteristics in a three-dimensional isothermal wall square duct with 20 ° inline V-ribs. The computations are based on the finite volume method, and the SIMPLE algorithm has been implemented. The fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are presented for Reynolds numbers based on the hydraulic diameter of the square duct ranging from 100 to 2000. To generate main streamwise <b>vortex</b> <b>flows</b> through the tested section, V-ribs with an attack angle of 20 ° are mounted in tandem with inline arrangement, pointing downstream (V-Downstream) and pointing upstream (V-Upstream) placed on both the upper and lower walls. Effects of different blockage ratio (b/H, BR) with a single pitch ratio (P/H, PR) of 1 on heat transfer, pressure loss, and performance in the ribbed tube are studied. Apparently in each of the main <b>vortex</b> <b>flows,</b> streamwise twisted <b>vortex</b> <b>flows</b> can induce impinging flows {{on the walls of the}} interbaffle cavity leading to drastic increase in heat transfer rate over the square duct. In addition, the rise in the V-baffle height results in the increase in the Nusselt number and friction factor values.
