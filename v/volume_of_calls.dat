500|$|In December 2006, Mills {{told the}} BBC {{that she had}} {{received}} death threats, and on 17 December 2006, police stated that a [...] "non-specific threat" [...] {{had been made to}} her safety. This led to more criticism that she was calling out the emergency services too often. In March 2007, Kevin Moore, Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police, said that Mills was running [...] "the risk of being treated as the little boy who cried wolf", and added, [...] "We do have to respond to a disproportionate high <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from Heather Mills McCartney because of the situations she finds herself in, and this is regrettable as it takes officers away from other policing matters". Mills responded that the police had told her to contact them whenever she was being harassed.|$|E
500|$|Joss was {{concerned}} about supporting his family after his baseball career ended; many players of the day had little education and few marketable job skills beyond their abilities on the diamond. As sportswriter Franklin Lewis wrote, [...] "Only a handful of players in the rough, stirring, {{early days of the}} major leagues arrived from campuses. And when they did, sometimes the shock was too great for them. Some grizzled holdovers from the 1890s were around and they bore down heavily on the eardrums of the so-called college-boy set." [...] Joss was hired as a sports columnist after the 1906 season for the Toledo News-Bee. He also served as their Sunday sports editor. His writings proved so popular that sales of the paper increased and a special phone line was installed in his office to field the large <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> he received from fans. The increased popularity gave him an advantage when negotiating with the Naps before the 1907 season, and the club agreed to pay him $4,000 ($). (By 1910, player salaries averaged only $2,500.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{rapid growth}} in sales of this product was unexpected, with Bennie quoted in an {{interview}} from late 1993 as saying [...] "the success of WinFax really caught us by surprise". With {{the success of the}} WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, {{and by the end of}} the year to 350. The increasing success of the WinFax product consequently led to significant strains on the firm to handle the increasing <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> to its Technical Support department, as each of the over 300 modems on the market at the time had their own nuances in how they implemented the fax data standard. Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing number of calls to the firm for technical support. By the end of 1994 the situation had improved to the point where noted industry commentator Robert X. Cringely put Delrina in his shortlist of firms providing [...] "exceptional" [...] product support.|$|E

50|$|CT Connect is {{used most}} {{frequently}} in call center applications. Large call centers must handle huge <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> and the coordination <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> with business applications is essential.|$|R
5000|$|In Ireland, 1800-xxxxxx {{numbers are}} freephone, with the 1800 71xxxx {{reserved}} for services that expect unusually high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> e.g. radio station phone-in lines.|$|R
2500|$|Foote professed to be a {{reluctant}} celebrity. When The Civil War was first broadcast, his telephone number was publicly listed and he received many {{phone calls from}} people who had seen him on television. Foote never unlisted his number, and the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> increased each time the series re-aired. [...] Many Memphis natives were known to pay Foote a visit at his East Parkway residence in Midtown Memphis.|$|E
2500|$|Early on Sunday {{morning at}} the Vidyaevo Naval Base, rumours began to {{circulate}} among family members of Kursks crew that something was wrong. A telephone operator handled an unusual <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> and she overheard that a submarine was in trouble and then the submarine's name. The base was very small and news spread quickly. The wives and family members exchanged information, but nobody had more information. Kursk had previously been regarded as unsinkable and so family members could not believe {{the worst of the}} rumours. They hoped that the submarine was just temporarily unable to communicate. The deputy base commander reassured the women that the headquarters office was half empty and that the officers present were just [...] "passing the time." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> {{grew and}} a System X digital {{exchange}} was installed {{and was taken}} over by a privatised telephone operator, Gibtelecom, who also operate a GSM network.|$|E
50|$|Cope is also {{an author}} on Neolithic culture, {{publishing}} The Modern Antiquarian in 1998, and an outspoken political and cultural activist with a noted and public interest in occultism and paganism. As an author and commentator, he has written two <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> autobiography <b>called</b> Head-On (1994) and Repossessed (1999); two <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> archaeology <b>called</b> The Modern Antiquarian (1998) and The Megalithic European (2004); and three <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> musicology <b>called</b> Krautrocksampler (1995), Japrocksampler (2007); and Copendium: A Guide to the Musical Underground (2012).|$|R

50|$|After the {{disruption}} in transatlantic flight, the Cunard Line said its <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> inquiring about booking passage on its ocean liner RMS Queen Mary 2 by stranded air passengers wishing to cross by ship had tripled since {{the weekend of}} 16 April.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{approval}} of the 1969 Constitution and the dissolution of the City Council, the telephone service was transferred to the newly formed Government of Gibraltar. In the 1970s there were three generations of automatic telephone exchange equipment in use with four and five digit numbers. The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> grew and a System X digital exchange was installed.|$|E
50|$|While {{working for}} the CTC, Erlang was {{presented}} with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service. His thinking went further by finding how many telephone operators were needed to handle a given <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> Most telephone exchanges then used human operators and cord boards to switch telephone calls by means of jack plugs.|$|E
50|$|However, {{with single}} systems that {{initiate}} large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> simultaneously, telephony cards offload the PC by performing {{most of the}} telephony functions (call status determination, playing music on hold, answer machine detection, etc.). Calls can likewise be cross transferred at the telephony board level.|$|R
5000|$|Watts {{was also}} a poet, {{publishing}} a <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> verse <b>called</b> 'Aurora'.|$|R
50|$|While {{a cost of}} {{hundreds}} of dollars monthly for the leased line was not uncommon, to a business handling large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from the larger city the cost may have been justified by long-distance toll savings {{at a time when}} long-distance was pricey and alternatives were limited.|$|R

50|$|The court further {{held that}} Pulte met its burden in showing that LIUNA acted {{with the intent}} to cause damage, holding that the {{district}} court had set too high of a standard as to this element. LIUNA did not need to know the actual consequences of its actions, the court reasoned; the sheer <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> and LIUNA’s call to “fight back” indicated that the union intended to cause some harm to Pulte.|$|E
50|$|The Office was {{established}} on 1 June 1978 and was originally known as The Public Information Office. It quickly {{evolved into a}} bigger section in order {{to cope with the}} <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> it received. By 1982 the Office was responding to more than 50,000 enquiries annually and this figure rose to 69,000 in 1985 and was up to 95,000 in 1990. It {{was also one of the}} first sections to pioneer the use of computers and electronic publication in the House of Commons with the use of Viewdata.|$|E

50|$|In {{just a few}} years, Fernic wrote over 400 sentimental {{and other}} kinds of songs. Many of his songs were hits. Starting in 1927, Fernic {{published}} a <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> sketch stories <b>called</b> Misterele din Mizil (written as a feuilleton). In 1928, he published a <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> poems <b>called</b> Prăştii and several children's books. He founded the satirical magazine Să nu te superi că te-njur, and moved to Bucharest in the early 1930s.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Spencer Potter {{picked up}} the number for free after discovering to his surprise that it was available in the 201 area code, hoping it would improve his DJ business. Unable to handle the overwhelming <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> he sought to sell the number on eBay in February 2009. Although bids reached $1 million, his inability to confirm {{the identity of the}} bidders led him to sell it privately to Retro Fitness, a gym franchise with a location in Secaucus, New Jersey that felt the 1980s origin of the number tied in perfectly with their business' retro theme.|$|E
5000|$|... "Non ho l'età" [...] went on {{to become}} a major hit across Europe. The BBC had taken the unusual step of re-broadcasting Cinquetti's winning reprise on the day after the contest in {{response}} to the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> from viewers asking for another chance to see the performance, and the song became a top 20 hit at a time when almost all non-British music had been pushed off the UK Singles Chart by the explosion of home-grown talent. The song has retained its reputation and is generally considered one of the best Eurovision winners of all.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Wichita, Kansas {{television}} KAKE-TV received special {{permission from}} the police to place a subliminal message in {{a report on the}} BTK Killer (Bind, Torture, Kill) {{in an effort to get}} him to turn himself in. The subliminal message included the text [...] "Now call the chief", as well as a pair of glasses. The glasses were included because when BTK murdered Nancy Fox, there was a pair of glasses lying upside down on her dresser; police felt that seeing the glasses might stir up remorse in the killer. The attempt was unsuccessful, and police reported no increased <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> afterward.|$|E
25|$|Around 1990, Sergey Aleynikov {{emigrated from}} the Soviet Union to the United States. From 1998 to 2007, {{he worked at}} IDT Corporation, writing {{software}} to better handle high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> phone <b>calls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Audio {{marketing}}, {{also known}} as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging, is increasingly being seen as {{an important element of}} audio branding. It involves the creation of brand-congruent voice and music tracks, which are used by companies to communicate marketing messages to customers over the telephone. Typically, these messages are played while a customer is waiting on hold or while they are being transferred. They are also frequently used as part of interactive voice response systems designed to handle large <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first release {{under the}} label was Comedy Central's [...] "Crank Yankers," [...] an uncensored album {{featuring}} human-like puppets voiced by comedic talent such as Adam Carolla, Jimmy Kimmel, Sarah Silverman and Fred Armisen, making off-color crank calls to one another. Upon its release, the album {{sold more than}} 80,000 copies, prompting network executives to release three more <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> including [...] "The Best Uncensored Crank Calls, Vol. 2" [...] and the two part [...] "The Best Crank Calls." ...|$|R
50|$|Essential {{services}} {{remained in}} operation {{in some of}} these areas. In others, backup generation systems failed. Telephone networks generally remained operational, but the increased demand triggered by the blackout left many circuits overloaded. Water systems in several cities lost pressure, forcing boil-water advisories to be put into effect. Cellular service was interrupted as mobile networks were overloaded with the increase in <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> Major cellular providers continued to operate on standby generator power. Television and radio stations remained on the air, with the help of backup generators, although some stations were knocked off the air for periods ranging from several hours to the length of the entire blackout.|$|E
50|$|There was {{considerable}} damage to communications infrastructure. The public telephone system was not available, and Haiti's largest cellular telephone provider, Digicel, suffered damage to its network. It was operational by 14 January, but the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> overwhelmed its capacity and most calls {{could not be}} connected. Comcel Haiti's facilities were not severely damaged, but its mobile phone service was temporarily shut down on 12 January. By 14 January the company had re-established 70% of its services. Service on the spur connection to the BDSNi cable system which provided Haiti with its only direct fibre-optic connectivity to the outside world, was disrupted, with the terminal in Port-au-Prince being completely destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2009, Pulte, a home {{building}} company, fired {{a construction}} crew member {{for what they}} claimed was misconduct and poor performance. [...] Soon afterward, the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LIUNA) initiated a national campaign against Pulte in order to damage its reputation because they thought union membership was the company's real reason. The union’s tactics included bombarding Pulte’s sales offices and three of its executives with thousands of phone calls and emails. Most of the communications concerned the company’s purported unfair labor practices, though some included threats and obscene language. The <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> overloaded Pulte’s system, interfering with employees’ normal communications with customers and vendors and generally stalling normal business operations.|$|E
