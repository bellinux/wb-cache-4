In this work we have deposited 60 nm, negatively charged, citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles onto microstructures consisting of six different materials, (<b>vanadium</b> (V), silicon <b>dioxide</b> (SiO 2), gold (Au), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni)). The samples have then been investigated by scanning electron microscopy to extract the particle density. The surface potential was calculated from the measured surface charge density maps measured by atomic force microscopy while the samples were submerged in a KCl water solution. These values were compared with literature values of the isoelectric points (IEP) of different oxides formed on the metals in an ambient environment. According to measurements, Al had the highest surface potential followed by Ni and Cu. The same trend was observed for the nanoparticle densities. No particles were found on V, SiO 2 and Au. The literature values of the IEP showed a different trend compared to the surface potential measurements concluding that IEP is not a reliable parameter for the prediction of NP deposition. focus article Copyright (C) EPLA, 201...|$|R
40|$|Spintronics is an {{emerging}} field of electronics, in which information is {{carried by the}} spin of an electron {{in addition to its}} charge. Advantages of spintronics devices include enhanced properties such as fast switching times and low power consumption, and new functionality such as sensing of magnetic fields. Half-metallic ferromagnets, or half-metals, are promising materials for spintronics applications. These exotic materials behave as metallic for electrons of one spin, and as insula- tors for the other. Chromium diodixe is the simplest half-metal. It is a metastable oxide of Cr(IV), which adopts the rutile structure common in transition metal dioxides. Electronic structure calculations first pre- dicted CrO 2 to be half-metallic. Half-metallicity has been confirmed with spectroscopic and point contact measurements. CrO 2 is the half-metal with the highest known spin polarization of over 90 % at 1. 6 K. Magnetic properties and half-metallicity of CrO 2 can be manipulated by substitution of chromium with other transition metals. Recently, <b>vanadium</b> doped chromium <b>dioxide</b> Cr 1 -xVxO 2 has been predicted to be half-metallic. In this work, properties of the Cr 1 -xVxO 2 system in the composition range 0 ≤ x ≤ 0. 5 are investigated with an emphasis on magnetic properties and half-metallicity. The materials are synthesized via high-pressure synthesis. Phase purity and crystal structure is investigated by x-ray powder diffraction. Oxidation state of Cr, V and O is probed with x-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES). The magnetic properties are measured with a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Furthermore, the electronic structure of Cr 1 -xVxO 2 is investigated by first principles electronic structure calculations. The Cr 1 -xVxO 2 solid solutions are confirmed to be single-phase with XRD. The lattice parameter a increases linearly with increasing vanadium content in agreement with Vegard's law. XANES measurements reveal that the oxidation state of chromium decreases from Cr(IV) towards Cr(III) with increasing vanadium content. Magnetic ordering is found to dramatically change from ferro- magnetic (CrO 2, Cr 0. 9 V 0. 1 O 2) to ferrimagnetic (Cr 0. 8 V 0. 2 O 2) to antiferromagnetic (Cr 0. 7 V 0. 3 O 2, Cr 0. 6 V 0. 4 O 2, Cr 0. 5 V 0. 5 O 2) resulting in the elimination of half-metallicity in the system. Electronic structure calculations predict Cr 0. 875 V 0. 125 O 2 to be half-metallic with reduced spin polarization compared to CrO 2, and Cr 0. 5 V 0. 5 O 2 to be an antiferromagnetic metal.
