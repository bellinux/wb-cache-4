50|$|Hainantoxins {{selectively}} inhibit tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) voltage-gated sodium channels (<b>VGSCs).</b> Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) <b>VGSCs</b> and rectifier-delayed potassium {{channels are}} not affected. HNTX-III and HNTX-IV {{are part of}} the Huwentoxin-I family. Toxins from the Huwentoxin-I family are thought to bind to site 1 on the sodium channels. Other hainantoxins bind at site 3 of the sodium channels. HNTX-I specifically blocks mammalian Nav1.2 and insect para/tipE channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. HNTX-I is a weak antagonist of the vertebrate TTX-S <b>VGSCs,</b> but is more potent on insect <b>VGSCs.</b>|$|E
50|$|In general, pumiliotoxins {{are known}} as {{positive}} modulators of voltage-gated sodium channels (<b>VGSCs,</b> membrane proteins). Pumiliotoxin 251D {{is not such a}} poison. However, it does block the influx of Na+ ions in mammalian <b>VGSCs.</b>|$|E
50|$|PTX 251D {{shifts the}} V1/2 of insect <b>VGSCs</b> even {{further than the}} {{mammalian}} VSGCs. This explains why it is especially toxic to insects, like mosquitoes. Furthermore, the presence of PTX 251D results in a six time higher permeability of the <b>VGSCs</b> for K+ ions. This severely disturbs the delicate sodium-potassium equilibrium in the nerve system.|$|E
40|$|The highly dynamic {{nature of}} {{voltage-gated}} Na+ channel (<b>VGSC)</b> expression and its controlling mechanism(s) {{are not well}} understood. In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of nerve growth factor (NGF) in regulating <b>VGSC</b> activity in the strongly metastatic Mat-LyLu cell model of rat prostate cancer (PCa). NGF increased peak <b>VGSC</b> current density in a time- and dose-dependent manner. NGF also shifted voltage to peak and the half-activation voltage to more positive potentials, and produced currents with faster kinetics of activation; sensitivity to the <b>VGSC</b> blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) was not affected. The NGF-induced increase in peak <b>VGSC</b> current density was suppressed by both the pan-trk antagonist K 252 a, and the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT 5720. NGF {{did not affect the}} Nav 1. 7 mRNA level, but the total <b>VGSC</b> alpha-subunit protein level was upregulated. NGF potentiated the cells' migration in Transwell assays, and this was not affected by TTX. We concluded that NGF upregulated functional <b>VGSC</b> expression in Mat-LyLu cells, with PKA as a signaling intermediate, but enhancement of migration by NGF was independent of <b>VGSC</b> activity...|$|R

Since <b>VGSC</b> ß-subunits are of relevance for the functional properties of <b>VGSC,</b> it will be of interest to study potential expression changes of these regulating ß-subunits in futures studies. Furthermore, not only <b>VGSC</b> but also other ion channels may be expressed differentially throughout development. The ontogenic expression profiles of other cardiac ion channels like potassium and calcium channels need to be studied in the future.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTypical {{antipsychotics}} {{are characterized}} by extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS). Previous studies demonstrated that typical antipsychotics could inhibit neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel (<b>VGSC).</b> However, EPS typically emerge only upon prolonged exposure. As a result, we examined effects of haloperidol, a prototype typical antipsychotic, on neuronal <b>VGSC</b> upon incubation for varying duration. Briefly, <b>VGSC</b> currents were activated and recorded using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique in primary culture of mouse cortical neurons. <b>VGSC</b> activity was inhibited by acute haloperidol exposure (for minutes), but enhanced in a time- and concentration-dependent manner by chronic haloperidol exposure (for hours). The effects of chronic haloperidol were associated with increased expression of <b>VGSC</b> subunits as well as corresponding electrophysiological channel properties. In summary, we found enhanced <b>VGSC</b> currents upon chronic haloperidol exposure in cortical neurons in contrast to inhibition by acute haloperidol exposure. Such a results may contribute to EPS of typical antipsychotics...|$|R

50|$|In myelinated fibres, <b>VGSCs</b> {{are located}} at the nodes of Ranvier; however, in unmyelinated fibres, the exact {{location}} of <b>VGSCs</b> has not been determined. Nav1.8 in unmyelinated fibres has been found in clusters associated with lipid rafts along DRG fibers both in vitro and in vivo. Lipid rafts organise the cell membrane, which includes trafficking and localising ion channels. Removal of lipid rafts in the membrane using MβCD, which depletes cholesterol from the plasma membrane, leads to a shift of Nav1.8 to a non-raft portion of the membrane, causing reduced action potential firing and propagation.|$|E
50|$|Nociceptors are {{different}} from other sensory neurons in {{that they have a}} low activating threshold and consequently increase their response to constant stimuli. Therefore, nociceptors are easily sensitised by agents such as bradykinin and nerve growth factor, which are released at the site of tissue injury, ultimately causing changes to ion channel conductance. <b>VGSCs</b> have been shown to increase in density after nerve injury. Therefore, <b>VGSCs</b> can be modulated by many different hyperalgesic agents that are released after nerve injury. Further examples include prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), serotonin and adenosine, which all act to increase the current through Nav1.8.|$|E
30|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{presence of}} other than the “cardiac-specific” <b>VGSC</b> had been suspected {{by the fact that}} tetrodotoxin (TTX) had been shown to impair left ventricular function. <b>VGSC</b> isoforms preferentially expressed in central nervous tissue are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of TTX, whereas the cardiac isoform SCN 5 A is inhibited only by micromolar concentrations of TTX and is therefore considered to be TTX-resistant [4]. In the present study, we were able to prove the expression of brain-type <b>VGSC</b> in the developing rat myocardium. The expression of the cardiac <b>VGSC</b> SCN 5 A and brain-type <b>VGSC</b> SCN 1 A and SCN 8 A was regulated differentially in the developing rat myocardium. Differential expression was demonstrated on RNA level as well as on protein level.|$|R

40|$|Metastasis is {{the major}} problem in {{clinical}} management of cancer, including prostate cancer (PCa). Biochemical conditions in tumour microenvironment (especially O 2 and Ca 2 + levels) are important for modulating metastatic cell behaviours (MCBs). Ionic mechanisms, in particular voltage-gated sodium channel (<b>VGSC)</b> and intracellular Ca 2 + activities, were shown previously {{to be involved in}} MCBs in PCa. This PhD tested the hypotheses (1) that MCBs would be sensitive to hypoxia and be inhibited by <b>VGSC</b> blockers including those selective for the persistent current and (2) that <b>VGSC</b> activity would control intracellular Ca 2 + signalling. Experiments were carried on a variety of model cell lines in a comparative approach: strongly metastatic Mat-LyLu and weakly metastatic AT- 2 rat PCa cells, and analogous human PCa cell lines (PC- 3 M and LnCaP, respectively). Experiments on Mat-LyLu cells showed that hypoxia (2 % O 2, 24 h) increased mRNA expression of Nav 1. 7, the predominant <b>VGSC</b> α-subunit expressed in PCa; however, both plasma membrane and intracellular <b>VGSC</b> protein levels were reduced. There was no change in cellular proliferation, Matrigel invasion or lateral motility, whilst transverse migration increased significantly. Treatment (24 h) with the <b>VGSC</b> blockers ranolazine, riluzole, lidocaine and procaine (micromolar concentrations) decreased Nav 1. 7 mRNA and total <b>VGSC</b> protein levels, and suppressed Matrigel invasion in both normoxia (~ 21 % O 2) and hypoxia. PC- 3 M (but not LNCaP or Mat-LyLu) cells showed spontaneous, transient elevations of intracellular Ca 2 + (“Ca 2 + oscillations”). Ionic substitution and pharmacological experiments suggested that Ca 2 + influx and release from intracellular stores both contributed to the oscillations. Importantly, acute treatment with tetrodotoxin and ranolazine decreased the oscillation amplitude and frequency. Thus, both hypotheses were confirmed, i. e. (1) that hypoxia increases PCa (Mat-LyLu) cell migration and <b>VGSC</b> expression and (2) that intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations are downstream to <b>VGSC</b> activity. Overall, the thesis concludes that <b>VGSC</b> blockers could serve clinically as anti-metastatic agents.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine whether a functional relationship existed between epidermal growth factor (EGF) and voltage-gated sodium channel (<b>VGSC)</b> upregulation, both associated with strongly metastatic prostate cancer cells. Incubation with EGF for 24 h more than doubled <b>VGSC</b> current density. Similar treatment with EGF significantly and dose-dependently enhanced the cells' migration through Transwell filters. Both the patch clamp recordings and the migration assay suggested that endogenous EGF played a similar role. Importantly, co-application of EGF and tetrodotoxin, a highly selective <b>VGSC</b> blocker, abolished 65 % of the potentiating effect of EGF.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{study revealed that}} cordycepin features important neuroprotective effects against hypoxic insult by improvement of neuronal electrophysiological function. Modulation on voltage-gated sodium channel (<b>VGSC)</b> in CA 1 neurons is the initial event during hypoxia/ischemia. However, no study comprehensively investigated cordycepin on <b>VGSC.</b> Hence, this study investigated modulation effects of cordycepin on <b>VGSC</b> not only in oxygen physiological conditions but also in acute oxygen deprivation injury conditions. Results revealed that cordycepin (80 [*]μM) reduced the amplitude of <b>VGSC</b> currents (INa) (77. 6 % of control, p< 0. 01) within 1 [*]min of drug exposure coupled with a negative shift in steady-state inactivation and prolonged recovery time course from inactivation. Additionally, this mild reduction on the peak of INa induced by the pretreatment with cordycepin can attenuate and delay the following hypoxia causing rapid dramatic decrease in INa with no additive change in the voltage dependence of inactivation. As modulation on <b>VGSC</b> in CA 1 neurons represents the initial event during ischemia, we propose that suppression effect of cordycepin on <b>VGSC</b> is an important neuronal protective mechanism that may enhance neuronal tolerance to acute oxygen deprivation and delay hypoxia-induced neuronal injuries...|$|R
50|$|PTX 251D {{has several}} effects. It rapidly induces convulsions and death to mice and insects (LD50 being, respectively, 10 mg/kg and 150 ng/larvae).

50|$|For the {{blockage}} {{of sodium}} channels, electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds are needed. Important for the electrostatic interaction {{is the presence}} of a positively charged region in the toxin, because the receptor site of the sodium channel contains a lot of negatively charged residues. In HNTX-I, the positively charged residues and a vicinal hydrophobic patch have most influence on the binding to the sodium channels. HNTX-IV has a positively charged patch containing the amino acids Arg26, Lys27, His28, Arg29 and Lys32, of which Lys27, Arg29 and Lys32 are the most important for interaction with the TTX-S <b>VGSCs.</b> HNTX-V also shows an interface of positively charged amino acids that are responsible for the binding with the TTX-S <b>VGSCs,</b> where also Lys27 and Arg29 are the most important. Subtle differences in the positively charged patch can result in altered electrostatic properties, causing altered pharmacological effects.|$|E
50|$|HNTX-I, HNTX-III, HNTX-IV, and HNTX-V {{are thought}} to bind to site 1 of voltage-dependent sodium channels, similar to TTX, and thereby block the channel pore.

40|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} (<b>VGSC)</b> {{are responsible}} for the selective influx of sodium ions in excitable cells. A number of physiological phenomena such as muscle contraction, pain sensation, processing of neuronal information in the brain as well as neuronal regulation of peripheral tissues rely on the activity of these channels.

40|$|Insecticide {{resistance}} is {{typically associated with}} alterations to the insecticidal target-site or with gene expression variation at loci involved in insecticide detoxification. In some species copy number variation (CNV) of target site loci (e. g. the Ace- 1 target site of carbamate insecticides) or detoxification genes has been implicated in the resistance phenotype. We show that field-collected Ugandan Culex quinquefasciatus display CNV for the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (<b>Vgsc),</b> target-site of pyrethroid and organochlorine insecticides. In order to develop field-applicable diagnostics for <b>Vgsc</b> CN, and {{as a prelude to}} investigating the possible association of CN with insecticide resistance, three assays were compared for their accuracy in CN estimation in this species. The gold standard method is droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), however, the hardware is prohibitively expensive for widespread utility. Here, ddPCR was compared to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and pyrosequencing. Across all platforms, CNV was detected in ≈ 10 % of mosquitoes, corresponding to three or four copies (per diploid genome). ddPCR and qPCR-Std-curve yielded similar predictions for <b>Vgsc</b> CN, indicating that the qPCR protocol developed here can be applied as a diagnostic assay, facilitating monitoring of <b>Vgsc</b> CN in wild populations and the elucidation of association between the <b>Vgsc</b> CN and insecticide resistance...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated sodium {{channels}} (<b>VGSC)</b> are multi-molecular protein complexes {{expressed in}} both excitable and non-excitable cells. They are primarily formed by a pore-forming multi-spanning integral membrane glycoprotein (α-subunit) {{that can be}} associated with one or more regulatory β-subunits. The latter are single-span integral membrane proteins that modulate the sodium current (INa) and can also function as cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs). In-vitro some of the cell-adhesive functions of the β-subunits may play important physiological roles independently of the α-subunits. Other endogenous regulatory proteins named channel partners or channel interacting proteins (ChiPs) like caveolin- 3 and calmodulin/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) can also interact and modulate the expression and/or function of <b>VGSC.</b> In addition to their physiological roles in cell excitability and cell adhesion, <b>VGSC</b> are the site of action of toxins (like tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin), and pharmacologic agents (like antiarrhythmic drugs, local anesthetics, antiepileptic drugs, and newly developed analgesics). Mutations in genes that encode α- and/or β-subunits as well as the ChiPs can affect the structure and biophysical properties of <b>VGSC,</b> leading to the development of diseases termed sodium channelopathies.
