5|$|Due {{to their}} {{location}} near the beachfront, the station roof's solar panels {{needed to meet}} stringent hurricane standards, and as such, the panels for the station were rigorously tested in a laboratory in York, Pennsylvania. It is the New York City Subway's first solar-powered subway station. The solar panels are expected to last for at least 35 years, and a catwalk is located below the roof if any solar panel replacements were ever needed. As a bonus feature, a low <b>voltage</b> <b>current,</b> which is emitted from the panels, serves as a deterrent against pigeons.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolysis}} {{of water}} is a simple method of producing hydrogen. A low <b>voltage</b> <b>current</b> is run through the water, and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode. Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage. If, however, the gas is to be burnt on site, oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion, and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals. (Iron, for instance, would oxidize, and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off.) The theoretical maximum efficiency (electricity used vs. energetic value of hydrogen produced) is in the range 80–94%.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the sign}} {{convention}} only {{deals with the}} directions of the variables and not with {{the direction of the}} actual current, it also applies to alternating current (AC) circuits, in which the direction of the <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> periodically reverses. In AC circuits, even though the <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> reverse direction, a [...] "formal" [...] direction of <b>current</b> flow and <b>voltage</b> polarity are defined by considering the <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> direction {{in the first half of}} the cycle [...] "positive". During the second half of the AC cycle, in a resistive AC circuit, both the <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> in the device reverse direction, so the sign of the <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> reverse. Since the power is the product of <b>voltage</b> and <b>current,</b> the two sign reversals cancel each other, and the sign of the power flow is unchanged.|$|R
50|$|A {{direct current}} circuit is an {{electrical}} circuit {{that consists of}} any combination of constant <b>voltage</b> sources, constant <b>current</b> sources, and resistors. In this case, the circuit <b>voltages</b> and <b>currents</b> are independent of time. A particular circuit <b>voltage</b> or <b>current</b> {{does not depend on}} the past value of any circuit <b>voltage</b> or <b>current.</b> This implies that the system of equations that represent a DC circuit do not involve integrals or derivatives with respect to time.|$|R
50|$|The {{bus voltage}} in {{frequency}} domain {{can be calculated}} by summing the voltages on C1 and C2. From the calculation result {{it can be seen}} that the bus voltage only relates to C2 <b>current,</b> <b>voltage</b> transformer <b>current</b> and their ratios.This result is helpful to reconstruct the bus voltage with the C2 <b>current,</b> <b>voltage</b> transformer <b>current.</b> For the ratio, it can be achieved by using a summing amplifier.|$|R

For other conditions of applied <b>voltage,</b> <b>current</b> load, temperature, capacitance value, circuit resistance (for tantalum capacitors), mechanical influences and humidity the FIT figure can recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial or military contexts. The higher the temperature and the applied voltage, the higher the failure rate.|$|E
25|$|Reliability for {{capacitors}} {{is usually}} specified in numbers of Failures In Time (FIT) {{during the period}} of constant random failures. FIT is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (109) component-hours of operation at fixed working conditions (e.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, at 40°C and 0.5 UR). For other conditions of applied <b>voltage,</b> <b>current</b> load, temperature, mechanical influences and humidity the FIT can recalculated with terms standardized for industrial or military contexts.|$|E

5000|$|The term DC is used {{to refer}} to power systems that use only one {{polarity}} of <b>voltage</b> or <b>current,</b> and to refer to the constant, zero-frequency, or slowly varying local mean value of a <b>voltage</b> or <b>current.</b> For example, the voltage across a DC voltage source is constant as is the current through a DC current source. The DC solution of an electric circuit is the solution where all <b>voltages</b> and <b>currents</b> are constant. It can be shown that any stationary <b>voltage</b> or <b>current</b> waveform can be decomposed into a sum of a DC component and a zero-mean time-varying component; the DC component is defined to be the expected value, or the average value of the <b>voltage</b> or <b>current</b> over all time.|$|R

25|$|A {{multimeter}} or a multitester, {{also known}} as a VOM (volt-ohm-milliammeter), is an electronic measuring instrument that combines several measurement functions in one unit. A typical multimeter can measure <b>voltage,</b> <b>current,</b> and resistance. Analog multimeters use a microammeter with a moving pointer to display readings. Digital multimeters (DMM, DVOM) have a numeric display, and may also show a graphical bar representing the measured value. Digital multimeters are now far more common due to their cost and precision, but analog multimeters are still preferable in some cases, for example when monitoring a rapidly varying value.|$|E
25|$|Since supercapacitors do {{not rely}} on {{chemical}} changes in the electrodes (except for those with polymer electrodes), lifetimes depend mostly on {{the rate of evaporation}} of the liquid electrolyte. This evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of current load, current cycle frequency and <b>voltage.</b> <b>Current</b> load and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat. This temperature is measurable as core temperature {{in the center of a}} capacitor body. The higher the core temperature the faster the evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Small {{capacitors}} {{are used}} in electronic devices to couple signals between stages of amplifiers, as components of electric filters and tuned circuits, or as parts of power supply systems to smooth rectified current. Larger capacitors are used for energy storage in such applications as strobe lights, as parts of some types of electric motors, or for power factor correction in AC power distribution systems. Standard capacitors have a fixed value of capacitance, but adjustable capacitors are frequently used in tuned circuits. Different types are used depending on required capacitance, working <b>voltage,</b> <b>current</b> handling capacity, and other properties.|$|E
50|$|Instrument {{transformers}} {{are high}} accuracy class electrical devices used to isolate or transform <b>voltage</b> or <b>current</b> levels. The most common usage of instrument transformers is to operate instruments or metering from high <b>voltage</b> or high <b>current</b> circuits, safely isolating secondary control circuitry {{from the high}} <b>voltages</b> or <b>currents.</b> The primary winding of the transformer {{is connected to the}} high <b>voltage</b> or high <b>current</b> circuit, and the meter or relay is connected to the secondary circuit.|$|R

25|$|MOSFET analog {{switches}} use the MOSFET to pass {{analog signals}} when on, {{and as a}} high impedance when off. Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch. In this application, the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source/drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate–source, gate–drain and source–drain voltages; exceeding the <b>voltage,</b> <b>current,</b> or power limits will potentially damage the switch.|$|E

Sensor signals were {{conditioned by}} amplifiers or converters located in measuring racks. There are four measuring racks in the IU at locations 1, 9, and 15 and twenty signal conditioning modules in each. Conditioned signals were routed to their assigned telemetry channel by the measuring distributor at location 10. There were two telemetry links. In {{order for the}} two IU telemetry links to handle approximately 200 separate measurements, these links must be shared. Both frequency sharing and time sharing multiplexing techniques were used to accomplish this. The two modulation techniques used were pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and frequency modulation/frequency modulation (FM/FM).|$|E

2500|$|A common {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{in using the}} decibel occurs when deciding {{about the use of}} 10×log or 20×log. [...] In the original definition, it was a power measurement, and as employed in that context, the formulation 10×log should be used, as deci means one tenth. The user must be clear whether the quantity expressed is power or amplitude. It is useful to consider how power or energy is expressed, e.g., current×current×resistance, ×velocity×velocity×mass. [...] Where the power is a square function of a field variable (such as <b>voltage,</b> <b>current,</b> or pressure), then 10×log is the correct expression for the square, or 20×log for the field variable itself.|$|E

2500|$|Appropriately {{applied with}} electro {{surgical}} forceps, desiccation and coagulation {{result in the}} occlusion of blood vessels and halting of bleeding. While the process is technically a process of electrocoagulation, the term [...] "electrocautery" [...] is sometimes loosely, nontechnically and incorrectly used to describe it. The process of vaporization {{can be used to}} ablate tissue targets, or, by linear extension, used to transect or cut tissue. While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high <b>voltage</b> <b>current</b> to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated. The continued application of current to this highly impedant tissue results in resistive heating and the achievement of very high temperatures - enough to cause breakdown of the organic molecules to sugars and even carbon, thus the dark textures from carbonization of tissue.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{utilization}} of extra-high-voltage underground power cables over distances greater than 100 miles presents serious problems {{relative to the}} <b>voltage</b> and <b>current</b> limits of such cables. These problems are directly associated with the fixed amount of capacitance inherent in long cable lines.
