5|$|The system {{produces}} sound using a Yamaha YM2612 FM synthesizer and a Texas Instruments SN76489 PSG; {{the latter}} is integrated with the <b>Video</b> <b>Display</b> Processor (VDP). The Z80 processor is primarily used to control both sound chips to produce stereo music and sound effects. Most revisions of the original system contain a discrete YM2612 and a separate YM7101 VDP; the functionality of these two chips was later integrated into a single custom ASIC (FC1004) for the model 2 and later revisions.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes have}} been made to the basic set since the {{syndicated}} version's premiere in 1983. In 1996, a large <b>video</b> <b>display</b> was added center stage, which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high-definition broadcasting. In the mid-1990s, the show began a long-standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme. As a result, in addition to its generic design, the set also uses many alternate designs, which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs. The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss-Johnson, with later modifications by Jody Vaclav. Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick Stiles.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Saturn {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another <b>video</b> <b>display</b> processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E
50|$|In early 2016, {{the stadium}} {{was given an}} {{extensive}} facelift. The most notable improvement was {{the replacement of the}} 2200 sq ft <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> with state of the art, high visibility 9600 sq ft <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> in both the north and south end zones along {{with the addition of a}} new 2300 sq ft video tower in each corner. All together, the <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> cover more than 28,000 sq ft, making Raymond James Stadium the third-largest <b>video</b> <b>displays</b> in the NFL. The original sound system and the stadium's luxury boxes were also upgraded. A second round of improvements are planned for after the 2016 season is complete.|$|R

5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary <b>video</b> <b>display</b> currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk on a <b>video</b> <b>display</b> screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E
