He did not try to steal <b>very</b> <b>often</b> but used his speed to take extra bases. Between 1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30inside-the-park home runs, and he led the league with 17triples in 1917 and 18triples in 1921; he had 20triples in 1920.|$|E

5|$|L.gigas is <b>very</b> <b>often</b> parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, {{which are}} common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially establish themselves in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may proceed to the secretory cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E

Montgomery's name was used <b>very</b> <b>often</b> in literature; among the authors who used his name was Thomas Paine.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are <b>very</b> <b>often</b> clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E

5|$|Zero {{was created}} by Taro Yoko, the game's {{director}} and co-writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist {{that had not been}} featured <b>very</b> <b>often</b> in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series, although he also added features to create a feminine vibe, such as the flower in her eye. Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and for standing out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Parliament in 1857 {{provided}} {{for the establishment of}} a number of art schools throughout the United Kingdom and the Cardiff School of Art opened in 1865. Graduates still <b>very</b> <b>often</b> had to leave Wales to work, but Betws-y-Coed became a popular centre for artists and its artists' colony helped form the Royal Cambrian Academy of Art in 1881. The sculptor Sir William Goscombe John made many works for Welsh commissions, although he had settled in London. Christopher Williams, whose subjects were mostly resolutely Welsh, was also based in London. Thomas E. Stephens and Andrew Vicari had very successful careers as portraitists based respectively in the United States and France. Sir Frank Brangwyn was Welsh by origin but spent little time in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting <b>very</b> <b>often,</b> and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the trackway. Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, {{but the fact that the}} trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 the Railway Executive {{decided on}} {{standard}} types of signs {{to be used}} at all stations. Lettering was to use the Gill Sans typeface on a background of the regional colour. Gill Sans was also used in much of its printed output, <b>very</b> <b>often</b> in capitals-only settings for signage. Specially drawn variations were developed by the Railway Executive (part of the British Transport Commission) for signs in its manual {{for the use of}} signpainters painting large signs by hand. Other users included Penguin Books' iconic paperback jacket designs from 1935 and British official mapping agency Ordnance Survey. It was also used by London Transport for documents which could not be practically set in Johnston. Paul Shaw, a historian of printing, has described it as a key element of the 'Modernist classical' style from the 1930s to the 1950s, that promoted clean, spare design, often with all-capitals and centred setting of headings.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Kud Wafter ranked {{first in}} {{national}} PC game pre-orders in Japan. The limited edition version of Kud Wafter ranked first {{in terms of}} national sales of PC games in Japan in June 2010.

At some stores in Akihabara, Kud Wafter was sold at midnight the day of its release, which is cited as not happening <b>very</b> <b>often</b> for games sold in Akihabara. Kud Wafter premiered as the No. 2 game sold on Getchu.com, a major redistributor of visual novel and domestic anime products, during the month of its release, and at No. 26 in July. The game would go on to be the No. 9 game sold {{for the first half of}} 2010, and at No. 15 for the whole year. The PSP port sold 5,733 units in its first week of sales. Both the PSP and PS Vita ports were reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu, which gave them an overall score of 27/40.|$|E
