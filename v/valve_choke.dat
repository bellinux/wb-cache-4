50|$|<b>Choke</b> <b>valves</b> are {{important}} for naturally-aspirated gasoline engines because small droplets of gasoline do not evaporate well within a cold engine. By restricting the flow of air into the throat of the carburetor, the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> reduces the pressure inside the throat, which causes a proportionally-greater amount of fuel to be pushed from the main jet into the combustion chamber during cold-running operation. Once the engine is warm (from combustion), opening the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> restores the carburetor to normal operation, supplying fuel and air in the correct stoichiometric ratio for clean, efficient combustion.|$|R

Laboratory hydraulic experiments have validated the capability of a back pressure control model for the parallel choke assembly to accurately control pressure. This study is of great theoretical and practical significance to further improve the performance of chokes used in managed pressure well drilling.|$|R

An Eulerian-Lagrangian model of the flow is used, in combination with empirically developed equations for the mass removal, to examine erosion in valve components for aqueous slurry flows. Two types of geometries were used: (i) a relative simple geometry with basic geometrical features similar to real valves and (ii) a geometrically complex <b>valve</b> (a <b>choke</b> <b>valve).</b> Predictions of flow coefficients and mass removal rates were directly compared with measurements from a parallel experimental programme.

The tests verified that the analytical based model was able to predict the pressure loss and flow across the valve.

40|$|<b>Choke</b> <b>valves</b> {{are widely}} used in the oil&gas {{industry}} to control the fluid flowing in the system. Some of these valves rely on a "cage and sleeve" functioning, in which an outer, sliding sleeve controls the flow rate by overlapping the holes of an inner, fixed cage. The regulation characteristic of <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> is typically quantified by the opening curve, which is {{the plot of the}} flow coefficient versus the valve opening. Experimental tests performed on a ???cage and sleeve??? <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> revealed that the orientation of the holes of the cage affects significantly the flow coefficient. This work focuses on the worst situation encountered, in which an anomalous decreasing trend in the opening curve for large valve openings is accompanied by strong vibrations of the device. CFD simulations were run to provide a physical interpretation of this unexpected result. Due to the complexity of the flow field structure at the origin of this behavior particular attention was paid in properly defining the CFD model; the turbulence model and the differencing scheme for the convective fluxes were found to be the most significant parameters. The CFD runs allowed attributing the anomalous trend of the opening curve to the peculiar interactions of the jets within the cage. At last, a modification of the trim design is suggested for avoiding the malfunctioning of the valve and the abnormal vibrations...|$|R
40|$|In an Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) lifted oil field, the ESP of each {{oil well}} should be {{operated}} inside its operating window. The total power {{consumed by the}} ESPs in the oil field should be minimized. The speed of the ESPs and the production <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening should be optimally chosen for maximizing the total oil produced from the oil field. At the same time, {{the capacity of the}} separator should not be exceeded. In this paper, nonlinear steady state optimization based on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) is developed. Two optimal control structures are proposed in this paper. In the first case, the optimal pump speed is controlled by a PI controller by varying the electrical excitation signal to the motors. The optimal fluid flow rate through each oil well is controlled by another PI controller by varying the production <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening. The paper shows that the production <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> for each oil well has to be always 100 % open to maintain the optimal fluid flow rate. In the second case, the production <b>choke</b> <b>valves</b> are considered to be always 100 % open as hard constraints. The optimal fluid flow rate through each oil well is controlled by a PI controller by varying the pump speed. It is shown that when the optimal fluid flow rate is tracked by the controller, the speed of each of the pumps is equal to the optimal pump speed calculated by the optimizer. This basically means that we can achieve the optimization objective with the same optimal results as in the first case by using only a single PI controller. The limitations of these two optimal control structures for very low values and for very high values of the separator capacity are discussed. For the feasible range of separator capacities, the optimal locus of the fluid flow rate and the pump speed are shown in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} study of robust ant-slug control strategies for riser systems. The main objective of this thesis {{was to develop a}} robust anti- slug control scheme to increase the stability of riser systems. Similar research has been done previously, but is repeated in this thesis using a new closed loop tuning method by Skogestad et al. [24]. Using this systematic approach ensures that the results from the different experiments are comparable. A number of experiments have been carried out using a small scale two phase flow riser loop. The robustness of the different control schemes was compared by slowly increasing the <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening (setpoint) of the closed loop system until instability was reached. Since the inflow is depended on the system pressure, the control scheme with highest robustness was the one which was stable at the largest <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening. Mainly, single loop control schemes were tested successfully. The general trend was that the best controllable variables, with respect to robustness, are measurements upstream the riser low point. The best control scheme was able to stabilize the riser system until a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening of 27 %. Top side measurements were in general found to be difficult to use in anti-slug control schemes. Density measurements using an optical slug sensor was able to stabilize the riser system, but no tuning method could be implemented. Measuring the topside flow rate using a venture tube and a DP-cell installation was tested with no success. The equipment used in the experiments was oversized and resulted in no signal output. Since no systematic tuning method could be implemented to the topside control schemes, no cascade anti-slug schemes were tested. Inspired by the density valve action, a square wave signal was used as an input to the <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> The experiments proved that the riser system stability region was extended when using a square wave as input...|$|R

In this work a simple-to-use method is developed to estimate the choke flow coefficient for natural gas subsonic flow through orifice-type chokes {{as a function of}} Reynolds number and the ratio of choke diameter to pipe diameter.

40|$|One of {{the best}} {{suggested}} solutions for prevention of severe-slugging flow conditions at offshore oilfields is the active control of the production <b>choke</b> <b>valve.</b> This thesis is a study of robust control solutions for stabilizing multiphase flow inside the riser systems; through S-riser experiments and OLGA simulations. ?Nonlinearity? as the important characteristic of slugging system poses some challenges for control. Focus of this thesis is on online tuning rules that take into account nonlinearity of the slugging system. The main objective has been to increase the stability of riser systems at higher levels of valve openings with more production rates. Similar {{research has been done}} previously, but is repeated in this thesis using new systematic tuning methods. Three different tuning methods have been applied in this thesis. One is Shams?s set-point overshoot method developed by Shamsozzhoha (Shamsuzzoha and Skogestad 2010). The other is IMC- (Internal Model Control) based tuning method with respect to the identified model of the system from closed-loop step test. The last tuning method is simple PI tuning rules with gain scheduling for the whole operating range of the system considering the nonlinearity of the static gain. The two latter methods have been developed very recently by Jahanshahi and Skogestad (Jahanshahi and Skogestad 2013). Two series of experiments have been carried out using a medium-scale two-phase flow S-riser loop. A single loop control scheme with riser-base pressure as the measurement was used. The robustness of different tuning methods was compared by slowly decreasing the set-point of the closed-loop system, which was the inlet pressure, until instability was reached. The <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening was increasing gradually by decreasing the set-point. A control with a robust tuning method can maintain system stability in a large range of conditions. The <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> was then replaced with a quicker valve after the first set of experiments. The same experiments were repeated and the effect of control valve dynamics was investigated thereafter. The experiments were simulated in OLGA and the same control tests were performed. The OLGA case was constructed based on the first series of tests with valve 1 and the designed controllers with different tuning strategies were applied. Results of the experiments verified those of the simulations. The tuning method with the highest robustness was thus the one which could stabilize the system at the largest <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening (the lowest inlet pressure). The best tuning method, with respect to robustness is the simple PI tuning rules with gain scheduling for the whole operating range of the system. With this method, it was possible to stabilize the experimental riser system up to a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening of 37 % from an open-loop stability of 16 %. It was also able to stabilize the simulated riser system until a <b>choke</b> <b>valve</b> opening of 75 % from an open-loop stability of 26 %. Top side measurements were in general difficult to use in anti-slug control. Measurement of the topside density using a conductance probe installation was not successful. Therefore, no cascade anti-slug control schemes could be tested. </p...|$|R
