The free app utilizes {{a number of}} patents and technology around its live streaming voice service to create a [...] "push-to-talk" [...] product that makes all communication live. The app has been described [...] "as being similar to the Nextel walkie talkie phones, except it lets users listen to messages at their convenience and talk one-to-one with other users." [...] The app also allows users to send text messages and photos and has a location feature that allows users to see on a map where other users are located when they send a message. In November 2011, after launching {{a version of the}} app on the Android operating system, Voxer Walkie Talkie began to experience viral success. In an interview with TechCrunch, Gustaf Alstromer, the company's head of growth, explained that users in Cleveland adopted the technology first, followed by users in other cities in the Midwestern United States. The company attributes its viral success to word of mouth and [...] "a variety of best practices going for tracking clickthroughs, conversions, and overall usage, using third parties like Mixpanel as well as its in-house systems." [...] As of April 2012, monthly, unique users numbered in the double-digit millions. In a video interview with the Wall Street Journal and All Things Digital, Katis also claimed Voxer's widespread adoption was in part due to the company's cross platform roll out on iOS and Android. This cross platform functionality allows users on different operating systems to communicate using the app which created a <b>viral</b> <b>loop.</b> Today, the company has users across the world with an especially high user base in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Germany, England, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Asia. Voxer Walkie Talkie was among the top 25 social networking apps in more than 60 markets, according to the app tracking website App Annie. The service works over WiFi, 3G, 4G, and EDGE. As of April 2012, the company has 35 employees and is headquartered in downtown San Francisco. The company's employees comes from a variety of backgrounds and companies including Danger, Android, Twitter, and Apple. Katis said that the next steps for Voxer are to continue to improve the app, roll out functionality on other platforms and to create an enterprise-level product with additional features and administrative rights {{that can be used for}} governments, hospitals, corporations and other large organizations.|$|E

While both genetic and postpartum environmental exposure have been linked to ASD, prenatal maternal weight has not been investigated. The objective of the study is to assess whether overweight or obesity at pregnancy is an important risk factor for the diagnosis of ASD in offspring. A case-control study was designed to answer this question using the public health ecosocial theory. The study population consisted of 70 mothers, who were recruited via the Internet using the <b>viral</b> expansion <b>loop.</b> Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. No significant difference in risk of ASD by level of body mass index (BMI) was found after adjusting for covariates. The odds ratio for obese women in comparison to normal or underweight women was 1. 19, 95 % CI [0. 53, 2. 66] after adjusting for covariates. Gaining the appropriate amount of weight during gestation, as determined by the Institute of Medicine, was not associated with ASD either, with the odds ratio at 0. 67, 95 % CI [0. 31, 1. 48]. The results indicate that BMI category at pregnancy and gestational weight gain were not risk factors for autism in children. The implications for positive social change include a better understanding of maternal prenatal BMI as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder. Appropriate health information provided to mothers prenatally could result in improved birth outcomes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{persistence}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type- 1 (HIV- 1) has long been attributed to its high mutation rate and the capacity of its resulting heterogeneous virus populations to evade host immune responses and antiviral drugs. However, this view is incomplete {{because it does not}} explain how the virus persists in light of the adverse effects mutations in the viral genome and variations in host functions can potentially have on viral functions and growth. Here we show that the resilience of HIV- 1 can be credited, at least in part, to a robust response to perturbations that emerges as an intrinsic property of its intracellular development. Specifically, robustness in HIV- 1 arises through the coupling of two feedback loops: a Rev-mediated negative feedback and a Tat-mediated positive feedback. By employing a mechanistic kinetic model for its growth we found that HIV- 1 buffers the effects of many potentially detrimental variations in essential viral and cellular functions, including the binding of Rev to mRNA; the level of rev mRNA in the pool of fully spliced mRNA; the splicing of mRNA; the Rev-mediated nuclear export of incompletely-spliced mRNAs; and the nuclear import of Tat and Rev. The virus did not, however, perform robustly to perturbations in all functions. Notably, HIV- 1 tended to amplify rather than buffer adverse effects of variations in the interaction of Tat with viral mRNA. This result shows how targeting therapeutics against molecular components of the <b>viral</b> positive-feedback <b>loop</b> open new possibilities and potential in the effective treatment of HIV- 1...|$|R

The variant peptide includes four amino acid substitutions in the loop relative to the previously studied peptide representing FMDV C-S 8 c 1 and corresponds to the loop of a natural FMDV isolate of subtype C 1. The peptide was complexed with the Fab fragment of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody 4 C 4. The peptide adopts a compact fold with a nearly cyclic conformation and a disposition of the receptor-recognition motif Arg-Gly-Asp that {{is closely related to}} the previously determined structure for the <b>viral</b> <b>loop,</b> as part of the virion, and for unsubstituted synthetic peptide antigen bound to neutralizing antibodies. New structural findings include the observation that well-defined solvent molecules appear {{to play a major role}} in stabilizing the conformation of the peptide and its interactions with the antibody. Structural results are supported by molecular-dynamic simulations. The multiply substituted peptide developed compensatory mechanisms to bind the antibody with a conformation very similar to that of its unsubstituted counterpart.

Evolution of the gp 120 C 2 - V 5 env sequence was demonstrated in all subjects but one by sequence analysis of the replicating plasma virus collected at baseline and 12 - 15 months after ART initiation. The analysis of the host's selective pressure showed that in four subjects, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous amino acid substitutions was higher in the V 3 sequences than in the C 2 - V 5 region ([K-a/K-s](V 3) /[K-a/K-s](C 2 -V 5) > 1. 0). Interestingly, this feature was observed only in subjects (four of five) showing an increase in T cell receptor rearrangement excision circle (TREC) -bearing cells and in CD 4 (+) T-lymphocytes despite persistent viremia (discordant therapeutic response) (p = 0. 02), thus suggesting that the V 3 loop is a target of the immune reconstitution under ART. Using phenotypic analysis of recombinant viruses expressing exogenous V 3 sequences, a reverse shift from CXCR 4 -tropic to CCR 5 -tropic variants was demonstrated {{in two of the}} four subjects, further indicating that the host's selective pressure sharply forces the V 3 evolution of replicating variants.

The protein asymmetrical unit, comprising four capsid proteins (VP 1, VP 2, VP 3, and VP 4) and two calcium ions, was solvated both on the exterior and the interior to fill the inside of the capsid. The stability of the simulations of this large system (∼ 800 residues and 6, 650 water molecules) is comparable to more conventional globular protein simulations. The influence of the antiviral compound on compressibility and positional fluctuations is reported. The compressibility, estimated from the density fluctuations in the region of the binding pocket, was found to be greater with WIN 52084 s bound than without the drug, substantiating previous computations on reduced viral systems. An increase in compressibility correlates with an entropically more favorable system. In contrast to the increase in density fluctuations and compressibility, the positional fluctuations decreased dramatically for the external loops of VP 1 and the N-terminus of VP 3 when WIN 52084 s is bound. Most of these VP 1 and VP 3 loops are found near the fivefold axis, a region whose mobility was not considered in reduced systems, but can be observed with this simulation of the full <b>viral</b> protomer. Altered <b>loop</b> flexibility is consistent with changes in proteolytic sensitivity observed experimentally. Moreover, decreased flexibility in these intraprotomeric loops is noteworthy since the externalization of VP 4, part of VP 1, and RNA during the uncoating process is thought to involve areas near the fivefold axis. Both the decrease in positional fluctuations at the fivefold axis and the increase in compressibility near the WIN pocket are discussed in relationship to the antiviral activity of stabilizing the virus against uncoating...|$|R

40|$|Porcine {{parvovirus}} (PPV) {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important causes of reproductive failure in swine. Fetal death, mummification, stillbirths and delayed return to estrus are some of the clinical signs commonly associated with PPV infection in a herd. The virus genome {{is considered to}} be conservative, with substitution rates near to that of their host. However, it has been shown that some parvoviruses exhibit a substitution rate close to that commonly determined for RNA viruses. In this scenario, new PPV phenotypes may reduce the effectiveness of the currently used vaccines, recommending the continuous monitoring of the currently prevalent PPV strains. In addition, a number of novel porcine parvoviruses have been described during the last decade, but the importance and characteristics of these viruses remain unknown. In the present dissertation, three studies were performed to address the PPV genetic variability, to monitor the emergence of new PPV strains and the prevalence of novel parvoviruses. In the first study, recent PPV field isolates from Austria, Brazil, Germany and Switzerland were sequenced and analyzed. These samples, together with sequences retrieved from GenBank, were included in three datasets (viral protein complete gene, viral protein partial gene and non-structural protein complete gene). For each dataset, the nucleotide substitution rate was determined and a molecular clock estimated. The analysis revealed that for the new strains, the amino acids substitutions were located mainly in the <b>viral</b> capsid <b>loops.</b> Only the capsid protein datasets present the higher suitability for phylogenetic analysis. In them, a higher divergence was found, with three well defined clusters. By inferring the evolutionary dynamics of the PPV sequences, a nucleotide substitution rate of approximately 10 - 4 substitutions per site per year was found for these datasets. An association of the phylogenetic tree with the molecular clock revealed that the main divergence of the PPV strains for the viral protein ocurred in the last 30 years. In the second study, the population dynamic of PPV isolates from swine herds was analyzed using PPV complete protein gene and partial sequences deposited in GenBank. The population dynamic of the virus was calculated using a Bayesian approach with a Bayesian skyline coalescent model. Additionally, an in vitro model was performed by twenty-one consecutives passages of the Challenge strain (a virulent field strain) and NADL 2 strain (a vaccine strain) in PK 15 cell-line supplemented with polyclonal antibodies raised against the vaccine strain (negative control was not supplemented). The Bayesian analysis indicated a decrease in the population diversity over the years and the predominance of some PPV strains. In agreement, the in vitro study revealed that a lower number of mutations appeared for both viruses in the presence of anti-PPV antibodies in comparison with the control passages without antibodies. In the third study, tonsils and hearts from 100 pigs were collected in a German slaughterhouse in 2010 and tested for PPV, porcine parvovirus 2 (PPV 2), porcine parvovirus 3 (PPV 3) and porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV 4). Positive samples of PPV, PPV 2 and PPV 3 were sequenced. PPV was observed in 60 / 100 hearts and 61 / 100 tonsils and PPV 2 in 55 / 100 hearts and 78 / 100 tonsils. PPV 3 and PPV 4 could not be detected in the heart samples but 20 / 100 and 7 / 100, respectively, of the tonsils were tested positive. The phylogenetic analysis of the PPV, PPV 2 and PPV 3 sequences revealed that the German samples could be divided in at least two clusters or clades for each virus. Altogether, it can be concluded that PPV is continuously evolving. Apparently, PPV vaccines largely used in the last 30 years probably have reduced the genetic diversity of the virus and induced the predominance of strains with distinct capsid profile from the original vaccine-based strain. Moreover, the high prevalence of the PPV, PPV 2 and PPV 3 and their genetic diversity highlight the importance of the continuous monitoring of these viruses...|$|R
40|$|All {{cellular}} {{organisms in}} aquatic environments {{are susceptible to}} virus attack. Viruses are the smallest but most abundant biological entities in freshwaters. This thesis describes interactions between viruses and bacteria in temperate and polar freshwaters with particular emphasis on Arctic and Antarctic aquatic systems. Free virus-like particles in freshwaters are vulnerable and exposed and as parasites their survival {{is dependent on the}} existence of a suitable host. I found that high concentrations of humic substances in lakes had a negative impact on viral abundance as viruses may be adsorbed to humic matter and replication or viral infectivity may be lost. This indicates that virus-bacteria interactions in humic lakes may differ from those in clear water lakes. Furthermore, there was a high incidence of lysogenic bacteria in humic lakes when compared to other temperate freshwaters which could indicate that lysogeny may act as a viral survival strategy in environments where high rates of destruction and inactivation may occur. On the contrary, I found that lysogenic bacteria were not common in the Arctic and Antarctic freshwaters and during a seasonal study conducted on two Antarctic ultra-oligotrophic lakes lysogenic bacteria were only detected on 3 out of 10 sampling occasions. As viruses are parasites the metabolic state of their host will largely determine how successful they are in replicating. I found that bacterial growth in the Arctic and Antarctic freshwaters was primarily limited by phosphorus however even though an increase in phosphorus had a positive effect on bacteria this was not reflected in the virus abundance. Using electron microscopy I established that a high percentage of the Arctic and Antarctic bacteria population was visibly infected and that the average number of virus-like particles per cell was low relative to previous reported data. This indicates that virus-bacteria interactions in polar freshwaters differ significantly from those in temperate freshwaters. In microbially dominated Antarctic freshwater lakes the major pathway of energy and carbon flow is through the microbial <b>loop.</b> <b>Viral</b> lysis disrupts this flow and shunts organic carbon back into the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool making it available for the uninfected bacterial community. I found that viral lysis of bacterial cells could contribute significantly to the DOC pool in Antarctic freshwater lakes. I estimated that over 60 % of the carbon supplied to the DOC pool originated from viral lysis during the winter months while during the summer period less than 20 % originated from viral lysis. This implies that viral processes in extreme Antarctic lakes may be of quantitative significance with respect to carbon flow...|$|R
