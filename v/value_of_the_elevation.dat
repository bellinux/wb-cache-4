40|$|International audienceWhen an {{aircraft}} with an {{inertial navigation system}} stays without an additional treatment (GPS-denied environment, covered area without terrain information) its errors grow during the time due to the sensors and the gravity field uncertainties. So {{as soon as possible}} the navigation filter has to reduce this uncertainty in the shortest possible time using other sensor. We take interest in using as other sensor a airborne laser scanner (ALS) with a digital terrain <b>elevation</b> data (<b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrain <b>elevation</b> as a function of geodetic coordinates). ALS sensor advantage is that it extracts a lot of terrain information in a single time step : the output is multiple distance measurements to the terrain alongside different directions with a very good accuracy. This very nice property might improve the navigation filter precision and so reduce the time until the INS estimates uncertainty is below a certain level. But basic filters diverge when for a more or less long duration in function <b>of</b> INS quality <b>the</b> uncertainty becomes too large.

Methods: We evaluated 20 eyes undergoing orthokeratology for correction of myopia spherical equivalent (mean +/- SD=- 3. 41 +/- 0. 76 D), 18 eyes undergoing custom LASIK surgery (mean +/- SD=- 4. 14 +/- 0. 89 D), and 23 eyes undergoing standard LASIK (mean +/- SD= 23. 61 +/- 0. 67 D). <b>The</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> front and back corneal surfaces were derived by using Pentacam (Oculus, Inc.

Results: Corneal elevation data before treatment were not statistically different between patients in either group (P> 0. 070, for back and front elevation). After treatment, both surgical procedures significantly increased <b>the</b> positive <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front <b>elevation</b> beyond an area <b>of</b> 6 mm. <b>The</b> opposite trend was found within the central 5 mm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cornea, presenting a statistically significant decrease in elevation (P 0. 285).

In order to raise <b>the</b> economic performance <b>of</b> Wave energy converters (WECs), still far from being competitive, a large scope exists for <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> their capacity factor through more intelligent control systems. Most control solutions proposed in the literature, for <b>the</b> enhancement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power absorption <b>of</b> WECs, are not implemented in practise because they require future knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave <b>elevation</b> or wave excitation force. <b>The</b> non-causality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unconstrained optimal conditions, termed complex-conjugate control, for the maximum wave energy absorption of WECs consisting of oscillating systems, is analysed. A link between fundamental properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floating body and the prediction horizon required for an effective implementation of complex-conjugate control is identified. An extensive investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> wave <b>elevation</b> and wave excitation force forecasting is then presented. The prediction is treated as a purely stochastic problem, where future <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wave <b>elevation</b> or wave excitation force are estimated from past measurements at the device location only. <b>The</b> correlation <b>of</b> ocean waves, in fact, allows <b>the</b> achievement <b>of</b> accurate predictions for 1 or 2 wave periods into the future, with linear Autoregressive (AR) models. A relationship between predictability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excitation force and excitation properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> floating body is also identified. Finally, a controller for an oscillating wave energy device is developed. Based on the assumption that the excitation force is a narrow-banded harmonic process, the controller is effectively tuned through a single parameter of immediate physical meaning, for performance and motion constraint handling.

This study investigated water wave-induced fluidization of cohesive soil beds composed of a 50 / 50 (by weight) mixture of a commercial attapulgite and a kaolinite in a laboratory flume. Temporal and spatial changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effective stress were measured during <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> wave action, and from these changes the bed fluidization rate was calculated. A previously developed hydrodynamic wave-mud interaction model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two-layered water-mud system was employed to study the nature and <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> wave dissipation, in terms of energy dissipation rate, during the bed fluidization process. By evaluating the mud rheological properties separately, a mud viscosity model was developed, which was then {{used in conjunction with}} the wave-mud interaction model to obtain an effective sheared thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed resulting from wave action. This thickness, considered to be a representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluidized mud thickness, was compared with the latter obtained from pressure measurements. Also, through this wave-mud model the relationship between <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> fluidization and <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> wave energy dissipation during fluidization was examined. In general, for a given wave frequency, a larger wave fluidized the bed at a faster rate and to a greater depth than a smaller one. Furthermore, increased bed consolidation time decreased <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> fluidization due to increased mud rigidity. <b>The</b> rate <b>of</b> bed fluidization was typically greater at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> wave action and decreased with time. Eventually this rate approached zero, while in some cases the wave energy dissipation rate approached a constant value, which increased with wave height. As the fluidization rate approached zero, there appeared to occur an equilibrium <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>elevation,</b> and hence a fluid mud thickness, for a given wave condition. During the fluidization process the bed apparently lost its structural integrity by loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effective stress through a build-up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excess pore water pressure. After wave action ceased, the bed structure exhibited recovery by dissipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excess pore water pressure.

Unfortunately, this discharge could change due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> uncertainty in its computation. As with hydrology, in a hydraulic analysis a determined <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water surface <b>elevation</b> at a certain location is calculated using the flow discharge obtained from the hydrologic analysis. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the hydrologic {{as well as in the}} hydraulic analysis that elevation could be higher or lower than <b>the</b> actual <b>elevation</b> calculated. Based on the case study and through the developed methodology, it was possible to develop stage and discharge frequency curves at selected locations along the channel. These frequency curves allow the analyst to see a range of possible discharges and a range of possible water surface elevations with their associated probability of occurrence at a specific location...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> main {{characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vernagtferner mass balance are sumarized {{in the table}} below. The mass balance years from 1964 / 65 to 2003 / 2004 are listed. The table includes <b>the</b> total area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier (basis for the calculations), the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accumulation area {{in relation to the}} total area (AAR) and the specific net mass balance in mm w. e. (water equivalent) per year. It becomes clear that, after a rather minor growth period in the mid 1970 's, the glacier continually lost mass since <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980 's. Besides that, a clear increase of mass balance years with extreme mass losses could be observed in the last decade. The "glacier-friendly" summer with a well-balanced mass balance in 1999 could only interrupt <b>the</b> series <b>of</b> years with extreme mass losses, but this means no change in the trend. The minor mass loss in 1999 was caused by a winter snow cover above average, which prevented the glacier from becoming snow free over large areas and thus resulted in a lower ice melt. Although real summer conditions in 2000 were mainly restricted to August and produced a snow free area only slightly larger than in 1999, there have been further ice losses. This trend of negative mass balance continued also in the years 2001 and 2002. Nevertheless, the losses are moderate because a smaller part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier became ice free until autumn (appr. 50 %). The summer 2003 caused a loss of ice in a dimension never seen since <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific investigations. This resulted from a combination of different factors: after only a moderate winter snowcover the glacier became snow free very early. For the first time the ablation area spanned over the entire glacier (blue fields in the mass balance tables!). Only one short snowfall event interrupted the ablation period, which lasted twice as long as in <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> large losses in the 1990 's. The extreme mass loss in 2003 will also influence the mass balance in the following year 2004. <b>The</b> graphical representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevation</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific mass balance together with the absolute mass balance can be found individually for each year by choosing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mass balance <b>values</b> from the table. These diagrams also include <b>the</b> area-height-distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier and the ablation area. A tabular version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numeric <b>values</b> in dependence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevation,</b> provided separately for the accumulation area, the ablation area and the total glacier, can be found in colums "Persistent Identifier". The tables include the results for three different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glacier and for the total glacier...|$|R
