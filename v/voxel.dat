25|$|Volume {{rendering}} is {{a technique}} used to display a 2D projection of a 3D discretely sampled data set. A typical 3D data set {{is a group of}} 2D slice images acquired by a CT or MRI scanner. Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image pixels in a regular pattern. This {{is an example of a}} regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or <b>voxel</b> represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the <b>voxel.</b>|$|E
3000|$|In {{the first}} stage, the feature {{selection}} algorithm is implemented {{to select the}} best subset of <b>voxels.</b> This procedure is repeated 15 times to obtain {{the average number of}} selected <b>voxels</b> (N_avg) and frequencies of <b>voxels</b> being selected. <b>Voxels</b> are ranked according to their selection frequencies in a descending order. The top N_ 1 (N_ 1 [...] = [...] 1.05 N_avg) <b>voxels</b> are selected in Stage I. In the second stage, we first establish all connectivity that connects <b>voxels</b> selected in Stage I, which is equivalent to constructing a fully connected network. In this stage, we aim at extracting discriminating connectivity patterns from a fully connected structure. The rationale is as follows: HHPSO–SVM selects a best combination of <b>voxels</b> in the first stage, which means the selected <b>voxels</b> are interactive and informative as a combination. Identifying consistent connectivity patterns from the pre-selected voxel combination may achieve similar or even better classification performances than only considering individual <b>voxels.</b>|$|R

After grouping, the dimensions and number of <b>voxels</b> of the object were compared to what is expected for normal markers (e.g., a diameter of under 6 <b>voxels</b> and consisting of under 250 <b>voxels)</b> to filter out possible objects other than markers.|$|R
25|$|The scanner {{platform}} {{generates a}} 3nbsp&D {{volume of the}} subject's head every TR. This consists of an array of <b>voxel</b> intensity values, one value per <b>voxel</b> in the scan. The voxels are arranged one after the other, unfolding the three-dimensional structure into a single line. Several such volumes from a session are joined {{together to form a}} 4nbsp&D volume corresponding to a run, for the time period the subject stayed in the scanner without adjusting head position. This 4nbsp&D volume is the starting point for analysis. The first part of that analysis is preprocessing.|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by the}} size of voxels, as in MRI. A <b>voxel</b> is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A <b>voxel</b> typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on <b>voxel</b> size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Voxels</b> are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} visualization and analysis of medical and scientific data. Some volumetric displays use <b>voxels</b> to describe their resolution. For example, a display {{might be able to}} show 512×512×512 <b>voxels.</b>|$|R

30|$|All slices were checked manually, {{abundant}} <b>voxels</b> were erased, {{and missing}} <b>voxels</b> were filled.|$|R
25|$|Head motion {{correction}} {{is another}} common preprocessing step. When the head moves, the neurons under a <b>voxel</b> move and hence its timecourse now represents largely that {{of some other}} <b>voxel</b> in the past. Hence the timecourse curve is effectively cut and pasted from one <b>voxel</b> to another. Motion correction tries different ways of undoing this to see which undoing of the cut-and-paste produces the smoothest timecourse for all voxels. The undoing is by applying a rigid-body transform to the volume, by shifting and rotating the whole volume data to account for motion. The transformed volume is compared statistically to the volume at the first timepoint {{to see how well}} they match, using a cost function such as correlation or mutual information. The transformation that gives the minimal cost function is chosen as the model for head motion. Since the head can move in a vastly varied number of ways, {{it is not possible to}} search for all possible candidates; nor is there right now an algorithm that provides a globally optimal solution independent of the first transformations we try in a chain.|$|E
25|$|CBCT use is only lightly {{regulated}} in the U.S. The recommended {{standard of}} care {{is to use the}} smallest possible FOV, the smallest <b>voxel</b> size, the lowest mA setting and the shortest exposure time in conjunction with a pulsed exposure mode of acquisition.|$|E

40|$|As fMRI {{researchers}} increasingly tackle naturalistic, complex experimental paradigms, response reliability {{is often}} used in place of response amplitudes as a metric of each <b>voxel’s</b> responsiveness to a stimulus.

After {{a cluster}} is {{produced}} by the DBC approach (in this step), we need to [...] "expand" [...] it (in the next step) by including the surrounding black <b>voxels</b> (to capture the nearby blood cells). The cluster expansion should not take blue <b>voxels,</b> but it should include nearby red/green <b>voxels</b> as well. Thus, this expansion process actually includes all surrounding non-blue <b>voxels.</b> With a relatively high density value, we preserve a dense cluster structure (although some [...] "sparse" [...] red/green <b>voxels</b> around the current cluster boundary may be excluded in the DBC process). This loss of information is compensated by allowing the clot to capture the nearby red/green/black <b>voxels</b> in the cluster expansion process.|$|R

25|$|After the {{individual}} images are segmented, they are registered to the template. Each <b>voxel</b> then contains {{a measure of}} the probability, according to which it belongs to a specific segmentation class. For gray matter, this quantity is usually referred to as gray matter density (GMD) or gray matter concentration (GMC), or gray matter probability (GMP).|$|E
25|$|The GLM model {{does not}} take into account the {{contribution}} of relationships between multiple voxels. Whereas GLM analysis methods assess whether a <b>voxel</b> or region's signal amplitude is higher or lower for one condition than another, newer statistical models such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), utilize the unique contributions of multiple voxels within a voxel-population. In a typical implementation, a classifier or more basic algorithm is trained to distinguish trials for different conditions within a subset of the data. The trained model is then tested by predicting the conditions of the remaining (independent) data. This approach is most typically achieved by training and testing on different scanner sessions or runs. If the classifier is linear, then the training model is a set of weights used to scale the value in each <b>voxel</b> before summing them to generate a single number that determines the condition for each testing set trial. More information on training and testing classifiers is at statistical classification.|$|E
25|$|One common {{approach}} to analysing fMRI data {{is to consider}} each <b>voxel</b> separately {{within the framework of}} the general linear model. The model assumes, at every time point, that the HDR is equal to the scaled and summed version of the events active at that point. A researcher creates a design matrix specifying which events are active at any timepoint. One common way is to create a matrix with one column per overlapping event, and one row per time point, and to mark it if a particular event, say a stimulus, is active at that time point. One then assumes a specific shape for the HDR, leaving only its amplitude changeable in active voxels. The design matrix and this shape are used to generate a prediction of the exact HDR response of the <b>voxel</b> at every timepoint, using the mathematical procedure of convolution. This prediction does not include the scaling required for every event before summing them.|$|E

Figure  2 represents the distribution of prediction R^ 2 for survived <b>voxels.</b> In most values of R^ 2, the proposed method obtained more <b>voxels</b> than ridge and lasso models. The prediction R^ 2 for all <b>voxels</b> are displayed in Fig.  3, where the points above the diagonals indicate {{the superiority of the}} model on the y-axis over the one on the x-axis. Obviously, most <b>voxels</b> in each brain area are better predicted by the proposed model than the traditional voxel-wise models.|$|R
25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} {{spectroscopic imaging}} (MRSI) combines both spectroscopic and imaging methods to produce spatially localized spectra {{from within the}} sample or patient. The spatial resolution is much lower (limited by the available SNR), but the spectra in each <b>voxel</b> contains information about many metabolites. Because the available signal is used to encode spatial and spectral information, MRSI requires high SNR achievable only at higher field strengths (3 T and above).|$|E
25|$|A study's {{choice of}} imaging {{modality}} {{depends on the}} desired spatial and temporal resolution. fMRI and PET offer relatively high spatial resolution, with <b>voxel</b> dimensions {{on the order of}} a few millimeters, but their relatively low sampling rate hinders the observation of rapid and transient interactions between distant regions of the brain. These temporal limitations are overcome by MEG, but at the cost of only detecting signals from much larger clusters of neurons.|$|E

25|$|Many brain {{areas are}} not {{suitable}} for fMRS studies because they are too small (like small nuclei in brainstem) or too close to bone tissue, CSF or extracranial lipids, which could cause inhomogeneity in the <b>voxel</b> and contaminate the spectra. To avoid these difficulties, in most fMRS studies the volume of interest is chosen from the visual cortex – because it is easily stimulated, has high energy metabolisms, and yields good MRS signals.|$|E
25|$|Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) is {{a method}} for {{determining}} whether the activation of a particular brain region changes between experimental conditions, stimuli, or over time. The essential idea is simple, and consists of two major steps: first, one performs a univariate statistical test on each individual <b>voxel</b> between each experimental condition. Second, one analyzes the clustering of the voxels that show statistically significant differences, and determines which brain regions exhibit different levels of activation under different experimental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is {{a method}} that allows one to measure brain tissue {{composition}} differences between subjects. To do so, one must first register all images to a standard coordinate system, by mapping them to a reference image. This is done by use of an affine transformation that minimizes the sum-of-squares intensity difference between the experimental image and the reference. Once this is done, the proportion of grey or white matter in a <b>voxel</b> can be determined by intensity. This allows one to compare the tissue composition of corresponding brain regions between different subjects.|$|E
