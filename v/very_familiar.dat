5|$|With {{the major}} {{population}} shifts of the Slavic migrations completed, the 8th century brought {{a measure of}} stability to the Slavic people settled in Poland. About one million people actively utilized no more than 20–25% of the land; the rest was mainly forest. Normal settlements, {{with the exception of}} a few fortifications and cult venues, were limited to lowland areas below 350 meters above the sea level. Most villages built without artificial defensive structures were located within valley areas of natural bodies of water. The Slavs were <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> with the water environment and used it as natural defense.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both tenderness and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> to the audience.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} promotion, Curtis joined the small brig HMS Otter in Newfoundland and there {{spent several years}} {{operating}} off the Labrador coastline, becoming <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> with the local geography and the Inuit peoples of the region. In a report he wrote for Lord Dartmouth, Curtis opined that although the inland regions of Labrador were barren, the coast was an ideal place for a seasonal cod fishery. He also formed a good opinion of the native people, applauding their healthy and peaceful lifestyle. Curtis made numerous exploratory voyages along the Labrador coast and formed close links with the Inuit tribes and Moravian missionaries in the region. His notes and despatches were presented to the Royal Academy by Daines Barrington in 1774, although accusations later surfaced {{that many of his}} observations were plagiarised from the notes of a local officer, Captain George Cartwright.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
5|$|Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) notifies Lieutenant Commander Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) that a {{group of}} Trill {{scientists}} will be arriving soon at Deep Space Nine to perform experiments related to wormhole physics. The Trill are a species formed of both a humanoid host and a symbiont, which are implanted into them. The symbionts live far longer than the hosts, and are moved into a new host when the old one dies. Jadzia is the eighth host of the Dax symbiont. Sisko tells Dax that the head scientist is Lenara Kahn (Susanna Thompson), and offers to grant Dax a leave of absence while the Trill scientists are aboard, but she turns it down. Upon Dax and Kahn's first meeting, Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) notices that they are <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> with each other; Dax tells her that Kahn used to be her wife. Dr. Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) later informs Kira about the non-association rules that Trill follow regarding the family and friends of former hosts, and says that hosts of the Dax and Kahn symbionts have previously been married to each other.|$|E

5|$|Chnodomar's {{men were}} of much less even quality than Julian's. His best warriors were the {{professional}} retinues of the regales (royal class, called ring-givers by the Germans), organized in warbands. They were well equipped with armour and swords, as behove their masters' status. The {{majority of his}} men, however, were temporary levies, lightly equipped and often inexperienced, like most contemporary Germanic forces relying on light equipment and speed. On the Alamanni side, {{there is little evidence}} of formation manoeuvres. The professional retainers of the regales may have had some capacity for this, especially as Germanic armies were by now <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> with the Roman way of war. Ammianus' account mentions a globus (mass) of the best warriors coming together {{in the thick of the}} battle and breaking through the Roman line. In addition, several would likely have served in the Roman army in the past. But the majority of Chnodomar's men consisted of temporary levies, whose equipment and experience would have been limited. According to Ammianus, they had to rely on a concentrated frontal charge to try to break through by weight of numbers, and proved no match for the Romans in the final phase of the battle, a prolonged struggle of attrition at close-quarters.|$|E
5|$|Mick St. John, {{a private}} investigator, dreams of being interviewed {{by a woman}} off-camera, where he reveals that he is 90 years old, and that unlike other vampires, he has {{standards}} and does not hunt women, children or innocents. Mick's job leads him {{to the scene of}} the murder of a young woman, where Beth, a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire, notices two large puncture wounds on the woman's neck. While walking around the scene, she meets Mick and tells him he looks <b>very</b> <b>familiar,</b> but he insists that they do not know each other. Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme, using the puncture wounds as inspiration. The article makes Josef, a 400-year-old vampire friend of Mick's, concerned for the safety of vampires. To get more information on the murder, Mick goes to the morgue, where his friend Guillermo (Jacob Vargas) supplies him with blood. Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman, eliminating them as her reason of death. Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman's apartment, where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{common law}} is, however, capable of {{evolving}} {{in the light}} of changing social, economic and cultural developments. Hale's proposition reflected the state of affairs in these respects {{at the time it was}} enunciated. Since then the status of women, and particularly of married women, has changed out of all recognition in various ways which are <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> and upon which it is unnecessary to go into detail. Apart from property matters and the availability of matrimonial remedies, one of the most important changes is that marriage is in modern times regarded as a partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the wife must be the subservient chattel of the husband. Hale's proposition involves that by marriage a wife gives her irrevocable consent to sexual intercourse with her husband under all circumstances and irrespective of the state of her health or how she happens to be feeling at the time. In modern times any reasonable person must regard that conception as quite unacceptable.|$|E

60|$|The enthusiasm which induced a priest, notary, {{and teacher}} like Knox {{to carry a}} claymore in defence of a beloved teacher, Wishart, seems more {{appropriate}} to a man of about thirty than a man of forty, and, so far, supports the opinion that, in 1545, Knox was only thirty years of age. In that case, {{his study of the}} debates between the Church and the new opinions must have been relatively brief. Yet, in 1547, he already reckoned himself, not incorrectly, as a skilled disputant in favour of ideas with which he cannot have been <b>very</b> long <b>familiar.</b>|$|R
5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents {{the high level of}} interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had {{spent a good deal of}} time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been <b>very</b> <b>familiar</b> with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807–08, as well as that of Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.|$|E

50|$|The {{settlement}} (and Resolute) {{was created}} by the Canadian government in 1953, partly to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War. Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula) were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and <b>very</b> little <b>familiar</b> wildlife. They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local beluga whale migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of 18000 km2 each year.|$|R
