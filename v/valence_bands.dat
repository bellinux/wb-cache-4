5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> with delocalized character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E

2500|$|Graphene nanoribbon {{transistors}} {{have shown}} great promise since its appearance in publications in 2008. Bulk graphene has a band gap of zero and thus {{cannot be used}} in transistors because of its constant conductivity, an inability to turn off. [...] The zigzag edges of the nanoribbons introduce localized energy states in the conduction and <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> and thus a bandgap that enables switching when fabricated as a transistor.

5000|$|The {{dispersion}} relation {{near the}} top of the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> is E=ℏ2k2/(2m*) with negative effective mass. So electrons {{near the top}} of the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> behave like they have negative mass. When a force pulls the electrons to the right, these electrons actually move left. This is solely due to the shape of the <b>valence</b> <b>band,</b> and is unrelated to whether the band is full or empty.
