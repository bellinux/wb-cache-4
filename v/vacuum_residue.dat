40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry is challenged with {{the processing of}} present heavy crudes caused by high composition of sulfur and metals, which lead to a higher yield of unfavorable bottom product as <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue.</b> <b>Vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> is the least valuable fraction of four, such as saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. However, it can be upgraded to recover more valuable products such as light hydrocarbons. The Delayed Coking process {{is going to be}} used to transform the <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> at different experimental conditions. First of all, the behavior of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> needs to be analyzed with no additions in feedstock. Secondly, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> can be mixed with unhydrogenated and hydrogenated light gas oil at different concentrations.

In this research, 3 different catalysts will be tested in several proportions with respect to the weight of the feedstock material. The recommended feed concentration of light gas oil depends on the molecular structure of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> and can be determined only by actual experiment. Based on these experimental conditions, a conclusion about the yield of the light hydrocarbons and ways to improving the process can be drawn...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{rheology}} has been extensively used in order to classify and evaluate bituminous binders according to their performance properties.

The influence of ageing on the rheological properties and temperature susceptibility was studied on whole <b>vacuum</b> <b>residues</b> and on their respective maltene fractions.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a methodology for kinetic modelling of refining processes, and more specifically for <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> conversion. The proposed approach allows to overcome the lack of molecular detail of the petroleum fractions and to simulate the transformation of the feedstock molecules into effluent molecules by means of a two-step procedure. In the first step, a synthetic mixture of molecules representing the feedstock for the process is generated via a molecular reconstruction method, termed SR-REM molecular reconstruction. In the second step, a kinetic Monte-Carlo method(kMC) is used to simulate the conversion reactions on this mixture of molecules.

As characterized by temperature-programmed ammonia desorption analysis, the A-FCC catalyst with moderate cracking ability was essential for optimum product distribution in <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> conversion, where coke formation could be greatly suppressed via efficient oil vaporization and minimized secondary reaction. Coke removal (i. e., catalyst regeneration) of the FCC catalysts was conducted in two ways, that is, coke gasification (G-FCC) and gasification combustion (GC-FCC). During coke gasification, the sum of H- 2 and CO took up more than 80 vol % in the syngas, which could be potentially used as a hydrogen source for hydrotreating the cracked oil.

Such elements and heterocompounds are harmful to industry catalysts and might be toxic to living organisms. This work presents a methodology based on the following two-step approach: (1) A chromatographic column separation is first performed on a silica gel column to produce six fractions from the initial crude oils or petroleum products, such as <b>vacuum</b> <b>residues</b> (VRs). This separation is achieved by varying the polarity of the elution solvent systems used. (2) The separated fractions are then studied using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled to an inductively coupled plasma high-resolution mass spectrometry (ICP-HRMS). Additionally, the use of ultraviolet (UV) -visible spectroscopy allows for the identification of fractions containing porphyrinic-type compounds by detecting the Soret band at 405 nm. The objective of this two-step approach is to deduce both the distribution and nature of Ni and V complexes within the sample.

The in depth knowledge of the feed of this upgrading step is of key importance to design better catalysts. In this study, we applied new cutting-edge techniques to improve the characterization of a coal derived liquid obtained from a liquefaction step starting from Scottish bituminous coal. For this purpose, bidimensional chromatography (GC xGC), and C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to analyze four cuts of the coal liquid with the following boiling points intervals: heavy naphtha (initial boiling point: IBP- 215 degrees C), gas oil (215 - 343 degrees C), vacuum gas oil (343 - 524 degrees C) and <b>vacuum</b> <b>residue</b> (524 (+) degrees C). The analyses showed high aromaticity of all four cuts. The weight content of aromatics in the gas oil fraction, was 75 %, with a majority of two rings aromatics and the remainder consisting mostly of normal paraffins. In the vacuum gas oil cut, which contains mostly four aromatic rings, we found 11 wt% of asphaltenes (compounds in n-heptane), an unexpected high amount comparing to petroleum VGO fractions.
