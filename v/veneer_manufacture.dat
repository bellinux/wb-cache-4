40|$|Background: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to compare the {{mechanical}} failure behavior and to analyze fracture characteristics of metal ceramic crowns with two veneering systems – press-on metal (PoM) ceramic versus a conventional veneering system – subjected to static compressive loading. Material and Methods: Forty-six crowns were constructed and {{divided into two groups}} according to porcelain <b>veneer</b> <b>manufacture.</b> Group A: 23 metal copings with porcelain IPS-InLine veneering (conventional metal ceramic). Group B: 23 metal copings with IPS-InLine PoM veneering porcelain. After 120, 000 fatigue cycles, the crowns were axially loaded to the moment of fracture with a universal testing machine. The fractured specimens were examined under optical stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscope. Results: Fracture resistance values showed statistically significant differences (Student’s t-test) regarding the type of ceramic veneering technique (p = 0. 001) : Group A (conventional metal ceramics) obtained a mean fracture resistance of 1933. 17 N, and Group B 1325. 74 N (Press-on metal ceramics). The most common type of fracture was adhesive failure (with metal exposure) (p = 0. 000). Veneer porcelain fractured on the occlusal surface following a radial pattern. Conclusions: Metal ceramic crowns made of IPS InLine or IPS InLine PoM ceramics with different laboratory techniques all achieved above-average values for clinical survival in the oral environment according to ISO 6872. Crowns made with IPS InLine by conventional technique resisted fracture an average of 45 % more than IPS InLine PoM fabricated with the press-on techniqu...|$|E
40|$|Cordia alliodora is {{a fast-growing}} tree with a {{high-quality}} wood. The species is widely distributed in continental tropical America from central Mexico to northern Argentina, a range in latitude of some 50 ° from approximately 25 °N to 25 °S. There {{is also a}} wide occurrence among the Caribbean islands. Not only does the tree produce high-quality timber but the persistent, tall, straight stem, self-pruning habit and compact crown make it suitable for growing in combination with many agricultural crops. This, combined with {{the ease with which}} the species regenerates naturally on cleared sites, has led to its incorporation in numerous agroforestry systems throughout its natural range. C. alliodora can also readily be regenerated artificially by using either seedlings or stumps. Good growth as a plantation species has been achieved in the neotropics, trials in Africa have been promising and it is the basis ofa plantation programme in Vanuatu. On suitable sites dimensions of 30 - 35 m height and 40 - 55 cm diameter breast height are predicted for rotations of 20 - 25 years. However, the choice of provenance is important. Provenance variation over the whole of the species' natural range has not been assessed but substantial data are available for Central America. These show that, in exotic environments, provenances from the seasonally-dry Pacific watershed develop more rapidly at the seedling stage than do provenances from the more humid Atlantic watershed, but within two years of planting in the field this ranking is reversed. The Atlantic group then shows superior growth rates up to 10 years, the greatest age for which information is available. Evidence from plantations exposed to hurricanes and cyclones indicates that C. alliodora probably has above average resistance to stembreak and windthrow, compared with other plantation species, especially during the early years. In the species' natural range, stem canker caused by the rust fungus Puccinia cordiae is economically damaging on some sites. Other pests and diseases have been recorded as problematical locally but not sufficiently to detract from the tree's widespread popularity. Outside its natural range C. alliodora appears to have few serious pests and diseases but mortalities due to a root disease attributed to the fungus Phellinus noxius have given rise to concern in Vanuatu. The timber seasons easily with little degrade. It is dimensionally stable when dry, moderately durable compared with other tropical hardwoods when exposed to fungus attack, and resistance to termites is good. The wood works easily with little dulling of cutting edges to give a very smooth finish. Polishing and staining characteristics are satisfactory. The decorative heartwood has somewhat similar mechanical properties to Swietenia macrophylla. These characteristics have resulted in the timber being widely used in the countries where the species occurs naturally. The wood is popular for light construction, as well as for furniture- and cabinetmaking. It is also used for <b>veneer</b> <b>manufacture,</b> turnery and a wide variety of carvings. As many of the properties of C. alliodora wood {{are similar to those of}} S. macrophylla, it might be an acceptable substitute in uses such as boat planking and other boat parts. The resistance to decay indicates a possible role as an alternative timber to several species of cedar in situations requiring durability. An investigation of plantation grown samples from Vanuatu concluded that although the wood is not strong for construction purposes, the combination of stability and durability make it suitable for both indoor and outdoor work. The appearance suggests a use in furniture construction and panelling, and it should be acceptable for flooring where there is light traffic. </p...|$|E

40|$|A New Zealand {{stand of}} Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden was pruned up to height 8 m and grown for 15 years at low {{stocking}} to 57 cm diameter at breast height. This stand provided 15 trees, preselected {{for a range}} of wood density. Lumber and veneer were cut from the 5 -m butt logs, veneer was peeled from the second logs from height 7 to 13 m, and each tree was evaluated for production of appearance-grade lumber and rotary-peeled veneer. Butt-log quality was good as pruning had effectively restricted the knotty core, and there was little decay from branches in either butt logs or veneer billets. Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing timber conversion in some trees. Collapse and internal checking were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated splitting. Knots severely downgraded structural plywood veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the second logs being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned butt logs.

40|$|Abstract- In {{this study}} the {{suitability}} of using core veneer made from renewable natural fiber i. e. Non-oven jute felt, which {{is the second most}} widely used natural fiber for manufacturing of plywood was investigated to minimize the gap between demand and supply of wood veneer. The renewable natural hard jute fibre was impregnated with phenolic resin and was used for the manufacture of plywood. Plywood of 4 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm thick were manufactured by using phenolic resin impregnated jute felt having thickness 16 mm of 1850 GSM (approx.) as a core in place of the natural wood veneer. From the study, it can be inferred that PF Resin impregnated Non oven jute felt as a natural fibre can suitably replace the wooden glue core <b>veneer</b> to <b>manufacture</b> ply board up to 80 % as an alternative substitute of wood. The physico-mechanical properties such as surface roughness, moisture content, density, water absorption, swelling, compressive strength, tensile strength, static bending strength, glue shear strength, of the plywood manufactured by using jute felt as core veneer with different resin dilution have been studied. Data revels that most of the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood showed satisfactory results meeting the requirement of different grades of plywood tested as per IS: 1734 - 1983. The accelerated study of the glued core after impregnation with jute felt have been carried out for three months before plywood manufacture after storing it in proper temperature and humidity. The data revealed that there is no appreciable change in bond quality and mechanical properties of the plyboard manufactured after storing the veneer up to 30 days.

A fine stylus method was used for surface roughness evaluation of the veneer produced from two types of the logs and it was found that the samples peeled from the logs with a temperature of 52 °C had significantly better roughness values than those of manufactured from the logs with 32 °C at a 95 % confidence level. Wettability of veneer samples was determined with contact angle measurements according to the sessile drop method. Urea formaldehyde (UF) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin drops were used in contact angle measurements. Contact angles of PF resin drops on veneers were similar for each peeling temperature while the contact angles of UF glue resin on veneers produced from the logs with 32 °C were lower than those of produced from the logs with 52 °C.

40|$|Customers demand {{very high}} quality of {{veneered}} furniture products with regard to surface appearance, shape stability and stiffness. To meet these requirements, {{it is important to}} improve the manufacturing process by {{a better understanding of the}} thermo-hygro-mechanical behaviour of the individual <b>veneers.</b> During the <b>manufacture</b> of strongly curved products, the veneers are exposed to large membrane and bending deformations and to high pressure in the radial fibre direction. When hot-press forming is used, the veneers are also exposed to a high surface temperature during the pressing time (curing time). These severe conditions can result in plastic deformation perpendicular to the veneer surface as well as mechano-sorptive strains in the curved regions, since the heating can have a significant influence on the moisture distribution. How strong an influence these factors have on the distortion of the veneered product and on the final surface quality (i. e. grain-raising and fissuring) of the product is far from being fully clarified. To study this complex multi-physical problem including temperature, moisture, large deformations for orthotropic materials, surface constraints and progressive glue interaction, a three-dimensional finite element model has been developed. In this study, the simulation of deformations and stresses occurring during the manufacture of a curved veneered product (chair seat) of birch wood is described. The results show that heating, pressure and the fibre orientation in the veneers have a significant influence on the distortion of the chair seat. The model can also be used to study the risk of fracture in the veneers and in the glue line. ...|$|R
40|$|Adhesives used in {{engineered}} wood products, such as I-joists and laminated <b>veneer</b> lumber (LVL), <b>manufactured</b> in North America {{are required to}} meet specific requirements of adhesive standards, such as ASTM D 2559 in the U. S. and CSA Standards for Wood Adhesives O 112 Series in Canada. However, these standards do not address the adhesive performance at temperatures above 180 °C (356 °F) even though the general expectation {{has been that the}} adhesives used in {{engineered wood}} products will not lose the bond strength more than wood does when exposed to elevated temperatures in unprotected assemblies, such as in most residential construction in North America. However, there is no existing standard in the world that addresses the performance of structural adhesives at an elevated temperature near unpiloted wood ignition. In lack of an international standard, a task committee was formed in 2004 by the engineered products industry in North America to develop an industry standard for the evaluation of adhesive performance at elevated temperatures with input from many key adhesive suppliers to the industry. Through coordinated efforts, an industry standard was adopted by the engineered wood products industry in March 2005. Test data suggests that this standard can be used to screen out those adhesives that significantly lose adhesive bond strength at the temperature near the wood ignition temperature. The test method given in the industry standard was submitted to the ASTM D 14 Committee on Adhesives for adoption in July 2005 and was approved for publication in April 2006 as ASTM D 7247, Standard Test Method for Evaluating the Shear Strength of Adhesive Bonds in Laminated Wood Products at Elevated Temperatures.

The characteristic strength value was 74 % and 118 % higher, respectively, than those adopted by Argentinean standards for the best strength class of sawn and glued laminated timber of the same species. It was similar to that reported for LVL of Norway spruce and lower than that published for LVL made from Uruguayan Eucalyptus grandis even though in the latter case the reported value was not obtained according to European standards.

To achieve better environmental benefits and cost saving, the utilisation of wood-based construction materials is currently attracting attention. However, the manufacturing of engineered wood products consumes large quantities of chemicals and energy, which may have adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, a life cycle study was conducted to compare various materials for constructing the structural frame of a 4 -storey apartment building compliant with the Australian building codes. Five alternatives were assessed: Laminated <b>Veneer</b> Lumber (LVL) <b>manufactured</b> from early to mid-rotation hardwood plantation logs (LVLm), LVL manufactured from mature hardwood plantations (LVLh), LVL manufactured from mature softwood plantations (LVLs), concrete and steel. The functional unit was defined as the whole building structural frame. Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification, Eutrophication, Fossil Depletion, Human-toxicity Potential (HTP) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) were evaluated. The LVL generally performed better than concrete and steel structural products. Particularly, LVLm had the lowest GWP (2. 84 E 4 ± 233 kg-CO 2 -eq) and LCC ($ 128, 855 ± 2797), which were less than {{a quarter of the}} concrete option. However, the usage of chemical preservatives and phenol-formaldehyde adhesive during the LVL production and treatment caused the HTP impact to be higher than the steel option. Monte Carlo Analysis showed that while the LVL options presented a higher sensitivity to the combined uncertainties, the overall ranking of the five options remained the same. Therefore, the inclusion of wood-based material in structural elements may significantly contribute to reduce the environmental impacts and the LCC of the construction sector.

40|$|Black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) {{is a fine}} {{hardwood}} tree species native to the central hardwood region of the United States. High-quality black walnut timber is highly desirable. Traded in both regional and global markets, {{it has been used}} for <b>veneer,</b> and the <b>manufacture</b> of high-end products such as cabinets, furniture, and gunstocks. As a result of its high economic value, black walnut has been commercially cultivated for many years, and breeding programs have generated superior timber genotypes with improved marketable traits. Once elite genotypes were developed, it was quickly recognized that black walnut was recalcitrant to clonal propagation techniques. Current black walnut propagation techniques such as grafting are time and labor intensive, and are less than optimal for commercial clonal black walnut production. Reports on black walnut propagation are limited, and successful protocols were often genotype dependent and difficult to replicate. The inability of black walnut to predictably and reliably produce adventitious roots is often the greatest hurdle to successful propagation protocols. The objective of this research was to develop a reproducible and dependable clonal propagation protocol for black walnut, as well as to study the mechanisms controlling adventitious root formation in black walnut. Clonal propagation systems are ideal to rapidly replicate elite genotypes, assist conservation efforts, and act to complement tree improvement programs. ^ These goals were achieved using a multi-faceted approach. First, an in vitro propagation protocol was developed for elite black walnut genotypes 55 and 189. Nodal cutting explants were aseptically cultured on semi-solid Driver and Kuniyuki walnut (DKW) medium supplemented with 8. 9 µM benzyladenine (BA), 0. 005 µM indole- 3 -butryic acid (IBA), 200 mg L- 1 casein hydrolysate (CH), 50 mg L- 1 adenine hemisulfate (AS), 2 ml L- 1 Plant Preservative Mixture™ (PPM), and 4. 1 µM meta-topolin. This medium resulted in the greatest shoot growth after 8 weeks for both genotypes, 1. 7 and 1. 3 cm respectively. Long-term survival and proliferation of microshoots was achieved when nodal segments of in vitro grown shoots were cultured in liquid initiation medium in 3 L polycarbonate Fernbach-style flasks on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) under a 16 h photoperiod at 25 °C. Elongated microshoots (5 – 7 cm in length) were rooted (40 %) in a slurry-like medium composed of half-strength DKW medium with 0. 11 % (w/v) Phytagel™ and coarse vermiculite (2 : 1, v/v) supplemented with 50 µM IBA for 5 weeks. Rooted microshoots shoots were acclimatized to ambient culture room conditions, but did not survive acclimatization to the greenhouse. ^ Softwood cuttings were used to improve ex vitro propagation and to develop a spatial and temporal timeline of the stages of adventitious root formation. Softwood cuttings (15 – 20 cm) that were collected from juvenile sources of elite genotypes, dipped for 60 s in 93. 2 mM indole- 3 -butyric acid-potassium salt (K-IBA), and then inserted into a moist medium consisting of 3 perlite: 1 coarse vermiculite (v/v) rooted at a 72 % frequency. Rooted cuttings were successfully acclimatized to ambient conditions and continued to grow normally. To visualize anatomical changes during root formation, stems were fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned, and stained on sequential days throughout root development. Anatomical analysis revealed adventitious root initials by day 16 and root primordia formation by day 18. Rooted cuttings survived acclimatization to the greenhouse, and continued to grow normally. ^ Using this timeline as a reference for the when and where the stages of root formation were occurring, gene expression assays of genes known to participate in adventitious root formation were conducted. The basal end (1 – 3 cm) of shoots from juvenile and mature origin, were collected on days 0, 8, 16, and 16; and 26 from mature shoots after treatment with 93. 3 K-IBA or deionized water (control) and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Shoots were serially sectioned using a Cryostat microtome, and cortical, phloem fiber, or phloem parenchyma tissues were isolated using a laser capture microdissection system. RNA was extracted from the samples, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to characterize relative changes during root development. Rooting-related genes displayed a distinct, localized expression pattern during depending on treatment and age. These findings elucidated the factors contributing to the recalcitrance of adventitious root formation in this economically valuable hardwood species, and may contribute to the improvement of clonal propagation of elite black walnut timber genotypes. ...|$|R
