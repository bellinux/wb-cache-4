Guaiacol {{is used as a}} model compound to study the catalytic HDO over Fe/SiO 2 catalyst. Experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reactor operated at 673 K (1 atm) with a gas mixture (guaiacol, H 2, H 2 O, CO, CO 2) that mimics the real gas composition from lignin pyrolysis. Fe/SiO 2 catalyst was shown to be selective for guaiacol HDO into benzene and phenols because it does not catalyze the aromatic ring hydrogenation. Major and minor products are modeled by a semidetailed kinetic mechanism. A deactivation law is also determined. The kinetic model is then included in an Aspen Plus model of lignin to BTX process.

Benzene, Toluene, Ethyl benzene and Xylene (BTEX) are volatiles components of Gasoline that occupational exposures with them cause irreversible effect on the health of people. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the risk arising from occupational exposure of BTEX on workers in Gasoline refueling stations of Mashhad in order to provide guidelines to control them. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 20 refueling station in the Mashhad city in 2012.

40|$|Typically, site {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} by using handheld or transportable field instruments coupled with offsite lab analyses. When using field instruments, the data generated represents a snapshot in time and space. Often, as with a PID or FID, data {{is presented as a}} total of contaminates present at that time and place. More sophisticated field equipment such as GC/MS can provide speciation, but still suffer from poor spatial and temporal resolution. As an alternative, investigators can choose methods such as Summa canisters that sample for a fixed period, say 24 hours, followed by lab analysis. The data generated provides speciation but the concentrations represent an average for the sampling period. Investigators are aware that environmental conditions such as pressure, temperature, water level and air movement substantially affect concentrations on a range of timescales, therefore uncertainty will always exist when using methods that lack temporal resolution.

For tritium recovery as hydrogen, an electrochemical hydrogen pump with a ceramic proton conductor has been proposed.
