25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

He recorded the legend, that the main church in the village was the church of St. Jovan the Baptist, once located near the present cemetery and after its demolition, church of St. Petka became a village temple.

The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt {{the only way to}} make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, [...] "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important." [...] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that [...] "I thought that it was <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> there would be one generation [...] who knew that [...] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".|$|E

5000|$|The role of Tony in {{the film}} reminds me of Jimmy Stewart's in Vertigo. There is a dark side to this character. I think it's <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> most of the {{audience}} prefers {{to think that this}} is a very innocent relationship. These are the good guys, because their spouses are the first ones to be unfaithful and they refuse to be. Nobody sees any darkness in these characters - and yet they are meeting in secret to act out fictitious scenarios of confronting their spouses and of having an affair. I think this happens because the face of Tony Leung is so sympathetic. Just imagine if it was John Malkovich playing this role. You would think, 'This guy is really weird.' It's the same in Vertigo. Everybody thinks James Stewart is a nice guy, so nobody thinks that his character is actually very sick." ...|$|E

50|$|Veles {{is one of}} few Slavic gods {{for which}} {{evidence}} of offerings {{can be found in}} all Slavic nations. The Primary Chronicle, a historical record of the early Eastern Slavic state, is the earliest and most important record, mentioning a god named Volos several times. Many etymologists, however, suppose them two different gods. Here, Volos is mentioned as god of cattle and peasants, who will punish oath-breakers with diseases, the opposite of Perun who is described as a ruling god of war who punishes by death in battle. In the later half of the 10th century, Veles or Volos was one of seven gods whose statues Volodymyr I, Prince of Kyiv had erected in his city. It is <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>that</b> Veles's statue apparently did not stand next to others, on the hill where the prince's castle was, but lower in the city, on the marketplace. Not only does this indicate that Veles was connected with commerce, but it also shows that worship of Perun and Veles had to be kept separate: while it was proper for Perun's shrines to be built high, {{on the top of the}} hill, Veles's place was down, in the lowlands.|$|E
