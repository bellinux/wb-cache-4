50|$|Louis XIV had ambitions {{to develop}} his new colony of New France. This {{was seen as a}} way of funding these efforts. Spearheaded by Minister of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the letters patent {{creating}} the Compagnie de l'Occident were issued in May 1664.

5000|$|Chose <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> {{is opposed}} to chose in action, and denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or {{constructive}} enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the proprietor or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he [...] "has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist {{and at other times}} not subsist", {{as in the case of}} animals ferae naturae ("of a feral nature", or wild). A chose <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, a wife's choses <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> became <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Martha Bethune Baliol was {{a person}} of quality and fortune, as these are esteemed in Scotland. Her family was ancient, and her {{connections}} honourable. She was not fond of specially indicating her exact age, but her juvenile recollections stretched backwards till before the eventful year 1745, and she remembered the Highland clans being <b>in</b> <b>possession</b> of the Scottish capital, though probably only as an indistinct vision. Her fortune, independent by her father's bequest, was rendered opulent {{by the death of}} more than one brave brother, who fell successively in the service of their country, so that the family estates became <b>vested</b> <b>in</b> the only surviving child of the ancient house of Bethune Baliol. My intimacy was formed with the excellent lady after this event, and when she was already something advanced in age.|$|R
