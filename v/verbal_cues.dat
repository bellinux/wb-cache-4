5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow walk down a familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of <b>verbal</b> <b>cues,</b> or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E

Cuing conditions were contrasted with a no-cue control. Symbolic cuing consisted of directing the operators to the appropriate keys throughout the sequence of primary task steps. <b>Verbal</b> <b>cuing</b> consisted of a short instruction displayed on the CRT just prior to the next step. In Experiment I, symbolic cuing proved effective in improving editing accuracy. In Experiment 2, symbolic cuing resulted in reduced early-trial edit-completion time. <b>Verbal</b> <b>cuing,</b> however, was not effective on these tasks in either experiment.

2500|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature is how {{males and females}} process information and then recall what was presented to them. Females tend to remember nonverbal cues and associate {{the meaning of a}} discussion with gestures. Since males follow <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> they react more to the facts and actual words within a discussion to recall what was said, but fluctuations in the speaker's voice helps them maintain the memories. Another difference that sets males and females apart is recalling someone's voice. [...] They tend to recall information they have read, for instance, lists of objects are better recalled for men than women. The only similarity they have is that when emotional words are used or an emotional tone is produced, males and females tend to recall those changes.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to recent}} research, {{there is no}} neural {{evidence}} of statistical language learning in children with autism spectrum disorders. When exposed to a continuous stream of artificial speech, neurotypical children displayed less cortical activity in the dorsolateral frontal cortices (specifically the middle frontal gyrus) as cues for word boundaries increased. However activity in these networks remained unchanged in autistic children, regardless of the <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> provided. This evidence, highlighting the importance of proper Frontal Lobe brain function is {{in support of the}} [...] "Executive Functions" [...] Theory, used to explain some of the biologically related causes of Autistic language deficits. [...] With impaired working memory, decision making, planning, and goal setting, which are vital functions of the Frontal Lobe, Autistic children are at loss when it comes to socializing and communication (Ozonoff, et al., 2004). Additionally, researchers have found that the level of communicative impairment in autistic children was inversely correlated with signal increases in these same regions during exposure to artificial languages. Based on this evidence, researchers have concluded that children with autism spectrum disorders don't have the neural architecture to identify word boundaries in continuous speech. Early word segmentation skills have been shown to predict later language development, which could explain why language delay is a hallmark feature of autism spectrum disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately, Elderspeak {{is based}} on {{stereotypes}} and not actual behaviour of elders because it is used in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. Elderspeak is actually offensive but nursing home residents are no longer offended by these speech patterns because they have claimed it as a normal habit. [...] The use of elderspeak in more [...] “warmth” [...] and lower in a “superiority” dimension when the speaker was a family member and/or friend compared to an unfamiliar. Generally, young adults use an overstated version of elderspeak when addressing impaired older persons. When older adults converse with older people with cognitive impairments, they make speech accommodations {{to a lesser extent}} than young people. They speak more slowly and incorporate more pauses, however they do not use more repetition as young people do. It is possible that older speakers may not accommodate their speech as much in order to avoid seeming patronizing. Research shows that approximately 80% of communication is non verbal. Elderspeak involves communicating to the older adult in a coddling way, which includes non <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> and gestures. An example would be looming over a wheelchair or bed in dominancy, or a pat on the buttocks resembling parent-child touching.|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} different perceptual training approaches {{for the improvement}} of anticipation was examined using a goalkeeping task from European handball that required the rapid prediction of shot direction. Novice participants (N = 60) were assigned equally to four different training groups and two different control groups (a placebo group and a group who undertook no training). The training groups received either (i) explicit rules to guide anticipation; (ii) direction as to the location of the key anticipatory cues provided either just verbally (<b>verbal</b> <b>cueing)</b> or supplemented with color highlighting (color cueing); or (iii) undertook a matching judgment task to encourage implicit learning. Performance of the groups was compared on an anticipation test administered before training, after the training intervention, under a condition involving evaluative stress, and after a 5 -month retention period. The explicit learning, <b>verbal</b> <b>cueing,</b> and implicit learning conditions provided the greatest sustained improvements in performance whereas the group given color cueing performed no better than the control groups. Only the implicit learning group showed performance superior to the control groups under the stress situation. The <b>verbal</b> <b>cueing,</b> color cueing, and implicit learning groups formulated the lowest number of explicit rules related to the critical shoulder cue although the reported use of general cues and rules based on all cues did not differ between any of the groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} how gestural training may facilitate oral reading and reading comprehension of single words. For example, it is not clear whether multi-modal cues such as gesture provide an advantage over <b>verbal</b> <b>cueing</b> alone, or which type of multi-modal cues may be more effective than others in visual-verbal learning. This study examined language learning in healthy volunteers to be able to apply the effective methods for language intervention in individuals with language difficulties. Thirty-two healthy adults were selected to participate in four different learning conditions including <b>verbal</b> alone, visual <b>cue,</b> meaningful gesture, and meaningless gesture. The participants were trained to correlate a verb with the matched nonsense symbol(s). After the 4 training conditions, the participants completed a final comprehensive yes/no verification task. It was predicted that participants would perform most accurately in orally reading novel script that was trained using meaningful gesture, followed by training with the visual tracing <b>cue,</b> then <b>verbal</b> training alone, and finally, verbal plus meaningless gesture. It was also predicted that participants would perform fastest in orally reading novel script that was trained using meaningful gesture, followed by training with the visual tracing <b>cue,</b> then <b>verbal</b> training alone, and finally, verbal plus meaningless gesture. The results of this study did not support the assumption that training with meaningful gestures facilitates learning of visual-verbal associations more than verbal training alone. Also, the assumption that training with a visual tracing gesture would aid learning more than training with the <b>verbal</b> <b>cue</b> alone was not supported by this study. The assumption that training with meaningless gestures would interfere with learning compared to training with the <b>verbal</b> <b>cue</b> only was supported by this study. These results suggest that the addition of a gesture with the verbal production of the word divides the participants 2 ̆ 7 attention between two items rather than one. These results also suggest that the nonsense symbols were vastly unfamiliar and therefore taxing the process of language learning. It would be beneficial for future studies to use the theory of these training tasks with young children who have increased mental flexibility and are better able to learn language when using combined gestures and/or movement with verbal production of words...|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{detection}} of disinterest, deceit can also be observed in a person. Hogan states [...] "when someone is being deceptive their eyes tend to blink a lot more. Eyes act as leading indicator of truth or deception," [...] Both nonverbal and <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> are useful when detecting deception. It is typical {{for people who are}} detecting lies to rely consistently on <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> but this can hinder how well they detect deception. Those who are lying and those who are telling the truth possess different forms of nonverbal and <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> and this {{is important to keep in}} mind. In addition, it is important to note that understanding the cultural background of a person will influence how easily deception is detectable because nonverbal cues may differ depending on the culture. In addition to eye contact these nonverbal cues can consist of physiological aspects including pulse rate as well as levels of perspiration. In addition eye aversion can be predictive of deception. Eye aversion is the avoidance of eye contact. Eye contact and facial expressions provide important social and emotional information.

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that spatial {{attention}} modulates early visual cortex retinotopically, resulting in enhanced processing of external perceptual representations. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the same visual areas are modulated when attention is focused on, and shifted within a working memory representation. In the current fMRI study participants were asked to memorize an array containing four stimuli. After a delay, participants were presented with a <b>verbal</b> <b>cue</b> instructing them to actively maintain the location of one of the stimuli in working memory. Additionally, on a number of trials a second <b>verbal</b> <b>cue</b> instructed participants to switch attention to the location of another stimulus within the memorized representation. Results of the study showed that changes in the BOLD pattern closely followed the locus of attention within the working memory representation. A decrease in BOLD-activity (V 1 -V 3) was observed at ROIs coding a memory location when participants switched away from this location, whereas an increase was observed when participants switched towards this location. Continuous increased activity was obtained at the memorized location when participants did not switch. This study shows that shifting attention within memory representations activates the earliest parts of visual cortex (including V 1) in a retinotopic fashion. We conclude that even in the absence of visual stimulation, early visual areas support shifting of attention within memorized representations, similar to when attention is shifted in the outside world. The relationship between visual working memory and visual mental imagery is discussed in light of the current findings...|$|R
40|$|Balance-recovery {{reactions}} that involve rapid reaching movements to grasp a handrail for support {{can play a}} critical role in preventing falls. To execute these reactions, the central nervous system (CNS) requires visuospatial information (VSI) about the handrail location. However, the urgent need to react rapidly may limit ability to acquire this information after loss of balance occurs. Instead, it appears that the CNS may continually monitor the environment and store salient VSI for use if and when a loss of balance occurs. Age-related deficits in visual attention may impair ability to use grasping reactions to recover balance by impeding the acquisition, processing and storage of required VSI. To counter this problem, we have developed a proximity-triggered handrail cueing system (patent pending) that provides a visual cue (flashing lights) and/or <b>verbal</b> <b>cue</b> (“attention, use the handrail”) so as to attract attention to the handrail. The cueing system comprises light-emitting diodes mounted inside a translucent black railing, speakers inserted into the handrail mounting fixtures, and a photocell that triggers the cueing as the person approaches. To test the system, grasping reactions were evoked as subjects walked along an extended (2 x 6 m) motion platform configured to simulate an office environment (including a stair, handrail and visual distracters). The platform was triggered to move suddenly and unexpectedly when the subject was adjacent to the handrail.
