25|$|At {{the end of}} the First World War {{traffic was}} {{completely}} disorganized. In 1920 freight traffic recovers rapidly with the arrival of motorised barges. The HPLM company (Le Havre-Paris-Lyon-Marseille) operated 30 boats on the Canal du Midi. The Second World War saw a slowdown in traffic due to the shortage of oil but recovery was rapid after the conflict and the traffic reached 110 million tkm. However, the canal suffered from a size too small for later barges with high tonnage. Rail became more and more competitive and road transport also became a second competitor. The Canal du Midi became the third means of transport. Freight traffic ceased in the 1970s. In 1980 there were only two barges (the Bacchus, a wine carrier and the Espérance, a grain carrier) carrying regular traffic between Toulouse and Sète: they definitively ceased their activities in 1989 following the cessation of navigation pronounced by the Prefect of the Region due to drought. In 1991 operation of the canal was assigned to the administration of <b>Voies</b> navigables de France who remain managers today.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{maintenance}} has {{not been}} carried out completely because many players are involved: three regions, six departments, and local collective authorities. None wish to bear the cost of restoration and do not always dare to launch development programs. Platanus (Plane Trees) is a particular source of problems because their roots destroy the banks and the paved cycle paths and their leaves invade the canal. In addition they are weakened by disease (canker of Platanus). The canal is a heavy heritage to maintain and enhance as the manager of French canals, <b>Voies</b> navigables de France (VNF), specializes in the management and maintenance of French canals in a market and commercial economy {{and not in the}} tourism market where the Canal du Midi is located. In addition maintenance costs are higher than in a traditional network because of the age of the canal. Also the operation of the channel generates low levels of earnings. VNF must try to establish local partnerships to develop and maintain the canal since its budget does not allow it to provide the care and supervision of 360km of canals.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile, in the Land of the Pharaohs, whose scanty {{interest}} {{about the}} war was disguised by affected rejoicings at Ottoman successes, the Prophet gallantly took the field, as {{in the days of}} Yúsuf bin Ishák. This time the vehicle of revelation was the learned Shayhk (má? [...] ) Alaysh, who was ordered in a dream by the Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) to announce the victory of the Moslem over the Infidel; and, as the vision took place in Jemádi el-Akhir (June), the first prediction was not more unsuccessful than usual. Shortly afterwards, the same reverend man again dreamt that, seeing two individuals violently quarreling, with <b>voies</b> de fait, he had hastened, like a true believer, to separate and to reconcile them. But what was his surprise when the brawlers proved to be the Sultan and the Czar, the former administering condign personal punishment to his hereditary foe. This, the enlightened Shaykh determined, was a sign that in September the Osmanli would be gloriously triumphant. Nor was he far wrong. The Russians, who had begun the campaign, like the English in India, with a happy contempt both for the enemy and for the elementary rules of war, were struck with a cold fit of caution: instead of marching straight upon and intrenching themselves in Adrianople, they vainly broke their gallant heads against the improvised earthworks of Plevna. And ignorant Europe, marvelling at the prowess of the [...] "noble Turk," [...] ignored the fact that all the best [...] "Turkish" [...] soldiers were Slavs, originally Christians, renegades of old, unable to speak a word of Turkish; preserving their Bosniac family-names, and without one drop of Turkish blood in their veins.

50|$|<b>Voies</b> (Greek: Βοιές) is {{a former}} {{municipality}} in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform {{it is part of}} the municipality Monemvasia, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 215.527 km2. It is on the southern tip of Cape Malea. It is a predominantly agricultural region with a few minor villages and one dominant town. Vatika is the common term for the area, but <b>Voies</b> is used in a more official context, particularly for postal situations. Voion, the genitive plural of <b>Voies,</b> is used for description: for example, to differentiate the village of Agios Nikolaos in <b>Voies</b> from other villages and towns of the same name, one would use Agios Nikolaos Voion. Neapoli is the administrative capital of the municipality, and is also the urban center to the numerous villages that surround the hinterland. In <b>Voies</b> you will find Kastania Cave, one of the most beautiful caves in Europe, with high color and shape density.|$|E

Along the way, she gets advice from the seven guardian spirits of the seven constellations, and reunites the spirits of wild animals with their bodies, sending them properly into the afterlife. In {{the centre of the}} universe is a black hole left by a destroyed planet, around which Iona can see her friends and family, in varying states of distress or peril. As Iona retrieves fragments of the planet, she begins to feel remorseful about her treatment of them. She finds out that <b>Voy</b> had a family and that Eddy, foraging for seasoning mushrooms, was responsible for cutting the hole in the fence through which Pepper found the poisoned mushroom. She finds out that the fox which startled her off the branch was <b>Voy's</b> mate, and watches as Sal finds and brings her body to Hickory, who kills <b>Voy</b> in rage. Iona also realises with alarm that the lantern she dropped has ignited a forest fire, implied to be what killed all the animal spirits Iona meets. Desperate to save her loved ones, Iona subtly manipulates their thoughts, feelings and aspects of nature to minimise their grief and to help them escape. Once all the fragments of the planet are delivered to the black hole, Iona reunites her spirit with her own body, which had been trapped {{in the middle of the}} black hole. Together with <b>Voy's</b> spirit, Iona guides the islanders and the <b>Voy's</b> family to safety on the coast before entering the afterlife herself.|$|R
