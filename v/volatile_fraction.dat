25|$|When saffron is dried {{after its}} harvest, the heat, {{combined}} with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield D–glucose {{and a free}} safranal molecule. Safranal, a volatile oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma. Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's <b>volatile</b> <b>fraction</b> in some samples. A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like. Chemists find {{this is the most}} powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal. Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating pH levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and oxidising agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the influence of fruit ripening on oil quality and volatile compounds in an attempt to establish an optimum harvesting time for Oueslati olives, the minor olive variety cultivated in Tunisia. Our results showed that many analytical parameters, i. e., peroxide value, UV absorbance at 232 – 270  nm, chlorophyll pigments, carotenoids and oleic acid contents decreased during ripening, whilst linolenic acid increased. Free acidity remained practically stable with a very slight rise at the highest maturity index. The volatile compounds emitted by the Oueslati olive oil were characterized and quantified by HS-SPME-GC-EIMS. Twenty-three volatile compounds were identified, mainly aldehydes, sesquiterpenes and esters. The results show variations in the <b>volatile</b> <b>fractions</b> and quality parameters of Oueslati extra virgin olive oil obtained at different olive-ripening stages. Fifteen sesquiterpenes were identified {{for the first time in}} this cultivar, mainly hydrocarbon derivatives, but also oxygenated ones. On the basis of the quality parameters and <b>volatile</b> <b>fractions</b> studied, the best stage of Oueslati olive fruits for oil processing seems to be at ripeness index about 3. 0. Indeed, these results suggested the possibility of using sesquiterpenes for olive authenticity and traceability and demonstrated that the <b>volatile</b> <b>fractions</b> can be used as indicators of the degree of ripening of the olives used to obtain the corresponding virgin olive oils...|$|R

5000|$|In the 19th century, {{refineries}} in the U.S. processed {{crude oil}} primarily {{to recover the}} kerosene.

Today, national and state legislation requires refineries to meet stringent air and water cleanliness standards. In fact, oil companies in the U.S. perceive obtaining a permit to build a modern refinery to be so difficult and costly that no new refineries were built (though many have been expanded) in the U.S. from 1976 until 2014, when the small Dakota Prairie Refinery in North Dakota is set to begin operation. More than half the refineries that existed in 1981 are now closed due to low utilization rates and accelerating mergers.

40|$|Formation and {{evolution}} of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from biogenic VOCs influences the Earth’s radiative balance. We have examined the photo-oxidation and aging of boreal terpene mixtures in the SAPHIR simulation chamber. Changes in thermal properties and chemical composition, deduced from mass spectrometric measurements, were providing information on the aging of biogenic SOA produced under ambient solar conditions. Effects of precursor mixture, concentration, and photochemical oxidation levels (OH exposure) were evaluated. OH exposure {{was found to be}} the major driver in the long term photochemical transformations, i. e., reaction times of several hours up to days, of SOA and its thermal properties, whereas the initial concentrations and terpenoid mixtures had only minor influence. The volatility distributions were parametrized using a sigmoidal function to determine TVFR 0. 5 (the temperature yielding a 50 % particle volume fraction remaining) and the steepness of the volatility distribution.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the five methods on the <b>volatile</b> <b>fraction</b> extract of Lonicera macranthoides. Methods: <b>Volatile</b> <b>fraction</b> from the flower buds of Lonicera macranthoides was obtained by using different extraction methods, HD, SE, MW, US, and CM. The compositions of <b>volatile</b> <b>fraction</b> were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometric and further compared among extraction methods. Results: Extracts obtained by the five methods reveal the qualitative and quantitative diversity in their compositions, especially for the low-content compositions. According to the results, SE shows the great value in the research where the high molecular-mass compound is of primary interest, and MW offers a way for the isolation of specific compound like octadecadienoic acid and hexadecanoic acid. HD, US, and CM have the advantage over SE and MW for the integrity of the constituents, whereas the phenomenon of compound degradation seems not so serious in solvent extraction methods such as US or CM as HD. Additionally, US and CM show superiority over time or material saving and diversity of the constituent. Conclusion: HD is still the best choice for the pure <b>volatile</b> <b>fraction</b> without organic solvent pollution.
