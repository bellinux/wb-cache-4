5|$|Images of trench warfare became iconic {{symbols of}} human {{suffering}} and endurance. The post-war world had many <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> were maimed or damaged by shell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 men were in receipt of pensions for war disabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or eyesight, paralysis or lunacy.|$|E

5|$|As of August 15, VA {{data showed}} {{that the number of}} <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> were waiting more than three months for an {{appointment}} has declined by half since Spring 2014, but the number who wait at least 30 days remains similar. Reported wait times for repeat patients have increased from 3.5 days to nearly 6 days. The VA paid for nearly 200,000 veterans to see private doctors, and average wait time to see a primary care doctor decreased from 51 to 43 days.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} the 6th Brigade– {{consisting}} of the 19th, 36th and 14th/32nd Battalions– was led by Brigadier Raymond Sandover. A Militia formation, it had not previously seen combat as a whole, though one of its infantry battalions– the 36th– had fought in the Battle of Buna–Gona during late 1942 and early 1943. Nevertheless, Sandover and his three battalion commanders were all Australian Imperial Force <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> had taken part in the fighting against the Germans and Italians in North Africa, Greece and Syria during 1941 and 1942. The 36th Battalion was dispatched to Cape Hoskins in early October, and relieved a battalion of the US 158th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|By 1966, Putnam County's {{men began}} {{drafting}} into {{the armed forces}} to fight in the Vietnam War. In November of that year, Local Board No. 14 announced that 21 local men would be drafted into the military, the highest total to be called since the Korean War. Of the 21, two were residents of Patterson. To honor the Patterson <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> lost their lives, a plaque commemorating the Vietnam War was added to the War Memorial by the American Legion at the intersection of NY311 and Maple Avenue.|$|E
5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the adipose (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, 350 veterans, politicians, and {{soldiers}} representing the division went to Normandy and Paris, in France for the 60th {{anniversary of the}} D-Day landings. The Army National Guard organized a major ceremony for the 60th anniversary, {{as many of the}} <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> participated in the invasion were in their 80s at that time, and the 60th anniversary was seen as the last major anniversary of the landings in which a large number of veterans could take part.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. Many such may have preferred to join their fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would thus have grown steadily over time until, after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if not exclusively, citizen units.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E

5|$|The cornerstone, {{located at}} the {{northeast}} corner of the building, bears the dates 1872, the start of construction, and 1878, the year of completion. The stone was opened during ceremonies November 15, 1978, the centennial of the building's completion. Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by moisture, although several coins from the era remained intact. Officials closed and resealed with stone with 38 new items depicting Michigan's history, people, and lifestyles. At the lawn's southeast corner is the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, a 1924-bronze plaque attached to a boulder as a memorial to American Civil War <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> fought for the Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} Allied {{objective was}} Verrières Ridge, a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise. The ridge was invested by battle-hardened German <b>veterans,</b> <b>who</b> had fallen back from Caen and entrenched {{to form a}} strong defensive position. Over the course of six days, substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge. Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine, as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations, resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the American and Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals who had fought against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld. There were 277 recognized guerrilla units out of over a thousand claimed and 260,715 individuals were recognized from nearly 1.3 million claims. These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and <b>veterans</b> <b>who</b> have served for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros.
