50|$|South America as an {{emerging}} market {{has yet to}} see popularization of new purchasing models such as group buying. First intermediaries appeared recently in Brazil with slightly different business models than those proposed in Europe. Notably, the difference is in the way <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> is achieved, as a post-purchase rebate instead of an instant discount, allowing for an immediate buyer's purchase. Major criticism for such model is in the lack of aggregation and unfit differentiation between buyers - those that wish to purchase immediately at any price {{and those that are}} willing to sacrifice time for discounts, eventually costing the vendor potential profits.

40|$|We {{present in}} this work a unified {{approach}} and provide the optimal solution to the pricing problem of option contracts for a supplier of an industrial good {{in the presence of}} spot trading. Specifically, our approach fully and jointly endogenizes the determination of three major characteristics in contract design, namely (i) Sales contracts versus options contracts; (ii) Flat fee versus volume- dependent contracts; and (iii) <b>Volume</b> <b>discounts</b> versus <b>volume</b> premia; combining them together with spot market trading decisions and also the option of delaying production for the seller. We build a model where a supplier of an industrial good transacts with a manufacturer who uses the supplier's product to produce an end good with an uncertain demand. We derive the general non-linear pricing solution for the contracts under information asymmetry of the buyer's production flexibility. We show that confirming industry observations, volume-dependent optimal sales contracts always demonstrate <b>volume</b> <b>discounts</b> (i. e., involve concave pricing). On the other hand the options contracts are more complex agreements, and optimal contracts for them can involve both <b>volume</b> <b>discounts</b> and <b>volume</b> premia. Further, we find that in the optimal contracts, there are three major pricing regimes. First, if the seller has a higher discount rate than the buyer and the production costs are lower than a critical threshold value, the optimal contract is a flat fee sales contract. Second, when the seller is less patient than the buyer but production costs are higher than the critical threshold, the optimal contract is a sales contract with <b>volume</b> <b>discounts.</b> Third, if the buyer has a higher discount rate than the seller, then the optimal contract is a volume-dependent options contract and can involve both <b>volume</b> <b>discounts</b> and <b>volume</b> premia. We further provide links between industry and spot market characteristics, contract characteristics and efficiency. Last, we look into an extension of our basic model, where we give an analysis for the case when the seller is given a last minute production option. by Pamela Pen-Erh Pei. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|The {{most common}} {{licensing}} models are per single user (named user, client, node) or per user {{in the appropriate}} <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> level, while some manufacturers accumulate existing licenses. These open volume license programs are typically called open license program (OLP), transactional license program (TLP), volume license program (VLP) etc. and are contrary to the contractual license program (CLP), where the customer commits to purchase {{a certain number of}} licenses over a fixed period (mostly two years). Licensing per concurrent/floating user also occurs, where all users in a network have access to the program, but only a specific number at the same time. Another license model is licensing per dongle which allows the owner of the dongle to use the program on any computer. Licensing per server, CPU or points, regardless the number of users, is common practice as well as site or company licenses. Sometimes one can choose between perpetual (permanent) and annual license. For perpetual licenses one year of maintenance is often required, but maintenance (subscription) renewals are discounted. For annual licenses, there is no renewal; a new license must be purchased after expiration. Licensing can be host/client (or guest), mailbox, IP address, domain etc., depending on how the program is used. Additional users are inter alia licensed per extension pack (e.g. up to 99 users) which includes the base pack (e.g. 5 users). Some programs are modular, so one will have to buy a base product before they can use other modules.|$|E

Getting an optimal solution with minimum costs (freight cost, warehouse cost) under certain constraints (delivery due date etc.) must be sought. Formerly, we made a mathematical formulation of the fundamental case (a single supply site and a single demand site with multiple delivery dates/different delivery quantities) and next we expanded the objective function from considering transportation costs to considering transportation costs and warehouse stock fees. Under certain constraints, a minimum costs was pursued. In this paper, the objective function is expanded to considering a reduced cost for the volume of lots. Here, a reduced cost of the <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> when multiple lots are transported using {{the same type of}} transport is also taken into account.

40|$|Auction based {{mechanisms}} {{have become}} popular in industrial procurement settings. These mechanisms minimize {{the cost of}} procurement {{and at the same}} time achieve desirable properties such as truthful bidding by the suppliers. In this paper, we investigate the design of truthful procurement auctions taking into account an additional important issue namely carbon emissions. In particular, we focus on the following procurement problem: A buyer wishes to source multiple units of a homogeneous item from several competing suppliers who offer <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> bids and who also provide emission curves that specify the cost of emissions as a function of volume of supply. We assume that emission curves are reported truthfully since that information is easily verifiable through standard sources. First we formulate the <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> procurement auction problem with emission constraints under the assumption that the suppliers are honest (that is they report production costs truthfully). Next we describe a mechanism design formulation for green procurement with strategic suppliers. Our numerical experimentation shows that emission constraints can significantly alter sourcing decisions and affect the procurement costs dramatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort in explicitly taking into account carbon emissions in planning procurement auctions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose an {{innovative}} algorithm for ranking suppliers in the presence of <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> offers, with regard to various criteria, based on super-efficiency analysis. Design/methodology/approach - This paper introduces an innovative approach, which is based on super-efficiency analysis (one of the data envelopment analysis models). Findings - To rank the suppliers in the conditions that they offer volume discounts, an algorithm was introduced. Practical implications - The results of this paper can be applied from both a buyer's and supplier's perspective. The buyer can use it as a tool in ranking the suppliers. The supplier can use these results from a marketing perspective. A specific supplier who achieves a high mean score, when compared to the other suppliers, can use these results for promoting its product. On the other hand, if a particular supplier is poorly performing, then the supplier can use the analysis for benchmarking purposes. This result may mean that the supplier must provide better performance levels at the same input. Originality/value - To the best of the author's knowledge, there is no comprehensive and feasible model that deals with supplier ranking by super-efficiency analysis in the presence of <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> offers.

40|$|Combinatorial auctions {{have been}} used in {{procurement}} markets with economies of scope. Preference elicitation is already a problem in single-unit combinatorial auctions, but it becomes prohibitive even for small instances of multiunit combinatorial auctions, as suppliers cannot be expected to enumerate a sufficient number of bids that would allow an auctioneer to find the efficient allocation. Auction design for markets with economies of scale and scope are much less well understood. They require more compact and yet expressive bidding languages, and the supplier selection typically is a hard computational problem. In this paper, we propose a compact bidding language to express the characteristics of a supplier’s cost function in markets with economies of scale and scope. Bidders in these auctions can specify various discounts and markups on overall spend on all items or selected item sets, and specify complex conditions for these pricing rules. We propose an optimization formulation to solve the resulting supplier selection problem and provide an extensive experimental evaluation. We also discuss the impact of different language features on the computational effort, on total spend, and the knowledge representation of the bids. Interestingly, while in most settings <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> bids can lead to significant cost savings, some types of <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> bids can be worse than split-award auctions in simple settings...|$|E
40|$|Perishable {{supply chain}} trading (PSCT) {{is the process}} of buying, selling, transferring, or exchanging products, services, and/or {{information}} across a perishable supply chain. Perishable products such as flowers, fish and vegetables are traded through Dutch auctions traditionally. However, the limited space of an auction center restricts the capacity of Dutch auctions. This thesis proposes double auction-based solution to match supply and demand in PSCT. Three typical scenarios are investigated. The first scenario considers multi-unit call auctions with <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> bids for PSCT. Two call auctions with <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> bids are designed, i. e., incremental <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> auction (IVDA) and total quantity discount auction (TQDA). Since the winner determination problems in these two auctions are NP-hard, two heuristic algorithms are proposed. Computational analysis is conducted to evaluate the performance of IVDA and TQDA. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed call auctions with <b>volume</b> <b>discount</b> bids improve the market value compared to call auctions with ordinary bids. In the second scenario, multi-unit multi-attribute call auctions are considered for PSCT. Firstly, a single-unit multi-attribute call auction (SMA) mechanism is designed for the multi/single-unit environment under which each buyer bids for multi-unit of one item and each supplier asks for a single unit of one item (i. e., single-output restriction). Then, a multi-unit multi-attribute call auction (MMA) mechanism is designed for the multi-unit exchange environment with a single item by relaxing the single-output restriction. The SMA and MMA mechanisms achieve incentive compatibility (IC), individual rationality (IR) and budget balance (BB). The allocative efficiencies of the proposed mechanisms are examined via simulation. The results show that the SMA and MMA mechanisms realize a desirable level of efficiency. The last scenario considers multi-unit online double auctions for matching supply and demand between suppliers and buyers dynamically in PSCT. At first, a multi-unit online double auction (MODA) mechanism is designed, which consists of a price schedule and a matching rule. Two valid price schedules are suggested, i. e., fixed price and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) price. The MODA mechanism ensures IC, IR, BB and feasible. Then, two fairly truthful and fairly efficient mechanisms are proposed, namely, TV-MODA mechanism and TR-MODA mechanism. Through numerical experiments, the EWMA-price MODA and TV-MODA are found to be suitable for real-world applications. In order to implement the proposed double auctions, a cloud-based auction platform (CAP) is developed. The CAP demonstrates several key contributions. Firstly, a set of facilities is provided to support the operations and decision making of the auction planner, auctioneer, suppliers and buyers. Secondly, cloud computing is adopted to realize “pay-as-you-go” and “pervasive-to-access” deployment. Thirdly, several issues in the design, development and implementation of the CAP are addressed to guarantee scalability, extensibility and usability of the CAP. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
