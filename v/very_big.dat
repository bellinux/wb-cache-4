5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow <b>very</b> <b>big</b> and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

5|$|In his autobiography, Butlin {{recorded}} {{that his}} mother remarried and emigrated to Canada around 1910 and passenger lists of the period show Bertha travelling to Toronto via Montreal in 1912. For two years Butlin, and his cousin Jimmy Hill boarded with a widow in Bristol. In December 1913 his mother returned and married Charles Robotham in Swindon. Butlin's mother and stepfather then asked him to join them in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was unhappy at school in Canada, mocked because of his English accent, and he left school at fourteen. Eventually {{he got a job}} as a messenger boy at Eatons, Toronto's largest department store. One of the best aspects of working for the company was {{that he was able to}} visit their summer camp, which gave him his first taste of a real holiday, indeed a taste of what was to become a <b>very</b> <b>big</b> part of his life.

5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his <b>very</b> <b>big</b> heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{discussion}} in Egyptology concerning whether Apepi also ruled Upper Egypt. There are indeed several objects with the king's name most likely coming from Thebes and Upper Egypt. These include a dagger {{with the name}} of the king bought on the art market in Luxor. There is an axe of unknown provenance where the king is called beloved of Sobek, lord of Sumenu. Sumenu is nowadays identified with Mahamid Qibli, about 24 kilometers south of Thebes and there is a fragment of a stone vessel found in a Theban tomb. For all these objects it is arguable that they were traded to Upper Egypt. More problematic is a block with the king's name found at Gebelein. The block had been taken as evidence for building activity of the king in Upper Egypt and, hence, seen as proof that the Hyksos also ruled in Upper Egypt. However, the block is not <b>very</b> <b>big</b> and many scholars argue today, that it might have reached Gebelein after the looting of the Hyksos capital and is no proof of a Hyksos reign in Upper Egypt.|$|E
25|$|CVR {{transcript}} contains {{details of}} extensive discussion amongst {{the crew members}} about the weather en route and over Kinshasa. First indication of Crew's realization {{of the presence of}} bad weather en route to Kinshasa was evident at 12:37, when the aircraft was between position GURUT and UDRID, over 100 NMs from Kinshasa. The crew got this indication through their on-board weather radar. At 12:38, the crew again discussed the weather when the Captain said that the (radar) beam was clearly showing the clouds. extended communication amongst the crew of extreme bad weather being present at and around Kinshasa and the way to avoid it, is heard on the CVR. The co-pilot exclaimed at 12:45 that the weather return being picked up on their radar was <b>very</b> <b>big.</b> Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E
25|$|The canal in Muncy Creek Township brought {{vast amounts}} of goods that were stored in {{warehouses}} in Port Penn and Muncy. The farmers and industrialists of Lycoming County used these warehouses to store their goods before they were sent south on the canal. The chief exports of the county were hogs, wheat, flour, lumber, dried and salted meats, leather and whiskey. Whiskey was a <b>very</b> <b>big</b> business. At least 13 distilleries in the area produced and out put of 1,200 to 1,500gallons of whiskey a day. Muncy Creek Township also was home to a thriving commercial fishing industry. The dam was an ideal point to catch fish. The bottleneck in the river caused by the dam and canal locks caused the fish to be forced into one easy to reach location. Baskets were placed along the dam and locks and tremendous amounts of fish and eels were easily caught. The dams and locks at Port Penn were destroyed by numerous floods in the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley during the late 1800s. This caused the canal to be abandoned as it {{was replaced by the}} railroads. Port Penn was since faded away. There are several homes in the area, but as a hamlet it no longer exists. Parts of Port Penn have been annexed by the borough of Muncy and others are in Muncy Creek Township. Lycoming College and the Muncy Historical Society have spearheaded an effort to uncover the history of Port Penn.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian {{plan of the}} Spring Campaign, {{elaborated}} by Antal Vetter, {{was that}} the 7th corps, under the lead of András Gáspár, had {{to attract the attention}} of Windisch-Grätz on his troops by making and attack from the direction of Hatvan, while the other three corps (I., II., III.) would encircle the Austrian forces from South West, and cut them from the capital cities (Pest and Buda). According to the plan, the 7th corps had to stay at Hatvan until 5 April, than on 6th it had to reach Bag. The attack on the Austrian forces had to occur on 7 April at Gödöllő, from two directions, while the I. corps would advance to Kerepes, and fell on the Austrians from behind, preventing them to retreat towards Pest. The key of this very risky plan was that the Austrians would not discover the Hungarian movements until they completed the encirclement. This is why on the shoulder of the Hungarian commander of the VIIth Corps, András Gáspár, lied a <b>very</b> <b>big</b> responsibility to lead his troops in a way which will not betray the campaigns strategy. This meant that he had to make the enemy commander who faced him, to think that he is face to face with the whole Hungarian army, distracting his attention about the I., II., and III. Hungarian corps, which in the meanwhile, were advancing towards Gödöllő from South-East. If Gáspár would have failed this task, Windsich-Grätz could been sent huge troops to destroy him, which would have been open before them the way to the interim Hungarian capital, Debrecen.|$|E
25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves. As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically <b>very</b> <b>big</b> and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Shark finning is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E
25|$|Further to the east, {{the canyon}} system runs into Coprates Chasma, {{which is very}} similar to Ius and Tithonium chasmata. Coprates differs from Ius in the eastern end which {{contains}} alluvial deposits and eolian material and like Ius, has layered deposits, although the deposits in the Coprates Chasma are much more well defined. These deposits pre-date the Valles Marineris system, suggesting erosion and sedimentary processes later cut by the Valles Marineris system. Newer data from Mars Global Surveyor suggest that the origin of this layering is either just a succession of landslides, one over another, volcanic in origin, or it may be the bottom of a basin of either liquid or solid water ice suggesting that the peripheral canyons of the Valles Marineris system could have been at one time isolated lakes formed from erosional collapse. Another possible source of the layered deposits could be wind-blown, but the diversity of the layers suggests that this material is not dominant. Note that only the upper layers are thin, while the bottom layers are <b>very</b> <b>big,</b> suggesting that the lower layers were composed of mass wasted rock and the upper layers come from another source. Some of this layering may have been transferred to the floor by landslides in which the layers are kept semi-intact, yet the layered section looks highly deformed with thickening and thinning beds that have multitudes of folds in them as seen in MOC image #8405. This complex terrain could also be just eroded sediment from an ancient Martian lake-bed and appear complex because all that we have is an aerial view like a geologic map and not enough elevation data to see if the beds are horizontal.|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{commercial}} {{performance of}} movie blockbusters at the Australian box office since the 1980 s (the Multiplex Era) and, {{to the extent}} that available data allows, draws comparisons with the performance of big movies before that time.

Although there are now more big films at the Australian box office, the <b>very</b> <b>biggest</b> individual films of the Multiplex Era are generally smaller in cinemas than those of the pre-Multiplex Era. But aggregating the box office for movie franchises, and ranking them by their average box office gross per film, we find half of the top 10 are franchises that started in 1999 or later. More than half the box office earned by the Top 20 franchises has been earned in the 2000 s. We interpret this as evidence of a significant change {{in the nature of the}} story-telling in cinemas. By setting out to tell stories in the cinema by instalment, the most popular cinema of the early 21 st century has been 'televisionized'...|$|R
