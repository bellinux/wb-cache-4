40|$|In this research, a <b>vermicular</b> <b>graphite</b> {{cast iron}} brake drum was {{produced}} by cored wire injection in a one-step method.

Several thermocouples were inserted into the casting in the desired positions to measure the temperature change. By means of one-step cored wire injection, the two residual concentrations of Mg and RE were effectively controlled in the ranges of 0. 013 %- 0. 017 % and 0. 019 %- 0. 025 %, respectively, which are crucial {{for the production of}} <b>vermicular</b> <b>graphite</b> cast iron and the formation of <b>vermicular</b> <b>graphite.</b> In addition, the cooling rate had a significant effect on the <b>vermicular</b> <b>graphite</b> percentage. In the case of the silica mold brake drum casting, there was an obvious difference in the cooling rate with the wall change, leading to a change in <b>vermicular</b> <b>graphite</b> percentage from 70. 8 % to 90 %. In the low-density alumina-silicate ceramic mold casting, no obvious change in temperature was detected by the thermocouples and the percentage of the <b>vermicular</b> <b>graphite</b> was stable at 85 %.

40|$|This article aims at {{measuring}} {{and comparing}} the fatigue strength with fully reversed push-pull {{tests in the}} case of two different cast irons: ductile and <b>vermicular.</b> Spheroidal <b>Graphite</b> Iron (SGI), also known as ductile cast iron, is nowadays used in a very large variety of applications. It represents a valid option when strength and stiffness are required, namely, when high values of tensile strength and Young’s modulus are coupled with appreciable deformation before failure. By contrast, a different cast iron, known as Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) or vermicular cast iron, presents its benefits in replacing SGI with respect to specific applications. In particular, with better castability, machinability and thermal resistance, SGI is ideal when components suffer simultaneous mechanical and thermal loadings, such as cylinder blocks and heads. While SGI benefits of a wide scientific literature, CGI is a relatively unknown material, especially referring to its response under fatigue loads...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} is a non-destructive {{method used}} for strain measurements in crystalline materials. Conversion of strain to stress {{can be achieved}} using the X-ray elastic constants (XEC), s 1  and ½s 2. The sin 2 ψ method was used during in situ loading to determine XEC for flake, <b>vermicular,</b> and spherical <b>graphite</b> iron. A fully pearlitic steel was used as reference. Uniaxial testing {{was conducted on the}} cast iron to create a homogeneous strain field, as well as four-point bending in both tension and compression due to the tension/compression asymmetry. The commonly used XEC value ½s 2  =  5. 81  ×  10 − 6  MPa− 1  is theoretically derived from an α-Fe single crystal. When investigating materials that contain ferrite, such as polycrystalline cast iron, this value is not accurate. Determination of an effective XEC for polycrystalline cast iron yields a better correlation between the measured microstrains and the properties observed on a macroscopic scale. The need for an effective XEC is evident, {{especially when it comes to}} model validation of, for example, casting simulations.

XRD confirmed that the graphitization at 2600 C resulted in a highly graphitic material. The porosity of this foam derives from the loose packing of the <b>vermicular</b> exfoliated <b>graphite</b> particles together with their internal porosity. During the foaming process the pitch tends to coat the outside surface of the expanding graphite flakes. It also bonds them together.

40|$|The {{effects of}} silicon (Si) on the {{mechanical}} properties and fracture toughness of heavy-section {{ductile cast iron}} were investigated to develop material for spent-nuclear-fuel containers. Two castings with different Si contents of 1. 78 wt. % and 2. 74 wt. % were prepared. Four positions in the castings from the edge to the center, with different solidification cooling rates, were chosen for microstructure observation and mechanical properties’ testing. Results show that the tensile strength, elongation, impact toughness and fracture toughness at different positions of the two castings decrease with the decrease in cooling rate. With an increase in Si content, the graphite morphology and the mechanical properties at the same position deteriorate. Decreasing cooling rate changes the impact fracture morphology from a mixed ductile-brittle fracture to a brittle fracture. The fracture morphology of fracture toughness is changed from ductile to brittle fracture. When the Si content exceeds 1. 78 wt. %, the impact and fracture toughness fracture morphology transforms from ductile to brittle fracture.

40|$|Compacted Graphite Iron, (CGI) {{is known}} to have {{outstanding}} mechanical strength and weight-to-strength ratio as compared to conventional grey cast iron, (CI). The outstanding characteristics of CGI is due to its graphite particle shape, which is presented as compacted <b>vermicular</b> particle. The <b>graphite</b> is interconnected with random orientation and round edges, which results in higher mechanical strength. Whereas, graphite in the CI consists of a smooth-surfaced flakes that easily propagates cracks which results in weaker and brittle properties as compared to CGI.
