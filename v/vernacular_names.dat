5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture.

25|$|Cucumeropsis mannii is {{a member}} of the Cucurbitaceae family. <b>Vernacular</b> <b>names</b> for this crop include egusi-itoo and white seed melon. This crop is often {{referred}} to as “the real egusi” given its long history in West Africa, dating back 4,000 years. This crop is primarily harvested for its large white seeds called egusi-itoo. The seeds are commonly processed into soups and oil products, and are also eaten individually as a snack. Benefits of Cucumeropsis mannii crops are many. The crop thrives in harsh climates and high yields are attainable in barren landscapes. Pests and disease are rarely a problem for farmers of this crop. Further benefits include increased soil quality through ground cover and suppression of weeds. This crop also holds significant nutritional value. Oil makes up 44% of the seed, where 30% is protein rich in essential amino acids. The seed is an excellent vegetable protein, and is ideal for battling nutritional debilitations. High in essential vitamins and minerals, egusi-itoo compliments the starch and grain diet of most Africans. Despite the crops obvious advantages, Cucumeropsis mannii remains an underutilized tool for nutritional intervention in Africa.|$|E
