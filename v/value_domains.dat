The {{representation}} term (and typically the corresponding data type term) comprise a taxonomy for the <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> within a data set. This taxonomy is the representation class. Thus the representation term {{can be used to}} control proliferation of <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> by ensuring equivalent <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> use the same representation term.|$|E

50|$|The common {{approach}} {{when working with}} FMC is {{to start with a}} high-level diagram of the compositional structure of a system. This “big picture” diagram serves as a reference in the communication with all involved stakeholders of the project. Later on, the high-level diagram is iteratively refined to model technical details of the system. Complementary diagrams for processes observed in the system or <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> found in the system are introduced as needed.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to induce self-affirmation is to have {{participants}} write about a personally relevant value. In order to do this, participants rank a list of values from most important to least important to them. The list typically includes the following <b>value</b> <b>domains,</b> business, art/music/theater, social life/relationships, science/pursuit of knowledge, religion/morality, and government/politics. Participants then write about the value they ranked as most important and how it is meaningful to them for 10 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The joint ISO/UN Core Components Technical Specification {{formally}} define {{both the}} allowed set of representation terms {{and the corresponding}} set of data types. ISO 15000-5 is an implementation layer of ISO 11179 and normatively expresses {{a set of rules}} to semantically define conceptual and physical/logical data models {{for a wide variety of}} uses. In ISO 15000-5, the representation term provides a mechanism to harmonize the <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> of candidate data elements before being added to the overall data model(s). ISO 15000-5 is being used by a number of government, standards development organizations, and private sector as the basis for data modeling.|$|E

5000|$|The {{different}} possible {{representations of}} a data element concept are then described {{with the use}} of one or more data elements. Differences in representation may be a result of the use of synonyms or different <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> in different data sets in a data holding. A value domain is the permitted range of values for a characteristic of an object class. An example of a value domain for [...] "sex of person" [...] is [...] "M = Male, F = Female, U = Unknown". The letters M, F and U are then the permitted values of sex of person in a particular data set.|$|E
5000|$|The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values Scale [...] {{is another}} {{measures}} that is administered to participants to induce self-affirmation in the laboratory. Participants {{choose one of}} two answers after reading a statement about a value. An example item from the religion scale would be “The more important study for mankind is (a) mathematics (b) theology”. This allows researchers to see where an individual’s personal interests and values lie. It is thought that answering questions about a value domain that they find important will make that value more salient to them, resulting in self-affirmation. There are six different <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> on the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values scale: religion, theoretical, aesthetic, political, social, and economic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary market}} for domain name {{speculation}} covers newly registered domain names {{that have not}} been registered before. Such domain names are often linked to news and current events. The launch of a new TLD encourages primary market speculation as domainers rush to register generic terms and also phrases that make a pun on the TLD name (domain hack). Other more organised domainers or domain name speculators register trademarks in advance of the launch of new TLDs specifically in order to register these short, memorable and potentially high <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> in the sunrise period of new gTLD launches. The Sunrise period is when intellectual property rights owners (trademark owners etc.) can register their trademark in the new gTLD in advance of the gTLD being opened for general registrations. In the last three years the main new TLDs launched were [...]eu ccTLD, [...]mobi TLD and [...]asia sTLD. All of these had landrush periods of varying success.|$|E

5000|$|International {{standards}} {{apply to}} metadata. Much {{work is being}} accomplished in the national and international standards communities, especially ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) to reach consensus on standardizing metadata and registries. The core metadata registry standard is ISO/IEC 11179 Metadata Registries (MDR), the framework for the standard is described in ISO/IEC 11179-1:2004. A new edition of Part 1 is in its final stage for publication in 2015 or early 2016. It has been revised to align with the current edition of Part 3, ISO/IEC 11179-3:2013 which extends the MDR to support registration of Concept Systems.(see ISO/IEC 11179). This standard specifies a schema for recording both the meaning and technical structure of the data for unambiguous usage by humans and computers. ISO/IEC 11179 standard refers to metadata as information objects about data, or [...] "data about data". In ISO/IEC 11179 Part-3, the information objects are data about Data Elements, <b>Value</b> <b>Domains,</b> and other reusable semantic and representational information objects that describe the meaning and technical details of a data item. This standard also prescribes the details for a metadata registry, and for registering and administering the information objects within a Metadata Registry. ISO/IEC 11179 Part 3 also has provisions for describing compound structures that are derivations of other data elements, for example through calculations, collections {{of one or more}} data elements, or other forms of derived data. While this standard describes itself originally as a [...] "data element" [...] registry, its purpose is to support describing and registering metadata content independently of any particular application, lending the descriptions to being discovered and reused by humans or computers in developing new applications, databases, or for analysis of data collected in accordance with the registered metadata content. This standard has become the general basis for other kinds of metadata registries, reusing and extending the registration and administration portion of the standard.|$|E
30|$|Although the {{findings}} of this study help to assure extensive evidence on the relationship between universalism <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> and cognitive/affective aspects of subjective well-being, the insignificant relationship between other personal values with subjective well-being in this study has to be taken into consideration. However, according to Bobowik et al. (2011), values deserve special attention and consideration in research into well-being, because personal growth-related values can indeed make us happier. Thus, Bobowik and colleagues have suggested that in order to examine the relationship in more detail, it may be advisable to include measurements of eudemonic well-being. The eudemonic perspective of well-being may be more strongly associated with <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> (Bobowik et al. 2011). Future research should examine this issue in order to shed more light on the relationship between personal <b>value</b> <b>domains</b> and subjective well-being in international education.|$|E

40|$|We are {{investigating}} and applying a semantically enhanced query answering machine {{for the needs}} of addressing semantically meaningful data and operations within a scientific information system. We illustrate a context based querying paradigm {{on the basis of a}} Regional Avalanche Information and Forecasting System - RAIFoS which is concerned with the collection and analysis of snow and weather related physical parameters in the Swiss Alps. The querying paradigm relies upon the issue of interactively constructing a semantically valid query rather than formulating one in a database specific query language and for a particular implementation model. In order to achieve this goal, the query answering machine has to make inferences concerning the properties and <b>value</b> <b>domains,</b> as well as data analysis operations, which are semantically valid within particular contexts. These inferences take place when the intended query is being constructed interactively on a Web-based blackboard. A graph-based display presentation formalism is used with elements including natural language terms, measurement units, statistical quantifiers and/or specific <b>value</b> <b>domains.</b> A meta-data database is used to organise and provide the elements of the graph each time the graph, and consequently the intended query, is expanded or further refined. Finally, the displayed graph is transformed into elements of the implementation model from which, in turn, SQL statements and/or sequences of statistical operations are created. ...|$|E
