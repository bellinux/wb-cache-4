25|$|Because older {{versions}} of DOS could mistake LFN {{names in the}} root directory for the <b>volume</b> <b>label,</b> VFAT was designed to create a blank <b>volume</b> <b>label</b> in the root directory before adding any LFN name entries (if a <b>volume</b> <b>label</b> did not already exist).|$|E
25|$|Hard disk {{controllers}} (IBM 2844, 3830, among others, and compatibles) {{accept the}} X'02' command, but first cause a seek to cylinder X'0000', and head X'0000', and {{a search for}} record X'01', before executing the sequential read command {{as if it was}} a X'06'. Without this special hard disk controller behavior, device independent IPL would not be possible. On a hard drive, the IPL Text is contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'01' (24 bytes), and cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'02' (fairly large, certainly somewhat more than 3,000 bytes). The <b>volume</b> <b>label</b> is always contained on cylinder X'0000', track X'0000', and block X'03' (80 bytes). The <b>volume</b> <b>label</b> always points to the VTOC, with a pointer of the form HHHH (that is, the VTOC must reside within the first 65,536 tracks). The VTOC's Format 4 DSCB defines the extent (size) of the VTOC, so the <b>volume</b> <b>label</b> only needs a pointer to the first track in the VTOC's extent, and as the Format 4 DSCB, which describes the VTOC, is always the very first DSCB in the VTOC, HHHH also points to the Format 4 DSCB.|$|E
25|$|VFAT Long File Names (LFNs) {{are stored}} on a FAT file system using a trick—adding (possibly multiple) {{additional}} entries into the directory before the normal file entry. The additional entries are {{marked with the}} <b>Volume</b> <b>Label,</b> System, Hidden, and Read Only attributes (yielding 0x0F), which is a combination that is not expected in the MS-DOS environment, and therefore ignored by MS-DOS programs and third-party utilities. Notably, a directory containing only volume labels is considered as empty and is allowed to be deleted; such a situation appears if files created with long names are deleted from plain DOS. This method {{is very similar to}} the DELWATCH method to utilize the volume attribute to hide pending delete files for possible future undeletion since DRDOS6.0 (1991) and higher. It is also similar to a method publicly discussed to store long filenames on Ataris and under Linux in 1992.|$|E
