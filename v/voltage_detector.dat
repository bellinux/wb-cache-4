50|$|Thermal Conductivity {{detector}} (TCD), {{this common}} detector {{relies on the}} thermal conductivity of matter passing around a tungsten -rhenium filament with a current traveling through it. In this set up helium or nitrogen serve as the carrier gas because of their relatively high thermal conductivity which keep the filament cool and maintain uniform resistivity and electrical efficiency of the filament.
