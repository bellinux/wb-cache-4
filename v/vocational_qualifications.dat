Primary education is available at Stanley, RAF Mount Pleasant (for children of service personnel) {{and a number of}} rural settlements. Secondary education is only available in Stanley, which offers boarding facilities and 12 subjects to General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) level.

5|$|Scotland's {{universities}} are complemented {{in the provision}} of Further and Higher Education by 43 Colleges. Colleges offer National Certificates, Higher National Certificates and Higher National Diplomas. These Group Awards, alongside Scottish <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications,</b> aim to ensure Scotland's population has the appropriate skills and knowledge to meet workplace needs. In 2014, research reported by the Office for National Statistics found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in {{the world in terms of}} tertiary education attainment, with roughly 40% of people in Scotland aged 16–64 educated to NVQ level 4 and above. Based on the original data for EU statistical regions, all four Scottish regions ranked significantly above the European average for completion of tertiary-level education by 25- to 64-year-olds.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to review the role of {{government}} in the current trends of <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system for building life learning society in Japan and to provide useful suggestions for the future directions to develop <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system in Korea. The vocational education and training system of Japan has been operated on the basis of ministry of education(Munbuso) and ministry of labor(Nodouso) is reponsible for human resource development. But there has not been any partnerships between them to operate vocational education and training. Recently, Japan has been tried to actualize lifelong learning society at large. So ministry of education and ministry labor have supported and developed it's own <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system toward the lifelong learning society. In relation to that, they begin to take little partnerships and form a loose alliance. This is reason why lifelong learning society needs strong links between general and vocational education, vocational education and vocational training learning and work. Nevertheless, Japan's dual <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system is limited for actualizing lifelong learning society. Korea's vocational education and training system and <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system are similar with those of Japan. So, it is necessary for us to understand the implications of the current trends of <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system in Japan to build and develop <b>vocational</b> <b>qualification</b> system toward lifelong learning society...|$|R

25|$|At {{the eighteenth}} Inter-Sessional CARICOM Heads of Government Conference in February, {{it was agreed}} that {{artisans}} would not be immediately granted free movement status from January (as was originally envisaged), but would rather be granted free movement by mid-2007. The free movement of artisans will be facilitated through the award of Caribbean <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications</b> (CVQ) based on industrial occupational standards. The conference also agreed that the free movement of domestic workers and hospitality workers could be facilitated in a similar manner to the free movement of artisans and that their cases would be considered after the CVQ model is launched. The CVQ itself was launched in October 2007, thereby facilitating the free movement of these categories of workers.|$|E

25|$|Region-wide {{accreditation}} {{has also}} been planned for vocational skills. Currently local training agencies award National <b>Vocational</b> <b>Qualifications</b> (NVQ) or national Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) certification, which are not valid across Member States. However, in 2003, the Caribbean Association of National Agencies (CANTA) was formed as an umbrella organization of the various local training agencies including Trinidad and Tobago's National Training Agency, the Barbados TVET Council and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States TVET agency and the HEART Trust/NTA of Jamaica. Since 2005, the member organizations of CANTA have been working together to ensure a uniformed level of certified skilled labour under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) and CANTA itself has established a regional certification scheme that awards the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ), which is to replace NVQs and national TVET certifications. The CVQ will be school-based and although based on the certification scheme of CANTA, will be awarded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) which will be collaborating with CANTA on the CVQ programme. At the February 9–10, 2007 meeting of the Regional Coordinating Mechanism for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, officials discussed arrangements for the award of the CVQ which {{was approved by the}} Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) in October 2006. It was expected that the CVQ programme may be in place by mid-2007, if all the requirements are met and that provisions were being made for the holders of current NVQs to have them converted into the regionally accepted type (although no clear mandate is yet in place). This deadline was met and in October 2007, the CVQ programme was officially launched. The CVQ now facilitates the movement of artisans and other skilled persons in the CSME. This qualification will be accessible to persons already in the workforce as well as students in secondary schools across the Caribbean region. Those already in the work force will be required to attend designated centres for assessment.|$|E
