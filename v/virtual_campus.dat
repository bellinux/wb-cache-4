500|$|In the 1997 legislature, Patton {{began his}} mission of {{reforming}} the state's system of higher education. Noting that the state's community colleges, {{under the control}} of the University of Kentucky, and technical schools, {{under the control of}} the state government, were too often competing with each other in the same community, he proposed removing the community colleges from the university's control. Part of the plan was upgrading the technical schools to colleges, allowing them to award associate's degrees, not just diplomas and certificates. Control of the community and technical colleges would be invested in a new entity, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. Patton believed that severing the community colleges from the University of Kentucky would allow the university to reallocate resources toward becoming a [...] "Top 20" [...] research university in the nation. The plan also charged the University of Louisville with becoming a nationally recognized urban university. The state's Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) would help eliminate duplication of programs among the colleges and oversee the improvements in the state's two major universities. In addition, the CPE was to oversee the formation of a [...] "Commonwealth Virtual University" [...] that would serve as a clearinghouse for all the distance learning opportunities offered by the colleges and universities of Kentucky. The new CPE president, , appointed former University of Kentucky engineering faculty and then Databeam Corp. co-founder Lee T.

40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>campuses</b> are {{gradually}} becoming a reality with the advances in e-learning and Web technologies, distributed systems and broadband communication, {{as well as}} the emerging needs of remote Universities for collaboration on offering common programs. The advances in grid-based distributed infrastructures have further significantly contributed to this fact providing optimized and real-time system performance and support for virtual communities even under synchronous distributed multi-user usage contexts executing complex simulations in virtual lab applications.

40|$|The present paper aims to {{identify}} {{some of the}} weaknesses in the IT area that {{have contributed to the}} current financial crisis. At the same time, the crisis impact over the IT&C industry is analysed. Some case studies are introduced: credit risk evaluation software applications with low performance are one of the main causes for the collapse in the loan market, while investments in software applications for <b>virtual</b> <b>campuses</b> have the potential to contribute to the recovery as they reduce costs. Therefore, the IT&C is presented from two opposite perspectives: a factor that contributed to the on-going economic turmoil and an important tool in the recovery process. In the economic recovery plan designed by the European Union, an important place is dedicated to the investments in IT&C networks, in the Research & Development area or {{in the development of the}} global commerce as companies can make profit from every opportunity that appears on the market. Under these circumstances, the authors design a set of performance metrics that are meant to quantify the efficiency of software applications. The concluion is that the existence of performant information systems with high quality metrics and user-friendly interfaces undoubtly leads to an improvement in the economic pressure factors that characterize the crisis. economic crisis, IT, <b>virtual</b> <b>campuses,</b> credit risk evaluation applications, metrics...|$|R
