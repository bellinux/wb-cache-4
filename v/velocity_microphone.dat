40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explores the effect of {{humidity}} on measurements of ensemble averaged surface normal impedance of material by means of pressurevelocity sensor (pu-sensor).

Cold helium/air jets are used to easily and inexpensively simulate the low densities of hot air jets. The experiments are conducted at low Reynolds numbers in order to facilitate study of the large-scale turbulent structures (instability waves) that cause most of the radiated noise.

40|$|Conventional {{particle}} <b>velocity</b> <b>microphones</b> (see Olson, 1957) are {{not readily}} available, are expensive, fragile and large, {{so they are}} not commonly used in biological research, though their use in one situation where the source is highly reactive, the recording of Drosophila song, is now standard practice. Here, the particle velocity produced by the fly is far louder than the sound pressure, so high quality recordings {{can be made with}} minimal sound insulation (see Bennet-Clark, 1971; Bennet-Clark, Leroy & Tsacas, 1980). The microphones {{can also be used to}} localize sources of echoes and to measure other reactive conditions. The present design was developed as an alternative to the fragile aluminum-ribbon microphones used previously (Bennet-Clark, 1973) and has the advantages of low cost, small size, robustness and a broad frequency response. The transducer is an electret membrane open on both sides to the sound wave. The resonant frequency of the electret unit is at the top of the practical frequency range of the microphone (16 — 17 kHz).

40|$|Jet noise {{measurements}} have been acquired at many anechoic jet-facilities around the world. These measurements {{have been used}} to form the basis for prediction schemes and to understand the generation and radiation of jet noise. Often, when jet {{noise measurements}} from different jet-facilities that are thought to be acquired at or corrected to similar conditions are compared, differences are observed in the spectra. These comparisons are typically performed {{on the basis of the}} same nozzle-exit diameter, jet <b>velocity,</b> <b>microphone</b> distance from the jet flow, and ambient conditions. This phenomenon has spurred much discussion in the aeroacoustics community, with some even claiming that some of the measurements are contaminated with rig-noise. This study investigates following four factors that can be responsible for the differences in jet noise measurements: (1) rig noise contamination, (2) the jet’s Reynolds number, (3) the nozzle-exit boundary layer of the jet, and (4) reflections and shielding from surfaces inside the anechoic jet-facility. First, the Doubling-Diameter Method, a scheme used to detect rig-noise contamination in jet-noise measurements, is verified and used on jet noise measurements acquired in the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) Anechoic Jet-Facility to verify the cleanliness of the jet noise measurements. Second, the effect of Reynolds number of the jet is investigated qualitatively and quantitatively for its effect on jet noise measurements. Third, the effect of the nozzle-exit boundary layer on jet noise measurements is categorized qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, a potential correction is developed that can be used to account for the differences in jet noise measurements from jets with different nozzle-exit boundary layer states. Finally, surfaces inside the anechoic chamber itself, such as, the plenum chamber, and a secondary nozzle are investigated as potential reflectors and shields that can cause waviness and modifications in the jet noise spectra, respectively.

40|$|A request on {{ventilation}} systems {{today is the}} feature of a low noise level. A common method to attenuate ventilation noise is to use passive silencers. However, such silencers are not suitable for the lowest frequencies and one solution is to use active noise control (ANC) to increase the noise attenuation in the low frequency range. Normally when using a feedforward ANC system to attenuate duct noise, both the reference microphone and the error microphone are exposed to airflow. As the airflow excites the diaphragm of the microphones, the microphone signals become contaminated by uncorrelated pressure fluctuations that {{are not part of}} the sound propagating in the duct. By reducing the flow <b>velocity</b> around the <b>microphones,</b> these uncorrelated pressure fluctuations can be reduced and the noise reduction improved. One way to reduce the flow <b>velocity</b> around the <b>microphones</b> is to place the microphones in outer microphone boxes connected to the duct via a small slit. In this paper a new practical design for the reduction of flow <b>velocity</b> around the <b>microphones</b> is presented; the microphone installation is based on a T-duct, and therefore it makes maintenance and especially construction easier, compared to the microphone box with a slit. Furthermore, comparative results concerning the performance of an ANC system for the two different microphone installations, the T-duct configurations and the microphone boxes with varying slit width, are presented. The results show that the active noise control performance is almost equal when using the suggested microphone installation as compared to when using a microphone box with a slit...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain access to mating partners, male Drosophila melanogaster produce complex {{multi-modal}} behaviours during courtship, signalling intention and quality by means of multiple communication signals. An integral part of male courtship behaviour is the production of species-specific 'love songs', acoustic signals consisting of trains of pulses (pulse song) interspersed with sinusoidal humming (sine song). Females receive these songs and other signals and ultimately decide whether the males' courtship is effective or futile. Despite nearly one hundred years of research on the courtship behaviour, little is known about what constitutes successful courtship in general and successful song in particular. To investigate whether differences in spatial and acoustic courtship between copulating and non-copulating males exist, a method was developed to synchronously record the visual and acoustic components of complete courtship sequences. An array of four miniature particle <b>velocity</b> <b>microphones</b> in combination with video recordings was used, and tracking of individual animals and computational processing of the results allowed for the creation of large datasets characterising the spatio-temporal and acoustic actions of the flies at all times. These datasets were used to establish the songs' spectro-temporal characteristics for entire courtship sequences. Successful males differ from unsuccessful ones in producing shorter song pulses and higher-pitched sine songs. Drosophila proxemics - the description of how courting pairs structure their space - shows that social space is sexually dimorphic, and that unsuccessful males exhibit an increased intersexual distance during pulse song production. Furthermore, accurate measurements and calculations of the absolute intensity of songs were performed to quantify them as they are produced by the male's wing and received by the female's ears. Drosophila courtship is a combination of complex behaviours and this work establishes that {{it is not only the}} male's song that is important for success, but also his proxemics.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of novel measurement approaches to estimate surface velocity, radiation efficiency and transmission loss of panel structures. These approaches are based on the estimates of the auto and cross spectral densities of the sound pressures measured by two closely spaced microphones. Some of these approaches involve the use of the recently developed two microphone acoustic intensity technique, which is reviewed extensively. ^ A two <b>microphone</b> <b>velocity</b> technique was developed and used to measure the acoustic velocity of a point source. Excellent agreement is obtained between velocities estimated by use of this technique and that measured by a single microphone (yielding the exact velocity), up to a frequency above which the finite difference error becomes significant. This error is well predicted, for a point source. ^ This technique is also used to estimate the surface velocity of an aluminum panel. Fair agreement is obtained between the measured and predicted difference in surface velocities measured by use of accelerometer and a two microphone probe. Near the panel coincidence region the two <b>microphone</b> <b>velocity</b> technique is quite sensitive to the probe orientation and a small misalignment can result in a significant overestimate in the surface velocity. ^ The radiation efficiency of the aluminum panel is estimated in the case of acoustic and mechanical excitations. The radiation efficiency is estimated accurately for subpanel critical frequencies from the aforementioned surface velocities and the radiated intensity measured by use of the two microphone acoustic intensity technique. ^ A statistical energy analysis approach is developed to determine the dissipation loss factor of a panel structure. Good agreement is obtained between this approach and a conventional approach. A new approach based on the two microphone acoustic intensity technique and the use of only one reverberation room is developed to determine panel transmission loss. Good agreement is found with both theory and the conventional method for several different panel structures. This approach is also used successfully to identify areas of different levels of intensity transmitted through a composite panel. ...|$|R

Besides, a proper assessment {{of the degree of}} spatial accuracy is requested during sound reproduction inside 3 D listening rooms, initially designed for acoustical virtual reality, but nowadays being employed also in the entertainment/cinema industry (Immsound, Auro- 3 D, NHK 22. 2). Normally, only monoaural or binaural measurements are performed, by means of omni-directional microphones and dummy heads, even though international standards like ISO 3382 / 1 : 2009 require measuring some spatial parameters (i. e.

The former was measured with a Wheatstone net, the latter produced a periodic voltage which was amplified and measured with a tuned galvanometer.

40|$|A very ambitious {{study was}} {{initiated}} to obtain detailed acoustic and flow data {{with and without}} a liner in a duct containing a mean flow so that available theoretical models of duct liners can be validated. A unique flow-duct facility equipped with a sound source, liner box, flush-walled microphones, traversable microphones and traversable pressure and temperature probes was built. A unique set of instrumentation boxes equipped with computer controlled traverses were designed and built that allowed measurements of Mach number, temperature, SPLs and phases in two planes upstream of a liner section and two planes downstream at {{a large number of}} measurement points. Each pair of planes provided acoustic pressure gradients for use in estimating the particle <b>velocities.</b> Specially-built <b>microphone</b> probes were employed to make measurements {{in the presence of the}} flow. A microphone traverse was also designed to measure the distribution of SPLs and phases from the beginning of the liner to its end along the duct axis. All measurements were made with the help of cross-correlation techniques to reject flow noise and/or other obtrusive noise, if any. The facility was designed for future use at temperatures as high as 1500 F. In order to validate 2 -D models in the presence of mean flow, the flow duct was equipped with a device to modify boundary layer flow on the smaller sides of a rectangular duct to simulate 2 -D flow. A massive amount of data was acquired for use in validating duct liner models and will be provided to NASA in an electronic form. It was found that the sound in the plane-wave regime is well behaved within the duct and the results are repeatable from one run to another. At the higher frequencies corresponding to the higher-order modes, the SPLs within a duct are not repeatable from run to run. In fact, when two or more modes have the same frequency (i. e., for the degenerate modes), the SPLs in the duct varied between 2 dB to 12 dB from run to run. This made the calibration of the microphone probes extremely difficult at the higher frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Low {{noise level}} is an {{essential}} feature when installing ventilation systems nowadays. The traditional noise control approaches use passive silencers to attenuate the undesired ventilation noise. These silencers have a high attenuation over a broad frequency range. However, traditional passive silencers are ineffective at low frequencies and tend to be relatively large and bulky when they are used for low frequencies. An approach to improve the low frequency noise attenuation and {{to reduce the size}} of a low frequency silencer is active noise control (ANC). A problem when applying ANC to attenuate noise in ducts is that both the reference microphone and the error microphone are placed in an air flow. Accordingly, the microphones sense the sound propagating through the duct as well as the turbulent fluctuations generated by the wind passing over the microphones. The turbulent flow noise reduces the coherence between the reference microphone and the error microphone, resulting in reduced performance of a feedforward ANC system. For improving the performance it is important with as little corruption from turbulent flow noise as possible. The coherence can be improved by reducing the flow <b>velocity</b> around the <b>microphones</b> by using some kind of windscreen. This paper presents comparison results for microphone installations based on different windscreens for suppression of the turbulent wind noise. The presented measurements are carried out in the frequency range 0 - 400 Hz - the plane wave propagation region for the ducts in use - and for flow speeds up to 5, 9 m/s. The results show that with appropriate screens and placement the attenuation and frequency range of attenuation can be significantly improved...|$|R
40|$|Experimental aeroacoustic {{research}} was conducted on a wind turbine specific airfoil at low Reynolds numbers. The goal of this thesis was to study trailing edge noise generation from the airfoil and investigate correlations between the noise and the flow field. Before experiments were performed the current wind tunnel had to be modified {{in order to make}} it more suitable for aeroacoustic tests. Sound absorbing foam was added to the inside of the tunnel to lower the background noise levels and turbulence reduction screens were added which lowered the turbulence. An S 822 airfoil was chosen because it is designed for low Reynolds flows attainable in the wind tunnel which are on the order of 104. Smoke wire flow visualization was used to gain insight into the airfoil wake development and oil film flow visualization was used to qualitatively assess the boundary layer development. Laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) was used to measure two components of velocity at high data rates in the airfoil wake. Wake profiles were measured in addition to single point measurements to determine the <b>velocity</b> spectrum. A <b>microphone</b> was mounted inside the test section in order to measure the trailing edge noise. Initial plans included measuring the trailing edge noise with a microphone array capable of quantifying and locating noise sources. Although an array was built and beamforming code was written it was only used in preliminary monopole source tests. Oil film results showed the behaviour of the boundary layer to be consistent with previous low Reynolds number experiments. LDA results revealed sharp peaks in the velocity spectra at 1100 Hz from U 0 = 15 – 24 m/s, and 3100 and 3800 Hz, from U 0 = 25 – 35 m/s, which were inconsistent with vortex shedding results of previous researchers. Also present were a series of broad peaks in the spectra that increase from 1200 – 1700 Hz in the U 0 = 25 – 35 m/s range. The shedding frequency from the smoke wire flow visualization was calculated to be 1250 Hz at U 0 = 26 m/s. These sharp peaks were also present in the acoustic spectrum. It was reasoned that these peaks are due to wind tunnel resonance which is a common occurrence in hard wall wind tunnels. In particular the tone at 1100 Hz is due to a standing wave with a wavelength equal to half the tunnel width. The shedding frequency from the smoke wire flow visualization was calculated to be 1100 Hz at U 0 = 20 m/s. These tones exhibited a “ladder-like” relationship with freestream velocity, another aspect indicative of wind tunnel resonance. It was reasoned that the wind tunnel resonance was forcing the shedding frequency of the airfoil in the U 0 = 15 – 24 m/s range, and in the U 0 = 25 – 35 m/s range, the shedding frequency corresponded to the broad peaks in the LDA spectra...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{particular}} thermal flow sensor, the Microflown, is studied. By {{virtue of its}} property {{to be sensitive to}} particle velocity, the physical quantity associated with sound, the sensor is especially used for sound intensity measurements. It is endeavoured to physically understand the behaviour of the Microflown and to give an adequate description of its sensitivity. The purpose of the presented analytic model is to deduce an explicit expression for the temperature difference between the two heated wires of the sensor due to an imposed particle velocity, to which the output signal is proportional. This is achieved by finding first the temperature distribution around the heated wires from the heat diffusion equation. This stationary temperature profile is altered slightly, asymmetrically, due to the forced convection of an acoustic wave. It is shown that this particle velocity can be described by a small perturbation term added to the heat equation to obtain an expression for the resulting temperature difference of the wires. The thus obtained sensitivity function is seen to be well characterised by two important characteristic frequencies, a ‘thermal’ frequency, and a second corner frequency related to the heat capacity of the wires. Another important property of this function is its value at zero frequency. An explicit expression for this low frequency sensitivity is found, allowing a good description and consequently optimisation of the sensor for the measurement of steady flows. The model is verified by acoustic measurements on many sensors of varying geometries and a satisfying correspondence between theory and measurement is found. Since the Microflown is mainly used for sound intensity measurements, an overview of the different principles that can be applied to measure sound intensity is given, methods based on particle <b>velocity</b> sensors, pressure <b>microphones</b> or a combination of them. The measurement principle that seems to be most favourable makes use of one pressure microphone and one particle velocity sensor. The advantage of this principle is that no pressure gradients or spatial derivatives of the particle velocity are involved. This so-called p-u probe is an affordable and practical measuring device for measuring several acoustic parameters and can easily be extended to a three-dimensional probe. The calibration method of the sensor that is most common, the standing wave tube, is described next. It considers particularly the limits of validity of this method by analysing the effects of the viscous and thermal properties of the gas in the tube. These viscothermal effects on the calibration are shown to be small. Nevertheless, they should be considered in the design of a standing wave tube; by proper design the viscothermal effects can be made negligible. Then it is shown that the sensor’s sensitivity and frequency behaviour can be determined electronically as well, and an electronic method for determination of the device output response, which is more convenient, is therefore presented. The previous approach, the introduction of a small perturbation to the heat diffusion equation, is applied to the electronic case: the small additional electrical heating of one of the two wires can be described by a perturbation term. Using a specific property of Green’s functions, the electrical response of the other wire can be translated to the acoustic response. The principle is shown to be geometry independent, it can be applied {{for a wide range of}} thermal flow sensors, even for those consisting of more than two wires. The method is not only less complicated, it also makes it possible to cover easily the entire acoustic frequency spectral range. The theory is experimentally verified for various thermal flow sensors of different geometries. The model developed in the second chapter is the basis for further optimisation. Since the theory is now implemented into a numeric program, several assumptions and restrictions for the deduction of the analytic model can be dropped. The implementation of the numeric model into a software program allows for an investigation of the influence of varying sensor dimensions on the sensitivity. Thus, improved devices could be fabricated, among which Microflowns with a new geometry consisting of three, instead of two, wires of which the central wire is most heated. These three-wire sensors have a significantly improved signal-tonoise ratio and a larger frequency bandwidth. The last two chapters deal with the noise that is present in the output signal. First a method to reduce the noise level of the particle velocity sensor is described. This method is based on the utilisation of cross-correlation spectra instead of auto correlation spectra of two of these sensors. The underlying principle is that the time averaged cross correlation signal of two uncorrelated noise sources is theoretically zero. The larger the measuring time and therefore the number of data points stored, the smaller the variance of the noise power in the cross spectrum. Finally, the characteristics and origins of the noise are investigated in detail. Especially the low-frequency noise is analysed and it is observed that the voltage fluctuations exhibit a spectral density that for low frequencies behaves as 1 /f α with 1 < α < 3. The approach of introducing a perturbation that has shown to be useful in the former chapters, is applied to analyse the influence of small fluctuations of external physical quantities on the fluctuations of the wire temperature and consequently on the spectral density of the output voltage. Besides, the dependence of the low-frequency noise on wire temperature and on the dissipated power are investigated experimentally. It is found that the electrical power dissipation and the related self-heating of the wire play an important role in the observed noise behaviour, although this phenomenon is not well understood yet. A difference in the power dependence of this noise between the sensor wires and a common metal film resistor is observed. We propose different possible explanations for this noise behaviour...|$|R
