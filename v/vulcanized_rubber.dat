25|$|Uncured rubber is {{used for}} cements; for adhesive, insulating, and {{friction}} tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear. <b>Vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{hockey is}} a contact team sport played on ice, {{usually in a}} rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> puck into their opponent's net to score points.

25|$|Each {{of these}} devices {{can be made from}} a variety of materials, {{including}} asphalt, concrete, recycled plastic, metal, or <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber.</b> Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most vertical deflection devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{hockey is}} {{played on a}} hockey rink. During normal play, there are six players per side on the ice at any time, one of them being the goaltender, each of whom is on ice skates. The {{objective}} {{of the game is}} to score goals by shooting a hard <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> disc, the puck, into the opponent's goal net, which is placed {{at the opposite end of}} the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck.|$|E
25|$|Another process {{involves}} {{conversion of}} assorted polymers into petroleum by {{a much less}} precise thermal depolymerization process. Such a process {{would be able to}} accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including thermoset materials such as <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> tires and the biopolymers in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in Carthage, Missouri, USA, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.|$|E

Autoclaves are used in medical applications to perform sterilization and in the chemical industry to cure coatings and <b>vulcanize</b> <b>rubber</b> and for hydrothermal synthesis. They are also used in industrial applications, especially regarding composites, see autoclave (industrial).|$|R
25|$|Starting in the 1880s, {{birth rates}} began to drop {{steadily}} {{in the industrialized}} countries, as women married later and families in urban living conditions increasingly favoured having fewer children. This trend was particularly acute in the United Kingdom, where birth rates declined from almost 35.5 births per 1,000 in the 1870s to about 29 per 1,000 by 1900. While the cause is uncertain, the 29% decline within a generation shows that the birth control methods Victorian women used were effective. Many women were educated about contraception and how to avoid pregnancy. While the rhythm method was not yet understood, condoms and diaphragms made of <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> were reliable and inexpensive.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber,</b> laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
500|$|Plastics are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} categories, which are [...] "thermosets" [...] and [...] "thermoplastics." [...] A thermoset is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic. Thermosets cannot be melted, therefore, once a thermoset has set {{it is impossible to}} weld it. Examples of thermosets include epoxies, silicone, <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber,</b> polyester, and polyurethane.|$|E

50|$|Ebonite is a {{brand name}} for very hard rubber first {{obtained}} by Charles Goodyear by <b>vulcanizing</b> natural <b>rubber</b> for prolonged periods. For <b>vulcanizing</b> natural <b>rubber</b> he received patent number 3633 from the United States Patent Office on June 15, 1844. Besides natural rubber, Ebonite contains about 25-80% sulfur and linseed oil. Its name comes from its intended use as an artificial substitute for ebony wood.|$|R
40|$|Anti-pollution {{flashover}} of insulator {{is important}} for power systems. In recent years, haze-fog weather occurs frequently, which makes discharge occurs easily on the insulator surface and accelerates insulation aging of insulator. In order to study the influence of haze-fog on the surface discharge of room temperature <b>vulcanized</b> silicone <b>rubber,</b> an artificial haze-fog lab was established. Based on four consecutive years of insulator contamination accumulation and atmospheric sampling in haze-fog environment, the contamination configuration appropriate for RTV-coated surface discharge test under simulation environment of haze-fog was put forward. ANSYS Maxwell was {{used to analyze the}} influence of room temperature <b>vulcanized</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> surface attachments on electric field distribution. The changes of droplet on the polluted room temperature <b>vulcanized</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> surface and the corresponding surface flashover voltage under alternating current (AC), direct current (DC) positive polar (+), and DC negative polar (−) power source were recorded by a high speed camera. The results are as follows: The main ion components from haze-fog atmospheric particles are NO 3 −, SO 42 −, NH 4 +, and Ca 2 +. In haze-fog environment, both the equivalent salt deposit density (ESDD) and non-soluble deposit density (NSDD) of insulators are higher than that under general environment. The amount of large particles on the AC transmission line is greater than that of the DC transmission line. The influence of DC polarity power source on the distribution of contamination particle size is not significant. After the deposition of haze-fog, the local conductivity of the room temperature <b>vulcanized</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> surface increased, which caused the flashover voltage reduce. Discharge is liable to occur at the triple junction point of droplet, air, and room temperature <b>vulcanized</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> surface. After the deformation or movement of droplets, a new triple junction point would be formed, which would seriously reduce the dielectric strength of room temperature <b>vulcanized</b> silicone <b>rubber...</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1840s brought {{trade and}} wealth to the Amazon. The process for <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>rubber</b> was developed, and {{worldwide}} {{demand for the}} product skyrocketed.

2500|$|Vulcanization {{refers to}} a {{specific}} curing process of rubber involving high heat {{and the addition of}} sulfur or other equivalent curatives. It is a chemical process in which polymer molecules are linked to other polymer molecules by atomic bridges composed of sulfur atoms or carbon-to-carbon bonds. A vast array of products are made with <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber</b> including ice hockey pucks, tires, shoe soles, hoses and many more. When [...] "rubber fever" [...] struck Boston in the 1830s, there was a large consumer demand for products made of rubber- aprons, life preservers, hats, carriage tops, and, by 1836, waterproof shoes. But in the heat of summer, rubber goods turned into a gooey, foul-smelling mess; in the winter, they froze stiff. In 1839, Charles Goodyear had a breakthrough when he mixed liquid latex with sulfur and heating it in the sun or over a stove top. The leather-like form of the stretchable substance resulted in the first <b>vulcanized</b> <b>rubber.</b> Goodyear received a patent on June 15, 1844.|$|E
