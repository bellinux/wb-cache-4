40|$|In a {{location}} system, the service area (e. g., an office building) is populated with sensors {{connected to a}} wired network. Employees or equipment are located by wearing {{a location}} badge {{of the size of}} a credit card. This badge periodically transmits a message to the sensor in the room. Based on the location message, the system updates or reconfirms the position of the badge. Through location badges, the location system is able to locate every user in the building. A major performance issue of the location system is the determination of the frequency that a badge transmits the location <b>message</b> (or the <b>registration</b> <b>message).</b> If the messages are sent very frequently, then the badge may consume too much power. On the other hand, if the messages are sent infrequently, then the system may not accurately locate the position of the user, and calls may be lost. In this paper, we propose an analytic model to study this performance issue. The model can accommodate an arbitrary distribution for the user residence time at a location. Our study indicates that the lost-call probability increases linearly proportional to the call arrival rate and the registration intervals. Also, in many cases, by decreasing the registration frequency (and thus save the badge power), the location system may still maintain low lost-call probability. For example, if the average time for a user to stay in a location is 2 hours, and the call arrival rate is one call per hour, then by increasing the registration interval from 5 seconds to 20 seconds (and thus 75 % of the transmitting power is saved), the lost-call probability can still be maintained below 0. 6 %. We also observe an interesting phenomenon that if the user movement pattern is more irregular, the opportunity of losing a call becomes smaller...|$|R

However, in some cases, the device failed to transmit a <b>message</b> after <b>registration</b> or according to schedule. We investigated {{the difference between}} patients who could make effective use of CARELINK® system and those who could not. Subjects and Method: Sixty patients who had registered until December 2009 at our institution were analyzed. These patients {{were divided into two}} groups: those who were able to use the device effectively (group G, n = 49) and those who were not (group F = 11). Patient background, automatic or manual telemetries, new or existing implant patient, presence of adverse events, and the use or non-use of a checklist at the time of introduction were compared between the two groups.

Our approach solves the problem with rapidly moving mobile units, using a broadcasting scheme. The first approach one might consider is to construct a spanning tree over the MSCs and broadcast each message along this tree. In this setting, however, delivery is not guaranteed if the mobile unit for which the message is destined moves rapidly from an area within the cluster which has not yet broadcast the message into a region which has. This rapid movement is realistic because the time to execute a handover between MSCs is small, but transmission of the message along t...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The current {{food pyramid}} {{guidelines}} {{have been criticized}} because of their complexity and the knowledge required for users to understand the recommendations. Simplification of a dietary message {{to focus on a}} single key aspect of dietary quality, e. g., fiber intake, may make the message much easier to comprehend and adhere, such that respondents can achieve greater weight loss, better dietary quality and overall metabolic health. Methods and design This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with two equal sized arms. In total, 240 obese adults who meet diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome will be randomized to one of the two conditions: 1) a high fiber diet and 2) the American Heart Association (AHA) diet. In the high fiber diet condition, patients will be given instruction only on achieving daily dietary fiber intake of 30 g or more. In the AHA diet condition, patients will be instructed to make the several dietary changes recommended by the AHA 2006 guidelines. The trial examines participant weight loss and dietary quality as well as changes in components of the metabolic syndrome, inflammatory biomarkers, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, insulin levels, and glycosolated hemoglobin. Potential mediators, i. e., diet adherence and perceived ease of the diet, and the intervention effect on weight change will also be examined. Discussions The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline the study design and methods for testing the simple message of increasing dietary fiber.

If more radios are present, it is possible to assign a maclet to each radio (this will require a simple extension of the multi-maclet selector).|$|R
40|$|The {{main source}} of the problem in Mobile {{handover}} is the latency and packet loss introduced by the lengthy registration processes. The <b>registration</b> <b>messages</b> must traverse {{all the way to the}} home agent (HA) and back. In addition, the packets sent by the corresponding node (CNs) are lost until they receive the binding update (BU) indicating the new care-of-address (nCoA) of the mobile node (MN). To reduce the number of lost packets during this time, the MN can request the old access router (oAR) to forward all its incoming packets to the new access router (nAR) Mobile IP handovers can be improved through link layer information to reduce packet loss during handovers. It avoids link disruption during Mobile IP handovers and reduces packet loss. Therefore, link layer information allows an MN to predict the loss of connectivity more quickly than the L 3 advertisement based algorithm.

In order to effectively provide the necessary QoS and optimize the channel management, we present an early channel reservation scheme based on mobile movement history.

This sequence is reported by encoding the entire information of a sequence of traditional location <b>registration</b> <b>messages</b> using a dictionary, as in the LZ 78 data compression algorithm.

40|$|Abstract Mobile user {{tracking}} is a {{major issue}} in wireless networks. Previous studies and traditional approaches dealt only with tracking algorithms which adapt themselves to the user activity. In this work we propose a novel approach for user tracking, in which the tracking activity is adapted to both user and system activity. The basic idea is to make the user location update rate dependent not only on the user activity (such as the call profile and mobility pattern); rather, it is made dependent also on the signaling load, which reflects the actual cost of the update operation. Thus, in low signaling load locations, the users are to transmit location update messages more frequently. To carry out this approach we propose a Load-Adaptive Threshold Scheme (LATS) : The network determines for each cell a registration threshold level (which depends on the cell load) and announces it, as a broadcast message, to the users. The user computes its own registration priority and then transmits a <b>registration</b> <b>message</b> only if its priority exceeds the announced threshold level.

50|$|Before a {{user can}} {{get access to}} IP Multimedia services, it must {{register}} at least one IMPU (IP Multimedia Public Identity), such as a telephone number. Then the IMS network must authenticate the IMPI (IP Multimedia Private Identity) at application. The registration process is initiated by the IMS terminal sending a SIP REGISTER message to the P-CSCF directed his IMPI and IMPU. This message reaches the P-CSCF, and it forwards {{the message to the}} I-CSCF. The I-CSCF sends a DIAMETER message authentication request of the user who sent the REGISTER message, DIAMETER UAR to HSS, who responds with another message DIAMETER UAA and parallel to I-CSCF informs the direction of the S-CSCF assigned to the user. Then the I- CSCF forwards the <b>registration</b> <b>message</b> to the S-CSCF, which in turn sends the message DIAMETER MAR including IMPI, which is used by the HSS to calculate the Authentication Vector (AV) and generates the quintuple < RAND, AUTN, XRES, CK, IK > and returns the S-CSCF to fivefold through DIAMETER MAA message. This message is an indication that the network is requesting that the terminal uses its security algorithms in order to authenticate. Then the S-CSCF sends the SIP 401 Unauthorized message accompanied by four of the five parameters making up the AV to I-CSCF, which forwards the message to the P-CSCF. Again, the P-CSCF forwards the message to the UE but leaving him only two parameters, the RAND and AUTN. Since the terminal has the same secret key that has a corresponding HSS, the user can calculate the AUTN. If this matches the one received from the network, the network is considered legitimate. The UE also calculates its response RES which is sent to another SIP REGISTER message with IMPI and ARPU. This message reaches the P-CSCF which forwards the I-CSCF. After the I-CSCF sends a DIAMETER UAR to HSS who responds with the address of S-CSCF through a DIAMETER UAA message. Then the I-CSCF forwards the <b>registration</b> <b>message</b> with the RES to S-CSCF. The latter sends the message DIAMETER SAR to the HSS who replies with DIAMETER SAA. If the RES parameter sent by the user is equal to XRES had calculated the HSS during the first registration attempt, then the HSS authenticates the user by means of the message DIAMETER SAA. Finally the S-CSCF sends a SIP 200 OK message to P-CSCF, which forwards it to the user.Security processes are always executed by the Home Network, even if the user is roaming.|$|R

40|$|There are two {{causes of}} latency in mobile handover: the move {{detection}} latency and registration latency. This delay {{is inherent in}} the round-trip incurred by Mobile IP as the registration request is sent to the home agent and the response sent back to the foreign agent.

Global position systems GPS used to assist FMIPv 6 for fast handovers and reduced packet loss during handover. We introduce a new link layer combined with Location information Provider signalling in this algorithm accordingly. Further, we report the implementation details performed through simulations. Therefore, link layer information and Location information Provider allows an MN and FAs to predict the loss of connectivity more quickly than the L 3 advertisement based algorithm.

There are various registration scenarios, some of them are more appealing to students and administration giving immediate feedback and being fully automatic, others are more practical and less demanding with respect to computing power.

While many teacher education programs offer early childhood courses, they have traditionally had a greater focus on kindergarten and the formal years of schooling. Less is known about the amount of time devoted to developing the specialist educational capacity for teaching and caring for infants and toddlers.

Our analysis shows that the LATS reduces the paging cost, in comparison with other dynamic methods, without increasing the wireless cost of registration. Moreover, if higher user density is coupled with less mobility (e. g., consider vehicles), then the LATS strategy offers further performance improvement. The load-adaptive strategy can be used in addition to any other dynamic tracking strategy. Furthermore, the computational complexity imposed on the user is identical to that required by an equivalent load-insensitive scheme...|$|R
