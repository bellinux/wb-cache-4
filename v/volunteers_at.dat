Despite his popularity with the crowds in London and Macroom, he was jeered by Ulster <b>Volunteers</b> <b>at</b> a recruitment drive in Ballaghaderrin during the autumn of 1915. This treatment caused such a scandal that it was raised in the Houses of Parliament in December.|$|E

5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the <b>volunteers</b> <b>at</b> Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E

5|$|The episode starred Pemberton, Shearsmith, Jane Horrocks, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Tony Way as <b>volunteers</b> <b>at</b> Comfort Support Line, {{a crisis}} hotline.

5|$|British {{attention}} {{elsewhere in}} the theatre was focused on Southern India. In January 1798, a French privateer brought envoys from Mysore to Île de France with a request for support. Malartic supplied 86 volunteers, which were sent to India on Preneuse under Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Lhermitte's mission {{was meant to be}} covert, but in April 1798 he attacked and captured two East Indiamen, Woodcot and Raymond, at Tellicherry, and landed the <b>volunteers</b> <b>at</b> Mangalore on 24 April. This action caused a crisis in relations between the EIC and Mysore, which Tipu Sultan's obvious enthusiasm for French intervention in India inflamed. The Fourth Anglo-Mysore War began in February 1799 when two British armies crossed into Mysorean territory. Forced back to his capital Seringapatam, the Tipu Sultan held out against a siege for several weeks until the city was taken by storm, with Tipu Sultan being killed during the ensuing street-fighting.|$|E
5|$|Gasol's mother, Marisa, was {{a medical}} doctor, and his father, Agustí, {{was a nurse}} administrator. When Pau was born, his family was living in Cornellà, but {{he was born in}} Barcelona, at Sant Pau Hospital, where both of his parents worked. When he was 6 years old, his family moved to another Barcelona suburb, Sant Boi de Llobregat, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his childhood. His parents moved to the Memphis suburb of Germantown, Tennessee, after he signed with the Grizzlies, and enrolled his younger brothers Marc and Adrià in Lausanne Collegiate School in Memphis. They planned to move to the Los Angeles area when Pau was traded to the Lakers, with Agustí accepting a job with a health-care company in that area; although the Grizzlies obtained the rights to Marc's services as part of the trade, he was expected to re-sign with his Spanish team Akasvayu Girona. However, when Marc decided to sign with the Grizzlies, their parents chose to stay in Germantown. Agustí now works from home for the same company, while Marisa now <b>volunteers</b> <b>at</b> St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.|$|E

5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Tennessee <b>Volunteers</b> <b>at</b> Knoxville 44–13 for their sixth consecutive {{victory in the}} series. After the teams traded punts to open the game, Alabama scored their first touchdown on their second possession on a 23-yard AJ McCarron pass to Amari Cooper. The Volunteers responded on the drive that ensued with a 32-yard Michael Palardy field goal that cut the Crimson Tide lead to 7–3. After the next Alabama drive ended with a missed Cade Foster field goal from 44 yards, the Crimson Tide defense responded with their first turnover of the game when C. J. Mosley intercepted a Tyler Bray pass at the Tennessee 32-yard line. Four T. J. Yeldon runs and 32 yards later, Alabama led 13–3 after he scored on a one-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide extended their lead further to 20–3 on their next possession when Michael Williams scored on a one-yard McCarron pass that completed a drive that included a 54-yard Cooper reception.

5|$|In {{their third}} {{game of the}} season against a ranked opponent, LSU played their first-ever game against the No.16 Mountaineers at Morgantown. Although West Virginia was able to outgain the Tigers in total offense 533 to 366 yards, four Mountaineer {{turnovers}} resulted in a 47–21 LSU victory. As a result of this win, combined with the other two over ranked opponents, LSU was selected the No.1 team by the AP following week 5. The Tigers returned home to defeat the Kentucky Wildcats 35–7 in Jordan Jefferson's return from suspension, and then defeated the No.17 Florida Gators 41–11, also in Death Valley. After their 38–7 victory over the Tennessee <b>Volunteers</b> <b>at</b> Neyland Stadium, the Tigers were selected as the No.1 team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls for the first time of the season after the Oklahoma Sooners were upset by Texas Tech Red Raiders. The next week, LSU defeated the No.19 Auburn Tigers 45–10 at home and entered their bye week undefeated and ranked No.1 for their game against No.2 Alabama in Tuscaloosa.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the United Way {{and other}} {{charitable}} groups also quickly mobilized volunteers to assist survivors {{in the aftermath}} across the regions affected. In the three hardest hit Middle Tennessee counties alone, the Red Cross sent out over 100 volunteers to deliver meals and supplies. Emergency assistance was also offered by the Tennessee Department of Human Services for low income victims in the counties affected by the tornadoes. In addition, the Nashville Predators announced that for their game on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, half the ticket sales revenue would be donated to the American Red Cross to help with their efforts, and that fans could make additional donations to Red Cross <b>volunteers</b> <b>at</b> the arena's main entrances. The National Football League's Tennessee Titans along with the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management of Nashville organized a donation drive during the weekend of February 9 at LP Field.|$|E
