40|$|AbstractMicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA {{molecules}} that can complementarily bind to the mRNA 3 ′-UTR region {{to regulate the}} gene expression by transcriptional repression or induction of mRNA degradation. Increasing evidence suggests a new mechanism by which miRNAs may regulate target gene expression by binding in promoter and amino acid coding regions. Most of the existing databases on miRNAs are restricted to mRNA 3 ′-UTR region. To address this issue, we present miRWalk, a comprehensive database on miRNAs, which hosts predicted as well as validated miRNA binding sites, information on all known genes of human, mouse and rat. All mRNAs, mitochondrial genes and 10 kb upstream flanking regions of all known genes of human, mouse and rat were analyzed by using a newly developed algorithm named ‘miRWalk’ {{as well as with}} eight already established programs for putative miRNA binding sites. An automated and extensive text-mining search was performed on PubMed database to extract <b>validated</b> <b>information</b> on miRNAs. Combined information was put into a MySQL database. miRWalk presents predicted and <b>validated</b> <b>information</b> on miRNA-target interaction. Such a resource enables researchers to validate new targets of miRNA not only on 3 ′-UTR, but also on the other regions of all known genes. The ‘Validated Target module’ is updated every month and the ‘Predicted Target module’ is updated every 6 months. miRWalk is freely available at [URL]...|$|E

This study was therefore undertaken to explore the various aspects of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the public towards gemstone therapeutics. Methods A survey was performed in the Community Health Centre of a tertiary care teaching hospital in Pakistan. Data collection was done via a face-to-face interview based on a structured, pre-tested questionnaire. Participants included all willing persons between 18 – 75 years of age approached prior to their appointments at the Community Health Centre. Results The survey response rate was 86 % (400 / 465). More than half (63 %) of the study population was aware of the use of gemstone therapy. One hundred fifty-six individuals believed that gemstone use impacts health. Of this group, 39 % believed that gemstone use increases physical strength. 62 % believed that gemstone use is based on superstitious beliefs, whereas 28 % opined that it is based on religious beliefs. 38 % had used gemstones therapeutics formerly, while 24 % were current users. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age status and education status were significant (p Conclusion More than half of our sample population is aware of the use of the gemstones for their various effects. Willingness to use gemstones is associated with the beliefs about the impact of gemstone therapy on health. Friends and family seem to be the major role players influencing people's willingness to use gemstones. CAM modalities should be recognized and considered as an important therapeutic option. We feel that gemstone therapy is a relatively unexplored area and more studies should, therefore, be conducted to gather more <b>validated</b> <b>information</b> on the subject. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nineteen {{parents of}} {{children}} with autismwere interviewed about their experiences with autism treatments. These parents had originally participated in an Internet survey of treatments for autism and were randomly selected to participate in the follow-up telephone interview. The questions focused on three current treatments that have varying empirical support in the research literature, namely Applied Behavior Analysis, Sensory Integration therapy, and a combination of Vitamin B 6 and Magnesium. Most parents received information about these treatments from the Internet, other parents, and occupational therapists. In addition to recommendations from professionals and other parents to use a particular treatment, the study showed that ease of implementation, time commitment, and perceived effectiveness may also contribute to the continued use of treatments that lack empirical support. The findings highlight the need for parents to have access to unbiased, scientifically <b>validated</b> <b>information</b> about treatments for autism...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} deployment of an agent community, {{which is responsible for}} monitoring and assessing air quality, based on measurements generated by a meteorological station.

We outline the procedure for creating agent ontologies, agent types, and, finally, for training agents based on historical data volumes. The C 4. 5 algorithm for decision tree extraction is applied on meteorological and airpollutant measurements. The decision models extracted are related to the validation of incoming measurements and to the estimation of missing or erroneous measurements. Emphasis is given on the agent training process, which must embed these data-driven decision models on software agents in a simple and effortless way. We developed a prototype system, which demonstrates the advantages of agent-based solutions for intelligent environmental applications...|$|E
