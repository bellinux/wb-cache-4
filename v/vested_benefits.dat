2500|$|Aside from {{terms in}} oral or written agreements, terms can be {{incorporated}} by reference. Two main sources are collective agreements and company handbooks. In JI Case Co v National Labor Relations Board an employing corporation argued {{it should not have}} to bargain in good faith with a labor union, and did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing, because it had recently signed individual contracts with its employees. The US Supreme Court held unanimously that the [...] "very purpose" [...] of collective bargaining and the National Labor Relations Act 1935 was [...] "to supersede the terms of separate agreements of employees with terms which reflect the strength and bargaining power and serve the welfare of the group". Terms of collective agreements, to the advantage of individual employees, therefore supersede individual contracts. Similarly, if a written contract states that employees do not have rights, but an employee has been told they do by a supervisor, or rights are assured in a company handbook, they will usually have a claim. For example, in Torosyan v Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc the Supreme Court of Connecticut held that a promise in a handbook that an employee could be dismissed only for a good reason (or [...] "just cause") was binding on the employing corporation. Furthermore, an employer had no right to unilaterally change the terms. Most other state courts have reached the same conclusion, that contracts cannot be altered, except for employees' benefit, without new consideration and true agreement. By contrast, a slight majority on the California Supreme Court, appointed by Republican governors, held in Asmus v Pacific Bell that a company policy of indefinite duration can be altered after a reasonable time with reasonable notice, if it affects no <b>vested</b> <b>benefits.</b> The four dissenting judges, appointed by Democratic governors, held this was a [...] "patently unfair, indeed unconscionable, result – permitting an employer that made a promise of continuing job security... to repudiate that promise with impunity several years later". In addition, a basic term of good faith which cannot be waived, is implied by common law or equity in all states. This usually demands, as a general principle that [...] "neither party shall do anything, which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party, to receive the fruits of the contract". The term of good faith persists throughout the employment relationship. It has not yet been used extensively by state courts, compared to other jurisdictions. The Montana Supreme Court has recognized that extensive and even punitive damages could be available for breach of an employee's reasonable expectations. However others, such as the California Supreme Court limit any recovery of damages to contract breaches, but not damages regarding the manner of termination. By contrast, in the United Kingdom the requirement for [...] "good faith" [...] has been found to limit the power of discharge except for fair reasons (but not to conflict with statute), in Canada it may limit unjust discharge also for self-employed persons, and in Germany it can preclude the payment of wages significantly below average.|$|E

The authors begin by discussing the way contractual benefits are analyzed by the courts, including the determination of a governing document, the Yard-Man Inference, {{and the use of}} extrinsic evidence when governing documents are ambiguous. The authors then discuss several potential claims employees may raise in an attempt to secure benefits, such as promissory estoppel, equitable estoppel, and breach of fiduciary duty.

5000|$|One reason Congress enacted ERISA was [...] "to {{prevent the}} 'great {{personal}} tragedy' suffered by employees whose <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> are not paid when pension plans are terminated." [...] When a defined benefit plan is properly funded by its sponsor, its assets should be approximately equal to its liability, and any shortfall (including benefit improvements) should be amortized {{in a relatively}} short period of time. Before ERISA, employers and willing unions could agree to increase benefits with little thought to how to pay for them. A classic case of the unfortunate consequences of an underfunded pension plan is the 1963 shutdown of Studebaker automobile operations in South Bend, Indiana, in which 4,500 workers lost 85% of their <b>vested</b> <b>benefits.</b> One of ERISA's stated intentions was to minimize underfunding in defined benefit plans.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{conversions}} {{from traditional}} plan to hybrid plan designs have been controversial. Upon conversion, plan sponsors {{are required to}} retrospectively calculate employee account balances, and if the employee's actual <b>vested</b> <b>benefit</b> under the old design {{is more than the}} account balance, the employee enters a period of wear away. During this period, the employee would be eligible to receive the already accrued benefit under the old formula, but all future benefits are accrued under the new plan design. Eventually, the accrued benefit under the new design exceeds the grandfathered amount under the old design. To the participant, however, it appears as if there is a period where no new benefits are accrued. Hybrid designs also typically eliminate the more generous early retirement provisions of traditional pensions.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{decline in}} funding levels of defined benefit pension plans (DBPs) has {{attracted}} the attention of regulators in Australia and other jurisdictions. In light of such scrutiny, this study provides timely empirical evidence of the economic and regulatory implications of the recent change in the financial position of DBPs sponsored by Australian listed companies. We identify that over the four-year period from 2000 to 2003 the frequencies of both accrued benefits deficits and <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> deficits increased sharply after 2001. Coinciding with the increased incidence of deficits, the time lag in measuring accrued and <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> declined significantly. Controlling for firms taking contribution holidays, we find that the market prices <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> surpluses and deficits, and accrued benefits deficits, but not accrued benefits surpluses. This asymmetric treatment of firms ’ superannuation funding positions is consistent with accounting conservatism theories and, as a consequence, has implications for recent adoption of IFRS accounting standards requiring Australian companies to recognise both accrued benefits surpluses and deficits...|$|E
50|$|Just {{as there}} is no legal {{requirement}} to give portability to a Defined contribution plan, there is no mandated ban on portability for defined benefit plans.

40|$|Under some {{defined benefit}} pension plans (typically foreign plans), the actuarial {{present value of}} {{benefits}} to which an employee is entitled if the employee terminates immediately may exceed the actuarial present value of benefits to which the employee is entitled at expected date of separation based on service to date. For example, {{the provisions of the}} Italian severance pay statute require that, in most cases, the benefit an employee has accrued for service to date is payable immediately upon separation. The undiscounted value of that benefit payable currently would exceed the actuarial present value of that benefit if payment is estimated to occur at the employee's expected termination date. Another example arises in the United Kingdom where legislation requires that deferred <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> of terminated employees be statutorily revalued from date of separation to normal retirement age. If the vested benefit obligation (VBO) is determined assuming employee termination at the measurement date, that VBO could exceed the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) if that obligation is measured giving consideration to a statutory revaluation only after the employee's expected date of termination. The issue is whether the VBO is the actuarial present value of the <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> to which the employee is entitled if the employee separates immediately (Approach 1) or the actuarial present value of the <b>vested</b> <b>benefits</b> to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee's expected date of separation or retirement (Approach 2).

40|$|The {{liability}} to employees in a defined benefit pension {{plan is the}} present value of <b>vested</b> <b>benefits,</b> {{the present value of}} the benefits that employees would receive on the immediate termination of the pension plan. This is the literal and simple definition of the liability. Although it leads {{to an understanding of the}} economics of the promise of a pension, several common provisions of pension plans make it necessary to expand the definition. Anomalies such as vesting, early retirement benefits, lump sum provisions, and ad hoc increases in benefits for retired employees indicate that employees accrue benefits that exceed their benefits on a termination of the plan. These anomalies, however, can be explained by requiring that employees as a group possess specific human capital. Although losing one or a few employees from the group would be a small loss, losing the group of employees would be a great loss. In this group model, employees bargain with the stockholders over the compensation of the entire group; they allocate. their compensation according to marginal product, returns from previous equity investments in the human capital of the group, and to purchases and sales of claims on this capital. The model explains the anomalies as a natural outgrowth of the transactions of members within the group. In addition, the model explains the use of defined benefit pension plans, and how employees could have claims, in excess of <b>vested</b> <b>benefits,</b> on the assets in the pension plan. ...|$|E

As for the latter, future salary and savings levels serve as reference variables for the calculation of associated contributions and benefits; while salaries grow at a constant rate, hitherto accumulated savings earn interest at a guaranteed rate and get periodically augmented by em-ployee’s contributions.

In this study, job choice problem is considered as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem and it has been analyzed by using fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions method; one of the MCDM methods. 275 surveys have been carried out in total for seven different job choice criteria determined (wage level, job security, location of the business, <b>vested</b> <b>benefits,</b> respectability in the society, the difficulty level of the business, flexible working time opportunity) and four different types of entity choice alternative (public corporation, special purpose entity, foreign capital enterprises, one’s own business). As a result of the analysis, it has been found that in general, the preferred job choice criteria of the decision makers (the individuals who participated in the survey) is respectively as follows; the respectability level of the business in the society, wage level, and flexible working time opportunity. Thus, these criteria have been considered more important when compared with other criteria. It has also been determined that the type of entity choices in which the decision makers wish to work are listed respectively as foreign capital enterprises, in one’s own business as an enterpreneur, public corporation and lastly special purpose entity.
