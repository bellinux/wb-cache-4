40|$|A 9 -year-old female, {{domestic}} {{short hair}} cat {{was presented with}} sudden onset of polyuria/polydipsia, and hundreds of cutaneous nodules. Prior to referral, the cat had had four skin nodules that were treated with steroids. The four skin nodules then multiplied to form more than 100 ulcerated and nonulcerated nodules located all over the trunk. Clinical evaluation revealed hypothermia and respiratory distress. Cytology from both skin nodules and bronchoalveolar lavage showed macrophages and small organisms whose shape and size were indicative of Toxoplasma spp., or similar organisms. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) serology results were negative. The cat was seropositive for Toxoplasma (IgG 1 : 640) and Neospora (1 : 80) infections. The cat died soon after referral. Necropsy revealed pyothorax, necrotic/purulent pneumonia, haemorrhagic spots on kidneys and mesentery. Histopathology from skin nodules showed diffuse, deep necrotic dermatitis/panniculitis, vasculitis and disseminated free and grouped protozoa. The parasites were found in lungs, spleen, kidneys and liver. Immunohistochemistry on skin tissue with anti-Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum antibodies gave positive results with both. Electron microscopy showed single and grouped tachyzoites with morphological features of T. gondii, often within macrophages. Samples of cutaneous nodules and bronchoalveolar fluid were examined by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting apicomplexa coccidia. PCR results were consistent only with T. gondii infection. Therefore, immunohistochemistry positivity for N. caninum was considered a cross-reaction and a diagnosis of cutaneous and <b>visceral</b> <b>toxoplasmosis</b> was made...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo {{activities}} of three bisphosphonates were determined against Leishmania donovani and Toxoplasma gondii. Alendronate was essentially inactive against both parasites. Pamidronate was active against L. donovani by intravenous administration. Risedronate had a 50 % effective dosage of five 2. 6 -mg/kg {{of body weight}} intraperitoneal doses against L. donovani-infected mice but was less effective against T. gondii-infected mice. Macrophages are the principal hosts or targets of the intra-cellular forms of the parasitic protozoa Leishmania donovani and Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agents of <b>visceral</b> leish-maniasis and <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> respectively. Macrophage-like cells, or osteoclasts, are also the targets of the bisphospho-nate class of bone antiresorptive drugs, and in recent work {{we found that the}} bisphosphonates alendronate (ALE) (Fosa-max; Merck), pamidronate (PAM) (Aredia; Novartis), and risedronate (RIS) (Actonel; Procter and Gamble) had consid-erable activity against both L. donovani and T. gondii in vitro (4). These protozoa are the cause of considerable mortalit...|$|R
