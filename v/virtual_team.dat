40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a model that eLearning {{practitioners}} can use to take advantage of research that has been conducted in the areas of <b>virtual</b> <b>teams</b> and communities of practice so as to promote an improved learning experience for eLearning students.

A prior study conducted by one of the authors that explored how the concepts of communities of practice could be applied into an eLearning context is then reviewed. Two building block models of how the literature relating to <b>virtual</b> <b>teams</b> can inform eLearning are constructed.

Due to the distributed nature of virtual teams, team members have less awareness of the wider situation of the team or dynamics of the overall team environment. Consequently, as situations change in a <b>virtual</b> <b>team</b> environment, such as adjustments to task requirements, modification of milestones, or changes to {{the goals of the}} team, it is important that leaders monitor followers to ensure they are aware of these changes and make amendments as required. The leaders of virtual teams do not possess the same powers of physical observation, and have to be creative in setting up structures and processes so that variations from expectations can be observed well virtually (for instance, <b>virtual</b> <b>team</b> leaders have to sense when [...] "electronic" [...] silence means acquiescence rather than inattention).
