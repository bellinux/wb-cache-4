30|$|The third common {{approach}} for implementing the propensity score {{is based on}} the idea of statistical matching (see e.g. Hansen 2004; Hansen and Klopfer 2006; Rässler 2002; Rosenbaum 1989). Following Rosenbaum (1989), consider the problem of matching a treated unit to a control unit on a <b>vector</b> <b>of</b> covariates. In <b>observational</b> studies, the number of control units typically exceeds the number of treated units. A matched pair is an ordered pair (i, j), with 1 < i < N and 1 < j < M denoting that the ith treated unit is matched with the jth control unit. As defined by Rosenbaum (1989), “A complete matched pair is a set I of N disjoint matched pairs, that is N matched pairs in which each treated unit appears once, and each control unit appears either once or not at all” (p. 1024).|$|R

In the case of Northern Hemisphere ocean temperatures, the latter are around 2 degrees. The infrared satellite retrievals have a similar size "error". If (as assumed) their errors are uncorrelated with the first guess error, they will improve the analysis. The larger errors of the microwave retrievals, however, mean that they will be given little weight in the analysis. An evaluation of the TIROS-N retrievals is currently underway at NMC to determine the impact of satellite derived data within operational analysis schemes, to isolate possible problems within current retrieval methods, and to offer possible solutions for these problems...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{invisible}} role <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> learning in the development of leadership practice. A model <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> learning and leadership practice is suggested to help guide theorizing and design intervention. Design/methodology/approach – The approach takes the form of empirical qualitative research that utilizes a time-line interview technique with 34 managers to enable in-depth data to be revealed <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> leadership learning. Data analysis is through a phenomenological grounded theory approach. Findings – The paper illustrates that observational learning from “notable people” is a prominent influence of these managers' conceptions <b>of</b> leadership. Such <b>observational</b> learning differed between men and women and between employed and self-employed contexts. Research limitations/implications – The variety, availability and diversity of people to observe and engage with are argued here to have significant implications for the development of leadership practice. Practical implications – The conclusions suggest that interventions into the leadership development of men and women, and between the employed and self-employed need to be different and such interventions need to be responsive to established structural practices. Originality/value – The paper responds to a call for contextualized, in-depth qualitative research into leadership development, making prominent the significance <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> learning to leadership practice and how such observational learning varies between men and women, and between the employed and the self-employed. It also provides a model <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> learning and leadership practice to guide understanding of informal leadership development...|$|R

Such appraisal is particularly difficult, however, as the quality assessment tools available for use with observational and analytic studies are poorly established. Methods We reviewed the existing quality assessment tools for systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies and developed a concise quality assessment checklist to help standardise decisions regarding the quality of studies, with careful consideration of issues such as external and internal validity. Results A pilot version of the checklist was developed based on epidemiological principles, reviews of study designs, and existing checklists for the assessment <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies. The Quality Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews <b>of</b> <b>Observational</b> Studies (QATSO) Score consists of five items: External validity (1 item), reporting (2 items), bias (1 item) and confounding factors (1 item). Expert opinions were sought and it was tested on manuscripts that fulfil the inclusion criteria of a systematic review. Like all assessment scales, QATSO may oversimplify and generalise information yet it is inclusive, simple and practical to use, and allows comparability between papers. Conclusion A specific tool that allows researchers to appraise and guide study quality <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies is developed and can be modified for similar studies in the future. </p...|$|R
40|$|Much medical {{research}} is <b>observational.</b> The reporting <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies is often of insufficient quality. Poor reporting hampers {{the assessment of}} {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a study and the generalisability of its results. Taking into account empirical evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reporting <b>of</b> <b>Observational</b> Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the quality <b>of</b> reporting <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For each item, one or several published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided. Examples of useful flow diagrams are also included.

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised {{about the quality of}} {{reporting}} in nutritional epidemiology. Research reporting guidelines such as the Strengthening the Reporting <b>of</b> <b>Observational</b> Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement can improve quality <b>of</b> reporting in <b>observational</b> studies. Herein, we propose recommendations for reporting nutritional epidemiology and dietary assessment research by extending the STROBE statement into Strengthening the Reporting <b>of</b> <b>Observational</b> Studies in Epidemiology - Nutritional Epidemiology (STROBE-nut). Recommendations for the reporting of nutritional epidemiology and dietary assessment research were developed following a systematic and consultative process, co-ordinated by a multidisciplinary group of 21 experts. Consensus on reporting guidelines was reached through a three-round Delphi consultation process with 53 external experts. In total, 24 recommendations for nutritional epidemiology were added to the STROBE checklist. When used appropriately, reporting guidelines for nutritional epidemiology can contribute to improve reporting <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies with a focus on diet and health.

These quantitative reviews are required for the assessment of the effectiveness of preventive policies that will be performed in the framework of next Dutch Public Health Status Forecast reports. The report describes briefly the 'art' of meta-analysis, recent methodological developments and the objectives of application. Subsequently the limitations and possibilities <b>of</b> meta-analysis <b>of</b> <b>observational</b> studies are evaluated.

A statistical procedure for data aggregation is presented, providing possibilities for meta-regression analysis, taking relevant study characteristics into account, as well as possibilities for Bayesian updating of individual studies (posterior estimates) 'borrowing strength' from a set of other comparable study results.

However, the main objective should be critical, comparative analysis, learning from heterogeneity, identifying patterns among studies, not data aggregation in itself...|$|R
