30|$|NHANES {{often has}} a “Refused” and “Don’t Know” choice for survey questions. These are encoded by the CDC {{as a very}} large number that could not be mistaken for a <b>valid</b> <b>value.</b> For example, in SMD 030, the {{respondent}} not knowing the age in which they started smoking is encoded as 999. It should be obvious to a human observer {{that this is not a}} <b>valid</b> <b>value.</b> However, many machine learning algorithms do not have built-in outlier detection and such a large value may have undue influence over the final model, reducing performance.|$|R

5000|$|The method {{starts with}} {{checking}} if [...] from the CGA Parameters data structure has a <b>valid</b> <b>value</b> and if [...] {{from the same}} data structure matches the CGA's subnet prefix (on line 2). This is done for security reasons.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{relational}} {{building block}} is the domain or data type, usually abbreviated nowadays to type. A tuple is an ordered set of attribute values. An attribute is an ordered pair of attribute name and type name. An attribute value {{is a specific}} <b>valid</b> <b>value</b> {{for the type of}} the attribute. This can be either a scalar value or a more complex type.|$|R

5000|$|Basic {{exception}} safety, {{also known}} as a no-leak guarantee: Partial execution of failed operations can cause side effects, but all invariants are preserved and there are no resource leaks (including memory leaks). Any stored data will contain <b>valid</b> <b>values,</b> even if they differ from what they were before the exception.|$|E
5000|$|Command macros and {{programs}} can be invoked with an argument to display a form listing all the available parameters, which the user can navigate using the [...] "tab" [...] key. Each parameter is generally restricted to control what the user can input. This includes lists of <b>valid</b> <b>values,</b> numeric-only, text-only, etc. Parameters can also be hidden using a [...] "secret" [...] tag, or made mandatory.|$|E
50|$|DTDs {{describe}} {{the structure of}} a class of documents via element and attribute-list declarations. Element declarations name the allowable set of elements within the document, and specify whether and how declared elements and runs of character data may be contained within each element. Attribute-list declarations name the allowable set of attributes for each declared element, including the type of each attribute value, if not an explicit set of <b>valid</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
30|$|Then the {{recipient}} attempts to verify {{validity of the}} AF security field. At this step, since the attacker does not know value of the key, he {{is not able to}} set a <b>valid</b> <b>value</b> for the AF field. Thus, the AF field of the received RTS packet is not valid. Consequently, although the packet is fresh, it is discarded as an invalid CP and thwarts the attack.|$|R
50|$|Many {{software}} bugs {{which cause}} crashes are also exploitable for arbitrary code execution {{and other types}} of privilege escalation. For example, a stack buffer overflow can overwrite the return address of a subroutine with an invalid value, which will cause a segmentation fault when the subroutine returns. However, if an exploit overwrites the return address with a <b>valid</b> <b>value,</b> the code in that address will be executed.|$|R
50|$|Some languages, such as C, {{provide only}} zero-based array types, {{for which the}} minimum <b>valid</b> <b>value</b> for any index is 0. This choice is {{convenient}} for array implementation and address computations. With a language such as C, a pointer to the interior of any array can be defined that will symbolically act as a pseudo-array that accommodates negative indices. This works only because C does not check an index against bounds when used.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, assumes the Copernican principle {{and the more}} general Cosmological principle and observations are largely consistent but there are always unsolved problems. Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the <b>valid</b> <b>values</b> of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} {{acknowledgement}} of and regret for attachment to troublesome values, {{the second question}} redirects attention toward existentially <b>valid</b> <b>values</b> the appreciation of which leads to harmony with reality. The qualities of peace, assurance, gratitude and love (creating the acronym PAGL) are cited as indicating when that state of blissful equanimity has been attained, and are used as criteria by which to evaluate the viability of possible courses of action.|$|E
5000|$|In metadata, the {{representation}} term code refers to, {{and is used}} in the name of, data elements whose allowable values can be represented as enumerated lists. Each enumerated value is a string that for brevity represents a specific meaning. For example, for a PersonGenderCode the allowable code <b>valid</b> <b>values</b> might be [...] "male", [...] "female" [...] or [...] "unknown". To be compliant with ISO standards a value meaning or definition must also be associated with each code.|$|E

5000|$|The {{routine in}} the {{following}} example written in Eiffel takes as an argument an integer which must be a <b>valid</b> <b>value</b> for an hour of the day, i. e., 0 through 23, inclusively. The precondition follows the keyword [...] It specifies that the argument must be {{greater than or equal}} to zero and less than or equal to 23. The tag [...] "" [...] describes this precondition clause and serves to identify it in case of a runtime precondition violation.|$|R
