5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional city of Karnaca. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can {{alternatively}} decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude of ways to complete missions, from stealth to purposeful <b>violent</b> <b>conflict,</b> navigated through a sandbox environment.|$|E

A DNA-scanning security system initially prevents Riddick from using firearms, but a limited arsenal later becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina dethroned Andrianjafy in a <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> {{that ended}} in 1787. The king then used Ambohimanga as a {{launching}} point for a successful campaign to bring the twelve sacred hills of Imerina under his rule, including the hill city of Antananarivo, thereby reuniting the four quadrants of the divided Kingdom of Imerina under his sovereignty and {{putting an end to}} 77 years of civil war. To consolidate support for his rule, Andrianampoinimerina mobilized representatives of the numerous noble castes to participate in the most extensive effort yet to expand and fortify Ambohimanga. He ordered the construction of new city walls, gates and defensive trenches, as well as a rosewood palace called Mahandrihono, which he had built in the traditional style.|$|E
40|$|Particularly {{pervasive}} <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> in the Horn of Africa have {{detrimental effects}} on people's livelihoods there. While the intensity, causes, and repercussions of <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> vary spatially and temporally, pastoral areas are currently the hotspots. This paper examines {{the causes and}} consequences of <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> in Ethiopia between Afar pastoralists and two of their neighbors, the Issa and the Karrayyu. The findings are based on primary data (individual interviews, group discussions, and field observations) and secondary data (documents and publications) collected in 2005 and 2006. The results indicate that contemporary challenges such as recurrent droughts, resource appropriation, livestock raiding, proliferation of small arms, and illicit trade contribute to the perpetuation of <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts.</b> While traditional institutions manage inter-clan conflicts, their effectiveness is quite limited with regard to inter-ethnic conflicts, where the contemporary challenges in pastoral areas are too diverse and complex to be managed solely by traditional institutions. The perpetuation of <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> has affected the livelihoods of pastoralists, thereby causing humanitarian crisis and limiting access to resources and opportunities...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the {{highlands}} around Imerina were wracked with <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united {{a number of these}} principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to the south. As he brought each territory under his control, he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Ventidius Cumanus (fl. 1st century AD) was the Roman procurator of Iudaea Province from AD 48 to c. AD 52. A {{disagreement}} between the surviving sources, the Jewish historian Josephus and the Roman Tacitus, makes it unclear whether his authority was over {{some or all}} of the province. Cumanus' time in office was marked by disputes between his troops and the Jewish population. Ventidius Cumanus failed to respond to an anti-Jewish murder in Samaritan territory which led to the <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> between Jews and Samaritans. Following an investigation by the governor of Syria, Gaius Ummidius Durmius Quadratus, Cumanus was sent to Rome for a hearing before the Emperor Claudius, who held him responsible for the violence and sentenced him to exile.|$|E
5|$|According to Madagascar {{historian}} Gwyn Campbell, {{the number}} of non-Merina who died in <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> during the military campaigns of Ranavalona and her predecessor Radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000. Additionally, a considerable {{proportion of the population}} not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of scorched earth policies. Deaths among the Merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high, estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820–1853. A further 25–50% of the queen's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have died each year due to diseases such as malaria. Although prevalent in the coastal parts of the island, malaria was uncommon in the high-altitude zone around Antananarivo, and Merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it. An average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of Ranavalona's reign, contributing to severe depopulation in Imerina.|$|E

40|$|<b>Violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> {{have been}} a {{characteristic}} feature of Nigeria’s polity since the recommencement of democratic rule in May 1999. The various dimension of conflict witnessed ranges from ethno-religious, inter-communal, post-election violence, and so on. Over 187 ethno-religious conflicts were reported between May 1999 and April 2009; and since 2009 boko haram activities {{have been on the}} increase and over 115 attacks reported in the north. Nigeria is thus seen as a conflict prone society as no geopolitical zone is immune. Scholarly account points to youth as the prosecutors of over 90 % of these <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> and the youth constitute about 70 % of Nigeria’s population. But are the youth victims of these <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> or the perpetrators? A critical analysis of the situation using secondary data revealed that over 60 % of youth lack access to employment and development opportunities. 90 % of the 1, 430, 000 youths that graduated from tertiary institutions between 2004 and 2014 roam the streets and become victims for manipulation by corrupt political elites and their associates to perpetrate and persecute <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> on their behalf in order to strengthen or legitimize their political and economic positions. Critically, youth are more of the victims of Nigeria’s democratic process that deny them opportunities and being the perpetrators of <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> is but a manifestation of this denial. Therefore, value reorientation for political elites and more job creation programs for youths in both private and public sector of Nigeria’s polity is strongly recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} and cultural richness of the Middle Eastern societies {{and the role of}} the state in the countries of the region provide a unique basis to understand the variety of means to address <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> in different societies with a common basis. Against this backdrop, the leading question addressed in the contributions to this book concerns what is the best-suited response to <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts?</b> The question implies that there exist alternative ways of dealing with <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts.</b> And posing this question, there follow immediately other questions: best in terms of what and best for whom: the offender, the victim, the public or all of them? The responses are related to basic concepts of punishment, retaliation and mediation that have evidently been developed everywhere although content and meaning differ. Within this context, the book provides an overview on structural factors, settings and the phenomenology of <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> in fourteen countries of the Middle East and an insight into the variety of types of traditional and modern conflict resolution applied largely in parallel in the region from different perspectives of social, legal and political sciences...|$|R

Passage of the act led to <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> over the expansion of slavery in the American West. Pierce's administration was further damaged when several of his diplomats issued the Ostend Manifesto, calling for the annexation of Cuba, a document which was roundly criticized. Although Pierce fully expected to be renominated by the Democrats in the 1856 presidential election, he was abandoned by his party and his bid failed. His reputation in the North suffered further during the Civil War as he became a vocal critic of President Abraham Lincoln. Pierce, {{who had been a}} heavy drinker for much of his life, died of severe cirrhosis of the liver in 1869.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, 800 protesters {{embarked}} on a protest march from Trinidad to La Paz, on the way facing <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> from police and those who supported the road, with many being injured. The controversy caused two government officials and various other high-ranking officials to resign in protest, while Morales begged forgiveness but blamed the U.S. and Bolivia's right-wing for stirring up the unrest. In October 2011, he passed Law 180, prohibiting further road construction, although the government proceeded with a consultation, eventually gaining the consent of 55 of the 65 communities in TIPNIS to allow the highway to be built, albeit {{with a variety of}} concessions; construction was scheduled to take place after the 2014 general election. In May 2013, the government then announced that it would permit hydrocarbon exploration in the nation's 22 national parks, to widespread condemnation from environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that {{became a part of}} Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The specifics of that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from the time when the English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|From c.1824 the {{movement}} of European colonists and their farming practices onto Pallittorre lands brought the two groups into often <b>violent</b> <b>conflict.</b> The conflict increased over time. In retaliation for acts by Europeans, killings of settlers by aborigines in 1827 {{appear to have been}} part of a coordinated effort to drive the settlers away. The conflict and violence was from both Europeans and aborigines, though more the former than latter. European disease, deliberate killings, forced exile to the islands of Bass Strait, and the driving of the natives from their land and food sources reduced their population. This reduction was such that during an 1834 visit George Augustus Robinson, Protector of Aborigines, could find only one woman in the area. There are only records of two colonists killed by the Pallittorre. The number of Pallittorre killed is not recorded; Shayne Breen—Lecturer in Aboriginal Studies at the University of Tasmania—has estimated more than one hundred. The removal of the Pallittorre from their land, a pattern echoed across Tasmania, was largely intentional. Deliberate policy, promulgated by Governor Arthur, was to remove the native population from the land and grant it to European settlers.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth is {{the most}} {{elaborate}} and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns {{the murder of the}} god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often <b>violent</b> <b>conflict</b> ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} intra-state {{conflicts}} or ‘new wars’ in West Africa has brought {{many of its}} economies {{to the brink of}} collapse, creating humanitarian casualties and concerns. For decades, countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone, Côte d’Ivoire and Guinea- Bissau were crippled by conflicts and civil strife in which violence and incessant killings were prevalent. While <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts</b> are declining in the sub-region, recent insurgencies in the Sahel region affecting the West African countries of Mali, Niger and Mauritania and low intensity conflicts surging within notably stable countries such as Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal sends alarming signals of the possible re-surfacing of internal and regional <b>violent</b> <b>conflicts.</b> These conflicts are often hinged on several factors including poverty, human rights violations, bad governance and corruption, ethnic marginalization and small arms proliferation. Although many actors including the ECOWAS, civil society and international community have been making efforts, conflicts continue to persist in the sub-region and their resolution is often protracted.
