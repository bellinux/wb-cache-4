In this work, we investigate to which extent such contributions influence, {{under a variety of}} hydrodynamic conditions, the force at the anchor point of a tethered cell and the survival probability of a bacterium that is attached to a host by either a slip or a catch bond via a tether with a few different biomechanical properties. We show that a consequence of not including some of these contributions is that the force to which a bond is exposed can be significantly underestimated; in general by ~ 32 - 46 %, where the influence of the surface corrections dominate (the parallel and normal correction coefficients contribute with ~ 5 - 8 or 23 - 26 %, respectively). The Basset force is a major contributor, up to 20 %, for larger cells and shear rates. The lift force and inertia contribute when cells with radii > 3 micrometer reside in shear rates > 2000 1 /s. Buoyancy contributes significantly for cells with radii > 3 micrometer in shear rates < 10 1 /s. Since the lifetime of a bond depends strongly on the force, both the level of approximations and the biomechanical model of the tether significantly affect the survival probability of tethered bacteria. For a cell attached with a FimH-mannose bond and an extendable tether in a shear rate of 3000 1 /s, neglecting the surface correction coefficients or the Basset force can imply that the survival probability is overestimated by more than an order of magnitude. This work thus shows that in order to quantitatively assess bacterial attachment forces and survival probabilities, both the fluid forces and the tether properties need to be modeled accurately.

30|$|Many factors {{affect the}} {{asphaltene}} deposition phenomena {{in the flow}} of petroleum reservoir fluids. Generally, in every flow regime (laminar or turbulent), it is always possible to find a narrow layer (the <b>viscous</b> or laminar <b>sub-layer)</b> of fluid near the wall. Within this layer, the dominating transport mechanism is molecular diffusion. In the center, on the other hand, the transport mechanism depends upon flow regime and the distribution form of momentum, heat, and mass species (Mirzayi et al. 2013). It is observed that the asphaltene deposition is a transient process. It is usually characterized by cycles of initial deposition followed by rapid incomplete erosion (Arsalan et al. 2014). In a dynamic deposition process in the well string, in addition to the effect of change in pressure, temperature, and composition, shear on the wall has a great impact on the asphaltene deposition.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{stage in}} rocky-shore seaweed life {{history is the}} recruitment process involving external fertilisation and then settlement of the propagules on a suitable substrate. The ultimate step in this settlement stage is the crossing of the <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer</b> and attachment to the substrate. Given the extreme conditions met in the intertidal zone, propagules can be dislodged at any time before they secure a strong enough anchoring. Flow conditions and propagule properties are key to this process. The settlement process under turbulent conditions was recreated within a stirred benthic chamber for five different species. Whereas propagule properties (size, density) vary with species, and propagules are adapted to the different conditions in the intertidal, they exhibit the same settlement behaviour. They nevertheless exhibit different settling velocities and settlement thresholds. Several methods of characterisation of the tank flow from particle tracking velocimetry and acoustic Doppler velocimetry data are reviewed, {{as well as an}} analytical model. Turbulent settling was found to be independent of the well-mixed tank bulk flow and to depend only on the boundary-layer mechanics. A model of settlement threshold is presented from which propagule mucilage adhesiveness estimates are derived, leading to good correlations between adult plant exposure and the stickiness of its propagules and to the conclusion that settlement can only occur in calm conditions. To extend the work, computational fluid dynamic techniques are developed by extending the Gerris Flow Solver. A 2 -D approach to tank modelling and a pilot study of expansion to 3 -D is described. This extends the perspective given by the experiments, notably through output of the hydrodynamical forces experienced by the propagules.

40|$|Properties of superhydrophobic {{materials}} are examined {{in light of}} their possible use for drag reduction in naval applications. To achieve superhydrophobicity a low-surface-energy material must be structured so as to minimize the liquid-solid interactions. The crucial aspect is that of maintaining a layer of gas in between the (rough) wall and the liquid, and this can be achieved by hierarchical micro- and nano-structuring of the solid surface, to ensure a sufficiently large apparent slip of the fluid at the wall, thus reducing skin friction. The behavior of the liquid is quantified by a slip length; recent results have shown that this length can be as large as 400 µm. As far as transition to turbulence is concerned, we show that superhydrophobic surfaces are effective (i. e. they delay the onset of travelling instability waves) only in channels with characteristic dimensions of a few millimeters. Conversely, when the fluid flow has already attained a turbulent state, the gain in term of drag reduction can be very significant also in macroscopic configurations. This occurs because the relevant length scale of the boundary layer is now the thickness of the <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer,</b> which can be of magnitude comparable to the slip length, so that an effective coupling emerges.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} orientational {{behaviour}} of fibres within a suspension influences the rheological and mechanical properties of that suspension. An Eulerian-Lagrangian framework {{to simulate the}} behaviour of fibres in turbulent flows is presented. The framework is intended for use in simulations of nonspherical particles with high Reynolds numbers, beyond the Stokesian regime, and is a computationally efficient alternative to existing Stokesian models for fibre suspensions in turbulent flow. It is based on modifying available empirical drag correlations for the translation of non-spherical particles to be orientation dependent, accounting for the departure in shape from a sphere. The orientational dynamics of a particle {{is based on the}} framework of quaternions, while its rotational dynamics is obtained from the solution of the Euler equation of rotation subject to external torques on the particle. The fluid velocity and turbulence quantities are obtained using a very high-resolution large eddy simulation with dynamic calibration of the sub-grid scale energy containing fluid motions. The simulation matrix consists of four different fibre Stokes numbers (St = 1, 5, 25 and 125) and five different fibre aspect ratios (λ = 1. 001, 3, 10, 30 and 50), with results considered at four distances from a channel wall (in the viscous sublayer, buffer and fully turbulent regions), which are taken as a measure of the flow velocity gradient, all at a constant fibre to fluid density ratio (ρp/ρ = 760) and shear Reynolds number Reτ = 150. The simulated fibre orientation, concentration and streakiness confirms previous experimentally observed characteristics of fibre behaviour in turbulence, and that of direct numerical simulations of fibres in Stokesian, or creeping flow, regimes. The fibres exhibit translational motion similar to spheres, where they tend to accumulate in the near-wall (<b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer</b> and buffer) region and preferentially concentrate in regions of low-speed streaks. The current results further demonstrate that the fibres’ translational dynamics, in terms of preferential concentration, is strongly dependent on their inertia and less so on their aspect ratio. However, the contrary is the case for the fibre alignment distribution as this is strongly dependent on the fibre aspect ratio and velocity gradient, and only moderately dependent on particle inertia. The fibre alignment with the flow direction is found to be mostly anisotropic where the velocity gradient is large (i. e. <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer</b> and buffer regions), but is virtually non-existent and isotropic where the turbulence is near-isotropic (i. e. channel centre). The present investigation highlights that the level of fibre alignment with the flow direction reduces as a fibre’s inertia decreases, and as the shape of the fibre approaches that of a sphere. Short fibres, and especially near-spherical λ  1. 001 particles, are found to exhibit isotropic orientation with respect to all directions, whilst sufficiently long fibres align themselves parallel to the flow direction, and orthogonal to the other two co-ordinate directions, and the vorticity and flow velocity gradient directions...|$|E

By means of single-line correlation it is further possible to extract the near wall velocity profile in the <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer,</b> both time-averaged as well as instantaneous, which can then be used to estimate the wall shear rate and with it the shear stress τ_w and friction velocity u_τ. Finally initial results of the ongoing measurement campaign on an adverse pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer are presented...|$|E
40|$|Air-water {{interaction}} flow {{between two}} parallel flat plates, known as Couette flow, is simulated by direct numerical simulation. The two flowing fluids are coupled through continuity of velocity and shear stress condition across the interface. Pseudo-spectral method {{is used in}} each flow subdomain with Fourier expansion in streamwise and spanwise directions and finite difference in vertical direction. Statistically quasi-steady flow properties, such as mean velocity profiles, turbulent intensities, Reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget terms show significant differences between air-water interface turbulence near the water side (IntT-w) and wall-bounded turbulence(WT) while there are some similarities between IntT-w and free surface turbulence (FST). Due to the velocity fluctuation at the interface, water side near interface turbulence flow (IntT-w) is characterized with a thinner <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer</b> and decreased intercept parameter B in log-law layer, strengthened Reynolds stress and eddy viscosity, together with a stronger production term, decreasing-then-increasing dissipation term and negative turbulent diffusion term in TKE budget. (cont.) Abundant physical phenomena exist on the water side turbulent flow with four major types of three-dimensional vortex structures identified near the interface by variable-interval spacing averaging (VISA) techniques. Each type of vortex structures is found to play {{an essential role in}} the turbulent energy balance and passive scalar transport. by Song Liu. Thesis (S. M. in Mechanical Engineering and S.

40|$|This journal vol. entitled: The 10 th International Symposium on Electrokinetic PhenomenaThis {{study is}} devoted to the {{modeling}} of the deposition of individual particles onto a clean membrane surface in cross-flow filtration systems. Comprehensive force analysis approach is applied, which accounts for the random Brownian force and the polar component of the particle-membrane interactive forces. The inclusion of the polar interactive force is important in that when a hydrophilic membrane is involved, it can easily predominate over the rest of lateral forces in the near-field. The repulsive polar particle-membrane interaction can greatly decrease the stability of the particle on the membrane surface. In the far-field that is about 0. 1. μm or farther away from the membrane, the particle transport is primarily dictated by the hydrodynamic lift and drag forces and the Brownian force. In sharp contrast to semi- or non-Brownian particles, the transport trajectory of Brownian particle is hardly definitive. The filtration flux and the cross-flow velocity can influence the particle transport trajectory of all sizes. Nevertheless, the existence of critical flux or critical cross-flow velocity is more evident for non-Brownian particles. Above the critical cross-flow rate or below the critical flux, particle deposition is minimized. Under appropriate operational conditions, a force-balanced level exists in the <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer</b> for a particular particle size, which is independent of the initial position of the particle. The model can be expanded further for more complicated water filtration conditions. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|A high {{frame rate}} {{camera and a}} {{continuous}} wave laser are used to capture long particle image sequences exceeding 100, 000 consecutive frames at framing frequencies up to 20 kHz. The electronic shutter of the high-speed CMOS camera is reduced to 10 microseconds to prevent excessive particle image streaking. The combination of large image number and high frame rate is possible by limiting {{the field of view}} to a narrow strip, primarily to capture temporally resolved profiles of velocity and derived quantities, such as vorticity as well as higher order statistics. Multi-frame PIV processing algorithms are employed to improve the dynamic range of recovered PIV data. The recovered data is temporally well resolved and provides sufficient samples for statistical convergence of the fluctuating velocity components. The measurement technique is demonstrated on a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer inside a small wind tunnel with Re_δ = 4800, Re_τ = 240 and Re_θ = 515. The chosen magnification permits a reliable estimation of the mean velocity profile down to a few wall units and yields statistical information such as the Reynolds stress components and probability density functions. By means of single-line correlation it is further possible to extract the near wall velocity profile in the <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer,</b> both time-averaged as well as instantaneous, which permits the estimation the wall shear rate γ̇ and along with it the shear stress τ_w and friction velocity u_τ. This data is then used for the calculation of space-time correlation maps of wall shear stress and velocity...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{numerical}} investigation of the flow field around a 45 ° wing-wall bridge abutment in three different scour conditions: beginning of the process, logarithmic phase and equilibrium stage. The flow field was computed using a wall-resolving large eddy simulation (a simulation where the near-wall <b>viscous</b> <b>sub-layer</b> is directly resolved) and the bathymetric data were taken from physical experiments with an equivalent geometry. The correlation between the flow field coherent structures and the bottom bed statistics was investigated, focusing mainly on the bed shear stress amplification and the near-wall pressure gradients. The results show the importance of the instantaneous flow field and its intermittency on the space-time distribution of the stresses at the bottom wall. The probability distributions of the wall shear stress was found to remain nearly similar to that of a straight duct flow up to the upstream edge of the scour hole; within the scour, in the upstream corner of the abutment the standard deviations of the wall shear stress was found to increase due to splat phenomenon of the downflow and to the presence of rare events with very intense values of wall shear stress. The horizontal pressure gradients evolution depends on the location whereas the vertical pressure gradients show a general increase in the logarithmic phase and a decrease going toward the equilibrium stage. The {{results of the present study}} may be helpful to formulate new physical-based local scour models to be used for practical evaluation of the scour depth around bridge abutments...|$|E
