25|$|The {{emptying}} {{can be done}} manually with {{shovels and}} buckets (manual scavenging), with manually powered pumps or with motorized pumps mounted on a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> which carries a tank for storage. For the fecal sludge to be pumpable, water usually needs {{to be added to}} the pit and the content stirred up, which is messy and smelly.|$|E
25|$|Septic tanks {{have to be}} pumped {{periodically}} by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> {{to eliminate}} non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.|$|E

50|$|Several {{types of}} non {{centralized}} sanitation systems {{are served by}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks.</b> They are used to empty septage from cesspits, septic tanks, pit latrines and communal latrines, for street cleanup, for sewer clean out, and for individual septic systems. The trucks {{are used in the}} cleaning of sanitary sewer pumping stations. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> are used to empty portable toilets. In commercial aviation, <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> are used to collect waste from airplane toilets.|$|R

50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> {{are used}} by town, and municipal, governments, and by {{commercial}} entities around the world.|$|R
5000|$|When a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> {{is used to}} {{transport}} fecal sludge then {{it can also be}} called [...] "fecal sludge truck".|$|E
50|$|A vehicle {{which is}} purely a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> {{has a long}} wide {{flexible}} hose without the big solid nozzle with controls on.|$|E
50|$|Compost can {{generate}} revenues since it replaces expensive fertilizer. If septage is discharged on land for composting, each <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> requires one hectare {{of land for}} composting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> {{are used}} to {{transport}} the collected material to a treatment or disposal site, for example a sewage treatment plant.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> {{are used}} in the {{petroleum}} industry, for cleaning of storage tanks and spills. They are also an important part of drilling oil and natural gas wells, as they are located at the drilling site. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> are used to remove drilling mud, drilling cuttings, cement, spills, and for removal of brine water from production tanks. They dispose of this in sump pits, treatment plants or if within safe levels may be spread out in a farmer's field.|$|R
5000|$|FFG also {{manufactures}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks,</b> {{which are}} high pressure sewer flushers and vacuums, under {{the brand name}} [...] "Elephant", which are used for duct cleaning.|$|R
5000|$|The rate of {{accumulation}} of sludge - also called septage or fecal sludge - is {{faster than the}} rate of decomposition. Therefore, the accumulated fecal sludge must be periodically removed which is commonly done with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{collected}} fecal sludge may {{be transported}} to treatment plants via a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck,</b> a motorcycle tanker, {{or even a}} hand cart. Often, mobile or permanent transfer stations are used to improve the efficiency of fecal sludge transportation.|$|E
50|$|Septage {{waste is}} {{periodically}} removed (with a frequency depending on tank capacity, system efficiency, and usage level, but typically {{less often than}} annually) from the septic tanks by specialized vehicles known as <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck.</b> They pump the septage out of the tank, and transport it to a treatment facility.|$|E
50|$|Efforts {{were made}} {{to clean up the}} {{affected}} area, such as <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks,</b> and avoid further environmental impact, like affecting wildlife. On 19 July, one duck was found dead from the spill.|$|R
50|$|Commercial <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> which collect fecal sludge {{usually have}} a volume of 10 - 55 cubic metres. However various smaller {{versions}} for specialized applications or low-resource settings can be found with tanks as small as 500 liters.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> {{discharge}} these wastes to {{the sewer}} network, to a wastewater treatment plant, or—usually illegally, {{for example in}} many developing countries—into the environment. The latter practice, called [...] "institutionalised open defecation", is dangerous since it constitutes a public health and environmental hazard.|$|R
50|$|A suction {{excavator}} produces powerful suction {{through a}} wide pipe which {{is up to}} 30 cm or so in diameter. The suction inlet air speed may be up to 100 m/s. Its construction is somewhat like a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> (gully emptier) but with a wider suction hose and a more powerful suction.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{trucks are}} also used for exposing {{underground}} utilities. The ground is jetted with water, and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> sucks up the muddy product. This exposes the buried utility {{without the possibility of}} damage, as would be possible if a digging machine were used (i.e. tractor backhoe, tracked or wheeled excavator, ditch witches).|$|E
50|$|The {{emptying}} {{can be done}} manually with {{shovels and}} buckets (manual scavenging), with manually powered pumps or with motorized pumps mounted on a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> which carries a tank for storage. For the fecal sludge to be pumpable, water usually needs {{to be added to}} the pit and the content stirred up, which is messy and smelly.|$|E
50|$|Airports can {{generate}} significant water pollution {{due to their}} extensive use and handling of jet fuel, lubricants and other chemicals. Airports install spill control structures and related equipment (e.g., <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks,</b> portable berms, absorbents) to prevent chemical spills, and mitigate the impacts of spills that do occur.|$|R
50|$|HDS {{systems are}} not maintenance-intensive, when {{compared}} with land-based BMP’s. Each manufactured system is different, therefore maintenance and inspection requirements should be looked at closely when purchasing an HDS system. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> are typically used for maintenance, so unobstructed access to accumulated pollutants for removal is critical.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} of catchbasins at removing sediment and other pollutants {{depends on the}} design of the catchbasin (for example, the size of the sump), and on routine maintenance to retain the storage available in the sump to capture sediment. Municipalities typically have large <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> that perform this task.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{portable}} toilet {{technologies are}} used as public toilets. Portables can be moved into place where and when needed and are popular at outdoor festivals and events. A portable toilet can either {{be connected to the}} local sewage system or store the waste in a holding tank until it is emptied by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck.</b> Portable composting toilets require removal of the container to a composting facility.http://www.naturalevent.com.au/#slice7 ...|$|E
50|$|Septic tanks {{have to be}} pumped {{periodically}} by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> {{to eliminate}} non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.|$|E
50|$|Smaller tank trucks, with a {{capacity}} of less than 3000 gal are typically used to deal with light liquid cargo within a local community. A common example is <b>vacuum</b> <b>truck</b> used to empty several septic tanks and then deliver the collected fecal sludge to a treatment site. These tank trucks typically have a maximum capacity of 3000 gal. They are equipped with a pumping system to serve their particular need.|$|E
50|$|Mobile {{transfer}} {{stations are}} nothing more than larger tanker trucks or trailers that are deployed along with small <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> and motorcycle or hand carts. The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models.|$|R
25|$|Some {{advanced}} transfer {{stations and}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>trucks</b> can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may {{be placed in}} sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants. This allows more sludge {{to be dealt with}} more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants.|$|R
