Here, we describe how the global proteome machine (GPM) {{can be used for}} protein identification and for validation of the results. We cover identification by searching protein sequence collections and spectral libraries as well as validation of the results using expectation values, rho-diagrams, and spectrum databases. Key words: Proteomics, Mass spectrometry, Protein identification, Spectrum libraries, <b>Validation</b> <b>Mass</b> spectrometry-based protein identification has become an invaluable tool for elucidating protein function, and several meth-ods have been developed for protein identification, including sequence collection searching with masses of peptides or their fragments, spectral library searching, and de novo sequencing (Fig. 1). The first step in protein identification is to find peaks in the mass spectra that correspond to peptides and their fragments. It is important to find all the relevant peaks {{and at the same time}} minimizing the number of background peaks. This can be achieved by scanning the spectra for peaks of the expected width and selecting peaks above a signal to noise threshold (see Note 1), and then picking the monoisotopic peak for each isotope cluster (see Note 2). After picking the peaks, spectra with low information content that could not produce any meaningful results can be removed to increase the speed of subsequent analysis (1) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to have a good {{understanding}} of the environmental impact of glucose production. Glucose is generally produced from corn or wheat. Since agricultural processes are known to be difficult to evaluate by LCA, the results obtained with two different LCA databases, Gabi and EcoInvent, are compared in this work. The production of glucose from raw materials can be divided in two steps: the agricultural step allowing the plant production, and the conversion step including the extraction of the starch from the plant and its hydrolysis into glucose. Preliminary results underline the high impact of the agricultural step, so a special attention has been paid to these data. Specific Belgian data collected by the Walloon Agricultural Research Centre (CRA-W) (2014) [1] have been used as primary data (yield, amount of fertilizers, etc.), either using EcoInvent or Gabi datasets background data to model fertilizers, diesel consumption, etc. A third model was built using only data available in Ecoinvent for corn and wheat cultures. For the conversion step, literature data have been used along with some industrial data.

40|$|Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomic {{technologies}} {{have increased the}} speed of analysis and the depth provided by a single analysis. Computational tools to evaluate the accuracy of peptide identifications from these high-throughput analyses have not kept pace with technological advances; currently the most common quality evaluation methods are based on statistical analysis of the likelihood of false positive identifications in large-scale data sets. While helpful, these calculations do not consider the accuracy of each identification, thus creating a precarious situation for biologists relying on the data to inform experimental design. Manual validation is the gold standard approach to confirm accuracy of database identifications, but is extremely time-intensive. To palliate the increasing time required to manually validate large proteomic datasets, we provide computer aided manual validation software (CAMV) to expedite the process. Relevant spectra are collected, catalogued, and pre-labeled, allowing users to efficiently judge the quality of each identification and summarize applicable quantitative information. CAMV significantly reduces the burden associated with manual validation and will hopefully encourage broader adoption of manual <b>validation</b> in <b>mass</b> spectrometry-based proteomics.

40|$|Bubbling {{fluidized}} bed technology {{is one of}} the most effective mean for interaction between solid and gas flow, mainly due to its good mixing and high heat and mass transfer rate. It has been widely used at a commercial scale for drying of grains such as in pharmaceutical, fertilizers and food industries. When applied to drying of non-pours moist solid particles, the water is drawn-off driven by the difference in water concentration between the solid phase and the fluidizing gas. In most cases, the fluidizing gas or drying agent is air. Despite of the simplicity of its operation, the design of a bubbling {{fluidized bed}} dryer requires an understanding of the combined complexity in hydrodynamics and the mass transfer mechanism. On the other hand, reliable mass transfer coefficient equations are also required to satisfy the growing interest in mathematical modelling and simulation, for accurate prediction of the process kinetics. This chapter presents an overview of the various mechanisms contributing to particulate drying in a bubbling fluidized bed and the mass transfer coefficient corresponding to each mechanism. In addition, a case study on measuring the overall mass transfer coefficient is discussed. These measurements are then used for the <b>validation</b> of <b>mass</b> transfer coefficient correlations and for assessing the various assumptions used in developing these correlations...|$|R

With {{respect to the}} method by Swenson et al.,the proposed approach exploits noise covariance information of both input data sets and thusproduces stochastically optimal solutions supplied with realistic error information. Numericalsimulations show {{that the quality of}} degree- 1 and - 2 coefficients may be increased in this wayby about 30 per cent in terms of RMS error. We also proved that the proposed approach can bereduced to the approach of Sun et al. provided that the GRACE data are noise-free and noise inoceanic data is white. Subsequently, we evaluate the quality of the resulting degree- 1 and C 20 coefficients by estimating mass anomaly time-series within carefully selected <b>validation</b> areas,where <b>mass</b> transport is small.

Right atrial appendages from 10 patients with hemodynamically significant isolated aortic valve disease and from 10 patients with isolated symptomatic coronary heart disease were collected during elective cardiac surgery. As presented in an earlier study by our group (Baykut et al., 2006), both disease forms showed clearly different pattern distribution characteristics. Interesting enough, the classification patterns {{could be used for}} correctly sorting unknown test samples in their correct categories. However, in order to fully exploit and also validate these findings there is a definite need for unambiguous identification of the differences between different etiologies at molecular level.

Currently, safety assessment involves consideration {{of the source of}} the introduced protein, in silico amino acid sequence homology comparisons to known allergens, physicochemical properties, protein abundance in the crop, and, when appropriate, specific immunoglobulin E binding studies. Recently conducted research presented at an International Life Sciences Institute/Health and Environmental Sciences Institute–hosted workshop adds to the scientific foundation for safety assessment of transgenic proteins in five areas: structure/activity, serum screening, animal models, quantitative proteomics, and basic mechanisms. A web-based tool is now available that integrates a database of allergenic proteins with a variety of computational tools which could be used to improve our ability to predict allergenicity based on structural analysis. A comprehensive strategy and model protocols have been developed for conducting meaningful serum screening, an extremely challenging process.

The mass balance model runs at daily steps and 100 m spatial resolution, while the regional model (REMO) RCM provides daily grids (∼ 18 km resolution) of dynamically downscaled reanalysis data. A combination of interpolation techniques and simple subgrid parameterizations is applied to bridge the gap in spatial resolution and to obtain daily input fields of air temperature, global radiation, and precipitation. Interpolation schemes are a key element and thus we test different interpolators. For <b>validation,</b> computed <b>mass</b> balances are compared to stake measurements and time series (1979 – 2003) of observed mass balance. The meteorological input fields are compared to measurements at weather stations. The applied inverse distance weighting introduces systematic biases due to spatial autocorrelation, whereas thin plate splines preserve the characteristics of the RCM output. While summer melt at point locations on several glaciers is well reproduced by the model, accumulation is mostly underestimated. These systematic shifts are correlated to biases of the meteorological input fields. Time series of mass balance obtained from the model run agree well with observed time series. We conclude that the gap in spatial resolution is not a major drawback, given that interpolators and parameterizations are selected upon detailed considerations.

The study compared three different Fourier transform NIR acquisition methods, namely, a fibre-optic probe for solid samples (SP), an integrating sphere (IS) and an emission head (EH). Fruit quality attributes measured included mass, colour index, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), maturity index expressed as TSS:TA ratio and vitamin C. Partial least squares regression was applied to spectral data to develop prediction models for each quality attribute and by randomly dividing the data into calibration and independent validation sets. To test robustness, a set of fruit harvested from another location was used for external <b>validation.</b> Fruit <b>mass,</b> colour index, TSS and vitamin C were predicted with significant accuracy showing RPD-values of 3. 53, 1. 99, 1. 87 and 1. 33, respectively.

The models developed using the EH gave the best prediction statistics for mass (R = 0. 96, RMSEP = 10. 45 g), colour index (R = 0. 83, RMSEP = 0. 82) and vitamin C (R = 0. 66, 8. 01 mg/ 100 mL), while the IS gave the best prediction for TSS (R = 0. 83, RMSEP = 0. 58).

Our rainfall-runoff model confirms that northern Iraq suffered a drought between 2007 and 2009 and captures the annual cycle and longer trend of the observed GRACE data.

Therefore, we conducted a multicenter study investigating whether serum proteome profiling may serve as a noninvasive platform to discover novel molecular markers for MDS. We generated serum proteome profiles from 218 individuals by MS and identified a profile that distinguishes MDS from non-MDS cytopenias in a learning sample set.

40|$|The {{scientific}} and industrial demand for controllable thin gold (Au) film and Au nanostructures is increasing in many fields including opto-electronics, photovoltaics, MEMS devices, diagnostics, bio-molecular sensors, spectro-/microscopic surfaces and probes. In this study, a novel continuous flow electroless (CF-EL) Au plating method is developed to fabricate uniform Au thin films in ambient condition. The enhanced local mass transfer rate and continuous deposition resulting from CF-EL plating improved physical uniformity of deposited Au films and thermally transformed nanoparticles (NPs). Au films and NPs exhibited improved optical photoluminescence (PL) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), respectively, relative to batch immersion EL (BI-EL) plating. Suggested mass transfer models of Au mole deposition {{are consistent with}} optical feature of CF-EL and BI-EL films. The prototype CF-EL plating system is upgraded an automated scalable CF-EL plating system with real-time transmission UV-vis (T-UV) spectroscopy which provides the advantage of CF-EL plating, such as more uniform surface morphology, and overcomes the disadvantages of conventional EL plating, such as no continuous process and low deposition rate, using continuous process and controllable deposition rate. Throughout this work, dynamic morphological and chemical transitions during redox-driven self-assembly of Ag and Au film on silica surfaces under kinetic and equilibrium conditions are distinguished by correlating real-time T-UV spectroscopy with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements. The characterization suggests that four previously unrecognized time-dependent physicochemical regimes occur during consecutive EL deposition of silver (Ag) and Au onto tin-sensitized silica surfaces: self-limiting Ag activation; transitory Ag NP formation; transitional Au-Ag alloy formation during galvanic replacement of Ag by Au; and uniform morphology formation under controlled hydraulic conditions.

Aerosols were classified into four different categories according to their air mass origin: marine, marine modified, continental and Mediterranean. The PM 10 aerosol mass at 50 % relative humidity was close to 2. 5 μg m− 3 in the marine, 4. 3 μg m− 3 in the marine modified, 10. 3 μg m− 3 in the continental and 7. 7 μg m− 3 in the Mediterranean sectors. We noted that the influence of the air mass origin (on the chemical properties) could be seen especially on the PM 10 - 1. A significant PM 10 - 1 mode was found in marine, modified marine, and Mediterranean air masses, and PM 1 dominated in the continental air masses samples. As a result, the aerosol chemical composition variability at the puy de Dôme is a function of both the season and air mass type and we provide a chemical composition of the aerosol as a function of each of these environmental factors.

40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) {{is one of}} the most common leukemias in adults in the Western world characterized by the accumulation of mature-appearing B-cells in the peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues and bone marrow. The use of novel inhibitors targeting BCR- and PI 3 K-signaling in CLL as well as the application of CD 20 -antibodies in the clinic have led to improved outcome for the patients. Nevertheless, CLL remains an incurable disease and in order to develop new treatment strategies, there is still a strong need to elucidate the pathomechanism of CLL further. CLL is amongst other aspects a disease of the epigenome, displaying genome-wide hypomethylation while specific regions are hypermethylated, resulting in the deregulation of tumor suppressors, non-coding RNAs and oncogenes. Interestingly, DNA methylation in CLL patients was shown to be relatively stable over time suggesting that genes which are deregulated by this DNA modification are affected permanently, independent of disease stage and course. In this project, it was therefore aimed to identify and characterize genes deregulated in CLL by DNA methylation, which are likely involved in the pathomechanism of the disease. To this end, expression and methylation array profiling was conducted in CD 19 + sorted CLL cells and B-cells of healthy donors. Out of the 1, 866 genes identified as differentially expressed between cancer cells and their non-malignant counterpart, 33 showed significantly differentially methylated regions (DMR) that displayed negative correlation with gene expression. Technical <b>validation</b> using <b>mass</b> spectrometry based quantification of methylation confirmed the presence of DMRs in 17 of these genes including the transcription and stem cell factor KLF 4. KLF 4, of which repression and hypermethylation could be confirmed in a larger patient subset, was previously shown to play an important role in B-cell differentiation and maturation and further to act as tumor suppressor in other B-cell malignancies including classical- and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Moreover, KLF 4 was shown to be a downstream target of NOTCH 1 which is recurrently mutated and constitutively active in CLL. In fact, treatment of six different lymphoblastoid and leukemia cell lines and of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from eight CLL patients with γ-secretase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of NOTCH 1 activity and in the re-expression of KLF 4 on RNA and protein level, suggesting transcriptional regulation of KLF 4 by NOTCH 1. Furthermore, expression of KLF 4 was correlated with levels of BCL- 2 family members BAK, BAX and BCL- 2 as well as the cell cycle regulator CCND 1 in primary CLL and B-cells. Although, overexpression of KLF 4 in three leukemia cell lines did not induce apoptosis in these cells, it resulted in the deregulation of a number of genes involved in prominent signaling pathways which are highly relevant for the pathogenesis of CLL, including BCR- and PI 3 K-signaling. In summary, these findings suggest the repression of KLF 4 by DNA promoter methylation and NOTCH signaling in CLL. Overexpression of KLF 4 results in the deregulation of genes involved in signaling pathways important for B-cells which indicates that KLF 4 is in part involved in keeping the CLL cells in a highly activated state...|$|R
40|$|The {{generation}} of synthesis gas from methane is currently performed by conventional steam reforming or by partial oxidation (POX) in fixed-bed reactors using nickel or noble metal based catalysts at temperatures around 900 °C. In {{the last years}} several new reactor concepts were suggested to intensify the heat exchange, e. g. auto thermal reformers, catalytic coated wall reactors, fluidised bed or membrane reactors [1]. Improved POX of methane is currently the most promising direction for better {{generation of}} synthesis gas, in particular if oxygen is fed in a distributed manner separated from air using O 2 -selective mixed conducting membranes. The industrial applicability of this concept depends {{on the availability of}} suitable selective tubular membranes characterised by thin walls to intensify the mass and heat transfer. In addition to the desired slightly exothermic partial oxidation in such reactors also the highly exothermic total oxidation can take place. The related heat generation can be exploited by coupling with conventional steam reforming to realise a potential auto thermal operating mode. Based on experimental results characterising a new type of mixed conducting hollow fibre membranes (BaCoxFeyZrzO 3 -δ,BCFZ, produced by spinning) the operating behaviour of a membrane reactor integrating the process steps air separation, selective O 2 transfer in the BCFZ and oxidation of methane with simultaneous steam reforming was evaluated. The estimation and <b>validation</b> of <b>mass</b> transfer parameters for characterisation of the membrane was based on systematic experiments [2]. The derived equations describing the mass transport in the membrane as well as kinetic approaches for the rates of oxidation and steam reforming of methane coming from the literature [3, 4, 5] were implemented in a detailed two dimensional pseudo homogeneous reactor model. Comparing with predictions of a reduced 1 -D model this model was found necessary for a detailed analysis of the pronounced concentration, temperature and velocity fields. The fibre membrane is placed in the reactor housing and separates the reactor in air providing side (tube) and synthesis gas side (shell). The following arrangements of the used catalyst in the membrane reactor were investigated: a) catalyst bed, b) catalyst coated hollow fibre c) structured catalyst bed, d) hollow fibre and catalyst separated by an additionally Al 2 O 3 membrane. Depending on the catalyst arrangement the obtained hot spot can be located directly on the membrane, which leads under unfavourable operation conditions to an inactivation or melting of the hollow fibre. It will be shown, that the essential temperature effects and the performance of the investigated concept can be described only using a more detailed two dimensional reactor model.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a burst of}} studies in the rapidly developing field of “epitranscriptomics”, which encompasses post-transcriptional changes of transcripts that have a functional relevance. Several new experimental approaches coupled with high-throughput-sequencing enabled the transcriptome-wide mapping of various RNA modifications, including those that are guided by the well-characterized small nucleolar RNAs (snoR-NAs). In the projects presented in this thesis, we {{have taken advantage of}} these new tools to comprehensively examine snoRNA functions in various cellular systems as well as in a health/disease context. The first question that we set to answer is how complete is the catalog of human snoRNAs and snoRNA pro-cessing products, since it is known that a variety of small RNAs derive from other RNAs with well-known functions such as tRNAs and snoRNAs. To answer this question we sequenced long and short RNAs, RNA fragments ob-tained in photoreactive nucleotide-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) of core snoRNA-associated proteins and small RNAs that co-precipitate with the Argonaute 2 (Ago 2) protein. A striking outcome of this study was that virtually all C/D box snoRNAs are specifically processed inside the regions of terminal com-plementarity, retaining in the mature form only 4 - 5 nucleotides upstream of the C box and 2 - 5 nucleotides down-stream of the D box. Further we found several new non-coding RNA targets that were repeatedly identified as bound by the core snoRNPs and that were validated as carrying 2 ’-O-methyl sites and/or pseudouridines. Analysis of the total and Ago 2 -associated populations of small RNAs in human cells revealed that despite their cellular abundance, snoRNA-derived small RNAs are not efficiently incorporated into the Ago 2 protein. We therefore con-cluded that a miRNA-like function for these products in human is unlikely. Identification of the targets for the many newly discovered regulatory RNAs remains a challenge. To address this problem, in a second project, we combined two powerful experimental high-throughput methods (CLIP-seq and RiboMeth-seq) with computational modelling to map 2 ’-O-methylation sites in human rRNA and to comprehen-sively associate C/D box guide snoRNAs with targets. We thereby determined that many “orphan” snoRNAs ap-pear to guide 2 ’-O-ribose methylation at sites that are targeted by other snoRNAs. Moreover, we found that snoRNAs can be reliably captured in interaction with many mRNAs, yet a subsequent 2 ’-O-methylation of these mRNAs cannot be detected. Our study provides a reliable approach to the comprehensive characterization of snoRNA-target interactions in species beyond those in which these interactions have been traditionally studied and contributes to the rapidly developing field of “epitranscriptomics”. Finally, we applied the same approach to study a particular group of orphan snoRNAs that have been implicated in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder called Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is characterized by excessive appe-tite, morbid obesity, mental and growth retardation, which are due to the loss of paternal expression of the ma-ternally imprinted SNORD 116 C/D box snoRNAs. snoRNP-CLIPs in mouse and human cell lines as well as mouse primary neurons revealed that SNORD 116 snoRNAs associate with snoRNP proteins, yet the RiboMeth-seq indi-cates {{that they do not have}} a primary snoRNP guide function. Nevertheless, the 2 ’-O-methylation landscape of wild-type mouse differs from that of a mouse model that does not express Snord 116, and the identified candidate target sites are now subject to <b>validation</b> by <b>mass</b> spectrometry. ...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} The improved survival {{of patients with}} lung cancer depends on early diagnosis of lung cancer. However, the traditional diagnostic techniques have several limitations. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been applied as a core technology for cancer diagnosis in preliminary proteomic studies. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore the differences in the serum peptide levels of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and healthy individuals using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) -time-of-flight (TOF) -MS. A NSCLC serum classification model was then established. Methods One hundred and thirty three cases of patients with NSCLC serum specimens and 132 cases of healthy human serum specimens were randomly divided into two groups in accordance with the ratio of three to one without age and gender differences. The training group was used to establish the classification model, this group included serum samples from 100 NSCLC cases and 100 healthy individuals. The test group for validating the proposed model was composed of the remaining serum samples from 33 NSCLC cases and 32 healthy individuals. Peptides were extracted from the samples using magnetic beads- immobilized metal affinity capture - copper, and their mass spectra were obtained using an automated MALDI-TOF-MS system. The MS data from the training group was analyzed using the ClinproToolTM software to identify the individual peptide fragments and establish the classification model. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were verified by blind testing with the test group. Results Among the 131 different peptide peaks, ranging from m/z 1, 000 Da to 10, 000 Da, 14 peaks were significantly different in the NSCLC samples of the training group, as compared with the controls (P< 0. 000, 001; AUC≥ 0. 9); these included 2 higher peaks and 12 lower peaks. The classification model was established, and the test group was verified for only 3 peptide peaks (7, 478. 59, 2, 271. 44 and 4, 468. 38 Da), which were selected by the statistical software. Blind testing revealed that the proposed method had 100 % sensitivity, 96. 9 % specificity and 98. 5 % accuracy. Conclusion Our results showed that the serum peptide levels were significantly different between NSCLC patients and healthy individuals. A serum peptide-based classification of NSCLC patients was established using an automated MALDI-TOF-MS system. This method demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in a small-scale test. Future studies should test the proposed model through <b>mass</b> <b>validation.</b> The model could be compared or combined with traditional diagnostic methods to establish novel techniques for the early diagnosis of patients with NSCLC...|$|R
40|$|Cdc 48 /p 97 is an essential, highly {{abundant}} hexameric {{member of}} the AAA (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family. It {{has been linked to}} a variety of processes throughout the cell but it is best known for its role in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In this system it is believed that Cdc 48 behaves as a segregase, transducing the chemical energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force to separate ubiquitin-conjugated proteins from their tightly-bound partners. Current models posit that Cdc 48 is linked to its substrates through a variety of adaptor proteins, including a family of seven proteins (13 in humans) that contain a Cdc 48 -binding UBX domain. As such, due to the complexity of the network of adaptor proteins for which it serves as the hub, Cdc 48 /p 97 has the potential to exert a profound influence on the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. However, the number of known substrates of Cdc 48 /p 97 remains relatively small, and smaller still is the number of substrates that have been linked to a specific UBX domain protein. As such, the goal of this dissertation research has been to discover new substrates and better understand the functions of the Cdc 48 network. With this objective in mind, we established a proteomic screen to assemble a catalog of candidate substrate/targets of the Ubx adaptor system. Here we describe the implementation and optimization of a cutting-edge quantitative mass spectrometry method to measure relative changes in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. Utilizing this technology, and in order to better understand the breadth of function of Cdc 48 and its adaptors, we then performed a global screen to identify accumulating ubiquitin conjugates in cdc 48 - 3 and ubxΔ mutants. In this screen different ubx mutants exhibited reproducible patterns of conjugate accumulation that differed greatly from each other, pointing to various unexpected functional specializations of the individual Ubx proteins. As <b>validation</b> of our <b>mass</b> spectrometry findings, we then examined in detail the endoplasmic-reticulum bound transcription factor Spt 23, which we identified as a putative Ubx 2 substrate. In these studies ubx 2 Δ cells were deficient in processing of Spt 23 to its active p 90 form, and in localizing p 90 to the nucleus. Additionally, consistent with reduced processing of Spt 23, ubx 2 Δ cells demonstrated a defect in expression of their target gene OLE 1, a fatty acid desaturase. Overall, this work demonstrates the power of proteomics as a tool to identify new targets of various pathways and reveals Ubx 2 as a key regulator lipid membrane biosynthesis. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to predict crop growth of year-round cut {{chrysanthemum}} (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) based on an empirical model of potential crop growth rate as a function of daily incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, MJ m¿ 2 d¿ 1), using generalized estimated parameters of the expolinear growth equation. For development of the model, chrysanthemum crops were grown in four experiments at different plant densities (32, 48, 64 and 80 plants m¿ 2), during different seasons (planting in January, May¿June and September) and under different light regimes [natural light, shading to 66 and 43 % of natural light, and supplementary assimilation light (ASS, 40 ¿ 48 µmol m¿ 2 s¿ 1) ]. The expolinear growth equation as a function of time (EXPOT) or as a function of incident PAR integral (EXPOPAR) effectively described periodically measured total dry mass of shoot (R 2 > 0 · 98). However, growth parameter estimates for the fitted EXPOPAR were more suitable as they were not correlated to each other. Coefficients of EXPOPAR characterized the relative growth rate per incident PAR integral [rm,i (MJ m¿ 2) ¿ 1] and light use efficiency (LUE, g MJ¿ 1) at closed canopy. In all four experiments, no interaction effects between treatments on crop growth parameters were found. rm,i and LUE were not different between ASS and natural light treatments, but were increased significantly when light levels were reduced by shading in the summer experiments. There was no consistent effect of plant density on growth parameters. rm,i and LUE showed hyperbolic relationships to average daily incident PAR averaged over 10 -d periods after planting (rm,i) or before final harvest (LUE). Based on those relationships, maximum relative growth rate (rm, g g¿ 1 d¿ 1) and maximum crop growth rate (cm, g m¿ 2 d¿ 1) were described successfully by rectangular hyperbolic relationships to daily incident PAR. In model <b>validation,</b> total dry <b>mass</b> of shoot (Wshoot, g m¿ 2) simulated over time was in good agreement with measured ones in three independent experiments, using daily incident PAR and leaf area index as inputs. Based on these results, it is concluded that the expolinear growth equation is a useful tool for quantifying cut chrysanthemum growth parameters and comparing growth parameter values between different treatments, especially when light is the growth-limiting factor. Under controlled environmental conditions the regression model worked satisfactorily, hence the model may be applied as a simple tool for understanding crop growth behaviour under seasonal variation in daily light integral, and for planning cropping systems of year-round cut chrysanthemum. However, further research on leaf area development in cut chrysanthemum is required to advance chrysanthemum crop growth predictio...|$|R
