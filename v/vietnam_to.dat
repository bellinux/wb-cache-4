5|$|The four {{objectives}} of the operation (which evolved over time) were to boost the sagging morale of the Saigon regime in the Republic of <b>Vietnam,</b> <b>to</b> persuade North <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> cease its support for the communist insurgency in South Vietnam without actually taking any ground forces into communist North <b>Vietnam,</b> <b>to</b> destroy North Vietnam's transportation system, industrial base, and air defenses, and to halt the flow of men and material into South Vietnam. Attainment of these objectives was made difficult by both the restraints imposed upon the U.S. and its allies by Cold War exigencies and by the military aid and assistance received by North Vietnam from its communist allies, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China (PRC) and North Korea.|$|E

Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam {{and the introduction of}} American combat troops, while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action.|$|E
5|$|When the Geneva Conference in July 1954 {{ended the}} First Indochina War, it handed North <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> Hồ Chí Minh's Việt Minh, {{and the south}} to the State of <b>Vietnam.</b> <b>To</b> reunify the country, {{national}} elections were scheduled for 1956, following which the French would withdraw from Indochina. The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified. Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947, Ba Cụt's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the partition, and {{that half of the}} country should not have been yielded to the communists.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> transfer {{wounded or}} sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation flights began on 1July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> Australia.|$|E

5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and military leaders of the U.S. and South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was {{a disaster for the}} ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E
5|$|COMIGAL {{dispatched}} inspection teams throughout South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> identify {{areas that}} were suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills. This required a search for arable land for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain approval and funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E

In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{was the largest}} allied military action mounted {{during the war in}} South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> that point, and the first fought at division level. Despite some success, the allied force was only able to partially clear the area and it remained a key communist transit and supply base throughout the war. The tunnels were later used as a staging area for the attack on Saigon during the 1968 Tet offensive before they were largely destroyed by heavy bombing from American B-52 bombers in 1970, ending their utility.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1964, the Viet Cong {{launched}} several {{attacks on}} U.S. military facilities in South Vietnam but Johnson {{did not start}} further retaliations against North Vietnam, {{as he tried to}} avoid upsetting U.S. public opinion during the 1964 United States Presidential Election. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, were experiencing political changes of their own as Nikita Khrushchev was removed from power. As leader of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev had begun the process of disengagement from Vietnam by reducing economic and military aid to North Vietnam. However, in the aftermath of Khrushchev's downfall, the Soviet government had to redefine their role in Southeast Asia, particularly in <b>Vietnam,</b> <b>to</b> compete with the growing influence of the People's Republic of China.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order to win the war. Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, the PAVN {{logistical}} system {{consisted of}} a two-lane paved (with crushed limestone and gravel) highway that ran from the mountain passes of North <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> the Chu Pong Massif in South Vietnam. By 1974 {{it was possible to}} travel a completely paved four-lane route from the Central Highlands to Tây Ninh Province, northwest of Saigon. The single oil pipeline that had once terminated near the A Shau Valley now consisted of four lines (the largest eight inches in diameter) and extended south to Lộc Ninh. In July 1973 the 259th Group as redesignated the Truong Son Command, the regimental sectors were converted to divisions, and the binh trams were designated as regiments. By late 1974 forces under the new command included AAA Division 377, Transportation Division 571, Engineering Division 473, the 968th Infantry Division, and sectoral divisions 470, 471, and 472.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Forrest, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Forrest, was a powerful tropical cyclone that prompted the evacuation of 600,000people in Bangladesh in late November1992. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing <b>Vietnam</b> <b>to</b> the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November20 as a Category4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November21 before dissipating early the next day.|$|E
