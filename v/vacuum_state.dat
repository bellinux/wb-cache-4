25|$|Any {{event that}} changes the number of {{observers}} in the universe may have experimental consequences. Quantum tunnelling to a new <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> would {{reduce the number of}} observers to zero (i.e., kill all life). Some cosmologists argue that the universe is in a false <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to a true <b>vacuum</b> <b>state.</b> This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to a true <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This {{can be thought of as}} a variation on quantum suicide.|$|E

Rarefaction waves are the unique solutions that may contain <b>vacuum</b> <b>states</b> in later time, {{in the context of}} one-dimensional Riemann problem, even when the Riemann initial data are away from the vacuum. For the multidimensional Euler equations describing isentropic or adiabatic fluids, we prove that plane rarefaction waves and <b>vacuum</b> <b>states</b> are stable within a large class of entropy solutions that may contain <b>vacuum</b> <b>states.</b> Rarefaction waves and <b>vacuum</b> <b>states</b> are also shown to be global attractors of entropy solutions in L∞, provided initial data are L∞ ∩ L 1 perturbations of Riemann initial data.

25|$|In QFT this {{combination}} of fields is called the <b>vacuum</b> <b>state,</b> its associated zero-point energy is called the vacuum energy and the average expectation value of the Hamiltonian is called the vacuum expectation value (also called condensate or simply VEV). The QED vacuum {{is a part of}} the <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> which specifically deals with quantum electrodynamics (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) and the QCD vacuum deals with quantum chromodynamics (e.g. color charge interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying quantum vacuum, and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions with the zero-point field.|$|E
25|$|If we {{can show}} that the <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> is {{invariant}} under parity (P|0=|0), the Hamiltonian is parity invariant (=0) and the quantization conditions remain unchanged under parity, then it follows that every state has good parity, and this parity is conserved in any reaction.|$|E

It {{is an example}} of a non-perturbative <b>vacuum</b> <b>state,</b> {{characterized}} by a non-vanishing condensates such as the gluon condensate and the quark condensate in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of quark matter. In technical terms, gluons are vector gauge bosons that mediate strong interactions of quarks in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction. This is unlike the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED (quantum electrodynamics) as it deals with nonlinear equations to characterize such interactions.|$|E
25|$|A {{third way}} of {{understanding}} Casimir forces has been suggested, based on canonical macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In this interpretation, there exists a ground (<b>vacuum)</b> <b>state</b> of the coupled system of matter and fields, which determines the ground-state properties of the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a force. The Casimir force is fundamentally a property of the coupled system of matter and fields, in which {{the interaction between the}} plates is mediated by the zero-point fields. In more traditional interpretations, however, the emphasis has fallen either on the electromagnetic field or the fluctuating material in the plates.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} of string {{theory is that the}} full theory does not have a satisfactory definition in all circumstances. The scattering of strings is most straightforwardly defined using the techniques of perturbation theory, but it is not known in general how to define string theory nonperturbatively. It is also not clear whether there is any principle by which string theory selects its <b>vacuum</b> <b>state,</b> the physical state that determines the properties of our universe. These problems have led some in the community to criticize these approaches to the unification of physics and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E

A non-classical noise reduction of 5. 3 dB below the shot noise was observed by means of balanced homodyne detection. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|In a supersymmetric theory, each nonzero energy {{eigenvalue}} {{contains an}} equal number of bosonic and fermionic states. Because of this, the Witten index is independent of the temperature and gives the number of zero energy bosonic <b>vacuum</b> <b>states</b> minus the number of zero energy fermionic <b>vacuum</b> <b>states.</b> In particular, if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken then there are no zero energy ground states and so the Witten index is equal to zero.|$|R
50|$|Theoretically, in QCD {{multiple}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>states</b> can coexist. The {{starting and}} ending of cosmological inflation {{is thought to}} have arisen from transitions between different <b>vacuum</b> <b>states.</b> For theories obtained by quantization of a classical theory, each stationary point of the energy in the configuration space gives rise to a single vacuum. String theory is believed to have a huge number of vacua - the so-called string theory landscape.|$|R
25|$|Another view {{states that}} BPST-like instantons play an {{important}} role in the vacuum structure of QCD. These instantons were discovered in 1975 by Alexander Belavin, Alexander Markovich Polyakov, Albert S. Schwarz and Yu. S. Tyupkin as topologically stable solutions to the Yang-Mills field equations. They represent tunneling transitions from one <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> to another. These instantons are indeed found in lattice calculations. The first computations performed with instantons used the dilute gas approximation. The results obtained did not solve the infrared problem of QCD, making many physicists turn away from instanton physics. Later, though, an instanton liquid model was proposed, turning out to be more promising an approach.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 paper {{published}} in Nature, {{as part of}} their investigation into global catastrophic risks, MIT physicist Max Tegmark and Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom calculate the natural risks of the destruction of the Earth at less than 1 per gigayear from all events, including a transition to a lower <b>vacuum</b> <b>state.</b> They argue that due to observer selection effects, we might underestimate the chances of being destroyed by vacuum decay because any information about this event would reach us only at the instant when we too were destroyed. This is in contrast to events like risks from impacts, gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and hypernovae, whose frequencies we have adequate direct measures of.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} vacuum metastability event {{would be}} theoretically possible if our universe {{were part of}} a metastable (false) vacuum in the first place, an issue that was highly theoretical and far from resolved in 1982. A false vacuum is one that appears stable, and is stable within certain limits and conditions, but is capable of being disrupted and entering a different state which is more stable. If this were the case, a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all of the observable universe without forewarning. Chaotic Inflation theory suggests that the universe may be in either a false vacuum or a true <b>vacuum</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

25|$|If the Standard Model is correct, the {{particles}} and forces we observe in our universe exist {{as they do}} because of underlying quantum fields. Quantum fields can have states of differing stability, including 'stable', 'unstable', or 'metastable' (meaning very long-lived but not completely stable). If a more stable <b>vacuum</b> <b>state</b> were able to arise, then existing particles and forces would no longer arise {{as they do in}} the universe's present state. Different particles or forces would arise from (and be shaped by) whatever new quantum states arose. The world we know depends upon these particles and forces, so if this happened, everything around us, from subatomic particles to galaxies, and all fundamental forces, would be reconstituted into new fundamental particles and forces and structures. The universe would lose all of its present structures and become inhabited by new ones (depending upon the exact states involved) based upon the same quantum fields.|$|E
