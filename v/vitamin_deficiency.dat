5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of the de novo pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of niacin in the diet causes the <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> common among ships' crews.|$|E

25|$|As a result, it {{is likely}} that the deaths of Burke and Wills {{resulted}} in part from a <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> disease called beriberi.

25|$|The {{approach}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as megavitamin therapy because its practice evolved out of, and in some cases still uses, doses of vitamins and minerals many times higher than the recommended dietary intake. Orthomolecular practitioners may also incorporate a variety of other styles of treatment into their approaches, including dietary restriction, megadoses of non-vitamin nutrients and mainstream pharmaceutical drugs.

40|$|Background And Objective: Poor {{sunlight}} exposure {{leads to}} <b>vitamin</b> D <b>deficiency</b> {{even in the}} sunniest places. So screening for <b>vitamin</b> D <b>deficiency</b> in outpatient clinics and inhospital setting in King Fahad Hospital, Al Madina Al Monwara. METHODS: Screening for <b>vitamin</b> D <b>deficiency</b> by assessment of serum 25 (OH) D with radioimmunoassay in 60 female patients aged 18 – 40 years. Serum calcium, phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase were assessed, too. Results: 6 female patients (10 %) showed significant <b>vitamin</b> D <b>deficiency</b> with 25 (OH) D < 20 ng/ml. However 54 female patients (90 %) showed severe <b>vitamin</b> D <b>deficiency</b> with 25 (OH) D < 10 ng/ml.

25|$|Victims of {{starvation}} are often {{too weak to}} sense thirst, and therefore become dehydrated. All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the esophagus, making swallowing painful. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> is also a common result {{of starvation}}, often leading to anemia, beriberi, pellagra, and scurvy. These diseases collectively can also cause diarrhea, skin rashes, edema, and heart failure. Individuals are often irritable and lethargic as a result.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} comes {{mostly from}} the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (<b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency,</b> anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or urinalysis (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out {{a small sample of}} the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with erythematous margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} uncertain, {{but it is}} thought to be caused by {{accumulation}} of epithelial squames and proliferation of chromogenic (i.e., color-producing) microorganisms. There may be an increase in keratin production or a decrease in normal desquamation (shedding of surface epithelial cells). Many people with BHT are heavy smokers. Other possible associated factors are poor oral hygiene, general debilitation, hyposalivation (i.e., decreased salivary flow rate), radiotherapy, overgrowth of fungal or bacterial organisms, and a soft diet. Occasionally, BHT may be caused by the use of antimicrobial medications (e.g., tetracyclines), or oxidizing mouthwashes or antacids. A soft diet may be involved as normally food has an abrasive action on the tongue, which keeps the filiform papillae short. Pellagra, a condition caused by a <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency,</b> may cause a thick greyish fur to develop on the dorsal tongue, along with other oral signs.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} myelin damage {{resulting from}} B12 deficiency, {{even in the}} presence of adequate folate and methionine, is more specifically and clearly a <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> problem. It has been connected to B12 most directly by reactions related to MUT, which is absolutely required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A into succinyl coenzyme A. Failure of this second reaction to occur results in elevated levels of MMA, a myelin destabilizer. Excessive MMA will prevent normal fatty acid synthesis, or it will be incorporated into fatty acids itself rather than normal malonic acid. If this abnormal fatty acid subsequently is incorporated into myelin, the resulting myelin will be too fragile, and demyelination will occur. Although the precise mechanism or mechanisms are not known with certainty, the result is subacute combined degeneration of the central nervous system and spinal cord. Whatever the cause, it is known that B12 deficiency causes neuropathies, even if folic acid is present in good supply, and therefore anemia is not present.|$|E
500|$|Posterior cord syndrome, {{in which}} just the dorsal columns of {{the spinal cord}} are affected, is usually seen in cases of chronic {{myelopathy}} but can also occur with infarction of the posterior spinal artery. [...] This rare syndrome causes the loss of proprioception and sense of vibration {{below the level of}} injury while motor function and sensation of pain, temperature, and touch remain intact. [...] Usually posterior cord injuries result from insults like disease or <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency</b> rather than trauma. Tabes dorsalis, due to injury to the posterior part of the spinal cord caused by syphilis, results in loss of touch and proprioceptive sensation.|$|E
500|$|Deficiencies of {{vitamins}} {{are classified as}} either primary or secondary. A primary deficiency occurs when an organism does not {{get enough of the}} vitamin in its food. A secondary deficiency may be due to an underlying disorder that prevents or limits the absorption or use of the vitamin, due to a [...] "lifestyle factor", such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, or the use of medications that interfere with the absorption or use of the vitamin. People who eat a varied diet are unlikely to develop a severe primary <b>vitamin</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In contrast, restrictive diets have the potential to cause prolonged vitamin deficits, which may result in often painful and potentially deadly diseases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract <b>Vitamin</b> A <b>deficiency</b> {{and malaria}} are both highly {{prevalent}} health problems in Africa. <b>Vitamin</b> A <b>deficiency</b> affects over 30 million children, {{most of whom}} are in the age-group (under five years) most affected by malaria. <b>Vitamin</b> A <b>deficiency</b> increases all-cause mortality {{in this part of the}} population, and malaria is an important cause of death in children at this age.

On 1 February 1709, as they neared the island, the sailors spotted a fire ashore and feared {{that it might be}} a shore party from a Spanish vessel. The next morning Rogers sent a party ashore and discovered that the fire was from Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded there four years previously. Selkirk was to become an inspiration for the classic novel Robinson Crusoe, written by Rogers' friend, Daniel Defoe. Rogers found Selkirk to be [...] "wild-looking" [...] and [...] "wearing goatskins", noting in his journal, [...] "He had with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible and books." [...] Selkirk, who {{had been part of the}} ship's crew that abandoned Dampier after losing confidence in his leadership, was now more than willing to join a flotilla that included his old commodore as ship's pilot.
