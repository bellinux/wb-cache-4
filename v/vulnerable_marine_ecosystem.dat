40|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach for fisheries management {{is a widely}} accepted concept and various international instruments require its application. However, there are various interpretations of the {{ecosystem approach}} and its application almost always brings about confrontations and resistance among managers, proponents, and stakeholders. This paper categorizes the ecosystem approach into four distinguishable types: bycatch mitigation, multi-species management, protection of vulnerable ecosystems, and integrated approach. Furthermore, the lack of identification and understanding of specific management goals is hampering {{the application of the}} ecosystem approach. Unless the stakeholders understand and accept the goals, the ecosystem approach will not succeed.

Through 2655 face-to-face interviews conducted between August 2012 and July 2014, we used fishers' recall of past catch rates of reef-associated finfish to infer species disappearances from catches in five marine key biodiversity areas (Lanuza Bay, Danajon Bank, Verde Island Passage, Polillo Islands and Honda Bay). We modeled temporal trends in perceived catch per unit effort (CPUE) based on fishers' reports of typical good days' catches using Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling. Fifty-nine different finfish disappeared from catches between the 1950 s and 2014; 42 fish were identified to species level, two to genus, seven to family and eight to local name only. Five species occurring at all sites with {{the greatest number of}} fishers reporting zero catches were the green bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), African pompano (Alectis ciliaris), giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus). Between the 1950 s and 2014, the mean perceived CPUE of bumphead parrotfish declined by 88 %, that of humphead wrasse by 82 %, African pompano by 66 %, giant grouper by 74 % and mangrove red snapper by 64 %. These declines were mainly associated with excess and uncontrolled fishing, fish life-history traits like maximum body size and socio-economic factors like access to market infrastructure and services, and overpopulation. The fishers' knowledge is indicative of extirpations where evidence for these losses was otherwise lacking.

40|$|Continental slopes support highly diverse ecosystems, {{influenced}} by strong environmental depth-related gradients, but many fundamental aspects of ecosystem dynamics remain poorly understood. Emerging evidences show that human-driven pressures are a {{primary reason for}} rapid and unpredictable changes on deep-sea ecosystems. For this reason, {{it is important to}} understand the ecological drivers behind community dynamics to improve our ability for a sustainable use and to mitigate impacts. In a multidisciplinary context, I aimed to explore aspects of continental slope ecosystem functioning, including trophic ecology, community structure and function, and potential human-induced perturbations. I used stable isotope analysis to investigate ecological drivers explaining demersal fish community structure between 500 and 2000 m water depth on the North East Atlantic (Scottish and Irish) continental slope. I show that community-level predator prey mass ratios are invariant along a strong environmental gradient and between feeding behaviours. Results also suggest that body size is responsible for a large proportion of the isotopic niche areas and revealed the effect of increasing depth in resource partitioning, with an indication of a divergent energy supply pathways. Finally, I assessed the present status of an important deepwater <b>vulnerable</b> <b>marine</b> <b>ecosystem</b> in the Porcupine Seabight (NE Atlantic). The Porcupine Seabight was surveyed extensively between 1977 and 1986 and was revisited in 2011 to compare the spatial coverage and size distributions of hexactinellid sponges (Pheronema carpenteri) as an indicator for trawling impact. I found that deep-sea sponge aggregations (a) are still present in the Porcupine Seabight, and (b) do appear to be vulnerable to / under threat from deep-water trawl fishing. In conclusion, it is shown that isotope-type metrics may be powerful proxies to understand community structure and a useful tool to improve ecosystem-based models. Results here present are suggestive that changes in benthic nutrient cycling communities can affect secondary production of deepwater fish communities. Given the vulnerability of deepwater fauna, it is imperative to outline priorities for conservation as a response to environmental and human disturbances threating deep-sea biodiversity. <br/...|$|E

40|$|To {{ensure that}} {{destructive}} bottom fishing activities {{do not have}} significant adverse impacts on <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Marine</b> <b>Ecosystems</b> (VMEs) in high seas areas of the World Ocean, as required by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61 - 105, knowledge of the locations of VMEs is required. Quantifying the occurrence and abundance of VME indicator taxa in research bottom-trawl samples, {{as well as from}} in situ observations with underwater photography, provides methods for detecting these ecosystems. A case study is presented in which a threshold density of indicator taxa was used as the basis for VME designation. In 2009, high densities of VME indicator taxa were encountered at 11 sites off th`e South Orkney Islands in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. In most cases, thresholds were exceeded by a limited number of VME indicator taxa, primarily representatives of the class Demospongiae (siliceous sponges), Hexactinellida (glass sponges) and Ascidiacea (tunicates). In situ imagery further showed the importance of bryozoans (lace corals), scleractinians (stony corals) and stylastrids (hydrocorals) in the study region. The approach outlined here, which relies on widely used sampling techniques, could be employed throughout the World Ocean to detect and document the presence of VMEs from existing datasets. To illustrate this point, the method was applied to a separate dataset, collected in 2006, from a research cruise off the northern Antarctic Peninsula, which led to the detection of 17 VMEs.
