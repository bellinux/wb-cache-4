5|$|Phineas is also <b>very</b> <b>modest.</b> He {{tends to}} put Ferb's name on inventions. This {{may be because}} Ferb {{does most of the}} building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.|$|E
5|$|Yet, whilst Nash {{tended to}} sound arrogant in public, he was <b>very</b> <b>modest</b> about {{his success in}} private; in fact, his {{daughter}} Noelene {{was not aware of}} her father's sporting success until aged 12 when a friend's father told her.|$|E
5|$|Ramirez {{attended}} George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving {{at the age}} of 19 without graduating. During {{his time}} on the team, GWHS was seeing a large {{increase in the number of}} immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans. As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be the center of attention and was often <b>very</b> <b>modest.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Dzordzor Chapel {{was built}} {{on the bank of the}} Makuchay River at Dzordzor by Bishop Zachariah in 1314 on <b>very</b> <b>modest</b> lines, making use of the vestiges of an earlier {{religious}} monument dated between the 10th and 12th centuries. During the period of Ottoman rule, some parts of the building were destroyed. Later, the chapel came under threat of submergence from a proposed dam and had to be shifted to a new location upstream.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Harcourt Williams, newly {{appointed}} {{as director of}} productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers <b>very</b> <b>modest</b> wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and Gielgud {{was not the first}} West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley's words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Utopia, Limited (1893), their {{penultimate}} opera, was a <b>very</b> <b>modest</b> success, {{and their}} last, The Grand Duke (1896), was an outright failure. Neither work entered {{the canon of}} regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, His Excellency (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protege from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal, and His Excellency was instead composed by F. Osmond Carr. Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.|$|E
50|$|Paradise, {{a friend}} of Sir William Jones, was {{described}} as <b>very</b> silent, <b>modest,</b> and amiable. He lived at one time in Charles Street, Cavendish Square; he died at Great Titchfield Street, London, on 12 December 1795. He left money to buy mourning rings to nine: Isaac Hawkins Browne, Nathaniel Burwell, Bennet Langton, Samuel Horsley, Thomas Jefferson, Richard Warburton Lytton, Frederick North, William Windham, and Mikhail Woronzow.|$|R

50|$|Clayton Glover is Clarence's father. A widower and {{a father}} of twelve, he amazes people that such a small, simple man was able to raise an entire pack of gigantic, {{successful}} men with little stress to show for it. He eventually starts dating and soon marries Marcy's mother. A retired minister and a <b>very</b> humble, <b>modest</b> man, he refuses any luxurious gifts offered {{to him by his}} successful sons. He resembles, in look and character, Tony Dungy.|$|R
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a <b>very</b> <b>modest</b> amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} in an obese population over four years is decreased with orlistat (6.2%) compared to placebo (9.0%).

60|$|He {{rang the}} bell a great many times, and yet nobody came. But at last, as he was sitting upon the box {{thinking}} about giants' castles, and princesses tied up to pegs by the hair of their heads, and dragons bursting out from behind gates, and other incidents of the like nature, common in story-books to youths of low degree on their first visit to strange houses, the door was gently opened, and a little servant-girl, <b>very</b> tidy, <b>modest,</b> and demure, but very pretty too, appeared. 'I suppose you're Christopher, sir,' said the servant-girl.|$|R
60|$|Thus far I {{have had}} a smooth story to tell of myself, and in all this {{part of my life}} I not only had the {{reputation}} of living in a very good family, and a family noted and respected everywhere for virtue and sobriety, and for every valuable thing; but I had the character too of a <b>very</b> sober, <b>modest,</b> and virtuous young woman, and such I had always been; neither had I yet any occasion to think of anything else, or to know what a temptation to wickedness meant.|$|R
50|$|Campo Algodonero {{is located}} in Cd. Juarez coincidently across from the {{maquiladora}} industries headquarters. The open field has crosses around that are painted in the iconic pink color with the victims names. Rosa-Linda Fregoso describes the memorial as a <b>very</b> clean, <b>modest</b> looking site. The walls mark its perimeters that separate the park from the memorial site. It has sandstone colored walls, paths, blue-mosaic waterways and a walkway where it then leads to marble-top stone benches. The location of the benches seems to be designed as a space {{for the public to}} reflect on what they see.|$|R
25|$|General Canby is very active, but {{his work}} makes no great show as yet, {{because it is}} {{conducted}} too quietly and without ostentation.

5000|$|Also, Tchaikovsky's friend Hermann Laroche {{reported}} that the composer was scrupulous in his personal hygiene. In the hope of avoiding doctors, Laroche writes, [...] "he relied above all on hygiene, of which he seemed (to my layman's view) {{to be a true}} master". The media noted this as they questioned the composer's death. [...] "How could Tchaikovsky, having just arrived in Petersburg and living in excellent hygienic conditions, have contracted the infection?" [...] asked a reporter for the Petersburg Gazette. A writer for Russian Life noted, [...] "Everyone is astounded by the uncommon occurrence of the lightning-fast infection with Asiatic cholera of a man so <b>very</b> temperate, <b>modest,</b> and austere in his daily habits." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the hearing}} on August 17, 1922 before the USSB the {{president}} of the North Atlantic and Western Steamship Company disclosed operational revenue for the company.

On August 15, 1922 West Hika was towed from Boston Harbor and sent to Norfolk. She arrived in Hampton Roads on August 18 to be laid up.|$|E
25|$|Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts {{tried to}} follow up their success with a much more ambitious {{offensive}} operation named Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Polar Star). This operation had the aim of decisively defeating Army Group North, but achieved <b>very</b> <b>modest</b> gains. Several other offensives were conducted by Meretskov {{in the area in}} 1943, slowly expanding the corridor, and making other small gains. In November 1943, Meretskov and Govorov began planning the Leningrad-Novgorod Offensive which would drive Army Group North out of the Leningrad region.|$|E

Well, all I can say is this, then, that as far as I can judge her, Lady Hilda Tregellis is a <b>very</b> sensible, <b>modest,</b> intelligent, well-conducted young woman, which is more than I could possibly have expected from a person of her unfortunate and distressing hereditary antecedents.

Upon her silken waist clover leaves were embroidered, and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed with sparkling emeralds of a uniform size.|$|R
