5|$|On September 16, {{shortly after}} he {{announced}} the Nixon pardon, Ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada, and for military deserters, in Presidential Proclamation 4313.

The program for the Return of <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Era</b> Draft Evaders and Military Deserters established a Clemency Board to review the records and make recommendations for receiving a Presidential Pardon and a change in Military discharge status. Full pardon for draft dodgers came in the Carter Administration.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Era</b> {{was a time}} {{of change}} in the Fayetteville area. Fort Bragg did not send many large units to Vietnam, but from 1966 to 1970, more than 200,000 {{soldiers}} trained at the post before leaving for the war. This buildup stimulated area businesses. Anti-war protests in Fayetteville drew national attention because of Fort Bragg, in a city that generally supported the war. Anti-war groups invited the actress and activist Jane Fonda to Fayetteville to participate in three anti-war events. At this time, Fayetteville also made headlines after Army doctor Jeffrey R. MacDonald murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters in their Ft. Bragg home in 1970; the book and movie Fatal Vision were based on these events.|$|E

McNaughton's office relied on Nowlin and her cadre of local Army Arts and Crafts directors to solicit applications from soldiers, which were forwarded to McNaughton's office at the U.S. Army Center of Military History, where selection and team assignments were made. The U.S. Army provided logistics support as the teams of artists were sent to Vietnam and then to Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1970 the wing was phased down {{as part of the}} overall American {{withdrawal}} from the Vietnam War; however, in 1972 tactical fighter strength was augmented by deployed Tactical Air Command CONUS-based tactical fighter squadrons being attached to the 432d in response to the North Vietnamese invasion of South Vietnam. In addition, the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron was reassigned from Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base. During Operation Linebacker, between May and October 1972, the 432d TRW had seven F-4 tactical fighter squadrons assigned or attached, (13th, 56th, 308th, 414th, 421st, 523d and 555th) making it the largest wing in the USAF. The three <b>Vietnam</b> <b>era</b> Airforce Aces all came from the 432d – two from the 555th and one from the 13th. The CONUS-based squadrons returned to the United States in {{the fall of}} 1972.|$|E

The trophy is permanently displayed at the United States Air Force Academy, with each winner’s name inscribed. A miniature replica, also donated by Perot, is presented to each year’s recipient as a personal memento.

500|$|Hemingway's work {{continued}} to be popular {{in the latter half}} of the century and after his suicide in 1961. During the 1970s, The Sun Also Rises appealed to what Beegel calls the lost generation of the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>era.</b> [...] Aldridge writes that The Sun Also Rises has kept its appeal because the novel is about being young. The characters live in the most beautiful city in the world, spend their days traveling, fishing, drinking, making love, and generally reveling in their youth. He believes the expatriate writers of the 1920s appeal for this reason, but that Hemingway was the most successful in capturing the time and the place in The Sun Also Rises.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, brigades were {{eliminated}} from divisions. Consequently, the HHC 173rd Infantry Brigade was {{designated as the}} 87th Reconnaissance Troop in February 1942 and activated on 15 December 1942. Though the brigade in name did not exist during the war, the redesignation meant that it carried the lineage of the 87th Reconnaissance Troop, and when the brigade was reactivated, it would include the troop's lineage and campaign streamers. The troop entered combat in 1944 and fought in three European campaigns; central Europe, the Rhineland and Ardennes-Alsace operations. The maneuver battalions of the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>era</b> 173rd trace their lineage to the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, which successfully assaulted the fortress island of Corregidor in the Philippines by parachute and waterborne operations, thereby earning the nickname [...] "The Rock". After the war, the troop reverted to reserve status and was posted at Birmingham, Alabama from 1947 until 1951. On 1 December 1951, the troop was inactivated and released from its assignment to the 87th Infantry Division.|$|E
500|$|Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! was {{compared}} to several other Hanna-Barbera productions. David Mansour, author of From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century, compared the show's premise to the storyline of Hanna-Barbera's Top Cat and wrote, [...] "but instead of a gang of hip cats residing in an alley, it starred a bunch of cool bears living at the zoo". Christopher P. Lehman, who wrote American Animated Cartoons of the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>Era,</b> also compared it to a previous television series, but instead to the live-action The Phil Silver Show. Author David Perlmutter considered the show to be a reworked version of Yogi Bear, which he deemed appropriate because [...] "the youth of the late 1960s and early 1970s" [...] had a [...] "'hippie' mindset". He also noted that because the series [...] "incorporated some of the 'flip, sophisticated' style of the early animal con-artist formula, the series maintained a distinct connection with {{the time and place}} in which it was produced".|$|E

500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that questioner Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>era</b> during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{authored}} {{two of the}} volumes. Crises & Commitments (1992)—written with Gregory Pemberton—analysed {{the political}} and diplomatic history of Australia's involvement in the three conflicts up to 1965, while A Nation at War (1997) covered the political, diplomatic and social history of Australia's Vietnam War from 1965 to 1975. Crises & Commitments received a somewhat contentious reception. John Murphy criticised the volume for {{what he saw as}} an overemphasis on the diplomatic and for skirting the social controversies of the <b>Vietnam</b> <b>era.</b> Murphy also questioned the need for an official history. Pemberton, a senior researcher on the history who drafted several of the earlier chapters before leaving the project acrimoniously in 1990, took issue with the book as well, arguing that his input [...] "had been censored and sanitised in the final product". Edwards acknowledged substantial rewrites to Pemberton's drafts in the foreword to Crises & Commitments, but the extent of and reasoning for the changes were not made clear. A Nation at War experienced a warmer reception, winning the Foundation of Australian Literary Studies Award and H. T. Priestley Medal. In spite of Murphy's doubts, the official history series was also [...] "praised [...] its detached and scholarly analysis of complex events", according to the Oxford Companion to Australian Military History.|$|E
