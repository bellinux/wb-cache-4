40|$|An {{ultra-low}} area, current efficient <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> {{appropriate for}} distributed point-of-load voltage regulation in high performance integrated circuits (ICs) {{is described in}} this paper. The proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> is a hybrid combination of a switching <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> and a linear <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> can supply over 100 mA current while generating 0. 9 volts from a 1. 2 input voltage. The current efficiency exceeds 99 % while the load regulation to a step current ranges between 40 ns and 60 ns. No output capacitor is required to ensure stability. Hence, the required on-chip area is as small as 0. 026 mm 2 for the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> which is approximately four to six times smaller than area efficient low dropout regulators. The proposed circuit therefore provides a means for distributing multiple local power supplies across an integrated circuit, maintaining high current efficiency and small area...|$|R

25|$|A {{carbon pile}} {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a stack of carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A carbon pile resistor {{can also be used}} as a speed control for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts. A carbon pile resistor can be incorporated in automatic <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> for generators, where the carbon pile controls the field current to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the carbon microphone.|$|E

This building, lying adjacent to the main national railway line, is known as the North Star Carriage Works thus perpetuating a typical GWR name. As well as having a machine shop and fabrication equipment to carry out a full range of body and bogie repairs the carriage works boasts equipment recovered from former BR works to calibrate and adjust dynamo <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> and to thoroughly overhaul and test vacuum brake equipment, a facility that is almost extinct elsewhere.

25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{nonlinear}} <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> with one tunable parameter for multimachine power systems. Based on output feedback linearization, this regulator can achieve simultaneous voltage regulation and small-signal performance objectives. Conventionally output feedback linearization {{has been used}} for <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> design by taking infinite bus voltage as reference. Unfortunately, this controller has poor small-signal performance and cannot be applied to multimachine systems without the estimation of the equivalent external reactance seen from the generator. This paper proposes a <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> design by redefining the rotor angle at each generator with respect to the secondary voltage of the step-up transformer as reference instead of a common synchronously rotating reference frame. Using synchronizing and damping torques analysis, we show that the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> achieves simultaneous <b>voltage</b> regulation and damping performance over a range of system and operating conditions by controlling the relative angle between the generator internal voltage angle delta and the secondary voltage of the step up transformer. The performance of the proposed <b>voltage</b> <b>regulator</b> is evaluated on a single machine infinite bus system and two widely used multimachine test systems...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> or {{stabilizers}} {{are used}} to compensate for voltage fluctuations in mains power. Large regulators may be permanently installed on distribution lines. [...] Small portable regulators may be plugged in between sensitive equipment and a wall outlet. Automatic <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> are used on generator sets on ships, in emergency power supplies, on oil rigs, etc. to stabilize fluctuations in power demand. For example, when a large machine is turned on, the demand for power is suddenly a lot higher. The voltage regulator compensates for the change in load. Commercial <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> normally operate {{on a range of}} voltages, for example 150–240V or 90–280V. Servo stabilizers are also manufactured and used widely {{in spite of the fact}} that they are obsolete and use out-dated technology.|$|E

2500|$|Generators, as used {{in power}} {{stations}} or in standby power systems, will have automatic <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first automatic <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system, that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal {{that is used to}} adjust the excitation of the generator. [...] As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. [...] The AVR [...] will control current by using power electronics devices; generally {{a small part of the}} generator's output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.|$|E
2500|$|It is also {{possible}} to put the rectified waveform into a choke-input filter. [...] The advantage of this circuit is that the current waveform is smoother: current is drawn over the entire cycle, instead of being drawn in pulses at the peaks of AC voltage each half-cycle as in a capacitor input filter. [...] The disadvantage is that the voltage output is much lower – the average of an AC half-cycle rather than the peak; this is about 90% of the RMS voltage versus [...] times the RMS voltage (unloaded) for a capacitor input filter. [...] Offsetting this is superior voltage regulation and higher available current, which reduce peak voltage and ripple current demands on power supply components. [...] Inductors require cores of iron or other magnetic materials, and add weight and size. [...] Their use in power supplies for electronic equipment has therefore dwindled in favour of semiconductor circuits such as <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Feedback <b>voltage</b> <b>regulators</b> operate by {{comparing}} the actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element {{in such a way}} as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. [...] If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, up to a point, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).|$|E
