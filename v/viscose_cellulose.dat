Hyperbranched poly(amino-amine) (HBPAA)-modified AgNPs were synthesized by hydrothermal reduction on the HBPAA template. With HBPAA {{serving as a}} “molecular glue,” positively charged AgNPs uniformly self-assembled to the fiber surfaces through intermolecular electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between HBPAA and <b>viscose</b> <b>cellulose.</b> Ag nanohair-grown ACFs were prepared by pre-oxidation and carbonization of AgNP-coated VFs. To successfully grow Ag nanohairs on ACFs, an open-ended carbonization furnace sealed by high-temperature flames in the entrance and exit was chosen. Therefore, ACFs could rapidly cool down upon leaving the furnace, triggering the fast cold contraction of pores. Ag liquid would be squeezed out and cooled down to form Ag nanowires.|$|E

40|$|Proteinases play {{a pivotal}} role in wound healing by {{regulating}} cell-matrix interactions and availability of bioactive molecules. The role of matrix metalloproteinase- 13 (MMP- 13) in granulation tissue growth was studied in subcutaneously implanted <b>viscose</b> <b>cellulose</b> sponge in MMP- 13 knockout (Mmp 13 (-/-)) and wild type (WT) mice. The tissue samples were harvested at time points day 7, 14 and 21 and subjected to histological analysis and gene expression profiling. Granulation tissue growth was significantly reduced (42 %) at day 21 in Mmp 13 (-/-) mice. Granulation tissue in Mmp 13 (-/-) mice showed delayed organization of myofibroblasts, increased microvascular density at day 14, and virtual absence of large vessels at day 21. Gene expression profiling identified differentially expressed genes in Mmp 13 (-/-) mouse granulation tissue involved in biological functions including inflammatory response, angiogenesis, cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation and proteolysis. Among genes linked to angiogenesis, Adamts 4 and Npy were significantly upregulated in early granulation tissue in Mmp 13 (-/-) mice, and a set of genes involved in leukocyte motility including Il 6 were systematically downregulated at day 14. The expression of Pdgfd was downregulated in Mmp 13 (-/-) granulation tissue in all time points. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases Mmp 2, Mmp 3, Mmp 9 was also significantly downregulated in granulation tissue of Mmp 13 (-/-) mice compared to WT mice. Mmp 13 (-/-) mouse skin fibroblasts displayed altered cell morphology and impaired ability to contract collagen gel and decreased production of MMP- 2.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{expression}} of an integral cell surface proteoglycan, syndecan, during the healing of cutaneous wounds, using immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization methods. In normal mouse skin, both syndecan antigen and mRNA {{were found to be}} expressed exclusively by epidermal and hair follicle cells. After incision and subsequent suturing, remarkably increased amounts of syndecan on the cell surfaces of migrating and proliferating epidermal cells and on hair follicle cells adjacent to wound margins were noted. This increased syndecan expression was shown to be a consequence of greater amounts of syndecan mRNA. Induction was observed already 1 d after wounding, was most significant at the time of intense cell proliferation, and was still observable 14 d after incision. The migrating cells of {{the leading edge of the}} epithelium also showed enhanced syndecan expression, although clearly less than that seen in the proliferating epithelium. The merging epithelial cells at the site of incision showed little or no syndecan expression; increased syndecan expression, however, was detected during later epithelial stratification. When wounds were left unsutured, in situ hybridization experiments also revealed scattered syndecan-positive signals in the granulation tissue near the migrating epidermal sheet. By immunohistochemical analysis, positive staining in granulation tissue was observed around vascular endothelial cells in a subpopulation of growing capillaries. Induction of syndecan in granulation tissue both at the protein and mRNA levels was temporally and spatially highly restricted. Granulation tissue, which formed in <b>viscose</b> <b>cellulose</b> sponge cylinders placed under the skin of rats, was also found to produce 3. 4 and 2. 6 kb mRNA species of syndecan similar to that observed in the normal murine mammary epithelial cell line, NMuMG.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{oxidative}} {{thermal stability}} of microcrystalline plant-based <b>viscose</b> rayon <b>cellulose</b> fiber was improved {{in the presence}} of an ammonium sulfate solution. The structural characterization of the oxidized samples was carried out using a combination of fiber thickness, linear density, burning test, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric anal-ysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements. Oxidized viscose rayon fibers showed physical and chemical transforma-tions with increasing oxidation temperature and were characterized by a reduction in fiber diameter and linear density values together with color changes with increasing oxidation temperature. The results obtained from XRD analysis showed the loss of crystallinity due to the amorphization processes. XRD analysis also showed increasing conversion to a highly crosslinked and cyclized structure with progressing temperature. The DSC and TGA measurements indicated that there was an improvement in thermal stability. The results obtained from IR spectra showed the progress of dehydrogenation and dehydration reactions.

40|$|Abstract — Cotton as a {{dominating}} {{natural fibre}} imparts a major contribution {{in the whole}} textile market including natural and artificial fibres. The demand of this cellulosic fibre is increasing rapidly day by day, {{on the other hand}} supply cannot fulfill its demand, and as a result price goes higher in world market. Viscose as cellulosic origin, the cheapest of all cellulosic fibres could be the best alternative. Viscose fibre exhibits some similar properties compared to cotton except its poor wet strength. In this research work different chemical finishes were applied to improve the wet strength of viscose fabric. For this purpose water repellent and soil release finishes were applied. Both water repellent and soil release finishes helped in reducing the molecular barrier around the individual fibres that lowered the surface tension of the fibre. It reduces the absorbency of viscose fibre hence leads to higher wet strength. Water repellent finish was applied alone as well as in combination with soil release finish. It was seen that viscose fibre exhibited better wet strength after applying water repellent and soil release finishes on it. This improved property of viscose could replace the cotton fibre in certain applications like bed linen. Index Term — Cotton, <b>cellulose,</b> <b>viscose,</b> wet strength, wate...|$|R

This thesis {{is focused on the}} novel approach for modification {{of cellulosic materials}} by the combination of adsorption of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) onto cellulose surface and the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) “click” reaction. The literature part gives an overview on the basics of cellulose chemistry, chemical functionalization of cellulose, as well as explains the principle of the chemical conjugation of carboxylic groups obtained by formation of amide bonds. The chapter continues with the phenomenon of the polyelectrolyte adsorption onto cellulose, {{takes a look at the}} viscose production process and, finally, it introduces the novel field of “click” chemistry. In the experimental part, methods and techniques applied are described. The experimental part focuses on the evaluation of the adsorption efficiency of CMC and its derivatives onto viscose in different reaction conditions, as well as on examination of chemical and mechanical stabilities of the modification. CMC functionalization was analyzed with spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. The effect of various reaction conditions on adsorption was studied and quantified by means of the phenol-sulphuric acid method for the estimation of total adsorbed carbohydrates. Chemical and mechanical stabilities of the modified CMC and fibres were studied by the alkaline and wet frictional treatments, respectively. The main findings revealed that chemically modified <b>viscose</b> fibres (<b>cellulose</b> II) behave differently from cellulose wood pulp and cotton (cellulose I) in respect of polysaccharide adsorption. The functionalization of CMC resulted in clear changes in the molecular structure of CMC, appearing as an increase in nitrogen content. In addition, spectroscopic analyses revealed characteristic signals of alkyne, azide and amide bonds indicative of successful grafting reactions. Adsorption of CMC onto viscose fibres was studied with Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and revealed changes on the surface of the viscose. The click reaction was demonstrated via fluorescent labelling. Moreover, the study on chemical and mechanical stabilities showed reasonable results. In general, combination of polysaccharide adsorption and click chemistry can be considered as a promising method for introducing new functionalities to the viscose fibres...|$|R

B <b>cellulose</b> was tested under 120 U/g oven dry pulp (odp) and the F cellulase under two conditions, 12 and 60 U/g odp. In addition, a purification stage, consisting in a cold caustic extraction (CCE) of 9 % w/v NaOH, was applied before or after the enzymatic treatment {{in order to reduce the}} amount of hemicellulose and improve the action of enzymes. The treated pulps were evaluated in terms of brightness, viscosity, water retention value, fibre morphology, carbohydrate composition, Fock solubility and NMR. In general, results revealed that both endoglucanases improved cellulose reactivity, albeit in a different way; thus, B caused no scissions in the cellulose chain and no significant reduction in fibre length, whereas F strongly decreased viscosity, shortened fibre length and increased considerably the amount of fines. The result of applying two different doses of F cellulase was reflected on Fock solubility and fibre morphology. F 60 treatment was found to give the highest value of Fock solubility and the biggest reduction of fibre length.

The Cellswab absorbed 1. 3 times more fluid and released 3. 5 times more fluid upon plating than the other swabs. Aerobic bacteria were stored in dry tubes, the others in transport medium, at 4 °C and room temperature (RT), for up to 14 days. Swab samples were transferred to plates at 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 days.

The quality of the pulp must be carefully controlled to ensure that it meets the requirements for its intended use and the further processes to be applied. If it is to be used to prepare <b>viscose,</b> or other <b>cellulose</b> derivatives, the key prop-erties of the pulp are its accessibility and reactivity. The studies described in this thesis investigated the potential utility of multivariate analysis of chemi-cal and spectral data for determining the properties of dissolving pulp. Dis-solving pulps produced by a two-stage sulfite process, both in the laboratory and a factory were produced pulps for this purpose. The analyses showed that pulp with high reactivity had short cellulose chains, low molecular weight, low polydispersity, low hemicellulose content, high content of ace-tone-extractable compounds, and high surface charge compared to pulp with low reactivity. Important {{chemical properties}} of the pulp, such as viscosity and alkali resistance, were successfully predicted from near infrared spectra. Predicting the reactivity, or the viscose filterability, of the pulp was more complex. Several chemical methods for analyzing the reactivity of the pulp were examined. The influence of the cellulose structure at the supermolecu-lar level on the reactivity of the pulp was explored by multivariate analysis of solid state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Structural variables considered included: differences in hydrogen bonding, contents of hemicel-lulose, amorphous cellulose and crystalline cellulose I and II.

First developed by wool cleaners and finishers during the mid 19 th century, the technique has been repeatedly employed to aid innovative yarn and fabric development by some of the textile industry’s leading engineers. The devoré technique, also known as burn out, developed from this temporary thread process during the late 1880 s. The popularity of devoré with textiles engineers reached its peak in the 1920 s when a period of high decoration coincided with innovation in new artificial fibers such as <b>viscose</b> rayon and <b>cellulose</b> acetate. The post war resurgence in textile engineering and fashion designing during the Art Deco period engendered numerous highly decorative devoré and temporary thread processes that utilized metallic, rayon, wire and latex threads. Fabric Innovation from Established Processes The devoré procedure of chemically removing single or multiple fibers from a constructed fabric {{can be traced to the}} wool cleaning industries of the mid to late 19 th century and the carbonizing treatment, employed to remove plant debris trapped within wool fleece. By treating wool in sulphuric acid solution, contaminating plant matter was reduced to dust when the wool was heated. The earliest forms of woven devoré follow the same principle of destruction, only the plant matter was replaced with cotton threads constructed within a wool woven textile. Initially it was American and European yarn manufacturers who recognised the economic potential of the temporary thread technique. Delicate wool fibers were twisted (spun) with a cotton thread which acted as a secure rigid guide during fabric construction. The earliest forms of fabric patterning using carbonizing treatments favored localised thread removal using printed carbonising pastes, whereupon cotton or linen threads previously twisted with wool or silk threads, and used for the warp or weft (or both), were burnt away revealing delicate lace-like open work effects...|$|R

Cellulase enzymes {{have been used for}} the biopolishing of cellulosic fibers and fabrics. In this work the focus was on two seperate applications of modified enzymes in textile processing, one is to retain strength of viscos during pilling process and the second is to combine desizing and the bleaching processes of the fabric. Cellulases are used to prevent pilling {{on the surface of the}} viscose fabric but they couse a loss in the tensile strength of the <b>viscose</b> fabric. Commercial <b>celluloses</b> were crosslinked using different parameters in an attempt to ameliorate the loss of tensile strength and to improve enzyme properties. Native and modified enzymes were characterized and their activities against CMC and their effects on the properties of viscose (such as pilling, bursting strength) fabric were determined. Effects of mechanical agitation and surfactants were examined. Crosslinking of cellulase was found to prevent the loss of strength due to the fact that larger enzyme complexes formed by crosslinking were minly resticted to the fabric surface. Enzymes are replacing the use of harsh chemicals in many of the textile processes such as desizind and bleaching and immobilizations of these enzymes on solid supports allow their recycling. Enzymatically produced peroxide is used for bleaching of the cotton fabrics. Commercial Glucosse oxidase (GOx) enzyme was immobilized on different supports such as alumina, silica, Sepharose 4 B and crosslinked enzyme aggragates of GOx were prepared. Their efficiencies against glucose substrate for the production of peroxide were analyzed. Moreover, the starch size of the cotton fabric is hydrolized into glucose by the action of amyloglucosidase and this liquor was also used to produce peroxide. The activities of immobilized enzymes and CLEAs against desizing liquor and the whiteness values of the cotton fabrics after bleaching were examined. The whiteness values reached with immobilized enzyme are not appropriate for white textile but is sufficient for further dyeing processe. Combination of desizing and bleaching in a single bath and recycling of the immobilized enzyme is an environmently friendly alternative...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Fashion {{industry}} is launching new trends in accelerating speed {{and that leads}} to increasing amount of discarded textiles. At the same time, there is need for new raw materials {{and that is why}} using discarded textiles in fibre manufacturing is important area of research. In an ideal scenario, textile industry would gain a closed loop economy by efficient sorting and material processing back to textile fibre. Benefits of recycling also include that discarded textiles don´t need cultivation like virgin materials, such as cotton. Cotton needs large amounts of water and chemicals to grow and because of this the environment gets strained. In this research, discarded cotton textile is used to produce new regenerated textile fibre called cellulose carbamate (CCA) fibre. The process is based on derivatisation of cellulose with urea to form cellulose carbamate. Environmental impacts for 12 CCA factory models are evaluated through life cycle inventory (LCI) and global warming potential (GWP). Variables are made for three processes where one (CCA 1) is representing a new factory where materia is added to the process the first time. Second process (CCA 2) is based on CCA 1 but it has a circulation for chemicals and water. Only input needed in CCA 2 is materia that evaporates or turns in to salt. In the third process (CCA 3), chemicals and water are recycled but the need for NaOH and H 2 SO 4 is 80 % less than those in CCA 2 because of electrodialysis that consumes electricity 600 % times more than CCA 2. These three processes are simulated as integrated and stand alone factories in location A and B. Results are compared with references cotton and viscose. The LCIs were calculated with VTT´s SULCA 5. 0 software, GWP was determined with the ReCiPe Midpoint H life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method and allocation was done by cut-off-method. The scope of this research starts at the sorting facility and ends with 1000 kg of baled CCA fibre. As a result, the integrated CCA 3 process has 20 % smaller GWP value than CCA 2 and 60 % smaller than CCA 1 despite increased electricity consumption. The GWP reduction potential of factory integration is 25 % with CCA 1, 40 % with CCA 2 and 45 % with CCA 3. The integrated CCA 3 process has 35 % lower GWP value and 98 % lower water consumption than the reference cotton. Compared to Lenzing viscose Asia, the integrated CCA 3 has 66 % lower GWP and 90 % lower water consumption. Integrated Lenzing viscose Austria has 7 % smaller GWP than the integrated CCA 3, but CCA 3 has 93 % lower water consumption. Where CCA uses urea in the derivatisation of <b>cellulose</b> <b>viscose</b> process uses carbon disulphide that is highly toxic. As a conclusion most promising ways to decrease the GWP of the CCA process is its integration to a pulp mill and by decreasing the amount of process chemicals through efficient circulation or through electrodialysis...|$|R
