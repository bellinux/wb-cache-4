We presented a patient with sacral gigantocellular tumor managed successfully using this method but with certain standard operative techniques improvements. Case report. A 30 -year old patient with a pronounced painful syndrome and sphincter disorders was confirmed to have sacral gigantocellular tumor affecting a greater part of the sacrum. Tumor resection was performed in the first act out off retroperitoneal organs (colon and blood <b>vesels),</b> sacroiliac joints were open by the ventral side, the L 5 discus removed, the S 2 -S 5 roots cut off.

Then, the standard technique was modified to provide additional spinal fixation. The results of the operation (duration, blood loss, postoperative deficit) were quite comparable with, and in some aspects even better than the results published in the literature. Conclusion.

In the vessels responsive to vasodilators, the electron density of the aggregation of granules and vesicles in the extracellular space of the media revealed by electron microscopy remained unchanged after treatment with 5 -hydroxydopamine, while the electron density of the vesicles in adrenergic terminals was increased. The granules and vesicles morphologically resembled the adrenergic vesicles but were biochemically different from them. Necrotic fhanges of the vessel wall such as the fragmentation of myofilaments were observed in the vessels unresponsive to vasodilators. The potassium pyroanitimonate staining technique revealed fine deposits with-in the nucleus, sarcoplasm, sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and along sarcolemma in normal <b>vesels.</b> The deposits were shown to contain calcium by X-ray microanalysis and EGTA-chelation.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} {{available for}} GRP tank design are time consuming and use either highly analytical formulations {{that are based}} on assumptions, or rely on expensive destructive experimental tests. Because of the variety of loading conditions that these tanks are subjected to when underground, a high factor of safety is usually appied to compensate for discrepancy between theory and practice. This results in sometimes unnecessarily increasing the material cost, wright and manufacturing time. The objective of this work is to find a more deterministic design approach based on experimental and analytical methods in order to predict the properties, integrity and performance of underground GRP tanks. The design methodology is the result of correlation between computational (linear and non-linear FE analysis), analytical and experimental procedures. The methodology should lead to an empirical description for mechanical characteristics of GRP tanks. Once tested it can be proposed as a standard method that can lead to a complete solution for GRP tank design, applied {{to a wide range of}} tank sizes and laminate lay-ups and properties. This replaces the needs for the expensive field tests that are specified in the current standards. It is also expected to prevent the excessive usage of composite material (due to applying high safety factors), and at the same time, prevents the underestimation of the effect of severe loading conditions. In this research GRP material properties used for underground tanks were estimated by using experimental (ie mechanical testing of samples ytaken from GRP tanks), analytical and numerical methods. An empirical description for the determination of elastic properties of GRP material is proposed using FEA method. A series of experiments on full size tanks were designed and tested to generate repeatable data to be used for correlation with simple linear elastic analysis using FEA to establish the validity of FEA as an alternative tool. Correlation between the two types of data showed the correct modelling technique and its limitations. This investigation helped to establish the confidence level required when using a FEA method. Buckling analysis of GRP tanks both experimentally (by vacuum testing of tanks to destruction) and numerically (using geometrically non-linear FEA) was concluded and failure loads and failure modes were compared for all tests with experimental results, British (BS 4995) and European (CEN) standards. Comparison has shown a good agreement with the numerical method, however, both standards results have been shown to be unreliable when used with anisotropic material. An individual investigation of the parameters that contribute to buckling failure has led to the development of an empirical design description for predicting buckling failure of GRP <b>vesels</b> based on a novel and numerical analysis. Finally based on the above work, a complete design methodology is proposed for the design of underground GRP tanks, and a computer program was developed to help the manufacturer to design an optimum vessel for the required application...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Cellulose {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} carbohydrate available from plant biomass. These biopolymers are therefore an important renewable source of food, fuels and chemicals. Cellulose is embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, lignin and pectin and is composed of repeating glucose units linked by p- 1, 4 -glycosidic bonds. The individual molecules are held together by hydrogen bonds, forming largely crystalline fibres. The hemicellulose, which is a low molecular weight heteropolysaccharide, coats and binds the cellulose microfibrils, preventing the cellulose from becoming too crystalline. Three predominant types of hemicelluloses are recognised, namely 1, 3 - and 1, 4 -p-D-galactans, 1, 4 -p-D-mannans and 1, 4 -p-D-xylans, which are named according to the sugar type that forms the polymer backbone. Pectic substances contain rhamnogalacturonan backbones in which 1, 4 -linked a-D-galacturonan chains are interrupted at intervals with a-L-rhamnopyranosyl residues carrying neutral side chains. Two groups of enzymes, cellulases and pectinases, are required for the microbial utilisation of crystalline cellulose and pectin. Cellulases are multicomponent complexes that are often composed of endoglucanases, exoglucanases and cellobiases. Cellobiose is the major end product of concerted endoglucanase and exoglucanase activity. Cellobiose is then hydrolysed to glucose by p-glucosidases. The enzymatic breakdown of pectic polymers occurs by the deesterifying action of the saponifying enzymes, pectinesterase, releasing the methyl groups of the pectin molecule, and by hydrolase or lyase action of the depolymerases (pectin lyase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase), splitting the a- 1. 4 -glycosidic linkages in the polygalacturonate chain. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively in the alcoholic beverage industry for fermentations of wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages for many years. However, it is unable to produce extracellular depolymerising enzymes that can efficiently degrade polysaccharides, which are the main cause of clarification and filtration problems. Enzyme preparations have been used in the alcoholic beverage industries to degrade haze-forming polysaccharides, thereby improving the filterability and quality of products such as beer and wine. An alternative would be to develop S. cerevisiae strains that produce extracellular polysaccharidases, enabling the yeast to degrade polysaccharides without the addition of commercial enzyme preparations. These strains can also be very useful in improving the quality of wine, as well as cutting the costs of the winemaking process. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of two transformed S. cerevisiae strains on different wine grape varieties. The following genes have been cloned and characterised previously: the Aspergillus niger endo-p-xylanase gene (xynC), the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens endo-| 3 - 1. 4 -glucanase gene (endl), the Erwinia chrysanthemi pectate lyase gene (pelE) and the Erwinia carotovora polygalacturonase gene (p e h l). The yeast alcohol dehydrogenase I gene promoter (ADH 1 p), the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene terminator (ADH 2 j), the tryptophan synthase gene terminator (TRP 5 r) and the yeast mating-type pheromone a-factor secretion signal sequence (MFcrfs) were used to compile the following gene constructs: ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-end 1 -TRP 5 r (designated END 1), A DH 1 p-xyn C-A DH 2 T (designated XYN 4), ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-peh 1 -TRP 5 t (designated PEH 1) and ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-pelE-TRP 5 r (designated PELE). Two yeast integrating plasmids were constructed, one containing the END 1 and XYN 4 gene cassettes and the other containing the PEH 1 -PELE cassette. These two plasmids were then integrated into the URA 3 locus of two separate industrial wine yeast strains of S. cerevisiae. To facilitate selection of the industrial yeast transformants in the absence of auxotrophic markers, the integrating plasmid containing the END 1 and XYN 4 gene cassettes was issued with the dominant selectable Geneticin G 418 -resistance G f) marker. The integrating plasmid harbouring the PEH 1 -PELE gene cassette was issued with the dominant selectable sulphumetronmethyl resistance (SMR 1) marker. The introduction of these plasmids into commercial wine yeast strains directed the synthesis of END 1, XYN 4, PELE and PEFI 1 transcripts and the production of extracellular biologically active endo-P- 1, 4 - glucanase, endo-(3 -xylanase, pectate lyase and polygalacturonase. These recombinant yeasts were capable of extracting more colour from grape skins of certain varieties, as well as leading to more freeflow wine as a result of the more effective degradation of glucans, xylans and pectins in the skins. They also led to decreased turbidity in the wine, making it more filterable. Future work will entail further investigation of the effects of these recombinant yeasts on different white and red wine grape varieties. Another objective of this study was to screen non-Saccharomyces wine yeasts for the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. The reason for this part of the thesis was to determine the types of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes that are produced and to determine which genera produce which kinds of extracellular enzymes. A total of 237 yeast isolates, belonging to the genera Kloeckera, Candida, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora and Kluyveromyces, were screened for the production of extracellular pectinases, proteases, (3 -glucanases, lichenases, p-glucosidases, cellulases, xylanases, amylases and sulphite reductase activity. These yeasts were all isolated from grapes and clarified grape juice to ensure that they were yeasts found in must during the initial stages of fermentation. This information can be used to pave the way to pinpoint the specific effects in wine of these enzymes produced by the so-called wild yeasts associated with grape must. This information can also be used to transform Saccharomyces wine yeasts with some of the genes from these non-Saccharomyces yeasts for the production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. However, future research will have to be done to determine the extent of the activity of these enzymes in wine fermentations and to obtain better knowledge of the physiological and metabolical features of non-Saccharomyces yeasts. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Sellulose is verreweg die volopste koolhidraat in plantbiomassa. Hierdie biopolimere is dus ‘n baie belangrike hernubare bron van voedsel, brandstof en chemikaliee. Sellulose is in 'n matriks van hemisellulose, lignien en pektien gebed en is uit herhaalde glukose eenhede, wat deur middel van (3 - 1, 4 -glukosidiese bindings geheg is, saamgestel. Die individuele molekules word deur waterstofbindings aan mekaar geheg, wat aanleiding gee tot die vorming van kristallyne <b>vesels.</b> Die hemisellulose, wat 'n lae molekulere gewig heteropolisakkaried is, bedek en bind die sellulose <b>vesels</b> en verhoed daarmee die vorming van <b>vesels</b> wat te kristallyn is. Drie predominante tipes hemisellulose word herken en sluit 1, 3 - en 1, 4 -p-D-galaktane, 1, 4 -p-D-mannane en 1, 4 -p-D-xylane in, wat vernoem word volgens die suikereenhede wat die polimeerruggraat vorm. Pektiene bestaan uit 'n rhamnogalakturonaanruggraat waarin 1, 4 -gekoppelde a-D-galakturonaankettings periodiek met a-L-rhamnopiranosiel residue, bevattende neutrale sykettings, onderbreek word. Twee groepe ensieme, nl. pektinase en sellulase, word deur mikrobes vir die benutting van kristallyne pektinase en sellulase vereis. Sellulase is multikomponent komplekse wat dikwels uit endoglukanase, ekso-glukanase en sellobiase saamgestel is. Sellobiose is die hoof eindproduk van die saamgestelde aktiwiteit tussen endoglukanase en ekso-glukanase en word verder gehidroliseer tot glukose deur | 3 -glukosidases. Die ensimatiese afbraak van pektien polimere vind deur die de-esterifiserings aksie van die versepings ensiem, pektienesterase, plaas. Dit lei tot die vrystelling van die metielgroepe van die pektienmolekuul. Deur die hidrolase of liase aksie van die depolimerase (pektien liase, pektaatliase en poligalakturonase), split die a- 1, 4 -glukosidiese verbindings in die poligalakturonaatketting. Die gis Saccharomyces cerevisiae word al vir jare ekstensief in die alkoholbedryf vir die fermentasie van verskeie produkte, veral druiwe, gebruik. S. cerevisiae besit egter nie die vermoe om ekstrasellulere depolimiserende ensieme wat vir die effektiewe degradasie van polisakkariede verantwoordelik is, te produseer nie, wat die hoof oorsaak van die verhelderings- en filtreringsprobleme in onder andere wyn en bier is. Dit veroorsaak ook dat S. cerevisiae nie oor die vermoe beskik om waasvormende polisakkariede in wyn te degradeer nie. Tans word ensiempreparate in die alkoholiese bedryf vir die degradasie van die probleem polisakkariede gebruik. Sodoende word die filtreerbaarheid en kwaliteit van wyn en bier verbeter. ‘n Goeie alternatief is die ontwikkeling van S. cerevisiae-rasse wat oor die vermoe beskik om ekstrasellulere polisakkarase te produseer en dus polisakkariede self sonder die byvoeging van eksterne kommersiele ensiempreparate te degradeer. Hierdie rasse sal baie voordelig wees vir die verbetering van wynkwaliteit, sowel as vir die vermindering van die kostes verbonde aan die wynmaakproses. Die objektief van hierdie studie is dus om die uitwerking van twee getransformeerde S. cerevisiae rasse, wat ekstrasellulere polisakkarases produseer, op verskillende wyndruifvarieteite na te vors. Die volgende gene is reeds voorheen gekloneer en gekarakteriseer: die endo-pxylanase- geen (xynC) van Aspergillus niger, die endo-p- 1, 4 -glukanase-geen (endl) van Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, die pektaatliase-geen (pe/E) van Erwinia chrysanthemi en die poligalakturonase-geen (p e h l) van Erwinia carotovora. Die alkoholdehidrogenase-geenpromotor (ADH 1 P), die alkoholdehidrogenase IIgeentermineerder (ADH 2 T), die gistriptofaansintase geen se termineerder (TRP 5 t) en die sekresiesein van die gisferomoon a-faktor (MFa 1 s) is gebruik om die volgende geenkonstrukte saam te stel: ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-end 1 -TRP 5 t (toekend as END 1), ADH 1 p-xynC-ADH 2 T (bekend as XYN 4), ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-peh 1 -TRP 5 T fbekend as PEH 1), and ADH 1 p-MFa 1 s-pelE-TRP 5 T (bekend as PELE). Twee gisintegrerings plasmiede is gekonstrueer, een wat die END 1 - en XYN 4 - geenkassette bevat en die ander wat die PEH 1 -PELE-kasset besit. Hierdie twee plasmiede is daarna in twee aparte industriele wyngisrasse van S. cerevisiae by die URA 3 lokus geintegreer. Vir die seleksie van die industriele wyngistransformante in die afwesigheid van ouksotrofiese merkers, is die dominante selekteerbare Geneticin G 418 weerstandbiedende (G f) merker in die END 1 - en XYA/ 4 -geenkassetbevattende plasmied geintegreer. Die dominante selekteerbare sulfumetronmetielweerstandbiedende (SMR 1) merker is in die integreringsplasmied, wat die PEH 1 - PELE-geenkasset bevat, geintegreer vir seleksie. Transformasie van hierdie plasmiede in kommersiele wyngisrasse het tot die direkte sintese van die END 1 -, XYN 4 -, PELE- en PEH 1 -transkripte aanleiding gegee, sowel as tot die produksie van die biologies aktiewe ekstrasellulere endo-P- 1, 4 -glukanase, endo-P-xylanase, pektaatliase en poligalaturonase. Tydens die wynmaakproses het bogenoemde rekombinante giste aanleiding gegee tot verhoogde kleurekstraksie uit die druifdoppe van sekere varieteite, asook tot verhoogde vryvloei wyn. Dit is verkry deur die effektiewe degradasie van die glukane, xilane en pektiene in die doppe. Die rekombinante giste het ook verlaagde turbiditeit in die wyn tot gevolg gehad, wat die wyne makliker filtreerbaar maak. Hierdie werk was net die eerste stap. In die toekoms sal verdere navorsing gedoen moet word om die presiese effekte van hierdie rekombinante giste op verskillende rooi en wit druifvarieteite te bepaal. ‘n Ander fokus van hierdie tesis was om nie-Saccharomyces wyngiste vir die produksie van ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme te selekteer. Die rede hiervoor is om te bepaal watter tipes ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme geproduseer word, asook watter ensieme deur watter genera geproduseer word, ‘n Totaal van 237 gisisolate wat tot die generas Kloeckera, Candida, Debaryomyces, Rhodotorula, Pichia, Zygosaccharomyces, Hanseniaspora en Kluyveromyces behoort, is vir die produksie van ekstrasellulere pektinase, protease, p-glukanase, lichenase, p-glukosidase, sellulase, xilanase, amilase en sulfiet reduktase-aktiwiteit getoets. Hierdie giste is almal vanaf druiwe en druiwesap geVsoleer om te verseker dat dit wel giste is wat gedurende die beginfases van fermentasie in die mos teenwoordig is. Hierdie inligting kan nou verder gebruik word om die spesifieke effekte wat hierdie ensieme, wat deur die sogenaamde wilde giste geproduseer word, tydens die beginfases van fermentasies op die mos het, te bepaal. Hierdie inligting kan ook in die toekoms gebruik word om Saccharomyces-wyngiste met gene van die ri-Saccharomycesgiste te transformeer om ekstrasellulere hidrolitiese ensieme vir die degradasie van die problematiese polisakkariede in wyn te produseer. Daar sal egter in die toekoms baie navorsing gedoen moet word om die omvang van hierdie ensiemaktiwiteite in wynfermentasies te bepaal, asook om meer kennis te bekom oor die fisiologiese en metaboliese samestelling van nie-Saccfraromyces wyngiste...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} the {{macromolecular}} composition and content of different wood species on the properties of wood-polymer composites (WPCs) achieved when using poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (EVOH) as a compatibiliser and {{linear low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) as a matrix, were investigated. Four wood different species (A. cyclops (acacia), E. grandis (eucalyptus), P. radiata (pine) and Q. alba (oak)) with different macromolecular composition and contents and average particle lengths were used. WPCs filled with these species and WPCs filled with the same species but without extractives were prepared using 10 % wood content and different amounts (0, 2, 5, 7 and 10 %) of EVOH. An EVOH content of 7 % was found to be optimum. Unextracted woods produced WPCs with higher mechanical properties and better resistance to ultraviolet (UV) degradation, while the extracted woods produced WPCs with lower water absorption (WA) rates and better thermal stability. Use of unextracted A. cyclops resulted in composites with superior mechanical and thermal properties compared with the other unextracted species, most probably due to its higher cellulose and lignin contents and a favourable average wood particle length (0. 225 mm). A. cyclops composites also had higher WA and thickness swelling (TS) rates most likely due to the greater number of free hydroxyl groups present in these composites because of higher cellulose content. Composites containing wood species with a high lignin and extractive content, such as A. cyclops and Q. alba, exhibited higher resistance to UV degradation. Poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylenes) (EVOHs) with different ethylene content (27, 32, 38 and 44 %) and A. cyclops with different particle sizes (180, 250 and 450 ìm) were used to prepare WPCs with 10 % A. cyclops content. The effect of the contact area between the A. cyclops particles and LLDPE achieved when using EVOHs as compatibilisers on the properties of WPCs was also investigated. The greatest improvements in the mechanical and thermal properties of composites made with A. cyclops with particle size 180 ìm were obtained when EVOH with 44 % ethylene content was used. The greatest improvements in the composites made with A. cyclops with particle size 250 ìm were achieved when EVOH with 38 % ethylene content was used. Composites made with A. cyclops with particle size 450 ìm exhibited better properties when EVOH with 27 % ethylene content was used. All the composites that had better mechanical and thermal properties, also exhibited better compatibility and interface adhesion. Two successful approaches were used to impart more attractive ecological and economical advantages to WPCs. In the first approach, (0, 2, 5 and 7 %) degraded LLDPE was used as a compatibiliser in WPCs at levels of 10, 30 and 50 % wood content. The resulting mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and hardness, thermal and morphological properties of the compatibilised composites were slightly higher than those of noncompatibilised composites and virgin LLDPE. Elongation at break and impact properties of the compatibilised composites were lower than in virgin LLDPE, but higher than in noncompatibilised composites. In the second approach, polyethylene (PE) and various functionalised polyethylenes (PEs) were synthesised by copolymerising ethylene and 10 -undecen- 1 -ol using a soluble metallocene/methylaluminoxane catalyst at room temperature. The incorporation of functional groups increased with increasing comonomer content. WPCs with 10 and 30 % wood content were prepared. The composites prepared with functionalised PEs had better mechanical, thermal and morphogical properties than the composites prepared with PE. Composites made with functionalised PE with higher hydroxyl groups content exhibited better properties than composites made with functionalised PE with lower hydroxyl groups content. Composites with 10 % wood content exhibited better properties and performance than composites with 30 % wood content. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die gevolg van die makromolekulere samestelling van verskillende houtspesies op die eienskappe van hout-polimeer saamgestelde materiale (HPS) wanneer poli(viniel alcohol-ko-etileen) (EVOH) as versoeningsmiddel gebruik word saam met linieere lae digtheid poli(etileen) (LLDPE) as matriks is ondersoek. Vier houtspesies (A. cyclops (acacia), E. grandis (eucalyptus), P. radiata (pine) and Q. alba (oak)) met verskillende makromolekulere samestelling and partikelgrootte-verspreiding is gebruik in die studie. HPS materiale is berei met hierdie <b>vesels,</b> beide voor en na ekstraksie van die houtpartikels met onderskeidelik warm water en oplosmiddels (alleen en in kombinasie). In hierdie HPS materiale is 10 % hout gebruik en 0, 2, 5, 7 en 10 % EVOH. 'n EVOH inhoud van 7 % is as optimum bepaal. Houtpartikels voor ekstraksie het HPS materiale met beter meganiese eienskappe en beter weerstand teen UV bestraling, terwyle partikels wat ekstraksie ondergaan het HPS materiale met laer water-absorpsie en beter hitte-stabiliteit to gevolg gehad het. Die gebruik van ongeekstraheerde A. cyclops het samegestelde materiale met die beste meganiese en termiese eienskappe tot gevolg gehad in vergelyking met die ander houtspesies (voor ekstraksie), as gevolg van die hoer sellulose en lignien inhoud van die spesie, sowel as 'n voordelige partikelgrootte-verspreiding. A. Cyclops saamgestelde materiale he took hoer waterabsorpsie (WA) en dikte-swelling (DS) tempos gehad, weens die groter hoeveelheid vrye hidroksielgroepe teenwoording in die materiale, direk in verwantskap met die sellulose-inhoud. Saamgestelde materiale met 'n hoe hoevellheid lignien en ekstraheerbare materiale (A. cyclops and Q. alba) het beter weerstand teen UV-degradasie geopenbaar. Verskillende poli(viniel alkohol-ko-etileen) polimere (EVOHs) met wisselende etileen-inhoud (27, 32, 38 en 44 %) en A. Cyclops met verskillende partikel-groottes (180, 250 en 250 µm) is gebruik om HPS materiale met 10 % hout te vervaardig. Die gevolg van die kontak-area tussen die houtpartikels en die LLDPE wanneer EVOHs as versoeningsmiddel gebruik is, is ook ondersoek. Die beste verbetering in die meganiese en termiese eienskappe van die saamgestelde materiale met A. cyclops met partikel-grootte 180 µm is gekry met EVOH met 44 % etileen-inhoud, terwyl die beste resultate met 250 µm partikels verkry is met 'n EVOH met 38 % etileen, en met 27 % etileen in die geval van die 450 µm partikels. Twee benaderinge om meer aantreklike ekologiese en ekonomiese eienskappe by die HPS materiale te bewerkstellig was suksesvol. In die eerste geval is gedegradeerde LLDPE as versoeningsmiddel gebruik. Die resulterende meganiese eienskappe van die HPS materiale met LLDPE as versoeningsmiddel was beter as die HPS mateirale daarsonder. Samegestelde materiale met 10, 30 en 50 % hout is vervaardig. Die trekverlenging by die breekpunt sowel as die impaksterkte van die HPS materiale was laer as LLDPE alleen, maar beter as die nie-versoende HPS materiale. In die tweede benadering is polietileen (PE) en gefunksionaliseerde PE gesintetiseer deur etileen en 10 -undekeen- 1 -ol te koplimeriseer met ‘n oplosbare metalloseen/metiel alumoksaan katalis. Die hoeveelheid funskionele (OH) groepe is verhoog deur toenemend ekomonommer-inhoud. HPS materiale met 10 en 30 % hout is vervaardig. Die saamgestelde materiale met funksionele PE het beter maganiese eienskappe gehad as die met gewone PE. Hoe hoër die hidroksielgroep-inhoud, hoe beter die eienskappe van die HPS materiale, terwyl die materiale met 10 % hout beter eienskappe openbaar het as materiale met 30 % hout...|$|R
