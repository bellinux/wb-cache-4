25|$|A {{consequence}} of a tailless delta design, {{such as in the}} Viggen, is that the elevons, which replace more conventional control surfaces, operate with a small effective moment arm; their use adds substantial weight to the aircraft at takeoff and landing.

The canard surfaces were positioned behind the inlets and placed slightly higher than the main wing, with a higher stall angle than the wing, and were equipped with flaps.

40|$|Abstract:- One of {{the main}} reasons for the {{aerodynamic}} drag in automotive vehicles is the flow separation near the vehicle’s rear end. To delay this flow separation, <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> are used in recent vehicles. The <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> are commonly used in aircrafts to prevent flow separation. Even though <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> themselves create drag, but they also reduce drag by delaying flow separation at downstream. The overall effect of <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> is more beneficial and proved by experimentation. The effect depends on the shape,size and orientation of <b>vortex</b> <b>generators.</b> Hence optimized shape with proper orientation is essential for getting better results. This paper presents the effect of <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> at different orientation to the flow field and the mechanism by which these effects takes place...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vortex</b> <b>generators</b> {{within a}} two-dimensional, external-compression {{supersonic}} inlet for Mach 1. 6 were investigated {{to determine their}} ability to increase total pressure recovery, reduce total pressure distortion, and improve the boundary layer. The <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> studied included vanes and ramps. The geometric factors of the <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> studied included height, length, spacing, and positions upstream and downstream of the inlet terminal shock. The flow through the inlet was simulated through the computational solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations on multi-block, structured grids. The <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> were simulated by either gridding the geometry of the <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> or modeling the vortices generated by the <b>vortex</b> <b>generators.</b> The inlet performance was characterized by the inlet total pressure recovery, total pressure distortion, and incompressible shape factor of the boundary-layer at the engine face. The results suggested that downstream vanes reduced the distortion and improved the boundary layer. The height of the <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> had the greatest effect of the geometric factors...|$|R

50|$|One {{the most}} {{important}} applications of metasurfaces is to control the wavefront of electromagnetic waves by imparting local, gradient phase shift to the incoming waves, {{which leads to a}} generalization of the ancient laws of reflection and refraction.

5000|$|Another key Il-62 {{trademark}} is the [...] "saw tooth" [...] ("dog-tooth") on {{the wing}} leading edge. This prominent feature acts as an aerodynamic fence <b>vortex</b> <b>generator</b> (without which the wings would be almost vortex-free), and fixed leading edge droop/slat/flap. It ensures vice-free behaviour at high angles of attack and assists efficient long-range cruise. The saw tooth removes the need for hydraulic controls, stick shakers, and stick pushers. Interestingly, later models of the VC10 (for British United Airways and Ghana Airways) also adopted this feature, in their case closer to the wing tips.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} flow {{disturbances}} generated by simulated cross-stream fuel injection on the drag reduction potential of boundary-layer combustion are investigated. Cross-stream fuel injection is commonly proposed for operational scramjet engines {{to aid in}} the penetration and mixing of the fuel jet with the mainstream flow. To simulate flow disturbances that are representative of those generated by cross-stream fuel injection <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> of semipyramidal shape are attached at two locations in the REST inlet. The <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> that were used produced counter-rotating vortex pairs that are representative of those produced when fuel is injected cross stream into the flow. For the fuel-on tests, in which fuel is injected tangentially into the boundary layer and allowed to burn, the pressure for the test with <b>vortex</b> <b>generators</b> rises to levels similar to those in tests without <b>vortex</b> <b>generators.</b> The ignition of the fuel, however, occurs further upstream than in the test without <b>vortex</b> <b>generators.</b> These experiments show that the measured levels of skin-friction reduction due to boundary-layer combustion are similar to those measured in the experiments without <b>vortex</b> <b>generators.</b> This is a clear demonstration that flow disturbances similar to those from cross stream fuel injection in the inlet and isolator of a scramjet engine do not affect the drag reduction potential of boundary-layer combustion...|$|R

5000|$|Installation of vortex {{generators}} {{can usually}} {{bring about a}} slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance. The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements. [...] An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a maximum zero fuel weight or, if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified {{as one of the}} airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight. [...] For these reasons, <b>vortex</b> <b>generator</b> kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.|$|E

50|$|Roncz's {{first public}} {{collaboration}} with Rutan was the Solitaire sailplane. Possibly his best known contribution to Rutan's designs is {{his involvement in}} the Rutan Voyager, the incredibly light and incredibly efficient twin-engine craft which flew nonstop/non-refueled around the world. Worried about the effects of rain or insects on the canard, he funded a wind tunnel model, which was tested at The Ohio State University Aeronautical and Astronautical Research Laboratory in their 3 by 5 foot wind tunnel. With Roncz running the computer data system, and Dick Rutan running the wind tunnel, they created <b>vortex</b> <b>generator</b> designs which would protect the canard wing in any weather. He also designed the propellers for both the front and rear engines, increasing their efficiency by 4%. He designed all the airfoil surfaces to control contamination by drag increasing bug-spattering. The airflow approaching the airfoil would direct heavier insects along the stagnation point, and smaller insects to go above the wing. Post-flight examination found only 3 insect carcasses splattered on the Voyager's wings.|$|E

All models continued to sport Recaro bucket seats, Brembo brakes and Momo steering wheels.

In an effort to reduce the price increase on the Evolution IX model, HID headlights were no longer standard equipment on the base IX (nor were they standard on the 2005 VIII), and were available only in the SSL package (Sun, Sound, and Leather), SE (Special Edition) and MR trims.|$|E
5000|$|Time-of-flight Lorentz force velocimetry, is {{intended}} for contactless determination of flow rate in conductive fluids. It can be successfully used even in case when such material properties as electrical conductivity or density are not precisely known under specific outer conditions. The last reason makes time-of-flight LFV especially important for industry application. According to time-of-flight LFV (Fig. 9) two coherent measurement systems are mounted on a channel one by one. The measurement is based on getting of cross-correlating function of signals, which are registered by two magnetic measurement's system. Every system consists of permanent magnet and force sensor, so inducing of Lorentz force and measurement of the reaction force are made simultaneously. Any cross-correlation function is useful only in case of qualitative difference between signals and for creating the difference in this case turbulent fluctuations are used. Before reaching of measurement zone of a channel liquid passes artificial <b>vortex</b> <b>generator</b> that induces strong disturbances in it. And when such fluctuation-vortex reaches magnetic field of measurement system we can observe a peak on its force-time characteristic while second system still measures stable flow.
