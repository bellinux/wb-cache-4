500|$|The modern ao dai {{turned up}} several years ago. However, the ao dai {{was a concern}} of {{people who need to}} wear it as a uniform such as: teacher, flight attendance, receptionists. It was not {{until the end of the}} year 2016 did the modern ao dai become so popular with {{hundreds}} of new designs. It is modified in the collar, the sleeves or the length of two flaps. Furthermore, instead of wearing pants with the ao dai, people nowadays prefer to wear culottes and skirts inside it. Not only the change in designs, people also use different materials for the modern ao dai like silk, brocade fabric or <b>voile</b> <b>fabric.</b>|$|E
50|$|Voiles are {{available}} {{in a range of}} patterns and colours. Because of their semitransparent quality, voile curtains are made using heading tape that is less easily noticeable through the fabric. <b>Voile</b> <b>fabric</b> is also used in dressmaking, either in multiple layers or laid over a second material. It is similar to chiffon.|$|E

50|$|Textile based {{activities}} such as fabric manufacturing and yarn manufacturing is the major economic activity in this town. Fabrics such as yarn dyed fabrics, griege fabrics, printed fabrics, linen <b>fabrics,</b> sheeting <b>fabrics,</b> <b>voile</b> <b>fabrics,</b> poplin fabrics, organic cotton woven fabric and canvas fabric is manufactured in this town using auto-looms and power looms factory. 100% viscose and Polyester viscose yarn are also manufactured in the spinning mills in this area. It is located very closer to Erode, a well known textile centre.|$|R
50|$|After the {{break-up}} of her marriage, Birtwell continued in fashion, designing for the Radley label for a time, until in 1984 {{she set up}} a shop on Westbourne Park Road in Bayswater, selling fabrics for the home. Again she built up a reputation for innovative and witty design. Her first success came with her own take on a 16th-century animal print she called 'Animal Solo', followed later by the first, and much copied, white on white <b>voile</b> and muslin <b>fabrics.</b> These fabrics are now {{to be seen in}} many homes, hotels and public spaces, including Claridge's and The Lanesborough hotels in London, The Grand Hotel, Leeds, and the Dubai Hilton.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is an Old World {{parasitoid}} of tephritid {{fruit flies}} that was widely {{introduced in the}} Americas to control pest species such as the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata. Augmentative releases in irrigated coffee plantations in semiarid regions of Brazil are under consideration and dispersal capacity of D. longicaudata in this habitat are important to develop release strategies. Approximately 2, 000 individuals of D. longicaudata (5 to 7 days old) were released {{in the center of}} a fruiting coffee plantation every two weeks from Dec. 2009 to Apr. 2010. Dispersal from the central release point was monitored to the north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest at 11 distances, beginning at 4. 6 m and ending at 90 m from the release point. At each point, a parasitism unit (approximately 120 larvae of C. capitata in the 3 rd instar wrapped in <b>voile</b> <b>fabric)</b> and 10 coffee beans were collected. The average dispersion distance and dispersion area were estimated by the model proposed by Dobzhansky and Wright (1943). The average dispersion distances were 27. 06 m (as estimated by fruit collection) and 33. 11 m (as estimated by oviposition traps). The average dispersion areas were 1, 315. 25 m 2 and 1, 752. 45 m 2 originating from the collection of beans and parasitism units, respectively. Cohorts of 2, 000 adult D. longicaudata released at six points ha− 1 are estimated to result in sufficient colonization to exert significant control of Ceratitis capitata...|$|E
40|$|Some {{species of}} the genus Anastrepha (Diptera: Tephritidae) are {{successfully}} man - aged by matching the sterile insect technique with parasitoid releases. Such strategies used in integrated pest management can be implemented only where insect mass-rearing programs are feasible. In this study, we show the process of domestication, rearing technology and qual - ity control data obtained from 54 generations of Anastrepha sp. 1 aff. fraterculus (Wiedemann, 1830) kept under fully artificial conditions. Eggs were collected by an artificial oviposition panel consisting of {{one side of the}} cage made of blue <b>voile</b> <b>fabric</b> externally covered with a thin layer of silicon rubber. They were then air-bubbled in water at 25 ºC for 48 h before seeding. Larvae were reared on the regular laboratory artificial diet with 66 % of agar reduction turning over a semi-liquid diet, which reduced costs and improved insect quality. The adult and larval diets were composed of local ingredients including hydrolyzed yeast. When large-scale production of this fly is contemplated, the critical stage is larval development. This system of artificial rearing for A. fraterculus sp. 1 developed in Brazil, allows for the production {{of a large number of}} insects of excellent quality using local ingredients and less agar in diet composition than the original medium used for this species. By reducing the interval of egg collection, the system might be optimized in terms of insect yield and, therefore, meet the demands of A. fraterculus sp. 1 with regard to integrated pest management purposes. 201...|$|E
