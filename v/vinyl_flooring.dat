Walls are plain, having been painted over and over throughout the years. The original wood floor finish is still retained in the library, the auditorium, {{and many of the}} classrooms; some have been substituted or changed to concrete. Hallways and stairs are paved in concrete. <b>Vinyl</b> <b>flooring</b> is used at offices. Glazed concrete tile is found at the lobby, where the original iron grilles, of geometrical design, are still in use.|$|E

50|$|The Bathroom Floor - With the {{bathroom}} fixtures removed, the next {{task is to}} put new <b>vinyl</b> <b>floors</b> onto {{the bathroom}}. Brian M and Johnnie manage to fail by applying adhesive all over the floor, leaving the task to adhere the <b>vinyl</b> to the <b>floor</b> difficult (as they would have large air bubbles and get adhesive all over their new floor). Johnnie also had fitted his bathroom with two pieces instead of one, having mismeasured. Angie also failed due to having mismeasured, while Brian P gave up after cutting a small piece for {{the area around the}} toilet before realizing that the entire room must be done with one piece of vinyl.

Eric took the time to assemble his air compressor and nail down a subfloor, but the subfloor was too flimsy and it left him no time to start doing the <b>vinyl</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R

When it dries, he draws on it. In some places he scrapes the tar away {{and allows the}} tile to show through. Elsewhere, he cuts the tar away and fills in sections with plaster. The plaster and tile {{may or may not}} be painted. The color often retains the gloss and unnatural lushness of the Polaroid photographs Sultan takes after he decides the still-life arrangement. The results are surprising and hip. The still lifes may not literally contain apples and oranges, but they do mix together very different, seemingly incompatible elements... Positive and negative, charred and pristine, ripeness and decay all nestle together..." ...|$|R
