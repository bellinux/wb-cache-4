50|$|Otiorhynchus (often spelt Otiorrhynchus) {{is a large}} genus of weevils in {{the family}} Curculionidae. Many species of the genus, {{particularly}} the black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (O. sulcatus) and the strawberry root weevil (O. ovatus), are important pests, both as larvae and as adults. Larvae feed on plant roots. Adults are flightless with fused elytra and feed at night on plant foliage. In many species of the genus at least some races are polyploid and parthenogenetic, {{while the rest of}} the races and species are diploid and bisexual. Otiorhynchus weevils, particularly O. scaber, have been a popular subject for studies of the evolution of parthenogenesis. The genus is native to the Palearctic region. However, sixteen species were inadvertently introduced to North America and have become widespread there.A number of species are troglobites, cave-dwelling animals that lack eyes.|$|E

40|$|Sweet potato (Ipomoca batatas (L,) Lam) is {{the major}} staple crop in Papua New Guinea and {{experiments}} were conducted investigating factors affecting yield decline. Yields; of unfertilized plots were related to rainfall and measured changes in soil properties, nematode (Meloidogyne sp., Rotylenchulus reniformis) and sweet potato weevil (Cylas formicarius) populations. The research took place at two locations (Hobu and Unitech) on Eutropepts and Fluvents, respectively. Yields at Hobu decreased from 18 Mg ha(- 1) in the first season to around 7 Mg ha(- 1) in the third season, but no significant yield trend was observed at Unitech. Vine biomass was not affected {{by the number of}} cropping seasons at Hobu brit it decreased at Unitech with time. Marketable tuber yield at both sites was significantly correlated to rainfall, i. e, the more rain the lower the yield. Significant changes in soil chemical properties included a decrease in pH and base saturation (Hobu) and a decrease in CEC and exchangeable K (Unitech). No significant changes in soil bulk density were found and no obvious pattern was found in the nutrient concentrations of leaf samples with time. Nematode populations were high and tripled between the first and third season at Hobu. Half of the vines at Hobu and all of the vines at Unitech were damaged by sweet potato weevils, but tuber damage was higher in Hobu although the damage was only superficial. Despite the considerable variation in yield and yield determining factors, the study showed that the decline in sweet potato yield may be attributed to the high nematode infestation, accompanied by an increase in <b>vine</b> damage by <b>weevils</b> and a declining soil fertility.

40|$|Over the {{previous}} quarter century the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{has become a}} pest of horticultural and agricultural plants. The <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is a polyphagous coleopteran insect {{and is able to}} attack over one hundred different plant species. Its spread has been limited by its lack of flight but modern world trade in live container grown plants has spread the insect to new habitats. Damage to plants caused by <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is two fold, with the larvae destroying root balls while the adults attack the, leaves. The larval stage, in particular is difficult to treat with conventional insecticides unless environmentally undesirable soil treatments are used. The current lack of defence against the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has opened the door for methods of crop protection through the generation of genetically modified plants. The design of an efficient GM approach to control the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> requires a sound knowledge of the insect’s digestive enzymes, which may be used as potential targets for insecticidal proteins. This approach was achieved for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> through analysis of active digestive proteases in the insects gut and the identification of suitable proteinase inhibitors which would reduce the overall level of protein hydrolysis. Using this method it was discovered that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> contained both serine and cysteine proteases in addition to a range of other digestive hydrolases. This biochemical data was supported by a molecular approach to isolate cDNA clones associated with the insect's digestive tract. Using a gut specific cDNA library clones encoding a cathepsin B protease, two trypsin proteases, a pectinesterase, a lipase and a cellulase were isolated and characterised. The cellulase isolated from <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has been shown to originate from the insect genome as shown through Southern Blot analysis and sequencing across several intronic regions. Evidence presented herein shows that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> gut extract hydrolyses both cellulose and cellobiose. Similar results were observed with recombinant protein expressed in the eukaryotic yeast P. pastoris. Furthermore data presented here shows that the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> has the full complement of enzymes needed for the complete digestion of crystalline cellulose, which was until recently believed to be the sole domain of several species of bacteria and yeast. In addition a cDNA clone encoded a <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> endogenous chitinase was isolated from the cDNA library. This chitinase cDNA and one encoding the proteinase inhibitor Oryzacystatin-I were used to generate transgenic tobacco plants which have been shown to express the transgene. These transgenic plants are the first step in developing a strategy for plant protection against <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> based on genetic modification...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} sweetpotato {{resistance to}} sweet potato weevils (Cylas spp.) and investigated the phytochemicals that mediated this defence. New Kawogo, LIR 302 and ARA 228 {{were shown to}} be the most resistant based on stem and root damage. Significant differences were observed on the number of faecal droppings, feeding holes and eggs laid on the root in a choice and no-choice bioassays confirming that New Kawogo, LIR 302 and ARA 228 affected development and emergence of adult weevils. Six hydroxycinnamic acid esters, including hexadecylcaffeic, hexadecylcoumaric, octadecylcaffeic, octadecylcoumaric, heptadecylcaffeic and 5 -O-caffeoylquinic acid esters were identified on the root surface and amounts of these differed significantly between resistant and susceptible varieties. The mean number of C. puncticollis and C. brunneus feeding holes, faecal droppings and egg laid on the root core were significantly different among the root cores treated with synthetic hydroxycinnamic acid esters. The study also showed that there were significant differences in the root volatiles of resistant and susceptible variety both before and after infestation. The larval survival of sweetpotato weevil was significantly affected by hydroxycinnamic acid esters treatment and Bt-toxin applied on the diet. There was also significant differences in percentage sweetpotato weevil root infestation among genotypes of the segregating population. The genotype by environment (GxE) interaction effect was also significant on the sweetpotato weevil damage on the stem portion of the sweetpotato <b>vine</b> indicating that <b>weevil</b> stem damage is dependent on the season. The mean number of sweetpotato weevil feeding holes differed significantly on the root of the genotypes of the segregating population in the feeding and oviposition bioassay. There was significant difference in total hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) esters among the genotypes of the segregating population. The distribution of genotype mean total HCA ester concentration was skewed to the left and only one progeny, NKB 257, had higher total HCA ester concentration than New Kawogo, the resistant mother used in the crossing. A weak but significant correlation between total HCA ester concentration and sweetpotato weevil root damage was observed signifying that resistance to sweetpotato weevils depended on other factors as well.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{is a major}} pest of {{soft fruit}} and {{ornamental}} crops. There is an urgent need to improve control of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges. To be effective this approach requires that the weevils move through the crop environment {{and in doing so}} spread the pathogen from the artificial refuges.

40|$|The <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus is a {{parthenogenetic}} reproducing species which forages for suitable host {{plants at}} night, but is found congregated in dark places during the day.

Using a still-air olfactometer, we tested adult vine weevils at night for their behavioural response to odours from conspecifics, feeding on {{a mixture of}} spindle tree (Euonymus fortunei) and yew (Taxus baccata), and to a sexually reproducing related species (Otiorhynchus salicicola), feeding on a mixture of ivy (Hedera helix) and cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between reproductive performance and preference for potential host plants of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> is investigated, {{as shown in}} tests on contact (or feeding) preference, presented herein, and tests on olfactory preference, published elsewhere. Assessment of reproductive performance shows that the host-plant range of the adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus in Europe is limited to one gymnosperm genus (Taxus sp.) and {{a broad range of}} angiosperm plants in two subclasses of the Dicotyledonae, namely Dilleniidae and Rosidae. The successful reproduction on very distantly related plant taxa suggests that the original weevil- and plant-habitat has mediated the current host-plant range of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> Contact-preference tests with equally suitable hosts, such as Aronia, Fragaria, Euonymus and Taxus, and one less suitable host, Humulus, indicate a mismatch between contact preference and performance and, as far as olfactory preferences are known, these match neither the contact preferences nor the performance. This mismatch may arise because (i) host plant species offered do not occur in weevil habitat in Europe (e. g. Aronia and the cultivated Fragaria come from North America) and (ii) predation (or disease) risks differ among host plants, thereby altering effective reproductive performance. With respect to performance on novel hosts (Thuja, Prunus) and bad hosts (Rhododendron), some between-individual variation is found within a single population, suggesting that local populations harbour (possibly genetic) variation for adaptation to new hosts. How this variation is maintained in the face of strong selection pressures on local populations of flightless and thelytokous weevils, is an important question for understanding the broad host plant range in the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are pathogens {{which require}} an insect host to fulfil their life cycle and {{are commonly used}} as biocontrol agents. Studies have shown {{that a combination of}} EPN and EPF can result in greater insect mortality when compared to the agents applied alone. This interaction could possibly reduce the cost and quantities of single dose applications, inferring a synergistic effect. However, combinations of these pathogens may also result in additive or antagonistic interactions which would be of no benefit to growers. Hylobius abietis (large pine weevil) and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil)</b> cause economic damage to forestry and horticultural crops, respectively. Large pine weevil larvae develop in the tree stumps, emerge as adults and feed on the bark of newly planted saplings, causing extensive mortality. Black <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae kill plants by feeding on the roots and adults cause cosmetic damage. In this investigation, laboratory and field trials were conducted against large pine weevil larvae to determine whether interactions occur if EPN and EPF were applied simultaneously. EPN and EPF have already been shown to interact synergistically against the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> in laboratory conditions. These experiments were repeated to investigate if synergistic interactions could be reproduced. Synergistic interactions were found with EPN and EPF against the large pine weevil in some laboratory experiments. However, antagonism and additivity were also recorded and synergism could not be predictably achieved. The field trial against the large pine weevil resulted in additivity. This indicates that the combined application of EPN and EPF would not be a better option than single applications.

Other plant volatiles eliciting responses in the weevils' antenna are 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, hexylamine, benzylalcohol, 1, 2 -dimethoxybenzene, o-cresol, myrtenol, 3 -methylcyclohexanol, ¿-hexalactone, and ¿-heptalactone.

40|$|A Y-tube {{olfactometer}} and a still-air olfactometer {{were developed}} to determine the attractiveness of several host plants for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.); Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Odours of weevil-damaged yew (Taxus baccata) and spindle trees (Euonymus fortunei) are attractive to the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> but Rhododendron and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) are not. Undamaged Euonymus is attractive to the weevils in springtime but not in late summer. When clean air or undamaged Euonymus is the alternative, weevils strongly prefer weevil-damaged Euonymus foliage, and this preference is retained throughout the year. Hence, plant damage {{plays a role in}} attraction of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil.</b> In contrast to the permanent attractiveness of weevil-damaged Euonymus, mechanically damaged plants gradually lose the attractiveness that they have early in the growing season. This suggests that emission of volatiles, produced by the plants in response to weevil damage, is important for attraction of the weevils because the weevils may use these plant odours to find suitable food plants throughout the season. Apart from weevil-damage-related plant volatiles, green leaf volatiles must also play a significant role, as indicated by the fact that weevils prefer: early season, undamaged Euonymus over clean air; early season, mechanically damaged Euonymus over undamaged Euonymus; and, throughout the season, had no preference when mechanically damaged Euonymus is tested against weevil-damaged Euonymus. Thus, monitoring traps may be developed by the use of green leaf volatiles and/or herbivore-induced volatiles, as attractant...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} infective juveniles (IJs) of Heterorhabditis megidis (strain NLH-E 87. 3) to cues from roots of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.), thuja (Thuja occidentalis L.) and to larvae {{of the black}} <b>vine</b> <b>weevil,</b> Otiorhynchus sulcatus, was studied. Choice assays were conducted in an Y-tube olfactometer filled with moist sand. Infective juveniles were activated {{by the presence of}} intact roots of both strawberry and thuja plants. Some nematodes aggregated in the compartments with roots but most moved away from the roots to the opposite side. Given a choice, IJs showed a preference for strawberry roots above O. sulcatus larvae. No difference in preference was observed between thuja roots and O. sulcatus larvae. The combination of strawberry roots with <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae was preferred above roots alone. In the assays with thuja roots and larvae versus thuja roots alone, however, IJs were stimulated to move but showed preference for the opposite compartment away from the arms with roots and larvae. Nematodes responded differently to mechanically damaged roots as opposed to roots damaged by <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae. In assays with damaged thuja roots, IJs were most attracted by the roots damaged by larvae, whereas in the strawberry assays IJs showed a clear preference for the mechanically damaged roots. When challenged with a choice between strawberry and thuja roots, IJs moved preferentially to strawberry than to thuja roots. A preference for the combination of strawberry roots plus larvae over the thuja roots plus larvae was also observed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:Vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) {{is a major}} pest of {{soft fruit}} and {{ornamental}} crops. There is an urgent need to improve control of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> and in particular to provide growers with effective Integrated Pest Management-compatible controls with which to target the adult stage of this pest. One approach would be to exploit the behaviour of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> to disseminate spores of an entomopathogenic fungus placed within the crop environment in artificial refuges. To be effective this approach requires that the weevils move through the crop environment {{and in doing so}} spread the pathogen from the artificial refuges. OBJECTIVE:Use passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to study the movement of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> within crop environments. METHOD:A series of laboratory bioassays were completed in which the effect of attaching RFID tags using a thermoplastic or a cyanoacrylate adhesive on survival and movement, on both horizontal and vertical surfaces, of adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> was determined. An outdoor field experiment was then completed at Harper Adams University in order to test the potential of this technique for studying <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> movement within crop environments. RESULTS:Attaching RFID tags using the thermoplastic adhesive did not result in any weevil deaths over a 21 day period. In contrast, just over half (53 %) of the weevils to which the RFID tag was attached using the cyanoacrylate adhesive died over the same period. The mean of weevil horizontal movement speed was significantly slower when an RFID tag was attached using a thermoplastic (1. 01  cm/s) or a cyanoacrylate (0. 29  cm/s) adhesive compared with untagged weevils (1. 83  cm/s). However, weevils that were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive were significantly faster than weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mean vertical movement speed was also significantly slower when weevils were tagged using the thermoplastic adhesive (0. 18  cm/s) compared with untagged weevils (0. 37  cm/s). Weevils tagged using the cyanoacrylate adhesive were unable to climb vertical surfaces. In the field experiment, weevils moved away from their release points. Nine days after the start of the experiment weevils were on average 3. 38  m from their release points indicating a speed of movement of 0. 38  m/day. The mean distance of movement from their release points did not increase further {{during the rest of the}} experimental period, but remained relatively constant at between 2. 50 and 3. 28  m. As such, for weevils that remained within the crop environment, there is no evidence of dispersal behaviour,with movement behaviour observed more likely to be driven by resource utilisation. However, not all weevils remained within the crop area. Indeed, 15 (38 %) of released weevils and/or RFID tags left the crop area, indicating possible long range dispersal by these individuals or evidence of predation of the weevils. A total of 11 (28 %) of the RFID tagged weevils released into the crop were recovered alive and with the tag still attached after 35 days. These weevils were estimated to have moved a distances of between 2. 65 and 17. 30  m (average distance moved 7. 50  m) during this period. These distances are likely to underestimate the distance moved by each weevil as they assume that each weevil took the most direct route between each point and did not move other than this. In total eight of the RFID-tagged weevils moved both along and between rows of strawberry grow-bags. At the start of the experiment the 11 RFID tagged weevils occupied 11 (14 %) of the strawberry grow-bags. If these weevils took the most direct route between each position within the crop where they were detected these weevils would have crossed, and potentially laid eggs in, 44 (58 %) of the grow-bags during the 35 days of the experiment. If they had taken a more indirect route the weevils could have potentially laid eggs in a higher number of the grow-bags. CONCLUSIONS:Results presented here indicate that RFID tags can be used to study the movement of <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> adults within crop environments. However, the weight and size of currently available tags significantly slows the movement of weevils under laboratory conditions and frequency of detection may affect estimates of actual distance moved. Despite this, the rate at which <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> dispersed through the strawberry crop was comparable to the speed of movement recorded previously by others when weevils were released into an urban environment. Use of RFID tags also resulted in detection rates far higher than those reported in studies by others using traditional mark-release-recapture techniques. Use of RFID tags in the present study indicates that adult <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> have the potential to disperse spores of a suitable entomopathogenic fungus from artificial refuges throughout the crop environment. Use of this technique could also be applied to investigate the effect of other plant protection products as well as the impact of different cropping systems on <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> movement and survival...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{constraints}} of the experiments conducted <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> were found to exhibit a strategy of volume of indiscriminate oviposition rather than a strategy of definitive site selection characteristic of a true oviposition behaviour. A series of experiments was conducted to determine oviposition and host plant interactions under conditions of choice and absence of choice of host plant. It was found that oviposition was greatest tor Yew, followed by polyanthus, fushcia, strawberry and (despite the name) was found to be least on vine plants. Variation was attributed to a combination mainly of ground cover and partially quality of host. Oviposition was found to be much lower under conditions of absence of choice. Variation was attributed to the observation that not all <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> oviposit all the time and that feeding and oviposition upon a plant arc independent. A further experiment conducted using strawberry plants with variable lcafN reinforced the interpretation that feeding and oviposition are independent functions. Under conditions of choice or host plant it was found that feeding occurred upon plants that were not capable o...|$|E

Bioassays {{on production}} and infectivity to larvae and pupae were compared for two steinernematids and two heterorhabditis such as Steinernema carpocapsae, S. feltiae, Heterorhabditis indica and H. bacteriophora. Nematodes production of all species {{was determined by}} the number infective juveniles (IJs) established in <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae and pupae O. sulcatus using sand and filter paper bioassay. S. feltiae produced the maximum number in larvae and pupae at 20 °C as compared to other nematodes but production of H. indica, was better at 25 °C in larvae and pupae followed by H. bacteriophora, S. carpocapsae and Infectivity test of larvae and pupae was also done in sand media. Infective juveniles recovered from larvae and pupae when infected with S. feltiae produced maximum infective juveniles at 20 °C temperatures than all other isolates. H. bacteriophora produced higher number of IJs in larvae and pupae than all other nematode isolates at 25 °C.

40|$|Interactions between insect herbivores {{and host}} plants are fundamental, shaping both {{ecosystem}} functions and community structure. One aspect of insect-plant interactions {{that has received}} considerable attention recently is the indirect linkages between aboveground and belowground insect herbivores via a shared host plant. To date, {{the relationship between a}} maternal insect aboveground and her soil dwelling offspring has been largely overlooked. This study aimed to examine the interactions between the adult insect and soil dwelling larvae of the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) with reference to the preference– performance hypothesis, using an agronomically important host plant, red raspberry (Rubus ideaus). A meta–analysis of aboveground–belowground insect herbivore interactions highlighted that belowground Coleopteran herbivores positively impacted aboveground Homoptera and that general predictions from conceptual models in the literature regarding the direction of interactions between insects were correct, but not statistically significant. In addition it was found that aboveground insect herbivores negatively influenced the survival of belowground herbivores. The preference–performance hypothesis was not supported in the findings for the <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> on raspberry. Instead a conflict between larval development and adult egg laying behaviour was observed, with a significant reduction in larval mass recorded when maternal adults fed on the same host plant. Larval mass was decreased by 19...|$|E

40|$|Root weevils in {{the genus}} Otiorhynchus are cited {{as one of}} the most {{important}} pests in the major nursery and small fruit production areas throughout the United States, western Canada, and northern Europe. A major problem in combating weevil attack is monitoring and timing of control measures. Because of the night-activity of the adult weevils growers do not observe the emerging weevils in a timely manner and oviposition often starts before effective control measures are taken. Several <b>vine</b> <b>weevil</b> electroantennogram-active plant volatiles were identiÞed from a preferred host plant, Euonymus fortunei. Main compounds evoking antennal responses on the weevilsÕ antennae were (Z) - 2 -pentenol, (E) - 2 -hexenol, (Z) - 3 -hexenol, methyl benzoate, linalool, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 - nonatriene, methyl eugenol, and (E, E) -_-farnesene.
