40|$|Traditional {{car sharing}} systems are <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> shared <b>vehicle</b> systems and require advance reservations. The {{advances}} of GPS, communication techniques and vehicle automation {{allow us to}} improve car-sharing systems and to provide users with greater flexibility. As it concerns reservation, new car sharing systems offer users open-ended reservation and/or instant access. As it concerns the trip topology, new car sharing systems are multiple station shared <b>vehicle</b> systems (MSSVS). <b>Round</b> <b>trips</b> still occur {{in this type of}} system; however there are a large number of one-way trips made between the multiple stations. Operating an MSSVS is much more difficult than operating a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> shared <b>vehicle</b> system. The problem is that the system can quickly become imbalanced with respect to the number of vehicles at the multiple stations. A review of user-based and operator-based relocation strategies is provided in the paper, as well as some details about some new possible car sharing systems, where vehicles are fully automated and can be accessed from any point within the intervention area...|$|R
50|$|There was {{considerable}} local {{enthusiasm for the}} scheme and the provisional Newbury and Lambourn Tramway Company was formed in late 1873. A 3 ft gauge single track would be laid {{at the side of}} the main road, with several short branches within Newbury. It was to be horse-drawn, the <b>vehicle</b> making two <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> daily at first. The cost was estimated at £30,000 and an authorising Act was obtained on 7 August 1875; one year was allowed for construction. A contract for construction was let and a first rail was ceremonially fixed; the subscribers did not come forward and only shares to the value of £4,000 were taken up. The company could not proceed and at the expiry of the year allowed, it was wound up.|$|R
3000|$|The {{solution}} {{is shown in}} Table (1) for this problem. As it is shown, the <b>vehicle</b> makes three <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> among them two to hospital 1 and one to hospital 2. Three batches k_ 1 = 1, [...] k_ 2 = 2 and k_ 3 = 2 are denoted. The products arrive at the customers in the batch to which they belong to in the completion time cited in Table (1). The total delivery cost equals η _ 1 × 2 +η _ 2 × 1 = 2750 Euro and the total storage cost at the hospitals equals β _ 1 × [(d_ 1 -C_ 1)+(d_ 3 -C_ 3)+(d_ 5 -C_ 5)]+β _ 2 × [(d_ 2 -C_ 2)+(d_ 4 -C_ 4)]= 30 × [20 + 0 + 0]+ 20 × [10 + 10]= 1000 Euro. The amount of the objective function is 3750 Euro.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{research}} is aimed at investigating the current situation relating to transportation of asphalt and the inter-action between the paving crew and the asphalt producing plant, with the purpose of deducting practical steps that will improve the delivery and production process as a whole. A study is undertaken in the analysis of the delivery and round-trip cycle times of the cartage contractors transporting the asphalt from the fixed plant to the Old Barn Project. A daily summary is compiled for every day that asphalt is delivered to the project, and this data is sorted and analyzed to deduct trends and typical patterns for a specific type of work. The factors by which the performance is judged will be a relation between the type of work carried out as well as the production figure achieved for the specific day. Furthermore a basic model is composed that {{could be used as a}} <b>vehicle</b> and <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> calculator to guide the supplier as to the resources that are required on future projects. A list of practical steps is also drawn up, in the form of recommendations to conclude some of the findings of the project. The starting point {{of this research is}} to gain insight into the processes involved and to make recommendations on a very practical level. The role of good communication between the asphalt plant and the paving crew was also found to be of critical importance, as well as the establishment of an open honest relationship between the key role players.

40|$|We {{define a}} new class of “rapid <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> ” interplanetary {{missions}} for which the principal characteristic is a total mission duration that is 1 or more years shorter than the traditional <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> using Hohmann transfers. <b>Round</b> <b>trip</b> missions using Hohmann transfers to near-Earth asteroids or other nearby interplanetary objects may require many years. (For example, 8 years for a <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> to a Near-Earth Asteroid at 1. 1 AU.) Consequently, rapid <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> are the only practical means for human space travel to these objects. The Hohmann <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> mission to Mars typically requires about 2. 7 years. Rapid <b>round</b> <b>trips</b> to Mars can be as short as 5 months in total mission duration, but these trips require delta V’s 5 times or more greater than for Hohmann <b>round</b> <b>trips.</b> This paper explores rapid <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> missions that are intermediate in terms of both total mission duration and total delta V required. These are significantly faster and take a greater delta V than Hohmann <b>round</b> <b>trips,</b> but are not as fast and use less delta V than the very rapid missions. For example, an intermediate <b>round</b> <b>trip</b> mission to Mars can have a total duration of 14 to 15 months, stay on the surface of Mars of 2 to 3 months, and a total applied delta V of around 14 km/sec if direct entry is used...|$|R
