5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes <b>values</b> <b>from</b> the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E

25|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolyte {{are the most}} inexpensive type and also those with widest range of sizes, capacitance and voltage values. They are made with capacitance <b>values</b> <b>from</b> 0.1µF up to 2,700,000µF (2.7F), and rated voltages <b>values</b> <b>from</b> 4V up to 630V. The liquid electrolyte provides oxygen for re-forming or self-healing of the dielectric oxide layer. However, it can evaporate through a temperature-dependent drying-out process, which causes electrical parameters to drift, limiting the service life time of the capacitors.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACS: ICT {{covers a}} broad range of fields in {{business}} and therefore makes ICT value difficult to simply define. The main factors that influence the use of ICT are therefore important to look at, as they give a good understanding of the how much influence the organisation has, on achieving value in its given context. The transformational model of ICT use was analysed to establish how SMEs in South Africa achieve business <b>value</b> <b>from</b> ICT and what management practices are most effective. Implications of the research are that management practices are an important factor that influences the <b>value</b> <b>from</b> ICT, and that the more management practices organisations implement, the greater the business <b>value</b> <b>from</b> ICT. Further findings of this study deduced that organisations that are more ICT aware, gain greater business <b>value</b> <b>from</b> ICT, with <b>value</b> achievement <b>from</b> ICT largely within the organisation’s control.
