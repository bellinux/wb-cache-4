40|$|In case of food {{packaging}} applications, high oxygen and water <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers</b> are the prerequisite conditions for preserving {{the quality of}} the products throughout their whole lifecycle. Currently available polymers and/or biopolymer films are mostly used in combination with barrier materials derived from oil based plastics or aluminium to enhance their low barrier properties. In order to replace these non-renewable materials, current research efforts are focused on the development of sustainable coatings, while maintaining the functional properties of the resulting packaging materials. This article provides an introduction to {{food packaging}} requirements, highlights prior art on the use of whey-based coatings for their barriers properties, and describes the key properties of an innovative packaging multilayer material that includes a whey-based layer. The developed whey protein formulations had excellent barrier properties almost comparable to the ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers (EVOH) barrier layer conventionally used in food packaging composites, with an oxygen barrier (OTR) of < 2 [cm 3 (STP) /(m 2 d bar) ] when normalized to a thickness of 100 Î¼m.

The effects of coating formulation (solvent, corn-zein, plasticizer concentration and plasticizer type) on final properties of films were observed. Corn-zein {{is the most important}} protein of corn and has good film forming property. Composites structures of PP films coated with corn-zein were obtained through a simple solvent casting method. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerol (GLY) were used as plasticizer to increase film flexibility. Statistical analysis based on full factorial design was performed to observe coating formulation effects. The high water <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers</b> were obtained for films coated with coating formulation consisting of higher amounts of corn-zein plasticized by GLY. The lower glass transition temperatures (T g) of films were obtained by plasticization of films and T g decreased by increasing plasticizer content. The statistical analysis defined the key parameters of coating formulation that had major effects on the final properties of coated PP films as corn-zein, plasticizer concentration and plasticizer type. In conclusion, corn-zein coatings could have potential as an alternative to conventional synthetic polymers used in composite multilayer structures for food packaging applications...|$|R

In this study, commercially available isotactic polypropylene (PP) and nylon- 6 (PA 6) blends and laminates were prepared, to develop a material with optimal water <b>vapour</b> and oxygen <b>barrier</b> properties. The effect of compatibilizers on phase dispersion has been investigated using three commercial Polybond's, PB 3002, PB 1001, and PB 3009. Three compatibilizers prepared in-house were also used as, maleic anhydride(MA) grafted on PP, MA and butyl methacrylate(BMA) co-polymer grafted on PP, and BMA grafted on low density polyethylene. The effect of two silanes(methacrylate functional and vinyl functional) on PP were also investigated and also the plasticization of PA 6 with formic acid. The results were compared with a commercial blend of PP and PA 6, Orgalloy R- 6000. Light microscopy with phase and fluorescence contrast {{has been used for}} morphological evaluation. Chemical changes were studied by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and rheology by dynamic and steady state measurements. Barrier properties were determined gravimetrically for water vapour and organic solvents, and for oxygen by an Oxtran apparatus. The results have shown that phase dispersion can be more easily explained by molecular interactions than by the rheological parameters. The blend slip factor has been improved however by compatibilizers and consequently the phase dispersion, which had little effect on the barrier properties of the blends and indeed the laminates were more effective water <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers.</b> The availability of particular functional groups, which can interact with the permeant is the most important parameter, which can be affected by processing and blending conditions. The addition of hydrophobic functional groups into polypropylene was therefore the most effective method for enhancing the barrier properties of polypropylene.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of water <b>vapour</b> permeation <b>barriers</b> on polymer films remains {{a major challenge}} for the introduction of various types of organic electronic devices. Multilayer coatings consisting of in organic and organic layers have been proven to meet the extraordinary high requirements of the anticipated applications. However, {{the high price of}} these layer systems is still preventing a widespread commercial success. Therefore reducing the cost of such layers by developing effective deposition technologies remains a challenge for many research groups. The paper features a deposition technology for silicon nitride layers on polymer films. The focus of the experiments was placed on this material because it has already proven to be a suitable candidate for high performance water <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers.</b> The contribution will present results that had been achieved in a roll-to roll coating machine on 600 mm wide film. The described technology can be scaled up to industrially relevant sizes and hence has the potential for a substantial decrease of the deposition cost. The technology was developed on a module consisting of two rotatable sputter magnetrons. Silicon targets were sputtered in a gas atmosphere consisting of argon and nitrogen. It is well known that the achievable deposition rate in such processes strongly depends on a precise control of the sputter gas composition. Apart from this the authors could demonstrate that incorporation of residual reactive species into the forming layers depends on the process regulation as well. This parameter is eventually determining the optical dispersion relation as well as the achieved permeation properties. The catalytic activation of the nitrogen molecules on the partially metallic target surface was identified as a possible explanation of this behaviour. The dual magnetron system was run with a bipolar pulsed power of a frequency of 50 kHz and at a power level of 20 kW. Under these conditions the dynamic deposition rate amounted to 62 nm*m/min. Silicon nitride is distinguished {{by the fact that the}} optimum permeation barrier values can be achieved for a layer thickness below 100 nm. The lowest value of 6 x 10 - 3 g/m 2 day (38 Â°C, 90 % RH) could be demonstrated at for a single layer with a thickness of 75 nm on an OPTFINE PQA 1 M substrate film. The paper will provide a comprehensive picture about both the details of the reactive sputtering process and the layer properties on different substrates...|$|R
50|$|Protection against {{interstitial}} condensation {{is necessary}} in heated or cooled buildings depending on the climate where they are located and other factors. This is done primarily by means of preventing exfiltration (air leakage into the assemblies); controlling indoor moisture at its sources through ventilation, heating, insulation, dehumidification; and using an impervious <b>vapour</b> <b>barrier</b> (vapour check) on the warm side of the insulation, i.e., inside the assembly on a heated building and outside on a cooled building. Buildings that are both heated and cooled should not have vapour barriers {{on both sides of}} the assemblies. Vapour barriers are problematic because they difficult to install perfectly and greatly reduce the ability of a cavity to dry out when it does get wet. Vapour barriers are used in conjunction with a housewrap, a vapour permeable but water resistant membrane, so that one side of the cavity is permeable to allow drying.

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} a novel technology that utilizes specialized water dissolvable thin films for valving in centrifugal microfluidic systems. In previous work (William Meathrel and Cathy Moritz, IVD Technologies, 2007), dissolvable films (DFs) have been assembled in laminar flow devices to form efficient sacrificial valves where DFs simply open by direct contact with liquid. Here, we build on the original DF valving scheme to leverage sophisticated, merely rotationally actuated <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers</b> and flow control for enabling comprehensive assay integration with low-complexity instrumentation on 2 Ì 2 lab-on-a-disc 2 Ì 2 platforms. The advanced sacrificial valving function is achieved by creating an inverted gas-liquid stack upstream of the DF during priming of the system. At low rotational speeds, a pocket of trapped air prevents a surface-tension stabilized liquid plug from wetting the DF membrane. However, high-speed rotation disrupts the metastable gas/liquid interface to wet the DF and thus opens the valve. By judicious choice of the radial position and geometry of the valve, the burst frequency can be tuned {{over a wide range}} of rotational speeds nearly 10 times greater than those attained by common capillary burst valves based on hydrophobic constrictions. The broad range of reproducible burst frequencies of the DF valves bears the potential for full integration and automation of comprehensive, multi-step biochemical assay protocols. In this report we demonstrate DF valving, discuss the biocompatibility of using the films, and show a potential sequential valving system including the on-demand release of on-board stored liquid reagents, fast centrifugal sedimentation and vigorous mixing; thus providing a viable basis for use in lab-on-a-disc platforms for point-of-care diagnostics and other life science applications...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{materials}} {{are used as}} water <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers</b> or encapsulation materials for photovoltaic modules. Their permeation properties {{determine the amount of}} water in the polymers and inside the modules. The water can cause corrosion and/or deterioration of functional properties of the modules. The temperature of solar modules and the ambient water vapour concentration vary over time according to the solar radiation and the ambient climate. Temperature-dependent permeation and diffusion properties are needed for modelling the water concentration over time in order to predict the long-term behaviour and the service life of such devices. The paper describes the measurement of the temperature-dependent permeation coefficient for polymer films, different laminates of polymer films and initial results of modelling the processes by integrating time series of conditions experienced during outdoor exposure. We used an experimental set-up based on a mass spectrometer to measure the water-vapour permeation. The sample film is mounted on ultra-high-vacuum flanges of up to 300 mm diameter by means of a butyl sealant and UHV-metal sealant. It is exposed to a constant temperature selected between 20 deg C and 90 deg C and a rapid increase of the humidity until a set partial pressure is reached. The increase of the humidity content in the volume behind the sample film, which is initially filled with argon under atmospheric pressure, is monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer and is used for evaluation of diffusion and permeation coefficients. The results of a parameter study are presented which describes the distribution of the water concentration in the module dependant on specific material parameters. The numerical simulation uses time series of meteorological data monitored in different regions as input. The experimentally determined parameters and the mathematical modelling can be combined to estimate the durability of PV modules under the climatic conditions of interest...|$|R

40|$|Materials {{that are}} {{renewable}} and biodegradable are demanded due to environmental aspects. Biopolymeric materials, such as materials from prolamins, fulfil {{both of these}} requirements. Prolamins are cereal storage proteins. Examples of such are zein, gluten, kafirin and avenin from maize, wheat, sorghum and oats, respectively. Prolamin materials are generally rather brittle and need therefore to be plasticized {{in order to become}} more flexible. Physical properties, such as thermomechanical, tensile and barrier properties, of kafirin, zein and avenin films, with different levels of plasticizer, were investigated. Zein and kafirin were plasticized by a mixture of glycerol, lactic acid and polyethylene glycol, whereas avenin was plasticized by sole glycerol. Avenin was weaker than the other two, but more extensible at low plasticizer contents. Zein was the most extensible of the high plasticizer content films. Kafirin and zein exhibited approximately the same barrier properties, whereas avenin was more permeable. Compared to synthetic polymers, these prolamin materials are not as water resistant and extensible as polyethylene, but can be made stronger and more resistant to oxygen. Other synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol are better oxygen barriers, but worse water <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers</b> than these prolamin materials. The plasticization of prolamin materials is an important issue. By studying the plasticization mechanism we can better understand and control the properties of these materials. Therefore the plasticization effect of water, glycerol and 2 -mercaptoethanol in zein films was investigated by a combination of thermomechanical and spectroscopy (infrared and dielectric) studies. It was found that the mechanisms of water and glycerol do not differ significantly from each other by the hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein. Neither one has any greater effect on the protein conformation. 2 -mercaptoethanol was likely evaporated already during film casting, as all samples containing this substance displayed the same glass transition temperature. However, {{a small portion of the}} 2 -mercaptoethanol seems to have broken the disulphide bonds in the protein before evaporation, which is a totally different plasticizing mechanism compared to the ones of water and glycerol...|$|R

40|$|In this project, Stora Ensoâs newly {{developed}} building {{system has been}} further developed to allow building to the Swedish passive house standard for the Swedish climate. The building system {{is based on a}} building framework of CLT (Cross laminated timber) boards. The concept has been tested on a small test building. The experience gained from this test building has also been used for planning a larger building (two storeys with the option of a third storey) with passive house standard with this building system. The main conclusions from the project are: ï· It is possible to build airtight buildings with this technique without using traditional <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers.</b> Initial measurements show that this can be done without reaching critical humidity levels in the walls and roof, at least where wood fibre insulation is used, as this has a greater capacity for storing and evening out the moisture than mineral wool. However, the test building has so far not been exposed to internal generation of moisture (added moisture from showers, food preparation etc.). This needs to be investigated and this will be done during the winter 2013 - 14. ï· A new fixing method for doors and windows has been tested without traditional fibre filling between them and the CLT panel. The door or window is pressed directly on to the CLT panel instead, with an expandable sealing strip between them. This has been proved to be successful. ï· The air tightness between the CLT panels is achieved with expandable sealing strips between the panels. The position of the sealing strips is important, both for the air tightness itself and to allow rational assembly. ï· Recurrent air tightness measurements show that the air tightness decreased somewhat during the first six months, but not {{to such an extent that}} the passive house criteria were not fulfilled. The reason for the decreased air tightness is not clear, but can be due to small movements in the CLT construction and also to the sealing strips being affected by changing outdoor temperatures. ï· Long term measurements (at least two years) have to be carried out before more reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the long term effect of the construction on air tightness and humidity in the walls. ï· An economic analysis comparing using a concrete frame or the studied CLT frame for a three storey building shows that it is probably more expensive to build with CLT. For buildings higher than three floors, the CLT frame has economic advantages, mainly because of the shorter building time compared to using concrete for the frame. In this analysis, no considerations have been taken to differences in the influence on the environment or the global climate between the two construction methods...|$|R

On top of that, the two fail to install the needed extra studs, and affix their wall panelling so poorly that a small tug from Hillary brings it all falling down, cementing the Green Team as the worst in this challenge. The Purple Team do an okay job of attaching their wall panelling and <b>vapour</b> <b>barrier,</b> but resort to haphazardly stuffing chunks of insulation in the wall instead of cutting it to size, which the experts tell them is a waste of materials and will not insulate effectively.

The Pink Team, therefore, are named the winners, as while their job wasnât perfect by any means (in particular, they left large, obvious joins between their sheets of wall panelling), it was still the best of the five teams.|$|E
50|$|For {{water to}} enter a wall first the water must get onto {{the wall and the}} wall must have openings.

This helps direct water away from the main exterior wall which in many climates is insulated. Keeping the insulation dry helps prevent problems such as mold formation and water leakage.

40|$|Ontario Regulation 153 / 04 {{outlines}} the process wherein a property impacted by soil and/ or ground water contaminants is evaluated for risks to human and ecological health, {{and may be}} redeveloped for more sensitive land uses. Under the Regulation, once a property has been sufficiently characterized, a Record of Site Condition (RSC) may be filed, to document {{the condition of the}} property. Owners of contaminated lands may choose to remediate the property, to meet the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MOECC) generic soil and ground water Standards, or develop new site-specific Standards via the Risk Assessment (RA) process. Many of the soil and ground water contaminants of concern (COC) frequently identified during the environmental site assessment process are volatile. If an RA is undertaken to address volatile COC, it must take into consideration the potential for vapour intrusion. The fundamental underlying principle for vapour transport is based on observations that small but persistent pressure differences established between the exterior and interior of buildings may cause infiltration of soil air through the substructure of buildings. When this occurs, the COC have the potential to cause an adverse effect on the health of building occupants, via the inhalation pathway. If the conclusions of the RA are that an adverse effect is likely, vapour mitigation will be proposed as a risk management measure (RMM) and mandated by the MOECC by describing them on a Certificate of Property Use (CPU) which is registered on the title of the land, thus obligating all current and/ or future property owners to comply. In practice, vapour mitigation options are limited, particularly for sites with existing buildings and where redevelopment is not planned. In some cases, buildings are not fitted with HVAC systems suited to increased air exchange rates or maintenance of a constant positive pressure, which would serve to âpush backâ against upward vapour movement. Nor can an existing building be fitted with <b>vapour</b> <b>barriers,</b> or easily equipped with an extensive sub-grade vapour venting system. In many cases, a sub-slab depressurization (SSD) system, retrofitted to the building, is the best option. Such a system would consist of one of more vapour extraction points, connected to a blower with the capacity to generate a slight negative pressure within the porous sub-grade media. However, the success of such a system depends to a large extent upon the characteristics of the sub-grade fill material, in addition to the building configuration and features such as the presence of footings and foundation thickness and quality. As such, there are many risks associated with uncertainties when the building sub-slab environment is not fully understood and each project is unique, where existing buildings are concerned.

Based on the descriptions on ecological function of modern agriculture, a number of ecological and environmental problems caused by large-scale facility agriculture were analyzed in this paper. Agricultural facilities tent membrane change surface coverage types of facilities agriculture area, will cause changes in the rate of surface occurs and break the original surface energy balance. Facilities agriculture covered by insulation in the night will prevent the surface heat from diffusing and reduce the absorption of long-wave radiation. The covered tent membrane <b>barriered</b> <b>vapour</b> from exchanging and reduce total plant evapotranspiration. The change of environments inside of the agricultural facilities will influence the balance of the soil respiration. The unreasonable cultivation practices will destroy regional soil quality. These environmental problems will weaken the urban ecological conservation in modern agriculture. Accordingly, we put forward corresponding countermeasures and Suggestions...|$|R
