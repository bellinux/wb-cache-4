25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show {{an average of about}} 5,600 {{vehicles}} per day between the route's western terminus and Old Federal Road in Forsyth County, with the exception of an average <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> of 9,960 on a short stretch of the route around Yellow Creek Road, which is a south-to-north feeder route to the Big Canoe residential development in Pickens County. SR369's <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> continues to increase as it travels to the east, going from 6,470 west of Matt to just over 11,000 east of Matt to SR9. The average vehicle count then fluctuates from 16,340 between SR9 and SR400 to just 7,400 east of SR400 to SR306, peaks at 21,430 east of SR306 to the Hall County line, and then holds at around 12,000 as the route loops around Lake Lanier. Once SR369 reaches the Gainesville area, the vehicle loads increases greatly to around 27,000 between SR53 and SR13, with a peak of 36,750 in downtown Gainesville.|$|E
25|$|Yellowknife did {{not have}} an all-season road access to the rest of Canada's highway network until the {{completion}} of Deh Cho Bridge in 2012. Prior to that, traffic relied on ferry service in summer and ice road in winter to cross the Mackenzie River. This became a problem during spring and fall time when the ice was not thick enough to handle <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> but the ferry could not pass through the ice, which would require all goods from fuel to groceries to be airlifted during the transition period.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show a variety of daily averages across SR20. The traffic load on the highway starts at its lowest daily average load as the route starts into Floyd County, where numbers hover around 5,400 {{vehicles}} per day. These averages increase rapidly as the highway approaches Rome, going from around 12,000 vehicles to a peak of 38,000 vehicles in downtown Rome. As SR20 becomes concurrent with US27/SR1, the numbers decrease {{to an average of}} 32,000, and then decrease more rapidly to around 15,000 as SR20 heads east out of Rome. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> stays in that area all the way through Floyd County and into Bartow County, as the highway is the main west-to-east thoroughfare between Rome and Cartersville. In Cartersville, where the highway is concurrent with US41, the vehicle count reaches a zenith of just over 41,000, but then drops off sharply as the highway heads into rural Cherokee County, dipping just below 10,000 before increasing again to near 24,000 vehicles per day as it approaches I-575/SR5. On the portion of the highway that is concurrent with I-575/SR5, the highway sees its maximum <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> of just over 54,000 vehicles, again dropping rapidly east of I-575/SR5, going from around 24,000 down to 11,000, and further down to around 10,000 as the Forsyth County line is reached.|$|E

25|$|Internationalized ECE Regulation 48, {{in force}} {{in most of}} the world outside North America, {{currently}} specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> conditions; if the vehicle isn't equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this anti-glare measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens – xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp self-leveling systems that sense the vehicle's degree of squat due to cargo load and road inclination, and automatically adjust the headlamps' vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show a variety of daily averages across SR53. In Floyd County, average traffic loads west of Rome hover around 4,000 {{vehicles}} per day, with a maximum of 5,000 in Cave Spring. Those numbers increase rapidly as the route approaches Rome, increasing {{to an average of}} about 17,000, with a peak of 30,000 in downtown Rome, where SR53 is concurrent with US27, SR1, and SR20. The average loads dip back down to around 14,000 vehicles north of Rome, and hit a low of around 9,000 vehicles as the route crosses into Gordon County. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> fluctuates back up into a range from 12,000 to 23,000 in and around Calhoun and approaching I-75, and drops rapidly again east of I-75, reaching lows of just above 4,000 average vehicles. Briefly increasing again to 8,000 in Fairmount, the route carries around 4,000 vehicles per day between Fairmount and SR5/SR515.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show some variety in the average daily traffic load numbers as the route travels north. The traffic load averages start at their high point on the route, {{with an average of}} 16,530 {{vehicles}} using the short stretch between SR140 and the start of the Birmingham Highway portion. Those numbers then steadily decrease as SR372 heads north, going from 9,390 initially down to just over 3,000 as Cherokee County approaches. The average load stays between 3,000 and 3,500 south of SR20, climbs to 5,500 north of SR20, and goes up once more to around 6,200 north of SR369. The area south of, and into, Ball Ground sees an average <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> of between 7,000 and 7,500, cresting once more at 8,680 heading north out of downtown towards I-575/SR5/SR515. However, the short stretch that feeds directly into the aforementioned state route only carries 3,900 vehicles per day, illustrating that the feeder route into SR5 south of Ball Ground sees heavier traffic than this northern spur.|$|E

25|$|In {{and around}} Jasper, where SR53 is {{concurrent}} with SR5/SR515, the route carries between 14,000 and 24,000 vehicles, before rapidly decreasing again {{to an average}} load of around 5,000 while concurrent with SR108. SR53 then sees the lowest average <b>vehicle</b> <b>load</b> on its way across north Georgia between Pickens County and Dawson County, where the averages drop to around 2,500 vehicles per day. Traffic picks up again west of Dawsonville, and reaches numbers of around 13,000 where the route feeds Dawson County and Forsyth County traffic to SR400. Once the route crosses into Hall County and approaches Gainesville, numbers increase yet again to around 23,000 vehicles per day north and into Gainesville, and reach nearly 28,000 vehicles as the route feeds I-985. The averages drop rapidly south of I-985 to around 7,000 as the route approaches Jackson County, and the average only increases again to around 10,000 as SR53 feeds I-85 and then approaches Winder in Barrow County. South and east of Winder, averages drop down to between 3,500 and 5,000 vehicles per day, but then increase one last time to just under 16,000 in Watkinsville, as the route reaches its eastern terminus.|$|E

2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of <b>vehicle</b> <b>load,</b> without driver intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E

40|$|The cost of {{transporting}} a set of shipments from an origin to many destinations {{depends on}} the number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>loads</b> required and the average route length per load. This paper explores a trade-off between the dual objectives of minimizing these two factors. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>loads</b> and route length per load are evaluated for a heuristic whereby more than one vehicle is filled simultaneously for the same destination. Filling more than one vehicle {{at the same time in}} general allows more shipments to be fit onto each vehicle, but increases route length per load. The best balance between loading efficiency and route length per load depends on the square-root of the size of the region over which shipments are delivered and the average distance from the origin to the destinations. To minimize total route length, the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>loaded</b> simultaneously should increase as the ratio between these two values decreases. ...|$|R
