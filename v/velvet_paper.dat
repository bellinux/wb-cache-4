60|$|Old lady's dress seventy or {{eighty years}} ago. Brown brocade gown, {{with a nice}} lawn {{handkerchief}} and apron,--short sleeves, with a little ruffle, just below the elbow,--black mittens,--a lawn cap, with rich lace border,--a black velvet hood {{on the back of}} the head, tied with black ribbon under the chin. She sat in an old-fashioned easy-chair, in a small, low parlor,--the wainscot painted entirely black, and the walls hung with a dark <b>velvet</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Unbridled luxury met {{his eyes}} in {{whatever}} direction he turned. There was a double staircase of marble; a court paved with mosaic-work of brilliant little stones; splendid rooms, the walls of which were covered with <b>velvet</b> <b>paper</b> of rich pattern and colour. Gilding glittered everywhere--on cornices, furniture, and ceilings, from which the eyes turned with double zest to the soft light of marble sculpture judiciously disposed on staircase and in chambers. There were soft sofas that appeared to embrace you as you sank into them; pictures that charmed the senses; here a bath of snow-white marble, there gushing fountains and jets of limpid water that appeared to play hide-and-seek among green leaves and lovely flowers, and disappeared mysteriously,--in short, everything tasteful and beautiful that man could desire. Of course Lancey did not take all this in at once. Neither did he realise {{the fact that the}} numerous soft-moving and picturesque attendants, black and white, whom he saw, were a mere portion of an army of servants, numbering upwards of a thousand souls, whom this Pasha retained. These did not include the members of his harem. He had upwards of a hundred cooks and two hundred grooms and coachmen. This household, it is said, consumed, among other things, nearly 7000 pounds of vegetables a day, and in winter there were 900 fires kindled throughout the establishment. [See note 1.] ...|$|E
60|$|The Lapham drawing-room in Nankeen Square {{was in the}} parti-coloured paint {{which the}} Colonel had hoped to repeat in his new house: the trim of {{the doors and windows}} was in light green and the panels in salmon; the walls were a plain tint of French grey paper, divided by gilt {{mouldings}} into broad panels with a wide stripe of red <b>velvet</b> <b>paper</b> running up the corners; the chandelier was of massive imitation bronze; the mirror over the mantel rested on a fringed mantel-cover of green reps, and heavy curtains of that stuff hung from gilt lambrequin frames at the window; the carpet was of a small pattern in crude green, which, at the time Mrs. Lapham bought it, covered half the new floors in Boston. In the panelled spaces on the walls were some stone-coloured landscapes, representing the mountains and canyons of the West, which the Colonel and his wife had visited on one of the early official railroad excursions. In front of the long windows looking into the Square were statues, kneeling figures which turned their backs upon the company within-doors, and represented allegories of Faith and Prayer to people without. A white marble group of several figures, expressing an Italian conception of Lincoln Freeing the Slaves,--a Latin negro and his wife,--with our Eagle flapping his wings in approval, at Lincoln's feet, occupied one corner, and balanced the what-not of an earlier period in another. These phantasms added their chill to that imparted by the tone of the walls, the landscapes, and the carpets, and contributed to the violence of the contrast when the chandelier was lighted up full glare, and the heat of the whole furnace welled up from the registers into the quivering atmosphere on one of the rare occasions when the Laphams invited company.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{merchant}} Barrell imported goods from overseas. For instance, the Hannah, commanded by William Haydon, sailed in May 1780, probably from Amsterdam, loaded with cargo for Barrell in Boston: [...] "German steel, ... china ware, earthen pots, house brushes, spices, linens, <b>velvets,</b> writing <b>paper,</b> children's toys (among the rest a furnished kitchen valued at over six florins), wafers, flat-irons, tea and tea-kettles and window-glass." [...] Barrell's notable wealth also derived from his activities as [...] "contractor to the French fleet." ...|$|R
25|$|Despite this redecoration, the East Room was {{nonetheless}} somewhat shabby by 1861. On April 18, 1861, about 60 militiamen from Kansas took up temporary {{residence in the}} East Room pending construction of barracks {{for them in the}} city. They did serious damage to the carpet, and sometimes shot bullets into the walls. Mary Todd Lincoln refurbished the room with damask drapes, lace curtains, wallpaper, and a new $2,500 carpet later that year. The wallpaper was heavy patterned <b>velvet</b> cloth <b>paper</b> from Paris in crimson, garnet, and gold, and supplied by William H. Carryl & Brother of New York. The floor covering was an Axminster carpet woven in Glasgow, Scotland. The largest loom in the world was needed to weave the carpet, which covered the entire floor. The drapes were crimson with heavy gold fringe and numerous gold tassels, while the lace curtains behind them were imported from Switzerland.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT romantec: artistic {{expression}} through cell phone photography by Elizabeth Newman Kuiper Master of Fine Arts in Art California State University, Chico Spring 2011 romantec: {{artistic expression}} through cell phone photography is a one-person exhibition of large scale unframed photographs {{displayed in the}} University Art Gallery, Taylor Hall, at California State University, Chico. All of these photographs are taken with a cell phone camera. They are printed by the artist on an Epson 9900 digital printer using archival Epson Ultrachrome HDR ink on Breathing Color's Elegance <b>Velvet</b> Matte <b>paper.</b> Each print is archivally laminated using Breathing Color's Timeless Matte varnish. The prints in romantec are the record of adventures experienced and captured with my camera at dusk and {{in the dark of}} the evening. While looking through the lens of a new technology, old world ideas of beauty are rediscovered, revealing ideas similar to those expressed by Romantic, Impressionist, and Post-Impressionist artists who delved into mysteries of the universe and spiritual realms with attention to science, beauty, and perception. This paper discusses the artistic motive and process behind the works, relevant technological aspects, as well as various historical contexts, which aid in the understanding of these works.

5000|$|RÃ©veillon apprenticed as a tradesman, {{haberdasher}} and stationer. In 1753 {{he began}} to import and hang flock wallpapers from England. At that time, wallpaper was becoming popular among the bourgeoisie as a creative and economical way to decorate interior spaces. During the Seven Years' War Reveillon started to produce wallpaper himself, marrying well and using his wife's dowry to produce <b>velvet</b> <b>paper,</b> pasted up into rolls and using vibrant colours, developed by Jean-Baptiste Pillement.|$|E
50|$|Antoine Lavoisier is seated, {{wearing a}} black vest, culottes, {{stockings}} and buckled shoes, a white shirt with a lace jabot and a powdered wig. His face turns towards his wife and he rests his left arm on the table, whilst writing {{with his right hand}} using a feather pen. The table is covered with scarlet <b>velvet,</b> many <b>papers,</b> a casket, an inkwell with two more feather pens, a barometer, a gasometer, a water still and a glass bell jar. A large round-bottom flask and a tap are on the floor to the right, by the table. To the table's extreme left is a chair with a large document-case and black cloth on it. The document-case, presumed to correspond to Madame's interest in the art of drawing, is an emphasis of the depiction of a left to right symmetry in the portrait of M. Lavoisier and objects of science visibly displayed on the right, while Madame with her document case of artistic drawings prominently displayed {{on the left side of}} the portrait. Significant also is the depiction by David of the wife being portrayed in a posture physically above the husband, somewhat atypically by late 18th century conventional standards of depicting a married couple in portraiture.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Our method can render various cloth fabrics with microcylinder {{appearance}} model under environment lighting at interactive frame rates. The insets {{show the}} environment maps. From left to right, cloth fabrics are linen plain, polyester satin charmuse, silk crepe de chine, <b>velvet.</b> This <b>paper</b> proposes an interactive rendering method of cloth fabrics under environment lighting. The outgoing radiance from cloth fabrics in the microcylinder model is calculated by integrating {{the product of}} the distant environment lighting, the visibility function, the weighting function that includes shadowing/masking effects of threads, and the light scattering function of threads. The radiance calculation at each shading point of the cloth fabrics is simplified to a linear combination of triple product integrals of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function, multiplied by precomputed spherical Gaussian convolutions of the weighting function. We propose an efficient calculation method of the triple product of two circular Gaussians and the visibility function by using the gradient of signed distance function to the visibility boundary where the binary visibility changes in the angular domain of the hemisphere. Our GPU implementation enables interactive rendering of static cloth fabrics with dynamic viewpoints and lighting. In addition, interactive editing of parameters for the scattering function (e. g. threadâs albedo) that controls the visual appearances of cloth fabrics can be achieved...|$|R
50|$|An optical {{beam dump}} is an optical element used to absorb {{a beam of}} light. Major design {{concerns}} in a beam dump typically include the management and reduction of back reflections and scattering {{as well as the}} dissipation of heat generated by absorption. For low-power systems and less demanding applications, the device {{can be as simple as}} a piece of black <b>velvet</b> or flock <b>paper</b> glued onto a stiff backing, but higher-power beam dumps must often incorporate more elaborate features to avoid back-reflection, overheating, or excessive noise. Dumping the beam with a simple flat surface may scatter unacceptably large amounts of light for some applications, even though the direct reflection may be effectively reduced. To minimize scattering, it is common to use deep, dark cavities lined with an absorbing material to dump the beam. A particularly simple and relatively inexpensive approach is to use a stack of razor blades with the sharp edges facing the beam, so that the spaces between the blades form very deep cavities from which little light escapes.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Cone {{introduced}} a commercial monochromatic black & white printing system of inks and ICC profiles for the Epson 3000 printer that allowed photographers {{to produce a}} wide range of monochromatic tones from warm to cool using archival color inks and ICC profiles for Somerset <b>Velvet</b> <b>paper.</b> This was the first inexpensive quad-black system to be released by ConeTech. From 2002 until 2008, Cone would develop and introduce higher standards of monochromatic ink jet products for Epson printers including PiezoTone (2002), PiezographyBW ICC (2004), Piezography iQuads (2005), Piezography K7 (2006), Piezography MPS (2008).|$|E
