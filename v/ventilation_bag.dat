40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} oxygen-sensitive 3 He-MRI in noninvasive determination of the regional, two- and three-dimensional distribution of oxygen partial pressure. In a gas-filled elastic silicon <b>ventilation</b> <b>bag</b> used as a lung phantom, oxygen sensitive two- and three-dimensional 3 He-MRI measurements were performed at different oxygen concentrations which had been equilibrated in a range of normal and pathologic values. The oxygen partial pressure distribution was determined from 3 He-MRI using newly developed software allowing for mapping of oxygen partial pressure. The reference bulk oxygen partial pressure inside the phantom was measured by conventional respiratory gas analysis. In two-dimensional measurements, image-based and gas-analysis results correlated with r= 0. 98; in three-dimensional measurements the between-methods correlation coefficient was r= 0. 89. The signal-to-noise ratio of three-dimensional measurements was about half of that of two-dimensional measurements and became critical (below 3) in some data sets.

40|$|Abstract Background Suboptimal <b>bag</b> <b>ventilation</b> in {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR) has demonstrated detrimental physiological outcomes for cardiac arrest patients. In light of recent guideline changes for resuscitation, {{there is a}} need to identify the efficacy of <b>bag</b> <b>ventilation</b> by prehospital care providers. The objective of this study was to evaluate <b>bag</b> <b>ventilation</b> in relation to operator ability to achieve guideline consistent ventilation rate, tidal volume and minute volume when using two different capacity self-inflating bags in an undergraduate paramedic cohort. Methods An experimental study using a mechanical lung model and a simulated adult cardiac arrest to assess the ventilation ability of third year Monash University undergraduate paramedic students. Participants were instructed to ventilate using 1600 ml and 1000 ml bags for a length of two minutes at the correct rate and tidal volume for a patient undergoing CPR with an advanced airway. Ventilation rate and tidal volume were recorded using an analogue scale with mean values calculated. Ethics approval was granted. Results Suboptimal ventilation with the use of conventional 1600 ml bag was common, with 77 % and 97 % of participants unable to achieve guideline consistent ventilation rates and tidal volumes respectively. Reduced levels of suboptimal ventilation arouse from the use of the smaller bag with a 27 % reduction in suboptimal tidal volumes (p = 0. 015) and 23 % reduction in suboptimal minute volumes (p = 0. 045). Conclusion Smaller self-inflating bags reduce the incidence of suboptimal tidal volumes and minute volumes and produce greater guideline consistent results for cardiac arrest patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{working group}} from the German Society of Hospital Hygiene (DGKH) and the German Society for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (DGAI) worked out the following recommendations for infection prevention during anaesthesia by using breathing system filters (BSF). The BSF shall be changed after each patient. The filter retention efficiency for airborne particles is recommended to be > 99 % (II). The retention performance of BSF for liquids is recommended to be at pressures of at least 60 hPa (= 60 mbar) or 20 hPa above the selected maximum ventilation pressure in the anaesthetic system. The anaesthesia breathing system {{may be used for}} a period of up to 7 days provided that the functional requirements of the system remain unchanged and the manufacturer states this in the instructions for use. The breathing system and the manual <b>ventilation</b> <b>bag</b> are changed immediately after the respective anaesthesia if the following situation has occurred or it is suspected to have occurred: Notifiable infectious disease involving the risk of transmission via the breathing system and the manual bag, e. g. tuberculosis, acute viral hepatitis, measles, influenza virus, infection and/or colonisation with a multi-resistant pathogen or upper or lower respiratory tract infections. In case of visible contamination e. g. by blood or in case of defect, it is required that the BSF and also the anaesthesia breathing system is changed and the breathing gas conducting parts of the anaesthesia ventilator are hygienically reprocessed. Observing of the appropriate hand disinfection is very important. All surfaces of the anaesthesia equipment exposed to hand contact must be disinfected after each case...|$|E
40|$|Study Objective: To {{report the}} use of a {{sustained}} Valsalva maneuver during deliberate hypotension {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of distal particle embolization during the neuroangiographic embolization of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Design: Retrospective case series. Patients: 54 cases were studied involving 46 unique patients (20 male, 26 female) seen between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008. All patients were ASA class II-III and were undergoing neuroangiographically-assisted embolization for intracranial AVMs. Intervention: Immediately prior to the injection of the embolic substance, each patient received a dose of nitroglycerin to lower their systolic blood pressure from baseline (112 - 146 mm Hg) to a target of 55 mm Hg. Next, mechanical ventilation was suspended and manual pressure was applied to the <b>ventilation</b> <b>bag</b> of the anesthesia circuit to maintain a constant airway pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. This simulated Valsalva maneuver was maintained for 15 seconds after the injection of the embolic material, at which point mechanical ventilation was resumed. Main Results: All patients tolerated the deliberate hypotension/Valsalva protocol well. 2 patients experienced a rupture of the AVM during the procedure. Conclusions: The distal embolization of the embolic material during intracranial AVM embolization is a potentially fatal complication of this procedure. Although our results represent a small case series, they suggest that {{the use of}} deliberate arterial hypotension in addition to a simulated Valsalva maneuver may enhance the safety and efficacy of intracranial AVM embolization.

Infants delivered under general anaesthesia had a significantly higher incidence of respiratory depression at birth with Apgar scores < 7 at both 1 and 5 min (P < 0. 00001), greater need for active resuscitation (intermittent positive pressure <b>ventilation</b> or <b>bag</b> and mask <b>ventilation)</b> (P < 0. 000001) and {{a higher rate of}} neonatal unit admission (P < 0. 00001), Caesarean sections for fetal distress were associated with a significantly higher incidence of intermittent positive pressure <b>ventilation,</b> but not <b>bag</b> and mask <b>ventilation,</b> for both the general anaesthesia and epidural groups (P < 0. 003 and P < 0. 02 respectively), indicating severe respiratory depression in some cases. Under epidural anaesthesia, both elective section and emergency section without fetal distress were low risk deliveries. By excluding the non-cephalic presentation cases in these two groups, the incidence of infants requiring active resuscitation was equivalent to the incidence quoted for spontaneous normal delivery. Conclusion Attendance by a paediatrician is not routinely required at epidural Caesarean section when the infant is cephalic and when there is no fetal distress.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting 35 public hospitals in 20 Brazilian state capitals. Patients 6929 inborn infants without congenital anomalies, with gestational ages from 37 (0 / 7) to 41 (6 / 7) weeks with vertex presentation, born between 1 and 30 September 2003. Intervention Non-urgent caesarean versus non-instrumental vaginal delivery. Non-urgent caesarean was defined as delivery occurring {{in the absence of}} prolapsed cord, third trimester haemorrhage, failure of labour induction, fetal distress or non-clear amniotic fluid. Main outcome measures PPV with bag and mask and with bag and endotracheal tube. Both outcomes were adjusted for potential confounding variables by logistic regression analysis. Results 2087 infants were born by non-urgent caesarean and 4842 by non-instrumental vaginal delivery. Non-urgent caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia compared to vaginal delivery under local or no anaesthesia increased the risk of <b>bag</b> and mask <b>ventilation</b> (OR 1. 42, 95 % Cl 1. 07 to 1. 89) adjusted for number of gestations, maternal hypertension and birth weight. <b>Ventilation</b> with <b>bag</b> and endotracheal tube was associated only with low birth weight, adjusted for delivery mode and twin gestation.

In this study we report our experience with manual <b>ventilation</b> using <b>bag</b> valve mask (BVM) in patients with neuroparalysis due to common krait bite.   Methods:This prospective study was conducted between June 2009 and December 2009. All consecutive patients with diagnosis of common krait bite who were manually ventilated by BVM were studied. The duration of ventilation and complications associated with ventilation were noted. Polyvalent anti snake venom was administered as per the "national snake bite protocol" and patients were followed up until final outcome. Results: Thirty-four patients (70. 6 % men) were studied. All patients except two came from rural areas and they were hospitalized between June and September. Majority of patients were bitten during the night while sleeping on the floor. The mean time interval between bite and arrival to hospital was 4. 4 hours. Ptosis (100 %) was he most common clinical finding followed by ophtalmoplegia (80 %) and limb muscle weakness (74 %).

Maternal serology was unremarkable, with an O positive blood group. However, her Group B Streptococcus (GBS) status was unknown. Her mother had developed pyrexia during labor, {{which could have been}} attributed to a prolonged second stage of labor or to that of a septic nature (Chen et al., 2012). A septic screen was performed and penicillin and gentamicin with antifungals were given until blood cultures were available at 48 h of incubation. These remained negative and the antibiotics were ceased...|$|R
40|$|Spaceflight {{carriers}} run {{a constant}} risk {{of exposure to}} vacuum. Above 63, 000 ft (47 mmHg), the ambient pressure falls below the vapor pressure of water at 37 C, and tissue vaporization (ebullism) begins. Little is know about appropriate resuscitative protocols after such an ebullism exposure. This study identified injury patterns and mortality rates associated with ebullism while verifying effectiveness of traditional pulmonary resuscitative techniques. Male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 87, 000 ft for periods of 40 to 115 sec. After descent, those animals that did not breathe spontaneously were given artificial <b>ventilation</b> by <b>bag</b> and mask for up to 15 minutes. Those animals surviving {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups [...] hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), ground-level oxygen (GLO 2), and ground-level air (GLAIR). The HBO group was treated on a standard treatment table 6 A while the GLO 2 animals received O 2 for an equivalent length of time. Those animals in the GLAIR group were observed only. All surviving animals were humanely sacrified at 48 hours. Inflation of the animal's lungs after the exposure was found to be difficult and, at times, impossible. This may be due to surfactant disruption at the alveolar lining. Electron microscopy identified a disruption of the surfactant layer in animals that did not survive initial exposure. Mortality was found to increase with exposure time: 40 sec [...] 0 percent; 60 sec [...] 6 percent; 70 sec [...] 40 percent; 80 sec [...] 13 percent; 100 sec [...] 38 percent; 110 sec [...] 40 percent; and 115 sec [...] 100 percent. There was no difference in the delayed mortality among the treatment groups (HBO [...] 15 percent, GLO 2 [...] 11 percent, GLAIR [...] 11 percent). However, since resuscitation was ineffective, the effectiveness of any post-exposure treatment was severely limited. Preliminary results indicate that reuscitation of guinea pigs following ebullism exposure is difficult, and that current techniques (such as traditional CPR) may not be appropriate...|$|R
30|$|Controlled {{ventilation}} in {{our patient}} with the ETT tip above the fistula would have led to leak through the fistula leading to gastric distension and possible aspiration. Spontaneous ventilation being negative pressure ventilation does not cause air leak through fistula. Thus, we sorted to spontaneous ventilation. In {{the absence of a}} muscle relaxant, deeper anaesthesia levels are required to prevent movement in response to surgical stimulus. Under this condition, spontaneous <b>ventilation</b> in the <b>bag</b> mode may lead to apnea/hypopnea and may easily be missed till hypoxia ensues. CPAP+PSV (continuous positive airway pressure + pressure support ventilation) and PSV-pro are the two spontaneous ventilation modes in Avance CS 2 machine. They ensure delivery of adequate tidal volume due to pressure support even when the patient hypoventilates. Further, automatic switch to back up ventilation (when apnea is detected for prescribed time as set in the machine) prevents unattended hypoxia. Application of CPAP also prevents atelectasis which leads to better oxygenation and minimises post-operative complications. In our case, the patient could maintain spontaneous ventilation except for one occasion when back up ventilation was initiated. There are reports in the literature of TOFs being repaired while the patient breathes spontaneously, although assisted ventilation was often necessary (Reed and Mathisen 2003; Bartels et al. 1998; Couraud et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|The {{shelf-life}} {{and quality}} of wax apple fruits were studied using polythene bag of 250 gauge with different ventilation (0. 50 and 1. 00 %) both at ambient as well as refrigeration condition during 2007 at College of Horticulture, Mudigere. The experiment was conducted with eight treatments and four replications. The data were analyzed by adopting Completely Randomized Design. The study revealed that the fruits in refrigeration storage with ventilated polythene bags showed good shelf life compared to fruits stored in ambient condition with ventilated polythene bags. The maximum shelf life, delayed rotting and optimum fruit quality of wax apple were observed in 1. 00 and 0. 50 % ventilation at refrigeration storage followed by 1. 00 % ventilation at ambient storage. The fruits stored without polythene bags both at ambient and refrigeration had lowest shelf life and shrunk compared to ventilated polythene bag storage. The fruits stored with no <b>ventilation</b> in polythene <b>bags</b> both at ambient and refrigeration rotted early and was unacceptable due to poor fruit quality and strong aldehydic flavour when compared to ventilated storage bag. The sensory evaluation revealed that, fruits stored in ventilated polythene bags had better orgenoleptic quality both in ambient as well as refrigeration storage condition compared to fruits stored without polythene bags...|$|R
30|$|We {{sought to}} perform this study {{because we believe}} {{developing}} an initial ventilation strategy to prevent PaCO 2 derangements immediately after resuscitation from cardiac arrest could potentially allow for a therapeutic approach to help attenuate brain injury associated with post-cardiac arrest syndrome. In this observational study we answered several preliminary questions: (1) initial prescribed MV had only a weak correlation with subsequent PaCO 2, and (2) early normocapnia was associated with good neurological outcome. Our {{findings suggest that the}} initial post-resuscitation PaCO 2 is not solely the result of the prescribed MV, and thus it is likely influenced by other treatment-related factors (for example, use of neuromuscular blocking agents, duration and technique of <b>bag</b> <b>ventilation</b> by hand prior to initiation of mechanical ventilation) and multiple patient-related factors (for example, etiology of cardiac arrest, lung compliance, lung injury, intrinsic respiratory drive, persistent post-resuscitation circulatory shock, dead space, body habitus). These data provide scientific rationale for further research to determine the other factors associated with PaCO 2 derangements during the initial post-ROSC period. Determining such factors will allow {{for the development of a}} volume-targeted ventilation strategy, which focuses on initial prescribed MV adjusted for individual patient-related factors. Such a ventilator strategy could potentially achieve normocapnia more consistently on the initial ABG after ROSC, decreasing the need for ventilator adjustments and additional ABG analyses, and ultimately decrease the time to achievement of normocapnia.|$|R
