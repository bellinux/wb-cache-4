At {{supplementary}} feeding stations (‘vulture restaurants’) carcasses are available permanently, posing a conservation dilemma: enhancing populations of endangered scavengers might introduce a predation pressure on non-target species. Here, we test if nest predation risk on ground-nesting birds increases near carcasses in Fuerteventura Island (Canary Archipelago).

40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{increasing}} concern for biodiversity conservation but decreasing resources devoted to species management, measuring the impact of actions is critically needed so as to optimise conservation practices. Long-term longitudinal data collected on marked individuals allow for {{an assessment of the}} demographic response of a population to conservation actions while accounting for potential confounding factors. This study focused on the recovery of a geographically-isolated population of the endangered Egyptian vulture in south-eastern France, which experienced food shortages induced by major changes in habitat and sanitary legislation limiting the abandonment of dead animals in the field. The survival rates and population dynamics of the Egyptian vulture were computed, following the implementation of supplementary feeding stations, while accounting for the potential variation in environmental conditions on wintering grounds, reproduction and immigration. An integrated population model (IPM) was used to combine capture-resighting data with recoveries of dead birds, breeding surveys and counts of territorial pairs over a 16 -year period. Results showed that the implementation of <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> improved the local survival rates and successfully stabilised the local demography of Egyptian vultures; this despite a reduction in average fecundity due to compensatory density feedback. Moreover, throughout the study period, about two thirds of the new recruits into the breeding population were immigrants, suggesting immigration constantly sustained the Egyptian vulture population in south-eastern France. However, we did not detect any effect of <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> on the immigration rate, indicating that the improvement of local survival by <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> remained the main driver of the positive shift in the population dynamics. This study highlights the positive impact of <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> on Egyptian <b>vulture</b> population restoration by compensating for natural food limitations. It also points out the methodological importance of estimating immigration for understanding population dynamics and that large-scale monitoring and internationally-concerted conservation should be promoted.

40|$|The {{provision}} of supplementary food at vulture restaurants is a well-established {{tool in the}} conservation of vulture species. Among their many applications, vulture restaurants are used to provide a safe food source in areas where carcasses are commonly baited with poisons.

40|$|The Cape Vulture, Gyps coprotheres, is {{currently}} classified as ‘endangered’. Endemic to southern Africa, its population has declined continuously {{over the past}} 40 years. The species is facing multiple anthropogenic threats. Notably, birds frequently collide with power lines and some cannot be released after treatment. This {{has led to the}} establishment of a captive breeding population with the hope that captive bred young can supplement wild populations and re-establish a now- abandoned breeding colony in the Magaliesberg Mountains, South Africa. This study aimed to follow the breeding behaviours of the captive colony and assess the appropriateness of chick rearing conditions. The study also aimed to monitor the behaviour, physical condition and dispersal of ten captive bred vultures after release in relation to their age. Behavioural observations of captive adult breeding and parental behaviours were conducted to establish whether chicks developed under comparable conditions to wild chicks. A high percentage of total colony copulation attempts (22 %) were extra-pair copulations. Four paired males formed ephemeral extra-pair relationships, two of which were homosexual. Chicks fledged earlier than wild chicks, on average at 128 days old. Wild and captive bred birds were observed at carcasses to compare competitive and feeding behaviours. Older birds, both wild and captive, fed the most efficiently. Preliminary evidence suggests females are more dominant and have higher display rates than males. Captive bred juvenile and four year old birds’ competitive and feeding behaviours (interaction rate, feeding rate, display rate, dominance, aggressiveness, and feeding efficiency) were the closest to, but still generally below, average values for same-aged wild birds. An index of body condition, body mass, and the prevalence of fault bars on the rectrices were used to assess their physical condition. After eight months, none of the ten birds had moved more than 8 km from the release site, nor had they foraged away from the <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurant</b> on site. Although altitude records of > 3100 m were recorded, their flight skills seemed inadequate. Future management considerations include the initiation of a pre-release exercise regime, the establishment of an acclimatization enclosure removed from the breeding site, and a varied or reduced post-release feeding schedule.

40|$|Wind {{farms are}} {{emerging}} as {{a major cause of}} mortality of large scavenging bird species, which may be catastrophic when they operate in concert with other threats. As a study model, we examine the impact of wind turbines on the population dynamics of a soaring bird species, when acting in conjunction with a sudden decrease in food availability following the European bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic. In Spain, vultures have been provided with supplementary food at traditional <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> for centuries. In 2006 / 2007, these feeding stations were closed as part of disease control measures. At the same time, wind farms were deployed within the vulture foraging range. We used capture-recapture data and direct observation to monitor the impacts of these changes on the vulture population. The number of breeding pairs decreased by c. 24 %, adult survival by 30 % and fecundity by 35 %. However, the population recovered as soon as the perturbations ceased, the <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> were reopened, and the most problematic wind turbines were closed. Population recovery was faster than predicted by a retrospective stochastic population model. Our analyses indicate that fecundity and survival were influenced predominantly by wind turbines. Food scarcity promoted a shift in foraging behaviour that drove vultures to fly into the path of wind turbines as they sought out new food sources in a landfill site. Elasticity and sensitivity analyses of the population model showed that mortality of adult birds had a much greater effect on population declines than mortality of immature birds, whereas reduction in fecundity had negligible effects. The most likely explanation for the rapid recovery of the vulture population is that the observed decline in breeding pairs was not solely because of increased mortality. The decline probably included dispersal away from the area and a greater incidence of skipped breeding during the perturbation years. Subsequent immigration from large nearby populations was probably a factor in population recovery. Synthesis and applications. Where specific wind turbines are causing substantial mortality, their closure is an effective management response. For vulture populations dependent on supplemental feeding stations, the feeding sites should be relocated away from the most problematic wind turbines, or other anthropogenic sources of mortality, to prevent negative impacts. We recommend the establishment of scattered, low-value food sources to replicate historical conditions and to avoid the problems associated with high concentrations of individuals in one place.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the spatial ecology and ranging {{behaviour}} of vultures in Europe. In this paper we used GPS satellite telemetry to assess home-ranges of eight non-breeding Eurasian Griffon Vultures in Spain, trying to answer the main questions on when (i. e. the time of the day), how far (i. e. hourly and daily distances) and where vultures range (i. e. home-range size). Results indicated that vultures ranged extensively mainly in areas where traditional stock-raising practices and pasturing were still common, also including some <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants,</b> which were visited occasionally. Eurasian Griffon Vultures concentrated their hourly and daily movements {{in the middle of the}} day, when the availability of thermal updrafts was higher, favouring foraging activities. The overall foraging range, calculated as Minimum Convex Polygon (MCP) (7419 km 2), or as 95 % and 50 % kernel contours (4078 km 2 and 489 km 2, respectively), was higher than those reported in previous studies. The precise knowledge of the ranging behaviour and spatial parameters is particularly important for the conservation of scavenger species inhabiting human-dominated areas where human activities may jeopardize vulture populations in the long term.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{consequences of}} spatio-temporal distribution and abundance of trophic resources have received significant attention in ecology {{due to their}} predicted effects at the individual, population and community levels. Pulses are defined as occasional episodes of food abundance concentrated in space and time. Although these phenomena are common in many ecosystems {{we still have a}} limited understanding about their effects on the dynamics and functioning of guilds and vertebrate communities. To explore these issues we carried out research using carcasses and scavenger guilds as a study model. Carcasses are a paradigmatic pulsed resource that under natural conditions appears unpredictable. They are exploited by guilds of organisms ranging from bacteria to vultures and large carnivores. However, human activities (including certain conservation strategies) change the unpredictable conditions with foreseeable consequences in the structure and functioning of scavenger guilds. In this scenario, the main aims of this thesis were: 1) to explore the role of unpredictability (randomness) as a driver of both the diversity and the existence of facilitatory processes within an avian scavenger guild and 2) to detect the ecological consequences that occur when trophic resources become predictable, both for scavengers and for non-scavenger species. We explored the second goal using supplementary feeding stations (<b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants)</b> as our study model. Thus our results are not only of ecological significance, but can also be of great utility for the management and conservation of these species. We found that unpredictable (random) distribution of carcasses favours the diversity of scavengers and promotes the existence of intraguild facilitatory processes. Moreover, through a transcontinental approach we found that migrant scavengers change their spatial distribution patterns between the breeding (in Europe) and the wintering areas (in Africa) consistently following the degree of food aggregation. Moreover, we detect higher overlap in interspecific diets in Europe, where resources are scarce, clumped and predictable. The availability of long-lasting carcasses provokes the aggregation of large numbers of facultative scavengers, increasing the risk of predation on other vertebrates that live around these areas. Finally, we examined conservation consequences of the concentration of carcasses at supplementary feeding stations (<b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants)</b> promoted by current European sanitary legislation. We found that clumped and predictable food resources cause the co-occurrence of scavenger species at these points provoking an overlap in their diets, which is otherwise segregated. Moreover, supplementary feeding stations favour the gathering of individuals of the dominant species (the griffon vulture Gyps fulvus), which monopolize food to the detriment of small scavengers of conservation concern. To minimize these negative effects we provide guidelines for an appropriate design and propose that adaptive management is key for the most effective application of this widely used conservation tool. In conclusion, this study shows that changes in the distribution and predictability of food resources have important consequences for the structure and functioning of the scavenger guilds as well as other vertebrate communities not directly related to the exploitation of this resource. Studies such as this thesis, which deal with the issue from different perspectives (including those relating to conservation) are particularly relevant in understanding the phenomenon.

40|$|Seven of {{the nine}} vulture species in South Africa are listed as {{endangered}} on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. From these, the Cape Griffon vulture (Gyps corprotheres) is the most endangered species in the region. Although inadequate nutritional support has been blamed on the constant decline in populations, the process of <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> has failed to improve the population status over the last twenty years. One possible reason for the decline may be an underlying reproductive disorder as described in endocrine disruptive syndromes. Both DDT and p,p 0 -DDE have been detected previously at very high concentrations in the mid 1980 s, with lower concentrations still being detectable as late as 2001. To establish the effect of DDT and DDE, the vulture estrogen receptor a (ERa) was sequenced from two species using 50 and 30 rapid amplification cDNA ends (RACE). Using transient transfected mammalian cell assays, vulture ERa estrogen-dependent transcription activity was validated using various estrogens and DDT derivatives. The receptor assay was sensitive to p,p 0 -DDT, o,p 0 -DDT and p,p 0 -DDE with EC 50 of 2. 41 x 10 - 6, 3. 47 x 10 - 7 and 3. 81 x 10 - 5 M. When compared to results obtained from human, zebrafish, chicken, salamander and turtle, the vulture ERa showed high sensitivity to o,p 0 -DDT and intermediately responsive to p,p 0 -DDE. Vulture ERa is, however, not responsive to the DDT and DDE levels reported in the plasma of vultures from the last population survey, indicating that the Southern African vulture are not currently exposed to disruptive levels of these contaminants...|$|R
40|$|Between 1996 and 2000 the {{appearance}} of bovine spongiform encephalopathy swiftly {{became one of the}} most serious public health and political crises concerning food safety ever experienced in the European Union (EU). Subsequent sanitary regulations led to profound changes in the management of livestock carcasses (i. e. the industrial destruction of around 80 % of all animal carcasses), thereby threatening the last remaining healthy scavenger populations of the Old World and thus contradicting the long-term environmental policies of the EU. 2. Several warning signs such as a decrease in breeding success, an apparent increase in mortality in young age classes of vultures and an increase in the number of cases of vultures attacking and killing cattle, as well as a halt in population growth, suggest that the decrease in the availability of food resources has had harmful effects on vulture populations. 3. Between 2002 and 2005, a number of dispositions to the EU regulations (2003 / 322 /CE 2005 / 830 /CE) enabled conservation managers to adopt rapid solutions (i. e. the creation of <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants)</b> aimed at satisfying the food requirements of vultures. However, these conservation measures may seriously modify habitat quality and have indirect detrimental effects on avian scavenger populations and communities. 4. Synthesis and applications. Conservation managers and policy-makers need to balance the demands of public health protection and the long-term conservation of biodiversity. The regulations concerning carrion provisioning need to be more flexible and there needs to be greater compatibility between sanitary and environmental policies. We advocate policies that authorize the abandonment of livestock carcasses and favours populations of wild herbivores to help to maintain populations of avian scavengers.

40|$|Understanding space use of {{free-living}} endangered {{animals is}} key to inform management decisions for conservation planning. Like most scavengers, vultures have evolved under a context of unpredictability of food resources (i. e. exploiting scattered carcasses that are intermittently available). However, the role of predictable sources of food in shaping spatial ecology of vultures has seldom been studied in detail. Here, we quantify the home range of the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), a long-lived raptor which has experienced severe population decline throughout its range and is qualified as endangered worldwide. To this end six adults were tracked by satellite telemetry in Spain during the breeding season, from 2007 to 2012, recording 10360 GPS locations. Using Resource Utilization Functions, we assessed the topology of the Utilization Distribution, a three-dimensional measure that shows the probability of finding an animal within the home range. Our results showed how food availability and principally, how food predictability, determines ranging behaviour of this species. Egyptian vultures showed consistent site fidelity across years, measured as the two and three-dimensional overlap in their home ranges. Space use varied considerably within the home range and remarkably, places located far from nesting sites were used more frequently than some areas located closer. Therefore, traditional conservation measures based on establishing restrictive rules within a fixed radius around nesting sites could be biologically meaningless if other areas within the home range are not protected too. Finally, our results {{emphasize the importance of}} anthropogenic predictable sources of food (mainly <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants)</b> in shaping the space use of scavengers, which is in agreement with recent findings. Hence, measures aimed at ensuring food availability are essential to preserve this endangered vulture, especially in the present context of limiting carrion dumping in the field due to sanitary regulations according to European legislation.

40|$|Pharmaceuticals from {{veterinary}} treatments may enter terrestrial food webs when medicated livestock {{are available to}} wildlife in supplementary feeding stations aimed at the conservation of endangered scavengers. Here, we hypothesized that the exposure risk to livestock fluoroquinolones, as indicators of pharmaceutical burden in food, {{is related to the}} variable reliance of scavengers on domestic versus wild animal carcasses. Since the misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major predisposing factor for opportunistic mycoses, we evaluated disease signs potentially associated with diet-dependent drug exposure in nestlings of two threatened vultures. A greater occurrence (100 %, n= 14) and concentration of fluoroquinolones (mean±SD= 73. 0 ± 27. 5 µg L, range= 33. 2 – 132. 7), mostly enrofloxacin, were found in Cinereous vultures, Aegypius monachus, due to their greater dependence on livestock carcasses than Egyptian vultures, Neophron percnopterus (fluoroquinolones occurrence: 44 %, n= 16, concentration: 37. 9 ± 16. 6 µg L, range= 11. 5 – 55. 9), which rely much more on carcasses of wild animals (42 % of remains vs. 23 % in the cinereous vulture). The chaotic, chronic and pulsed ingestion of these drugs throughout nestling development is proposed {{as one of the most}} plausible explanations for the high occurrence and intensity of oral Candida-like lesions in nestling vultures. The high occurrence of fluoroquinolone residues and disease hindered the probing of a cause-effect relationship between both factors in individual vultures. This relationship could be evaluated through a population-based approach by sampling vultures not exposed to these drugs. The high dependence of vultures on domestic animals today compared to past decades and the growing intensification of livestock farming, imply an expected increase in the impact of pharmaceuticals on scavenger populations. This requires further evaluation due to potential consequences in biodiversity conservation and environmental health. We encourage the prioritization of efforts to promote the use of less medicated free-ranging livestock carcasses left in the countryside, rather than stabled stocks made available in <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants.</b> Additionally, attention should be paid to the population recovery of wild species that dominated scavenger diets in the past.

40|$|The {{demand for}} the control of safe food, from {{consumers}} the world over, has revolutionized {{the manner in which}} wild game meat harvesting occurs. In developed countries, food quality, food and human safety with quality controlling systems embracing environmental carbon footprint issues are constantly improving, for international harmonization at each level of production “from stable to table”, “farm to fork”, “field to yield” as well as from “cradle to grave”. Food industries globally have adopted the in Hazard Analysis Critical control Point (HACCP) system. This is a risk assessment process using Hygiene Assessment Systems (HAS) as a mitigating strategy for risk communication through training. It is also a holistic system that is compatible with international trends designed not only for food safety and quality, but it also embraces other aspects of farming such as animal welfare, environmental management and Occupational Safety and Health. Global marketing for international trade demands quality assurance from trading partners thereby promoting economic growth for developing countries. The watch dog bodies such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) prohibit trading for non-compliance, therefore trade barriers are in place for uncertified food of animal origin, EU regulations are stringent requirements that need compliance and so too the OIE regulations for disease control, while the Codex Alimentarius Commission maintains trade harmonization. In South Africa Hygiene Assessment Systems (HAS) is a National Hygiene management strategy implemented at abattoirs, that promotes and facilitates quality and hygiene and is reflective of South African quality abroad. It is prescribed under the section, “Essential National Standards” in the Meat Safety Act, 2000, (Act 40 of 2000). This Act covers red meat and includes both domestic animals and game. The Veterinary Procedural Notices (VPN’s) are used for export of game and give far more detailed guidelines than the legislation for game meat sold and consumed locally in South Africa. The objective of the Hygiene Assessment System (HAS) is to create a national awareness of quality to better {{improve the quality of life}} of all South Africans, whilst at the same time it is used as an auditing tool for Veterinary Public Health to effectively compare essential standards within the nine provinces. Currently this programme is referred to as the National Abattoir Rating Scheme (NARS), which is only applicable to the high and low throughput Red Meat and Poultry abattoirs in South Africa and not to the Game or Rural abattoirs, thereby further compounding the duality of food standards with food safety being compromised. This study has been undertaken because there are inadequate risk control measures such as introduction of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) guidelines on primary and secondary meat inspection, specifically on game for local consumption, not only within South Africa, but in the international arena as well. A revision of the HAS document and audit will also be needed to meet with the local (not just export) criteria for wild game harvesting, to enable food safety, thus enabling food security in the remote non - agricultural areas in KwaZulu -Natal. Venison is the meat of today because of health priorities that have arisen over the last ten years. It is low in trans - fatty acids and is regarded internationally as a healthy product produced organically in a free range situation. South Africa has a large potential export market for venison to the European Union because the demand, for venison, exceeds supply in Europe. However, the European Union’s “safe food regulation” that was introduced between 2005 and 2007 with an implementation date of 2008 (Regulation 1021 / 2008) has made it imperative that the HACCP principle is applied to any food or food product of animal origin imported into the European Union or its member states. Also, HACCP specifies that a multidisciplinary team of experts is selected. This then lends itself to a participatory approach to risk assessment as wide consultation is required. This participatory approach was used, including expert opinion surveys and focus group discussions with stakeholders and role-players in the game industry such as commercial hunters, state veterinary services and game ranch owners. Such participants may have better insight into existing conditions than external experts with recognised educational qualifications, usually used in the HACCP team. From this and the relevant Veterinary Procedural Notices for game harvesting, a HACCP process flow and critical control points were derived for the primary phase of meat inspection, including slaughter, primary meat inspection and loading for transport to the abattoir. This was modified during a phase or trial harvesting and then implemented during the harvest of 1758 impala carcasses which were subsequently exported. In addition, environmental risks were considered and a risk mitigation strategy designed, to reduce any possible environmental impacts. In northern Kwazulu Natal, game ranches and conservation areas are in close proximity to the rural poor where food is scarce and comes at a premium price. These game farms harvest seasonally for either the local or export market, hence there is abundance of game offal and by-products available, yet it is at present left in the field or taken to the <b>vulture</b> <b>restaurants</b> (in line with the VPN). Participatory risk analysis was thus also used to investigate the feasibility of using edible offal from impala (Aepyceros melampus) as a source of renewable protein, to address food security issues in impoverished communities in the study area, the districts of uPongola and Jozini, in northern KwaZulu Natal. Structured interviews on the cultural acceptability of impala offal were held with 162 randomly sampled adult respondents in veterinary districts associated with dip tanks. A two stage cluster design was used where the state veterinary areas were stage one and the dip tanks (with proportional random sampling of community members) were the second stage. Offal is a popular food in South Africa in different cultures, called “ithumbu” in IsiZulu, “ boti” by the Indian group, “afval” in Afrikaans and “tripe” in English. Generally demand outstrips supply of offal at red meat abattoirs in South Africa. It was found that there was no significant difference between those who would eat impala offal and those who would eat the offal of sheep. It was concluded that it is feasible to use inspected game offal from impala as a protein source in much the same way as red meat offal is used and that the current practice of leaving the offal for predators was likely, if it continues, to cause imbalances in the predator/ prey ratio on game farms. It is recommended that the VPN for game be amended to encompass inspected offal being allowed into the formal food chain, in line with the standard operating procedure developed during this study. Also that current fragmentation of legislation and the implementation thereof is revisited for effective control for harmonisation of food safety standards for game meat within South Africa.
