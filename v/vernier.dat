5|$|During 1963, the M-102 {{designation}} {{was extended}} northerly along Jefferson Avenue through St. Clair Shores, replacing the M-29 designation to the Shook Road interchange {{at the northern}} end of the then-existing I-94 freeway. That extension was reversed the next year, and M-102 was scaled back to end at US25 (Gratiot Avenue); the rest of 8Mile and <b>Vernier</b> roads plus the Jefferson Avenue segment are added to M-29 instead. M-102 was re-extended along 8Mile and <b>Vernier</b> roads to the I-94 interchange in Harper Woods in 1970 replacing M-29; the remainder of that other highway along <b>Vernier</b> Road and Jefferson Avenue to Shook Road that was once part of M-102 was transferred to local control.|$|E

5|$|M-102 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that {{runs along the}} northern boundary of Detroit following 8Mile Road. The highway follows the Michigan Baseline, {{a part of the}} land survey of the state, and the roadway is also called Base Line Road in places. As a county road or city street, 8Mile Road extends both east and west of the M-102 designation, which leaves 8Mile on the eastern end to follow <b>Vernier</b> Road. The western terminus of M-102 is at the junction of 8Mile Road and M-5 (Grand River Avenue) and the opposite end is at <b>Vernier</b> Road and Interstate94 (I-94). The 8Mile Road name extends west to Pontiac Trail near South Lyon with a discontinuous segment located west of US Highway23 (US23). The eastern end of 8Mile Road is in Grosse Pointe Woods near I-94.|$|E
50|$|Léonce <b>Verny</b> {{is remembered}} in Japan {{as a symbol}} of {{modernization}} and of friendship with France. A park has been built in his name ("Verny Park") on the seafront at Yokosuka, with a bronze bust of <b>Verny,</b> and a small museum. The <b>Verny</b> Commemorative Museum is located near the site of the former Yokosuka Naval Arsenal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Verny</b> {{experienced}} numerous {{problems during}} his tenure in Japan, as {{the expectations of the}} Japanese government and military were very high, but funding was very limited, and <b>Verny</b> had to create much of the necessary infrastructure from scratch. When visited by the French construction director of the Chinese Fuzhou arsenal in 1871, <b>Verny</b> noted that the Chinese budget was three times larger than his.|$|R

5|$|M-102 {{was first}} {{designated}} along 8Mile Road from US10 (Woodward Avenue, now M-1) to US25 (Gratiot Avenue, now M-3) in late 1928 or early 1929. In 1939, the eastern terminus was moved as M-102 was extended along 8Mile and <b>Vernier</b> Roads {{to end in}} Grosse Pointe Shores at M-29 (Jefferson Avenue). The highway was extended in the early 1940s from Woodward westward to US16 (Grand River Avenue, now M-5).|$|E
5|$|I-94 {{traverses}} Detroit in an east–west direction well inland of, {{and parallel}} to, the Detroit River. The freeway intersects I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and M-10 (Lodge Freeway) on the West Side, passing the main campus of Wayne State University {{before entering the}} East Side at M-1 (Woodward Avenue). Immediately east of the interchange with I-75 (Chrysler Freeway), I-94 forms the southern border of the Milwaukee Junction district. The Edsel Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit's East Side. The Interstate turns more northerly, mimicking the shoreline of Lake St. Clair, and exits Detroit for Harper Woods. Just north of the interchange for M-102 (<b>Vernier</b> Road), the freeway crosses 8Mile Road and enters Macomb County.|$|E
5|$|Schirra {{was awakened}} at 1:40 am ET {{on the morning}} of October 3, and after a hearty breakfast—including a {{bluefish}} he had speared the day before—and a brief physical he left for the launchpad at around 4 am. He entered the spacecraft at 4:41 am ET, where he found a steak sandwich left for him in the 'glove compartment', and began the pre-launch checks. The launch countdown proceeded as planned until 6:15, when there was a 15-minute hold to allow the Canary Islands tracking station to repair a radar set. The countdown resumed at 6:30 and proceeded to booster ignition with no further delays. Liftoff proceeded smoothly, but there was a momentary clockwise roll transient at liftoff, which reached 7.83° per second and approached 80% of the required threshold to trigger the ASIS abort system. This was later identified as being due to a slight misalignment of the main engines and was kept under control by the booster's <b>vernier</b> thrusters. Sustainer engine thrust during the launch was slightly below normal and fuel consumption higher than normal due to a suspected leak in the sustainer fuel system.|$|E

25|$|Rockets {{consist of}} a {{propellant}}, {{a place to put}} propellant (such as a propellant tank), and a nozzle. They may also have one or more rocket engines, directional stabilization device(s) (such as fins, <b>vernier</b> engines or engine gimbals for thrust vectoring, gyroscopes) and a structure (typically monocoque) to hold these components together. Rockets intended for high speed atmospheric use also have an aerodynamic fairing such as a nose cone, which usually holds the payload.|$|E
25|$|The Atlas {{first stage}} was a booster skirt with two engines burning liquid fuel. This {{together}} with the larger sustainer second stage gave it sufficient power to launch a Mercury spacecraft into orbit. Both stages fired from lift-off with the thrust from the second stage sustainer engine passing through {{an opening in the}} first stage. After separation from the first stage, the sustainer stage continued alone. The sustainer also steered the rocket by thrusters guided by gyroscopes. Smaller <b>vernier</b> rockets were added on its sides for precise control of maneuvers.|$|E
25|$|Under Snella, Saint-Étienne {{achieved}} {{its first}} honour {{after winning the}} Coupe Charles Drago in 1955. Two seasons later, the club won its first domestic league title. Led by goalkeeper Claude Abbes, defender Robert Herbin, as well as midfielders René Ferrier and Kees Rijvers and striker Georges Peyroche, Saint-Étienne won the league by four points over Lens. In 1958, Saint-Étienne won the Coupe Drago for the second time. After the following season, in which the club finished sixth, Snella departed the club. He was replaced by René <b>Vernier.</b> In the team's first season under <b>Vernier,</b> Saint-Étienne finished 12th, the club's worst finish since finishing 11th eight seasons ago. In the following season, François Wicart joined the coaching staff. In 1961, Roger Rocher {{became president of the}} club and quickly became one of the club's chief investors. After two seasons under Wicart, Saint-Étienne were relegated after finishing 17th in the 1961–62 season. However, Wicart did lead the club to its first Coupe de France title in 1962, alongside co-manager Henri Guérin with the team defeating FC Nancy 1–0 in the final. He also led the club back to Division 1 after one season in the second division, but after the season, Wicart was replaced by Snella, who returned as manager after a successful stint in Switzerland with Servette.|$|E
50|$|December 31, 1910, is {{considered}} to be the NLRK's birthday.

25|$|The first {{launch of}} an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) {{occurred}} on 15 May 1957. A fire {{began in the}} Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until T+98 seconds when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed some 400km downrange. Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10–11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch. The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July. An electrical short caused the <b>vernier</b> engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted {{in all of the}} strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about 7km from the pad.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{came very}} close to failure—a postflight {{examination}} of telemetry data found that the Blok G strap-on had not attained full power at ignition and the resulting imbalanced thrust caused the booster to pitch over about 2° six seconds after liftoff. Two seconds later, the flight control system tried to compensate by rapidly moving the <b>vernier</b> engines and stabilizer fins. The Blok G strap-on finally reached 100% thrust only one second before the pitch angle would have been great enough to trigger an automatic shutdown command, which would have terminated the launch and sent the R-7 and Sputnik 1 crashing to the ground in a fireball only a short distance from the pad.|$|E
25|$|SpaceX {{currently}} manufactures {{two broad}} classes of rocket engine in-house: the kerosene fueled Merlin engines and the hypergolic fueled Draco/SuperDraco <b>vernier</b> thrusters.

25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or <b>vernier</b> scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
25|$|A solar compass is a {{railroad}} compass with a solar attachment that allows surveyors {{to determine the}} north direction by reference to the sun rather than by reference to the magnetic needle. It consists of three arcs: one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed; one for setting the declination of the sun; and one for setting the hour of the day. In 1835, the solar compass was invented by William Austin Burt, a U.S. Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government lands in the Michigan Territory earlier in 1833. While experiencing great difficulty in using his standard <b>vernier</b> compass in order to detect deposits of iron ore in the Northwest Territory (present-day Wisconsin), Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of the Earth's magnetic field and north-south survey lines {{would be easier to}} find. A patent was issued to Burt on February 25, 1836.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 11, {{the joint}} Expedition 22/STS-130 crew {{received}} a phone call from U.S. President Barack Obama and several school children.After the conference with President Obama and the children, the crew members began transferring Environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) racks to the Tranquility module. These transfers were done by ISS commander Jeff Williams, flight engineer T.J. Creamer, shuttle commander George Zamka and mission specialist Stephen Robinson and took most of the day. Also during the day pilot Terry Virts continued working on getting the Cupola set-up for the robotics work station. He had a small problem installing some corner panels which are needed to hold the workstation. Spacewalkers Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick were busy reconfiguring the airlock for use by the station crew and later flights. They also transferred their spacesuits and tools back to the shuttle for the return trip home. After the rack transfers were done the crew completed some more transfers and passed the 75% complete mark. The space shuttle commanded by commander George Zamka and pilot Terry Virts completed a reboost of the station using its <b>vernier</b> thrusters.|$|E
