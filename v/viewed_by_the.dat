5|$|In many countries, being {{identified}} {{in such a}} sauna was still <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> press as scandalous. In Ireland in November 1994, the Incognito sauna made mainstream press as the gay sauna where a priest {{had died of a}} heart attack and two other priests were on hand to help out. Scott Capurro is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to gay sexual culture including gay bathhouses.|$|E
5|$|Mazdakism was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Zoroastrian {{hierarchy}} as a heresy and its followers were persecuted by Zoroastrian Sassanian leaders.

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated {{large parts of the}} town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Edinburgh.

5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to support it. Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|The 2000 UEFA Cup Final Riots, {{also known}} as the Battle of Copenhagen, were a series of riots in City Hall Square in Copenhagen, Denmark, between fans of English {{football}} team Arsenal and Turkish side Galatasaray around the 2000 UEFA Cup Final on 17 May 2000. The scuffles, in which four people were stabbed, also involved fans from other clubs and were <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> media as part of a retaliation for the killing of two Leeds United fans by Galatasaray supporters the month before.|$|E
5|$|The American Revolutionary War, {{which began}} in April 1775 with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, widened in September 1775 when the Continental Army {{embarked}} on an invasion of the British Province of Quebec. The province was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Second Continental Congress as a potential avenue for British forces to attack and divide the rebellious colonies, and {{was at the time}} lightly defended. The invasion reached a peak on December 31, 1775, when the Battle of Quebec ended in disaster for the Americans. In the spring of 1776, 10,000British and German troops arrived in Quebec, and General Guy Carleton, the provincial governor, drove the Continental Army out of Quebec and back to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

5|$|As <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church, Baptism is {{the first}} of three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an {{archipelago}} {{or group of}} islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.|$|E

5|$|In 1129, Emperor Gaozong {{designated}} the site at Hangzhou (known then as Lin'an) {{to be the}} temporary settlement of the court, {{but it was not}} until 1132 that it was declared the new Song capital. Hangzhou and Nanjing were devastated by the Jin raids; both cities were heavily repopulated with northern refugees who outnumbered the remaining original inhabitants. Hangzhou was chosen not only for its natural scenic beauty, but for the surrounding topographic barriers of lakes and muddy rice-fields that gave it defensive potential against northern armies comprising mostly cavalry. Yet it was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> court as only a temporary capital while the Song emperors planned to retake Kaifeng. However, the rapid growth of the city from the 12th century to the 13th necessitated long-term goals of residency. In 1133 the modest palatial residence of the imperial family was improved upon from a simple provincial lodging to one that at least accommodated strolls with new covered alleyways to deflect the rain. In 1148 the walls of the small palace compound were finally extended to the southeast, yet this was another marginal improvement.|$|E
5|$|In 1230 Óláfr fled to Norway to seek {{military}} assistance against Alan {{and members of}} Clann Somairle. The Norwegian king's response was to send a fleet into the Isles {{under the command of}} Óspakr-Hákon, a member of Clann Somairle. Óspakr-Hákon was slain early in the campaign, after which Óláfr took control of the fleet and secured himself on Mann. The island-kingdom was divided between him and his mutilated nephew Guðrøðr, with the latter ruling the Hebridean portion and Óláfr ruling Mann itself. Guðrøðr was soon after killed on Lewis, and Óláfr ruled the whole Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully, until his death in 1237. Óláfr's restoration on Mann was seen as a success by the Norwegians, and likely favourably <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Scots as well; since the internal struggle between him and his rivals had been brought to an end. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Haraldr. In all, three of Óláfr's sons ruled the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom—the last of which, Magnús Óláfsson, was also the last of the dynasty to rule.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} Communist regime in Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. After the elections, the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija, or JNA) confiscated the weapons of Croatia's Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana, or TO) to minimise any resistance. On 17 August 1990, the tensions escalated to an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, {{and parts of the}} Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia regions. The Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), later established in those areas, declared its intention to integrate with Serbia, and was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Government of Croatia as a breakaway region. The JNA prevented Croatian police from intervening. By March 1991, the conflict had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. In June, Croatia declared independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated, but implementation of the decision was postponed until 8 October by a three-month moratorium. A campaign of ethnic cleansing then began in the RSK; most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993.|$|E

5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land lease agreement with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 {{revolt of}} the Croatian Serbs was {{centered}} on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and in eastern Croatian settlements with significant Serb populations. These areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). The RSK declared its intention of political integration with Serbia and was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Government of Croatia as a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict escalated to warthe Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated, followed by a three-month moratorium on the decision, thus the decision came into effect on 8 October. A campaign of ethnic cleansing was then initiated by the RSK against Croatian civilians and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. By November 1993, less than 400 and 1,5002,000 ethnic Croats remained in UN protected areas Sector South and Sector North respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Washington administration's {{suppression}} of the Whiskey Rebellion met with widespread popular approval. The episode demonstrated that the new national government had the willingness and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. It was, therefore, <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Washington administration as a success, a view that has generally been endorsed by historians. The Washington administration and its supporters usually did not mention, however, that the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect, and that many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax. The events contributed {{to the formation of}} political parties in the United States, a process already underway. The whiskey tax was repealed after Thomas Jefferson's Republican Party came to power in 1801, which opposed the Federalist Party of Hamilton and Washington.|$|E
