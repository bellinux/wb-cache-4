40|$|A {{large amount}} of fine {{granular}} materials (< 6 mm) are produced during the mining of oil shale. The combustion characteristics of oil shale improve with decreasing size of these materials, for which reason fine-grain oil shale has a high utility value. However, fine oil shale also contains {{a significant amount of}} inorganic mineral impurities which can be reduced by physical separation to improve the oil quality. Based on an analysis of the physical properties of oil shale, this paper proposes a compound dry separation process for the cleaning of < 6 mm oil shale grains.

Theoretical solutions based on various physics are derived and compared with experimental results to determine how air modifies the vibrational behavior of structures. This work may help in determining the characteristics of structural vibrations – from acoustic behavior to earthquake response - in practical buildings. The work consists of several primary components: derivation of theories that predict {{the effect of}} air on structural vibrations and vice-versa, design of experiments, and determination {{of the importance of}} air in structural vibrations and the applicability of different physics under various vibrational frequencies. Two types of physics - acoustic theory and fluid dynamics theory - are applied to derive solutions for damping ratios of air. Experiments such as an unbaffled plate experiment, a pendulum experiment and a baffled plate experiment are designed and conducted to observe the damping effect of air. Experimental results illustrate the applicability of the theories. Finite element analysis is performed to provide a computational basis with which to compare the observed vibrational frequencies. The main question in this research is whether air has a great effect on structural vibrations. The results show that air has a damping effect on vibrating buildings that can be important under certain conditions. The results also reveal that when calculating the damping effects due to air, different physics should be applied under different <b>vibrational</b> <b>conditions.</b> A dimensionless factor is derived to determine under which regimes acoustic theory is applicable, and under which regimes fluid dynamics theory is applicable.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of measurement uncertainties is an elementary {{requirement for the}} proper assessment of product-quality and for controlling production processes. Furthermore, the determination of measurement uncertainties is essential to ensure the comparability {{with other types of}} metrological instruments. Interferometers are amongst the most precise metrological instruments used by today's industry. But in the case of interferometers {{it is difficult to determine}} all possible error-sources and to quantitatively estimate their contribution to the measurement uncertainty. An approach to a systematic assessment of interferometer-errors and their effects on a specific measurement is the simulation of interferometric measurements in a virtual environment. For this reason a simulation tool, the so called virtual interferometer, had been developed which is completely based on non-sequential raytracing. The virtual interferometer allows simulation of interferometrical measurements under accurately specified and, thus, perfectly known conditions, helping to provide very detailed information on the measurement uncertainty. Monte Carlo analysis is a very effective method for studying complex systems with many degrees of freedom. In this work this method was used e. g. to quantitatively determine the influence of a misaligned optical interferometer setup. The Monte Carlo method was also used to analyse the effect of vibration on the phaseshift procedure which is used for interferogram evaluation. It was shown that the measurement error not only is affected by the <b>vibrational</b> <b>conditions</b> but also by the integration time of the CCD detector. Furthermore the measurement error is strongly influenced by the electronic characteristics of the CCD detector and the phaseshift algorithms used. Some error influences, however, like environmental changes, can not be modelled by conventional optical simulation.

In this work, a model for the non-LTE state distribution of NO has been developed. It calculates the state populations of vibrational, rotational, and spin orbit degrees of freedom in an atmospheric altitude region from 0 to 200 km. All known processes affecting the non-LTE state distribution of NO have been considered. Apart from the interaction with the atmospheric radiative field these are a) vibrational transitions due to collisions of NO with atomic and molecular oxygen (VV- and VT-processes), b) rotational transitions due to the collision processes NO-N_ 2, NO-O_ 2, and NO-O (RT-processes), c) chemical production of NO by the NO_ 2 photolysis in the stratosphere, and d) chemical production of NO by the reaction N+O_ 2 #->#NO+O in the thermosphere.

40|$|Laser-induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) is {{a powerful}} optical emission analytical tool capable of sampling solids, liquids and gases for research and industrial applications[1]. A pulsed high-power laser is used to ablate {{a piece of the}} sample and excite it till plasma state. The optical emission from the relaxation of excited species within the plasma yields information regarding the composition of the material under test. Moreover, LIBS enables the study of some parameters regarding the fundamental point of view: electron temperature Te and number density Ne. This is feasible since some assumptions can be made, such as the existence of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions and optically thin plasma. Even though the plasma parameters rapidly change during the measurement time due to its expansion, the plasmas fulfil LTE conditions. In this communication we report some results on wavelength and time resolved measurements of the optical emissions in a plasma induced by both, Nd-Yag and CO 2 pulsed-laser on the target surface of an aluminium 2024 alloy.

Some important differences in the obtained spectra are observed because of different characteristics between Nd-Yag and CO 2 pulsed laser. The plasma spectrum obtained using CO 2 laser shows more lines, due to ionic species, than the plasma spectrum obtained using Nd-Yag laser.

The {{results of the}} MM 2 and MM+ methods, {{based on the same}} force field, differ insignificantly. The barriers between conformers appear to be exaggerated by the molecular mechanics methods, particularly MM 2. Contour maps showing the groundstate energy {{as a function of the}} full range of two backbone SiSiSiSi dihedral angles, with all other geometrical variables optimized, computed by each of the methods (only a limited range of angles near the anti,anti geometry in the case of HF/ 3 - 21 G*) are compared with each other and with analogous results for a model compound, Si 4 Me 10. Conformer interconversion paths are discussed, and two meso transition states for enantiomer interconversion have been located at the HF/ 3 - 21 G* level of calculation. At the eight HF/ 3 - 21 G* optimized geometries, single-point energies (HF/ 6 - 31 G* and MP 2 / 6 - 31 G*) and vibrational frequencies (HF/ 3 - 21 G*) were computed. The predicted IR and Raman spectra suggest that about half of the expected conformers will be identifiable by <b>vibrational</b> spectroscopy under <b>conditions</b> of matrix isolation. Relative conformer energies calculated by the MM 2 and HF methods are similar and favor the anti dihedral angles over gauche and ortho, in agreement with results of solution experiments. Those calculated by the hIM 3 and HF methods are similar to each other and favor both anti and gauche dihedral angles nearly equally over ortho, in agreement with indications provided by gas-phase experiments. A rationalization of these solvent effects is proposed. The energies of the conformers of Si 4 Me 10 and Si 3 Me 12 were used to set up a system of additive increments at the MM 2, MM 3, HF/ 3 - 21 G*, HF/ 6 - 31 G*, and MP 2 / 6 - 31 G* levels of calculation, which can be used to predict conformational energies of longer permethylated oligosilanes. An intrinsic energy value is assigned to each of the a, o, and g dihedral angles, and interaction energy values are assigned to each combination of two dihedral angles.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{the use of}} plasmas in {{chemical}} processes has increased significantly. Especially in non thermal plasmas, chemical processes can be run with high reactivity (i. e. high reaction rate coefficients), without spending much energy on (translational) heating of the gas. For this reason, plasma chemistry can offer an energy efficient option for inducing or assisting chemical reactions. The dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) is a plasma chemical reactor configuration which is widely used, since it offers a convenient and cost-effective way for creating a non thermal plasma. Vibrational excitation and gas temperature (translational excitation) have a large influence on rate coefficients and the energy efficiency of plasma chemical reactions. Therefore, vibrational excitation and gas temperature of a nitrogen plasma, generated in a DBD reactor, are investigated {{in a wide range}} of the available process variables, namely applied voltage amplitude, pressure and residence time. Also the specific energy input and the reduced electric field, two other relevant plasma parameters in a DBD reactor, are determined as a function of these process variables in order to find possible correlations with vibrational excitation. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is used to determine vibrational excitation and gas temperature (translational temperature) of nitrogen molecules in the plasma and to estimate the reduced electric field in the plasma, an important parameter for all gas discharges. Current-voltage (I-U) measurements are performed to determine the specific energy coupled into the plasma, an important parameter regarding the energy efficiency of a chemical process, and to obtain a second estimate for the reduced electric field. The latter diagnostic is also used for a thorough electrical characterization of the gas discharge. From this characterization, the capacitances of the dielectric barriers and the discharge gap are determined, together with the voltage across the discharge gap, both averaged over the discharge phase and as a function of time. The capacitances of the dielectric barriers and the discharge gap correspond to theoretically calculated values. Contrary to a common assumption, the voltage across the discharge gap is not found to be constant during the discharge phase. From the same analysis, the effect of residual charge in a nitrogen DBD is observed. By comparing two methods for determining the voltage across the discharge gap, the possible effect of charge accumulation in a discharge filament is observed. Both methods for determining the reduced electric field yield similar values, though the trends are not identical. Under all <b>conditions,</b> <b>vibrational</b> excitation is found to be in Boltzmann equilibrium, making it possible to assign a vibrational temperature to each operating condition, ranging 2100 - 3200 K. Gas temperatures are found in the range of 340 - 650 K. The vibrational temperature is found to be positively correlated with the specific energy input (ranging 0. 24 - 64 kJ per standard liter) and negatively correlated with the reduced electric field (340 - 530 Td, OES based values) which suggests that a high specific energy input and a low reduced electric field are beneficial for rate coefficients and the energy efficiency of a plasma chemical process in a nitrogen DBD. No conclusive scaling parameter for vibrational temperature is found in this work. For a pure nitrogen plasma, generated in a DBD reactor, the highest rate coefficients may be expected for high values of the applied voltage amplitude and medium values for the residence time, while the highest energy efficiency may be expected at low pressures. In the past decades, the use of plasmas in chemical processes has increased significantly. Especially in non thermal plasmas, chemical processes can be run with high reactivity (i. e. high reaction rate coefficients), without spending much energy on (translational) heating of the gas. For this reason, plasma chemistry can offer an energy efficient option for inducing or assisting chemical reactions. The dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) is a plasma chemical reactor configuration which is widely used, since it offers a convenient and cost-effective way for creating a non thermal plasma. Vibrational excitation and gas temperature (translational excitation) have a large influence on rate coefficients and the energy efficiency of plasma chemical reactions. Therefore, vibrational excitation and gas temperature of a nitrogen plasma, generated in a DBD reactor, are investigated {{in a wide range of}} the available process variables, namely applied voltage amplitude, pressure and residence time. Also the specific energy input and the reduced electric field, two other relevant plasma parameters in a DBD reactor, are determined as a function of these process variables in order to find possible correlations with vibrational excitation. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) is used to determine vibrational excitation and gas temperature (translational temperature) of nitrogen molecules in the plasma and to estimate the reduced electric field in the plasma, an important parameter for all gas discharges. Current-voltage (I-U) measurements are performed to determine the specific energy coupled into the plasma, an important parameter regarding the energy efficiency of a chemical process, and to obtain a second estimate for the reduced electric field. The latter diagnostic is also used for a thorough electrical characterization of the gas discharge. From this characterization, the capacitances of the dielectric barriers and the discharge gap are determined, together with the voltage across the discharge gap, both averaged over the discharge phase and as a function of time. The capacitances of the dielectric barriers and the discharge gap correspond to theoretically calculated values. Contrary to a common assumption, the voltage across the discharge gap is not found to be constant during the discharge phase. From the same analysis, the effect of residual charge in a nitrogen DBD is observed. By comparing two methods for determining the voltage across the discharge gap, the possible effect of charge accumulation in a discharge filament is observed. Both methods for determining the reduced electric field yield similar values, though the trends are not identical. Under all <b>conditions,</b> <b>vibrational</b> excitation is found to be in Boltzmann equilibrium, making it possible to assign a vibrational temperature to each operating condition, ranging 2100 - 3200 K. Gas temperatures are found in the range of 340 - 650 K. The vibrational temperature is found to be positively correlated with the specific energy input (ranging 0. 24 - 64 kJ per standard liter) and negatively correlated with the reduced electric field (340 - 530 Td, OES based values) which suggests that a high specific energy input and a low reduced electric field are beneficial for rate coefficients and the energy efficiency of a plasma chemical process in a nitrogen DBD. No conclusive scaling parameter for vibrational temperature is found in this work. For a pure nitrogen plasma, generated in a DBD reactor, the highest rate coefficients may be expected for high values of the applied voltage amplitude and medium values for the residence time, while the highest energy efficiency may be expected at low pressures...|$|R
