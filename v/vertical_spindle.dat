25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is one of}} the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore {{processing}} plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle</b> and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle</b> to gyrate. The <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle</b> is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.|$|E
500|$|Things did improve for Churchill-Redman and {{the sales}} rose {{dramatically}} from £200,000 in 1946 to £1M by 1955. This {{was in part}} because of innovative product development at the Halifax site which ultimately produced the CR P5 and P6 profiling lathes: the conclusion of this development is described by Jeremy as being a range of [...] "fully automatic, multi-tool and profiling lathes. A lathe with an automatic feed and delivery heralded an automatic machine tool production line." [...] The expansion of the motor vehicle industry once again was a significant factor, driving demand for machine tools much as the bicycling boom of the 1890s had done. In 1957 the Scotswood operation moved across the River Tyne to Blaydon, where a factory was built especially for the manufacturing purpose intended. Among other products from that site was the Vertimax lathe, which used a <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle</b> and was of interest to motor vehicle manufacturers. This particular design originated from James Anderson, a garage owner in Glasgow, during the war and whose business was brought into the Churchill group of companies. Churchill Gear Machines Ltd was part of the group, having been established in Blaydon since 1956: the cause of its origin and the nature of its products is uncertain.|$|E

The company also produced heavy horizontal milling machines, as well as a small vertical milling machine for tool and die work.|$|R
40|$|The {{ice cover}} in high {{mountain}} lakes breaks up and disappears {{in about an}} hour, {{in part because it}} has been divided into fragile <b>vertical</b> <b>spindles,</b> which are individual crystals. Contributing to this process are vertical holes in the ice remaining after particles of dust melt downward as they are warmed by the sun. Temperature profiles of lakes in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming include those of five lakes in the high wilderness. All are isothermal at or near 5 °C below a depth of 20 to 30 m, regardless of elevation or lake depth. Large lakes have a deeper mixed layer than do small ones because of longer fetch and thus more effective wind shear...|$|R
2500|$|The Brandon {{site was}} finally {{abandoned}} in the 1950s. The White House drain, which supplied it, had become steadily deeper as the land surface had sunk, and the soil through which it ran was unstable, requiring regular maintenance to prevent slippage. The pumping station was effectively {{on top of a}} hill, rather than being at the lowest part of the Fen, and so a decision was taken to construct a new pumping station at Whitehall on the River Great Ouse, which required the construction of [...] of main pumping drain, to connect it to the existing drains. Two [...] electric motors with <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle</b> axial flow pumps were supplied by W. H. Allen Sons and Company Ltd, and the station was opened on 10 September 1958.|$|E
2500|$|The Lark Engine {{pumping station}} was {{upgraded}} again in 1974. The Blackstone engine was retired but kept intact {{as part of}} the history of the district, the Crossley engine became the standby, and the Crossley enginehouse was extended to allow the installation of a [...] Dorman diesel engine, which drives a [...] Allen Gwynne <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle</b> pump. The work included the provision of a wooden plaque, showing all of the engines which had been installed since the opening of the station in 1842, which was unveiled by Mrs F. G. Starling at the formal opening held on 25 May 1976. Further improvements followed, when negotiations with British Rail resulted in the skew bridge, which carried the Ely to Norwich line over the main drain being demolished and replaced by a culvert. This action allowed the main pumping drain to the Lark Engine to be made deeper and wider, improving flows between the two halves of Burnt Fen.|$|E
2500|$|Koehler's design had {{the further}} {{advantage}} of absorbing the recoil caused by firing the gun. Ordinary carriages had no mechanism to absorb this recoil. The entire gun and mount would jump violently, causing the gun crew {{to have to}} reposition it before they could fire the next shot. Koehler's carriage mounted the gun on a sliding bed attached to {{the main body of}} the carriage via a <b>vertical</b> <b>spindle.</b> Firing the cannon forced the bed to slide upwards, rather than making the entire carriage recoil. As an eyewitness, John Drinkwater, noted, [...] "the carriage, when the gun was depressed, seldom moved; the gun sliding upon the plank to which it was attached by the spindle, and returning to its former place with the most trifling assistance." [...] This system was a forerunner of the recoil systems that are standard features of modern artillery pieces. The gun could be reversed on the carriage and fired upwards at angles of up to 45°, though according to Drinkwater [...] "in that state [...] did not particularly excel." [...] The design also enabled gunners to reload the cannon without exposing themselves to enemy fire, by rotating the sliding bed sideways.|$|E

40|$|Neurons in the {{mammalian}} neocortex {{arise from}} asymmetric divisions of progenitors {{residing in the}} ventricular zone. While in most progenitor divisions, the mitotic spindle {{is parallel to the}} ventricular surface, some progenitors reorient the spindle and divide in oblique orientations. Here, we use conditional deletion and overexpression of mouse Inscuteable (mInsc) to analyze the relevance of spindle reorientation in cortical progenitors. Mutating mInsc almost abolishes oblique and <b>vertical</b> mitotic <b>spindles,</b> while mInsc overexpression has the opposite effect. Our data suggest that oblique divisions are essential for generating the correct numbers of neurons in all cortical layers. Using clonal analysis, we demonstrate that spindle orientation affects the rate of indirect neurogenesis, a process where progenitors give rise to basal progenitors, which in turn divide symmetrically into two differentiating neurons. Our results indicate that the orientation of progenitor cell divisions is important for correct lineage specification in the developing mammalian brain...|$|R

50|$|The {{choice between}} <b>vertical</b> and {{horizontal}} <b>spindle</b> orientation in milling machine design usually {{hinges on the}} shape and size of a workpiece {{and the number of}} sides of the workpiece that require machining. Work in which the spindle's axial movement is normal to one plane, with an endmill as the cutter, lends itself to a vertical mill, where the operator can stand before the machine and have easy access to the cutting action by looking down upon it. Thus vertical mills are most favored for diesinking work (machining a mould into a block of metal). Heavier and longer workpieces lend themselves to placement on the table of a horizontal mill.|$|R

40|$|The cornea of {{the human}} eye is cooled by the {{surrounding}} air and by evaporation of the tear film. The temperature difference between the cornea and the iris (at core body temperature), causes circulation of the aqueous humor in the anterior chamber of the eye. Others {{have suggested that the}} circulation pattern governs the shape of the Krukenberg <b>spindle,</b> a distinctive <b>vertical</b> band of pigment on the posterior cornea surface in some pathologies. We modeled aqueous humor flow the human eye, treating the humor as a Boussinesq fluid and setting the corneal temperature based on infrared surface temperature measurements. The model predicts convection currents in the anterior chamber with velocities comparable to those resulting from forced flow through the gap between the iris and lens. When paths of pigment particles are calculated based on the predicted flow field, the particles circulate throughout the anterior chamber but tend to be near the vertical centerline of the eye for a greatest period of time. Further, the particles are usually in close proximity to the cornea only when they are near the vertical centerline. We conclude that the convective flow pattern of aqueous humor is consistent with a <b>vertical</b> pigment <b>spindle.</b> 3 Introductio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Machining {{of metals}} is {{generally}} {{accompanied by a}} violent relative vibration between work and tool, known as chatter. Chatter is undesirable due to its adverse effects on product quality, operation cost, machining accuracy, tool life, and productivity. This paper presents an innovative approach to chatter control during end milling of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using ferrite permanent magnets to reduce the unwanted vibrations. A special fixture was fabricated and mounted on a <b>Vertical</b> Machining Center‘s <b>spindle</b> for holding the permanent magnet bars, used in suppressing the vibration amplitudes. DASY Lab 5. 6 was used for signal analysis and processing to compare the intensity of chatter under normal and magnet application conditions. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was subsequently used to transform the vibration data to a function of frequency domain. The experiments focused on monitoring the vibration amplitudes and analysis of chip formation process during metal cutting. It was observed that the magnetic fields contributed to reduction of chatter amplitudes. It was apparent that a reduction of chatter amplitude would result in improved surface finish of the work-piece and lead to uniform chip formation...|$|R

To gain insight into the optimized configuration of the <b>vertical</b> columns and <b>spindle</b> head stock, the static and dynamic characteristics of the machine models with cast iron and granite composites were predicted for comparison. With this, evaluations of the machine with different design were made to examine the experimental measurements on the prototype machine.

The scoop wheel lifted 71.45 tons per minute through 9.78 ft, with the engine indicating that it was developing , while the newer installation was developing , and raised 75.93 tons per minute through 10.84 ft. Efficiency was calculated as 46 per cent for the scoop wheel and 52.79 per cent for the centrifugal pump. The most significant difference was the coal consumption, which was reduced from 11.64 lb per hour to 6.66 lb per hour for the newer system.|$|E
50|$|In modern machines, the gantry type {{superstructure}} has {{two legs}} {{and is often}} called a bridge. This moves freely along the granite table with one leg (often {{referred to as the}} inside leg) following a guide rail attached {{to one side of the}} granite table. The opposite leg (often outside leg) simply rests on the granite table following the vertical surface contour. Air bearings are the chosen method for ensuring friction free travel. In these, compressed air is forced through a series of very small holes in a flat bearing surface to provide a smooth but controlled air cushion on which the CMM can move in a frictionless manner. The movement of the bridge or gantry along the granite table forms one axis of the XY plane. The bridge of the gantry contains a carriage which traverses between the inside and outside legs and forms the other X or Y horizontal axis. The third axis of movement (Z axis) is provided by the addition of a <b>vertical</b> quill or <b>spindle</b> which moves up and down through the center of the carriage. The touch probe forms the sensing device on the end of the quill. The movement of the X, Y and Z axes fully describes the measuring envelope. Optional rotary tables can be used to enhance the approachability of the measuring probe to complicated workpieces. The rotary table as a fourth drive axis does not enhance the measuring dimensions, which remain 3D, but it does provide a degree of flexibility. Some touch probes are themselves powered rotary devices with the probe tip able to swivel vertically through 90 degrees and through a full 360 degree rotation.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe demand for higher productivity and improved quality of the machined surfaces requires spindle designers to aim for higher spindle speeds and feed rates. For instance, in routing of non-ferrous metals, wood and plastics, spindle speeds {{of the order of}} 60, 000 rpm have been achieved with the help of better assembly aiming for higher operational accuracy, and increased component quality. The limitations on attainable speeds and quality of surface finish are partly governed by rolling element bearing vibrations. Dynamic performance of a rolling bearing has been of considerable interest. Although fatigue life is sometimes a significant parameter, it has been fairly well established {{that in the case of}} many practical applications, bearing failure is caused by dynamic instability in the motion of the rolling elements. Ball bearings are widely used for high speed spindles, where high speeds, high temperatures, and heavy load/forces are encountered, because they offer low friction, appropriate stiffness characteristics and minimum starting torque. Dynamic stiffness of a bearing is very important characteristic in bearing design for achieving precise tolerances, which has been the concern of industry, especially wood machining industry. Due to poor machining the energy consumed in manufacturing better quality product is very high. Higher energy consumption and the time to carry out extra finishing processes is a major concern. This thesis provides a numerical model incorporating inertial dynamics of <b>vertical</b> routing <b>spindle</b> with five degrees of freedom simulating an existing routing spindle, which can run at speeds up to 60, 000 rpm (Le. 2. 4 million DN). An experimental rig is also devised to investigate the vibration spectra the high speed precision 7. 5 kW power routing spindle. The vibrations generated in the high speed precision spindles have amplitudes in the order of microns. Fine measurement of spindle vibration characteristics are carried out using laser vibrometry. Use of this technique is quite novel for high speed applications, with precise resolution of rigid body motions with fine alignment of a single laser beam with respect to an optically smooth surface of a specially designed tool held in the spindle collet. The experimental spectra are compared with the numerical model predictions with very good agreement.. Numerical model for grease lubrication· capable of solving thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication of rough surfaces with combined entraining and squeeze motions is developed. For this a modified Reynolds equation is derived from basic principles considering grease as a Bingham solid using the Herschel Bulkley flow model.
