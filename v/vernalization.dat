25|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of <b>vernalization</b> before flowering. This decision is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals. In Arabidopsis thaliana it is known that genes like CONSTANS (CO), FRIGIDA, Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) integrate the environmental signals and initiate the flower development pathway. Allelic variation in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes that grow in the cold temperate regions require prolonged <b>vernalization</b> before they flower, while the tropical varieties and common lab strains, do not. Much of this variation is due to mutations in the FLC and FRIGIDA genes, rendering them non-functional.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} signals that {{regulate}} the molecular biology of the process. The following three genes in Arabidopsis thaliana possess both common and independent functions in floral transition: FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), LEAFY (LFY), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1, also called AGAMOUS-LIKE20). SOC1 is a MADS-box-type gene, which integrates responses to photoperiod, <b>vernalization</b> and gibberellins.|$|E
25|$|More {{favourable}} {{effects on}} yield tend to depend {{to a large}} extent on realization of the potentially beneficial effects of carbon dioxide on crop growth and increase of efficiency in water use. Decrease in potential yields is likely to be caused by shortening of the growing period, decrease in water availability and poor <b>vernalization.</b>|$|E
500|$|Cabbage is {{generally}} grown for its densely leaved heads, produced {{during the first}} year of its biennial cycle. Plants perform best when grown in well-drained soil in a location that receives full sun. Different varieties prefer different soil types, ranging from lighter sand to heavier clay, but all prefer fertile ground with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. For optimal growth, there must be adequate levels of nitrogen in the soil, especially during the early head formation stage, and sufficient phosphorus and potassium during the early stages of expansion of the outer leaves. Temperatures between [...] prompt the best growth, and extended periods of higher or lower temperatures may result in premature bolting (flowering). Flowering induced by periods of low temperatures (a process called <b>vernalization)</b> only occurs if the plant is past the juvenile period. The transition from a juvenile to adult state happens when the stem diameter is about [...] <b>Vernalization</b> allows the plant to grow to an adequate size before flowering. In certain climates, cabbage can be planted at the beginning of the cold period and survive until a later warm period without being induced to flower, a practice that was common in the eastern US.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{flowering}} plants use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed photoperiodism. Broadly speaking, {{flowering plants}} {{can be classified}} as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. [...] Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity (<b>vernalization)</b> instead.|$|E
2500|$|Temperature [...] affects {{cellular}} metabolic {{and growth}} rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds {{from the same}} plant germinate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) , while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). [...] Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (<b>vernalization)</b> to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. [...] For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination [...] Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family Ranunculaceae and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>vernalization</b> also {{occurs in}} flc mutants (lacking FLC), <b>vernalization</b> must also {{activate}} a non-FLC pathway. A day-length mechanism is also important.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vernalization</b> (from Latin vernus, [...] "of the spring") is the {{induction}} of a plant's flowering process {{by exposure to}} the prolonged cold of winter, or by an artificial equivalent. After <b>vernalization,</b> plants have acquired the ability to flower, but they may require additional seasonal cues or weeks of growth before they will actually flower. <b>Vernalization</b> is sometimes {{used to refer to}} herbal (non-woody) plants requiring a cold dormancy to produce new shoots and leaves but this usage is discouraged.|$|E

50|$|Biologically, the {{chilling}} requirement {{is a way}} of ensuring that <b>vernalization</b> occurs.|$|E
50|$|Many plants {{grown in}} {{temperate}} climates require <b>vernalization</b> and must experience {{a period of}} low winter temperature to initiate or accelerate the flowering process. This ensures that reproductive development and seed production occurs in spring and summer, rather than in autumn. The needed cold is often expressed in chill hours. Typical <b>vernalization</b> temperatures are between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius (40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit).|$|E
5000|$|At the {{molecular}} level, flowering is repressed by the protein Flowering Locus C (FLC), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering. Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active {{copy of the}} gene FRIGIDA (FRI), which promotes FLC expression, thus repression of flowering. Prolonged exposure to cold (<b>vernalization)</b> induces expression of <b>VERNALIZATION</b> INSENSTIVE3, which interacts with the VERNALIZATION2 polycomb-like complex to reduce FLC expression through chromatin remodeling. [...] The epigenetic silencing of FLC by chromatin remodeling is also thought to involve the cold-induced expression of antisense FLC COOLAIR or COLDAIR transcripts. <b>Vernalization</b> is registered by the plant by the stable silencing of individual FLC loci. The removal of silent chromatin marks at FLC during embryogenesis prevents the inheritance of the vernalized state ...|$|E

The acceleration of flowering by prolonged cold is a classic epigenetic process called <b>vernalization.</b> The study of this and parallel genetic pathways has led us into the dissection of conserved chromatin silencing mechanisms involving non-coding RNAs.Our recent work has focused on a mechanistic understanding of <b>vernalization</b> and on the pathways that determine a requirement for <b>vernalization.</b> These pathways converge on a gene that encodes a floral repressor called FLC. We analyse how these pathways intersect during development, in different environmental conditions, and through evolution. This takes us into the analysis of what regulates reproductive strategy in plants. We use Arabidopsis as a reference to establish the regulatory hierarchy and then translate our findings into other species." ...|$|E
50|$|Winter {{varieties}} do not flower until springtime {{because they}} require vernalization: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for <b>vernalization</b> or exceed the hardiness {{of the crop}} (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without <b>vernalization.</b> Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to plant}} {{flowering}} requiring the successful co-operation of several metabolic pathways, computer models that incorporate <b>vernalization</b> {{have also been}} made.|$|E
50|$|Lysenko's 1928 {{paper on}} <b>vernalization</b> and plant {{physiology}} drew wide attention {{due to its}} practical consequences for Russian agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring. Later however, Lysenko inaccurately asserted that the vernalized state could be inherited, i.e. the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require <b>vernalization</b> in order to flower quickly.|$|E
50|$|In winter annual Arabidopsis, <b>vernalization</b> of the {{meristem}} {{appears to}} confer competence {{to respond to}} floral inductive signals. A vernalized meristem retains competence {{for as long as}} 300 days {{in the absence of an}} inductive signal.|$|E
50|$|Lithodora diffusa is hardy in USDA zones 6 - 8, {{and should}} be planted in full sun to partial shade. It needs a well drained soil, as it is {{susceptible}} to root rot. It requires <b>vernalization</b> to flower.|$|E
5000|$|Arabidopsis thaliana ("thale cress") is a much-studied {{model for}} <b>vernalization.</b> Some {{ecotypes}} (varieties), called [...] "winter annuals", have delayed flowering without vernalization; others ("summer annuals") do not. The genes that underlie {{this difference in}} plant physiology have been intensively studied.|$|E
50|$|Lysenko {{presented}} {{himself as a}} follower of Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin, a well-known and well-liked Soviet horticulturist. However, unlike Michurin, he advocated a form of Lamarckism, insisting on using only hybridization and grafting, as non-genetic techniques. With this came, most importantly, the implication that acquired characteristics of an organism—for example, the state of being leafless {{as a result of}} having been plucked—could be inherited by that organism's descendants. This is why Lysenko claimed <b>vernalization</b> would give greater productivity than it did; he believed the ability of his vernalized seeds to flower faster and produce more wheat would be passed on to the next generation of wheat seeds, thus causing <b>vernalization</b> to further amplify the process.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, Trofim Lysenko, a {{previously}} unknown agronomist, {{claimed to have}} developed an agricultural technique, termed <b>vernalization,</b> which tripled or quadrupled crop yield by exposing wheat seed to high humidity and low temperature. While cold and moisture exposure are {{a normal part of}} the life cycle of autumn-seeded winter cereals, the <b>vernalization</b> technique claimed to increase yields by increasing the intensity of exposure, in some cases planting soaked seeds directly into the snow cover of frozen fields. In reality, the technique was neither new (it had been known since 1854, and was extensively studied during the previous twenty years), nor did it produce the yields he promised, although some increase in production did occur.|$|E
5000|$|So-called [...] "facultative" [...] wheat {{varieties}} need shorter {{periods of}} <b>vernalization</b> time (15 - 30 days) and temperatures of 3° to 15 °C (37-59 °F). In many areas facultative varieties {{can be grown}} either as winter or as a spring, depending on time of sowing.|$|E
50|$|Another floral {{feature that}} has been a subject of natural {{selection}} is flowering time. Some plants flower early in their life cycle, others require a period of <b>vernalization</b> before flowering. This outcome is based on factors like temperature, light intensity, presence of pollinators and other environmental signals: genes like CONSTANS (CO), Flowering Locus C (FLC) and FRIGIDA regulate integration of environmental signals into the pathway for flower development. Variations in these loci have been associated with flowering time variations between plants. For example, Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes that grow in the cold, temperate regions require prolonged <b>vernalization</b> before they flower, while the tropical varieties, and the most common lab strains, don't. This variation is due to mutations in the FLC and FRIGIDA genes, rendering them non-functional.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, {{many plants}} may {{survive in a}} {{locality}} but will not flower if the day length is insufficient or if they require <b>vernalization</b> (a particular duration of low temperature). With annuals, the time of planting can often be adjusted to allow growth beyond their normal geographical range.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} to devernalize a plant by exposure to high temperatures subsequent to <b>vernalization.</b> For example, commercial onion growers store sets at low temperatures, but devernalize them before planting, because they want the plant's energy to go into enlarging its bulb (underground stem), not making flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Gustav Gassner (born January 17, 1881 in Berlin; died 5 February 5, 1955 in Lüneburg) was a German {{botanist}} {{and plant}} pathologist whose 1918 paper on <b>vernalization</b> {{has been called}} [...] "the first systematic study of temperature {{as a factor in}} the developmental physiology of plants." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{reproductive}} {{phase change}} of A. thaliana occurs by {{a sequence of}} two related events: first, the bolting transition (flower stalk elongates), then the floral transition (first flower appears). [...] Bolting is a robust predictor of flower formation, and hence a good indicator for <b>vernalization</b> research.|$|E
50|$|Polycomb-group {{proteins}} also {{intervene in}} the control of flowering by silencing the Flowering Locus C gene. This gene is {{a central part of}} the pathway that inhibits flowering in plants and its silencing during winter is suspected {{to be one of the}} main factors intervening in plant <b>vernalization.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is a {{threatened}} {{species in the}} wild, but it is amenable to cultivation.It can be grown as a cold hardy garden plant, needing <b>vernalization</b> (a period of cold weather) in order to flower. As a garden plant, it will bloom in late January or early February at low altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Wild Arabidopsis {{plants have}} {{different}} alleles for the FLC gene, which correspond to ecotypes which either (a) flower rapidly {{and produce a}} number of generations during one summer (summer-annual), or (b) flower only after <b>vernalization</b> (winter-annual or late-flowering). This kind of variation can also be provided by variation in the FRIGIDA (FRI) gene.|$|E
