50|$|In dentistry, a veneer is a {{layer of}} {{material}} placed over a tooth, veneers improve the aesthetics of a smile or and protect the tooth's surface from damage. There are two main types of material used to fabricate a veneer: composite and dental porcelain. A composite veneer may be directly placed (built-up in the mouth), or indirectly fabricated by a dental technician in a dental lab, and later bonded to the tooth, typically using a resin cement such as Panavia. In contrast, a porcelain veneer may only be indirectly fabricated. Full <b>veneer</b> <b>crown</b> is described as “A restoration that covers all the coronal tooth surfaces (Mesial, Distal, Facial, Lingual and Occlusal)”. Laminate veneer, on the other hand, is a thin layer that covers only {{the surface of the}} tooth and generally used for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

The outline form of the lingual rest is a half moon shaped with a smooth curve from one marginal ridge to the other, crossing {{the center of the}} tooth. The rest seat itself should be V shaped, and the depth is 1 - 1 1 / 2 mm.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to screen {{patients}} with fixed prosthodontic appliances that were in oral cavity for a period of 5 years or more and to assess clinically and radiologically root caries, gingival recession, pocket formation, alveolar ridge resorption, as well as gingival (GI) and plaque index (PI). The aim also was to find out the differences between materials and constructions, between abutment and non-abutment teeth, and to find out the need for replacement. A total of 260 patients and their orthopantomograms were examined, with a total of 2, 265 teeth, 610 being bridge abutments and 246 being crowns. The most frequent were metal+ acrylic <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> or bridges. Root caries was found under the abutments in 10 – 20 %; however abutments with ceramic crowns had the lowest percentage of caries (p 0. 05). Although the worst findings were recorded for metal-+acrylic <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> for PI, no significant difference existed between crowns of different material or non-abutment teeth (p> 0. 05). There was statistically significant difference between abutments with metal + acrylic <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns,</b> full metal crowns, metal ceramic crowns and non-abutments for GI scores. Higher percentage of scores 0 and 1 was recorded for metal ceramic crowns and non-abutments and significantly higher percentage of scores 2 and 3 was recorded for metal + acrylic <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> and full metallic crowns.

40|$|Abstract: Tracking student {{performance}} in preclinical and clinical courses {{can be helpful}} in developing and refining a curriculum. Our objective was to correlate {{student performance}} on three fixed prosthodontic examinations taken by eighty junior dental students. Examinations included a knowledge-based objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), a manual skills exercise completed on a typodont (Typodont), and a competency casting exam (Casting CE) on a patient. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the OSCE and Typodont exam scores, as independent variables, were not statistically significant predictors (P= 0. 07; P= 0. 87, respectively) of Casting CE exam performance, which was the dependent variable. Correlations were weak for the OSCE (r= 0. 21) and nearly nonexistent for the Typodont exam(r= 0. 03) when compared to the Casting CE. Our results indicate a weak correlation between an OSCE-based knowledge exam measuring students ’ knowledge of critical errors in preparations and castings and a competency exam involving the preparation of a full <b>veneer</b> <b>crown.</b> Results also indicate virtually no correlation between a typodont preparation examination designed to provide a measure of students ’ clinical skill and a clinical competenc...|$|E

Materials and Methods A full <b>veneer</b> <b>crown</b> and an mesio-occluso-distal (MOD) inlay cavity, which were prepared on extracted human molars, were used as templates of epoxy resin replicas. The prepared teeth were scanned and CAD-CAM restorations were milled using Lava Ultimate (LU) and experimental nano-composite CAD/CAM blocks (EB) under the same milling parameters. To assess the marginal and internal fit, the restorations were cemented to replicas and were embedded in an acrylic mold for sectioning at 0. 5 mm intervals. The measured gap data were pooled according to the block types and measuring points for statistical analysis. Results Both the block type and measuring point significantly affected gap values, and their interaction was significant (p = 0. 000). In crowns and inlays made from the two blocks, gap values were significantly larger in the occlusal area than in the axial area, while gap values in the marginal area were smallest (p < 0. 001). Among the blocks, the restorations milled from EB had a significantly larger gap at all measuring points than those milled from LU (p = 0. 000). Conclusions The marginal and internal gaps of the two nano-composite CAD/CAM blocks differed according to the measuring points.

40|$|Introduction: A common {{procedure}} in esthetic dentistry is fabrication of metal-ceramic veneer crowns that have proper color match with the patient’s teeth. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare color reproduction of the selected color by dental practitioners in dental laboratories by technicians with and without academic education. Materials and methods: In this in vitro study a maxillary incisor from a dental model was prepared for a metal-ceramic <b>veneer</b> <b>crown.</b> After impression taking and making a standard framework, 36 impressions were taken for 36 laboratories and two standard metal frameworks were fabricated on each die. Two frameworks were sent to each laboratory. A 3 porcelain was requested to be placed on the standard frameworks and glazed. Each specimen was tested with Shadepilot equipment. a*, b* and L* color indexes and DE were determined at incisal, middle and cervical areas of each crown. T-test and linear regression were used for data analysis (α= 0. 05). Results: Means and standard deviations of DE of samples in the group without academic education at incisal, middle, and cervical areas were 3. 56 ± 1. 93, 2. 54 ± 2. 40, and in 3. 0 ± 1. 16, respectively; corresponding values in the group with academic education were 5. 6 ± 3. 19, 2. 11 ± 1. 02, and 21. 18 ± 0. 72, respectively. T-test showed significant differences in DE of incisal areas between the two groups (P= 0. 003), with no significant differences in other areas. Conclusion: In this study, there was a significant relationship between job experience and color match accuracy in the incisal region, indicating that technicians with more job, but with no academic education, exhibit more accuracy in reconstructing incisal edge color of metal-ceramic veneer crowns.

40|$|Dental alloys, {{and later}} zirconia, {{have been used}} in {{dentistry}} as frameworks for many years in making <b>crowns</b> and bridges <b>veneered</b> with ceramic e. g. feldspathic porcelain. Such methods of restoring teeth have been extensively studied both in the laboratory and clinically. Although such substructures have excellent strength there remains a large properties mismatch between these materials and bone or dentine e. g. elasticity. Furthermore, other drawbacks have been documented such as possible allergies, colouring of alloy margins, veneer chipping and excessive wear to opposing natural dentition. Polyaryletherketone (PAEK) thermoplastic biomaterial polymers such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) have been successfully applied in different medical applications with the latter recently being introduced to dentistry as a restorative material. The material is called Pekkton® ivory (Cendres+Métaux, SA, Switzerland) and is proposed to be used for fabricating both monolithic and bi-layered structures veneered with indirect composite resin. The manufacturer recommends methods similar to well-established restorations such as alloy and ceramic based crowns which makes it a user friendly material for both dental clinics and laboratories. Furthermore, the material’s properties such as high strength, low elastic modulus close to that of dentine, high temperature, chemical, hydrolysis and wear resistance, makes it a promising material for the replacement of tooth material. There is little published data about this material and hence the aim of this research was to evaluate the manufacturing process, aesthetic properties, structural integrity and durability of bi-layered crowns made from PEKK based thermoplastic high performance polymer (Pekkton® ivory, Cendres+Métaux, SA) and veneered with indirect light cured composite (Vita VM LC, VITA Zahnfabrik H. Rauter GmbH & Co. KG, DE). The processing route for Pekkton® ivory is either via milling or hot-pressing and the procedures were compared. The polymer-based restoration was compared to equivalent zirconia and metal based bi-layered restoration systems veneered with either light cured composite resin or feldspathic porcelain. Optical properties of each crown system were compared using a UV and visible light spectrophotometer. Structural integrity was compared for each system by testing the fracture resistance of the crowns using a universal testing machine and durability was evaluated by testing the fatigue limit and fatigue life using a fatigue chewing apparatus. The research hypothesis is that the PEKK polymer as anunderlying substructure material will perform equivalently to metal and zirconia substructures when veneered with light cured composite in the aspects of optical properties, strength and durability. The outcome of the study established a pressing protocol for PEKK using a standard ceramic pressing furnace where the pressed samples showed no significant differences in the CIEL*a*b* colour values, hardness or biaxial flexural strength to those samples produced via milling. There was no significant optical difference between the systems compared, the study found no evidence of difference in the CIEL*a*b* colour value of PEKK, zirconia or metal based samples when veneered with the same composite veneer. However, zirconia based groups displayed greater translucency with the composite veneer and feldspathic porcelain veneer. The fracture resistance of the PEKK and metal composite <b>veneered</b> <b>crowns</b> showed to be comparable, whereas zirconia based crowns demonstrated significantly lower fracture resistance. The durability of the PEKK composite <b>veneered</b> <b>crowns</b> showed the highest fatigue limit in comparison to the zirconia and metal composite <b>veneered</b> <b>crowns.</b> Similarly they showed the highest survival rate in the fatigue life assessment under the same cyclic load. Furthermore, the fracture mode was significantly different than observed with the zirconia and metal based crowns. The conclusion was that this material is promising for use as a restorative material and that clinical evaluation should be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate, in-vitro, the shear bond {{strength}} (SBS) and the resultant failure pattern after debonding of metal orthodontic brackets bonded with TransbondTM XT adhesive resin cement and RelyXTM Unicem 2 self-adhesive resin cement to pre-treated (35 % ortho-phosphoric acid and silane coupling agent application) IPS eMax and porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crowns.</b> Material and methodology: A Typhodont maxillary lateral incisor was used and prepared in a conventional manner to receive a full ceramic crown. A CAD (computer aided design) / CAM (computer aided manufacturing) machine was used to scan the prepared tooth and manufacture 40 IPS eMax crowns and 40 porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crowns.</b> Half the number of IPS eMax crown specimens (ie. 20) and half the number of porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> specimens (ie. 20) were thermocycled (ie. to mimic thermal changes which occur in the mouth), from 5 to 55 o for 500 cycles as recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 6872, 2008). The remaining 20 IPS eMax crown specimens and 20 porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> specimens remained new and unexposed to thermal changes. The facial surfaces of all the thermocycled and non-thermocycled crown specimens were then etched. Etching of all the ceramic bonding surfaces was performed by the application of 35 per cent ortho-phosphoric acid liquid for 2 minutes, followed by a thin layer of a ceramic primer. A lateral incisor metal bracket with a bracket base area of 9 mm 2 (as confirmed by the manufacturer) was bonded to each of the etched and silane treated ceramic crown specimens and separated in the following manner: Group 1 : (10 thermocycled, etched and silane treated IPS eMax and 10 thermocycled, etched and silane treated porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> specimens) RelyX™ Unicem 2 self-adhesive resin cement was used to bond the bracket to the ceramic crown specimens, Group 2 : (10 thermocycled, etched and silane treated IPS eMax and 10 thermocycled, etched and silane treated porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> specimens) Transbond™ XT light cure adhesive primer was first applied onto the bonding surface of the crowns and then Transbond™ XT adhesive resin was used to bond the bracket to the ceramic crown specimens, Group 3 : (10 non-thermocycled, etched and silane treated IPS eMax and 10 non-thermocycled, etched and silane treated porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> specimens) RelyX™ Unicem 2 self-adhesive resin cement was used to bond the bracket to the ceramic crown specimens, Group 4 : (10 non-thermocycled, etched and silane treated IPS eMax and 10 non-thermocycled, etched and silane treated porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> specimens) Transbond™ XT light cure adhesive primer was first applied onto the bonding surface of the crowns and then Transbond™ XT adhesive resin cement was used to bond the bracket to the ceramic crown specimens. After bonding all samples were stored in distilled water for 24 hours before being submitted to the shear bond strength test. Debonding forces in Newtons (N) was determined by using a shear testing machine and converted into Mega Pascals (MPa). Results: The results after debonding were compared. The mean shear bond strength for RelyXTM Unicem 2 self-adhesive resin cement bonded to the all ceramic non-thermocycled crowns (Group 3) ranged from a low of 5. 1 MPa (45. 5 Newtons) when brackets were bonded to the IPS eMax crowns to a high of 5. 8 MPa (51. 9 Newtons) when brackets were bonded to the porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crowns.</b> The mean shear bond strength for Transbond XT adhesive resin cement bonded to the all ceramic non-thermocycled crowns (Group 4) ranged from a low of 6. 4 MPa (57. 3 Newtons) when brackets were bonded to the porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crowns</b> to a high of 8. 1 MPa (72. 7 Newtons) when brackets were bonded to the IPS eMax crowns. The side by side Box-and-Whisker plots of the shear bond strengths show wide and overlapping dispersions of the crown/adhesive resin combinations which consequently lessen the probability of significant differences between the crown/adhesive resin combinations in all 4 groups. According to the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0. 05), and the Bonferroni Test the non-thermocycled crown/adhesive resin combinations do not differ significantly. Study of the mean ARI (Adhesive Remnant Index) values for the non-thermocycled crown/adhesive combinations shows that brackets bonded with Rely-XTM Unicem 2 to non-thermocycled porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crowns</b> failed entirely at the ceramic/adhesive interface and for all the other non-thermocycled ceramic/adhesive combinations most of the failures of the bond (70 %) occurred at the bracket/adhesive interface, ie. cohesive fractures within the composite resin. No cohesive fractures of the porcelain crowns were noted. The results of the thermocycled groups (Group 1 and Group 2) show the TransbondTM XT/non-thermocycled IPS eMax crown combination yielded the highest overall mean shear bond strength of 8. 1 MPa (72. 7 Newtons) but dropped to a mean shear bond strength of 5. 1 MPa (46. 1 Newtons) (36. 4 % drop in shear bond strength) when the crowns were thermocycled prior to bonding. The TransbondTM XT/non-thermocycled porcelain veneerd zirconia crown combination yielded the second highest overall mean shear bond strength of 6. 4 MPa (57. 3 Newtons) and dropped to a mean shear bond strength of 5. 1 MPa (45. 8 Newtons) (19. 3 % drop in shear bond strength) when the crowns were thermocycled prior to bonding. The RelyXTM Unicem 2 /non-thermocycled porcelain <b>veneered</b> zirconia <b>crown</b> combination yielded the third highest overall mean shear bond strength of 5. 8 MPa (51. 9 Newtons) but dropped significantly to a mean shear bond strength of 3. 2 MPa (29. 1 Newtons) (a significant 43. 8 % drop in shear bond strength) when the crowns were thermocycled prior to bonding. Lastly, the RelyXTM Unicem 2 /non-thermocycled IPS eMax crown combination yielded the fourth highest mean shear bond strength of 5. 1 MPa (45. 5 Newtons) but dropped to a mean shear bond strength of 4. 9 MPa (44. 5 Newtons) (a drop in shear bond strength of only 3 %) when the crowns were thermocyled prior to bonding. Relaxing the significance level (p-value) somewhat demonstrates the negative influence of thermocycling on the shear bond strength of the crown/adhesive combinations. The non-thermocycled all ceramic crown/adhesive combinations showed mean ARI values of between 1. 3 and 2. 1 indicating cohesive fractures within the composite resin and efficient bonding of the adhesive material to the porcelain surface. However, all the thermocycled all ceramic crown/adhesive treatment combinations showed mean ARI values of between 0 and 0. 8 indicating a bond failure between adhesive and porcelain and highlighting the negative influence of thermocycling on bond strength of both adhesive resin cements. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that: 1. There was no significant difference in the shear bond strengths of metal orthodontic brackets bonded with RelyXTM Unicem 2 self-adhesive resin cement and metal orthodontic brackets bonded with TransbondTM XT adhesive resin cement to IPS eMax and porcelain-veneered zirconia crowns which were conditioned with 35 % phosphoric acid and a silane coupling agent. 2. Conditioning the porcelain surface with 35 % phosphoric acid and a silane coupling agent (which is safer to use than Hydrofluoric acid) is sufficient for bonding metal orthodontic brackets to all ceramic crowns, and should make it simpler for clinicians to remove the remaining adhesive from the porcelain surface after debonding. 3. The negative influence of thermocycling prior to bonding can be seen on shear bond strength values. 4. Most of the failures of the bond occurred at the ceramic/adhesive interface and cohesive fractures within the composite resin. No cohesive fractures of the porcelain crowns were noted...|$|R

Veneering-method groups included: 1. Hand-layered feldsparthic porcelain (VM=VitaVM 9,Vident) and fluorapatite glass-ceramic (CR=IPSe. maxCeram,IvoclarVivadent); 2. Pressed feldspathic porcelain (PM=VitaPM 9,Vident) and fluorapatite glass-ceramic (ZP=IPSe. maxZirPress,IvoclarVivadent); 3. CAD/CAM milled feldspathic ceramic (TF=VitablocsTriluxeForte,Vident) and lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (CAD=IPSe. maxCAD,IvoclarVivadent). CAD/CAM veneers were either cemented with resin cements (P=Panavia 21,KurarayDental), (R=RelyXUltimate, 3 M ESPE), (M=MultilinkAutomix,IvoclarVivadent) or fused with fusion glass-ceramic (C=CrystalConnect,IvoclarVivadent). A Three-point-bending test was performed. For group VM,PM,TF-M,TF-C,CAD-M,CAD-C, ten more bars were prepared and aged with cyclic loading and thermocycling before testing. Zirconia bars (PrettauZirconia,Zirkonzahn;inCorisTZI,Sirona;ZirluxFC,PentronCeramics) specimens were prepared and polished. The specimens were divided into 3 groups: control, self-glaze fired, and glazed groups. A Three-point bending test was performed. <b>Veneered</b> zirconia <b>crowns</b> were made. Feldspathic porcelain was applied to zirconia coping. Bevel cut on porcelain was made to simulate porcelain chipping. The crowns were then divided into 4 different groups according to repair materials including: 1. Conventional-resin composite (TetricEvoCeram,IvoclarVivadent) 2. Flowable-resin composite (G-aenialUniversalFlo,GCamerica) 3. Cemented CAD/CAM milled feldspathic ceramic (VitaTriluxForte,Vident) 4. Cemented CAD/CAM milled lithium-disilicate glass-ceramic (IPSe. maxCAD,IvoclarVivadent). Each crown underwent thermocycling. The test was performed by loading force on the center of repaired part to record load-to-failure. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the failure loads of non-aged bilayered veneer-zirconia bars. Aging experiment revealed a significant difference in failure load between non-aged and aged bars in groups VM and PM, but not in the groups with CAD/CAM milled veneers. There was significant influence of surface treatments on flexural strength of zirconia specimens. Post-hoc test showed that glazed group had significant lower flexural strength than other groups. Crowns repaired with CAD/CAM ceramics showed significant higher failure load than resin composite. Repairing with lithium-disilicate glass ceramic yielded the highest load-to-failure of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: -	Veneer materials, veneering methods, and cement materials have a significant effect on the failure load of bilayered veneer- zirconia.

A study was undertaken wherein, the shear bond strengths of metal and ceramic brackets on porcelain were compared {{and the effects of}} debonding on the debonded surfaces were evaluated. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 acrylic duplicate samples were fabricated from a therapeutically extracted maxillary first premolar, duly prepared for metal crown with porcelain facing. The samples were divided into two equal groups for bonding of metal and ceramic brackets. The shear bond strength of the samples was measured with a universal testing machine. Results: The metal brackets showed shear bond strengths with a mean of 12. 21 ± 1. 4 MPa, whereas the ceramic brackets displayed shear bond strengths with a mean of 17. 45 ± 2. 36 MPa. Visual and scanning electron microscope examination revealed multiple failure patterns with more of porcelain fractures in the ceramic brackets group. Conclusion: Bonding of metal and ceramic brackets to porcelain can be achieved with bond strengths comparable to that when bonded to enamel surface. Porcelain fractures are more commonly associated with debonding of ceramic brackets...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the type and the aesthetic material in relation to age, gender, level of education, employment, socio-economic status and frequency of visits to the dentist. The examination was performed on 212 patients who had a fixed prosthodontic appliance for more than a year (55 % males and 45 % females, age 18 - 80 yrs.). The following conclusions were made: 1. The older patients and retired patients had significantly more bridges than crowns (p 0. 05). Patients who visit their dentist regularly have significantly more crowns than bridges than patients who visit their dentist irregularly or when in pain (p 0. 05). 2. Almost all fixed prosthodontic appliances older than 10 years were made of porcelain (98 %), while acrylic <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> were more frequent in appliances older than 10 or 15 years (p 0. 05). Patients older than 60 years had more acrylic material compared to younger patients. While patients younger than 39 years had almost exclusively ceramic appliances (p< 0. 01). Less educated patients had more acrylic veneer appliances. Employed patients had significantly more ceramic appliances than retired patients...|$|R
5000|$|When space {{exists between}} the {{contacts}} of the maxillary central incisors, the condition {{is referred to as}} a diastema or [...] "gap tooth." [...] One frequent cause of the space is the presence of a large labial frenum from the upper lip extending near the teeth. Treatment depends upon the cause and extent of the gap. Periodontal surgery may be required to reduce the frenum. A small space may be corrected with a filling, <b>veneer,</b> or <b>crown.</b> Larger spaces may require orthodontics.|$|R
40|$|Background and Rationale: The precise fit of {{prosthesis}} {{depends on}} the impression materials and the technique used. Addition silicone impression materials being the user-friendly material are used in monophase and two-phase techniques. Considering the paucity of data {{on the effectiveness of}} intraoral delivery tip (IODT) on void, tear and bubble formation using monophase impression technique in stock tray and two-phase impression technique in custom tray the present study was initiated. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 patients requiring single complete <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> were enrolled. Monophase and two-phase impressions with and without IODT were made. Evaluation of the impression were made for tears, voids, and bubbles and alpha, beta, delta scores were given. Results: A significant reduction in the total number of voids was observed with two-phase technique either with or without IODT. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of overall evaluation into alpha, beta and delta between monophase and two-phase with and without IODT. No significant association was seen in the overall evaluation between the two groups (monophase and two-phase) as compared using Chi-square test for independency and a trend in association between overall evaluation as tested using Chi-square for linear trend analysis. Conclusion: Two-phase impression technique with the use of IODT produced decreased number of voids...|$|R
40|$|The dental {{practitioner}} {{is provided with}} a variety of post endodontic treatment options which range from invasive methods like full <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> to least invasive and aesthetic procedures like bleaching. The most important parameter in non-vital bleaching is the placement of a barrier to prevent the resorption of the tooth which has a poor prognosis. The aim of this paper was to report a case of successful non-vital bleaching by using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as a barrier, with follow up reports of two years. This article describes a one year follow up of a case of non vital bleaching which was performed on a root canal treated, discoloured, maxillary central incisor. By using mineral trioxide aggregate as a barrier, a mixture of sodium perborate and distilled water was used as the bleaching agent. The follow up visits showed significant improvement {{in the shade of the}} bleached teeth even after 24 months, with no evidence of resorption. This is the first paper to report on the use of MTA as a barrier for non-vital bleaching. The placement of a proper bleach barrier is the most important factor for successful intracoronal bleaching. Non vital bleaching can be considered as a safe, effective and non invasive treatment option in the management of endodontically treated, discoloured teeth. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{longevity}} of crowns versus large multisurface restorations in posterior teeth. The investigation used the treatment database at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Dentistry. The inclusion criteria for the final data set used for analysis were: only one restored tooth per patient, premolars with three or more restored surfaces, molars with four or more restored surfaces, molars and premolars restored with complete <b>veneer</b> metal <b>crowns,</b> or <b>crowns</b> <b>veneered</b> with metal and porcelain. The Kaplan-Meier approach was used to visualize the survival curves, and the Cox proportional hazards model was used for analysis of predictor variables. The investigation indicates crowns survive longer than large restorations and premolar restorations survive longer than molar restorations. The median survival for crowns exceeded 16. 6 years, with the median survival of premolar restorations being 4. 4 years and molar restorations 1. 3 years. An interaction between age and treatment was discovered, with overall survival decreasing as patient age increases. The doctor supervising the treatment also affected survival with treatment supervised by specialists lasting longer than treatment supervised by nonspecialists...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Today, new {{developments}} in the field of computer hardware and software have led to the production of advanced equipment and devices in industry, including the dental field. One of these devices is computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacture (CAM) system. CAD/CAM systems are able to collect data and design and manufacture a wide range of dental restorations such as inlays, onlays, <b>veneers,</b> <b>crowns,</b> fixed partial dentures, orthodontic appliances and dental implant abutments. The aim {{of this article is to}} review the history of CAD/CAM, types of available CAD/CAM systems, how they function and application concepts in digital dentistry. Article description: This article was collected by scientific search in electronic resources, books, Pubmed and ISI Web of Science websites, in articles published in English until 2013, and with the following key words: history, advantages and disadvantages, an overview of the components and the performance of CAD/CAM systems in dentistry. Conclusions: In recent years, digital technology is advancing rapidly in dentistry and now it can be applied to almost any restorative situation, including full-mouth rehabilitation. Computer technology has made fabrication of restorations easier, faster, cheaper and more predictable than before. While there are many benefits for dental digital systems, it is necessary for the dental team to master their function in order to maximize their advantages for creating well-fitting restorations...|$|R
40|$|The {{cases of}} TMD {{are complex and}} multifactorial, {{therefore}} the management should be done by several disciplines. In this report, a 27 -year-old man came to the teaching hospital of the University of Indonesia Faculty of Dentistry’s Prosthodontic Department complaining about clicking sound and pain around his right joint. He received orthodontic treatment 9 years ago with removable appliance at a private practice and had 4 premolar extractions. The patient’s face looked asymmetric, with a low vertical dimension, a Class II occlusion, and an anterior deep bite. Besides that, he clenched his teeth during emotional stress. Lateral transcranial photo showed that {{the position of the}} left condyle was relatively normal or slightly anterior, and the right condyle was in the superoposterior position in the fossa with an abnormal shape. To solve this problem, the patient was referred to the Orthodontic Department to get a correct vertical dimension and normal anterior overbite. After 6 years, the patient was again referred to the Prosthodontic Department, but the result was not successful. In order to get the right vertical dimension, an occlusal splint was fabricated to achieve a comfort jaw relation. In this position, the overbite was 2 mm, but the space between the upper and lower posterior teeth was 5 mm. In this situation, full <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> were not impossible to fabricate. Finally, to maintain this comfort position, the patient was suggested to wear the occlusal splint and come regularly for control every 6 months...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Different {{factors can}} affect the {{retention}} of full <b>veneer</b> <b>crowns</b> such as clinical lengthof crown, diameter of tooth, angle of convergence, type of restoration and the cement. The aim ofthis study was assessment of the convergence angles of tooth preparations for full coverage crownamong dentistry students. Methods and materials: In this observational- cross sectional study, 210 dies from preparedanterior and posterior teeth by under graduate and postgraduate students were randomly selected. In the two groups, the mesiodistal and buccolingual angles of the dies were measured withstereomicroscope and moticam camera and compared with each other. The results were analyzedby t-test via SPSS- 11. 5 software. Results: The total average convergence angle was 23. 8 ± 8. 6 degrees for the preparationsperformed by undergraduate students and 22. 4 ± 9. 0 for postgraduate group. The averageconvergence angle for anterior preparations was 24. 4 ± 8. 1 degrees in undergraduate group and 20. 2 ± 7. 7 degrees in postgraduate group and for posterior preparations it was 23. 6 ± 8. 8 degreesin under graduate group and 24. 1 ± 9. 6 degrees in other group. Differences in convergence anglesof anterior preparations between two groups were significant (p value = 0. 02), but for posteriorpreparations and other preparation were not statistically significant. Conclusion: The total average convergence angle of all preparations and posterior preparations intwo groups were the same, But it was significantly greater in anterior preparations prepared byundergraduate students. In any case, the findings were similar to some of previous studies. Key words: Angle of convergence, Retention, full crown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{fracture strength}} of veneered translucent zirconium dioxide crowns designed with different porcelain layer thicknesses. Materials and Methods: Sixty crowns, divided into six groups of 10, {{were used in}} this study. Groups were divided according to different thicknesses of porcelain veneer on translucent zirconium dioxide cores of equal thickness (0. 5 [*]mm). Porcelain thicknesses were 2. 5, 2. 0, 1. 0, 0. 8, 0. 5 and 0. 3 [*]mm. Crowns were artificially aged before loaded to fracture. Determination of fracture mode was performed using light microscope. Results: Group 1. 0 [*]mm showed significantly (p[*]≤[*]. 05) highest fracture loads (mean 1540 N) in comparison with groups 2. 5, 2. 0 and 0. 3 [*]mm (mean 851, 910 and 1202 N). There {{was no significant difference}} (p>. 05) in fracture loads among groups 1. 0, 0. 8 and 0. 5 [*]mm (mean 1540, 1313 and 1286 N). There were significantly (p[*]≤[*]. 05) more complete fractures in group 0. 3 [*]mm compared to all other groups which presented mainly cohesive fractures. Conclusions: Translucent zirconium dioxide <b>crowns</b> can be <b>veneered</b> with minimal thickness layer of 0. 5 [*]mm porcelain without showing significantly reduced fracture strength compared to traditionally veneered (1. 0 – 2. 0 [*]mm) crowns. Fracture strength of micro-veneered crowns with a layer of porcelain (0. 3 [*]mm) is lower than that of traditionally <b>veneered</b> <b>crowns</b> but still within range of what may be considered clinically sufficient. Porcelain layers of 2. 0 [*]mm or thicker should be used where expected loads are low only...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{which of the}} veneered primary stainless steel crowns demonstrate the greatest resistance to dislodgment and to characterize the bond failure. Background. There is a growing demand from parents to provide more esthetic restorations. We need an alternative besides SSC. Veneer primary molar esthetic stainless steel crowns have recently appeared on the market. There are few literatures on the performances of these crowns but none compare the different brands from different companies. Methods. Ten of the same sized preveneered primary molar stainless steel crowns will be purchase from four different laboratories. The four laboratories will be tested are: Dental Innovators, Cheng Crowns, NuSmile Crowns, Kinder Krowns. Only full porcelain coverage primary molar stainless steel crowns will be used. A master die will be fabricated with preparation and reduction specified in text books. Ten duplicate dies will be fabricated from this master prepped die. Each <b>veneered</b> <b>crown</b> will be luted with Fuji glass ionomer cement {{onto one of the}} ten prepared cast die. The crowns will be allowed to set for twenty-four hours. The crowns will then be thermocycled at 4 ° C and 55 ° C for 500 1 -minute cycles. Each die will be placed on a mechanical testing machine with a compressive load (N) applied along the long axis of the specimen at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min until fracture. Failure loads (N) will be recorded for each specimen. Failure will be classified as complete dislodgement of the facing of the preveneered crowns. Results. Will be presented at Research Day.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the marginal discrepancy of monolithic and <b>veneered</b> all-ceramic <b>crown</b> systems cemented on titanium (Ti) and zirconia implant abutments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty customized implant abutments for a maxillary right central incisor were fabricated of Ti and zirconia (n = 30 of each) for an internal-connection implant system. All-ceramic crowns were fabricated {{using the following}} systems (n = 10 per group) : monolithic with computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacture (CAD/CAM) lithium disilicate (MLD), pressed lithium disilicate (PLD), or CAD yttrium-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP). The frameworks of the PLD and Y-TZP systems were manually veneered with a fluorapatite-based ceramic. The crowns were cemented to their implant abutments, and the absolute marginal discrepancy of the gap was measured before and after cementation. Data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Marginal discrepancies were significantly influenced by the crown system and by cementation, but the material did not significantly affect the results. Interaction terms were not significant. Y-TZP crowns on both Ti and zirconia abutments presented the smallest mean marginal discrepancies before (52. 1 ± 17 μm and 56. 2 ± 11 μm, respectively) and after cementation (98. 7 ± 17 μm and 101. 8 ± 16 μm, respectively). Before cementation, MLD crowns showed significantly larger mean marginal openings than PLD crowns on both Ti and zirconia abutments (75. 2 ± 12 and 77. 5 ± 13 μm for MLD, 52. 1 ± 17 μm and 69. 7 ± 8 μm for PLD, respectively). After cementation, both Ti and zirconia abutments with MLD crowns (113. 5 ± 12 μm and 118. 3 ± 14 μm, respectively) showed significantly larger values than with PLD crowns (98. 7 ± 17 μm and 109. 4 ± 9 μm, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Manually <b>veneered</b> Y-TZP <b>crowns</b> demonstrated more favorable marginal fit on both Ti and zirconia implant abutments before and after cementation compared to those of MLD and PLD...|$|R
