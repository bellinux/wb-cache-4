The latter needed potash, as well as quartz and lime as raw materials for the manufacture of glass. Potash acted as a flux in the production process, that is by mixing it with quartz sand it significantly reduced the melting point of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which wood ash and <b>vegetable</b> <b>ash</b> was gathered by ash burners and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as leaching.|$|E

Como resultado, espera-se níveis mais elevados de produtividade sem aumentos significativos nos custos. Objetivou-se com este trabalho verificar o estado nutricional do pimentão (Capsicum annuum L.), em resposta à aplicação de diferentes fontes e doses de biofertilizantes. O experimento foi realizado no Sítio Macaquinhos, em Remígio, estado da Paraíba. Os tratamentos foram distribuídos em esquema fatorial 2 × 5, referente a duas fontes de biofertilizante e cinco doses de cálcio (0; 0, 65; 1, 30; 1, 95 e 2, 60 g cova- 1 de cálcio). As covas foram abertas em espaçamento de 1 × 0, 50 m e preenchidas com 2 L de esterco bovino e 1 L de cinza vegetal. Os biofertilizantes puro e agrobio foram preparados 30 e 60 dias antes do plantio, respectivamente. No início da floração, as plantas depimentão encontravam-se nutricionalmente deficientes em nitrogênio, cálcio e magnésio, mas equilibradas em fósforo, potássio e enxofre. Apesar do acréscimo de macro e micronutrientes no agrobio, ao final do experimento, constatou-se que os resultados foram semelhantes quanto ao estado nutricional das plantas. Use {{of liquid}} biofertilizers {{is one of}} the {{practices}} of organic agriculture that aims to achieve balanced plant nutrition.

5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, <b>vegetables</b> and grain. <b>Ash</b> can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|R

The proximate analysis and sensory evaluation of the “Okpa ” prepared with vegetables fluted pumpkin (Telfairia Occidentales) and scent leaves (Ocimum Viridis) were carried out. The results show that the addition of the leaves altered the ash and fiber contents of the “Okpa ” compared with control at P ≤ 0. 5. Fluted pumpkin leaf had the highest ash content (4. 52 ± 0. 03) followed by the combination of the leaves (4. 51 ± 0. 02), and then the scent leaf (4. 45 ± 0. 01) compared with the control (4. 09 ± 0. 05), confirming that the presence of these <b>vegetables</b> boosted the <b>ash</b> (mineral) contents of the “Okpa”. The “Okpa ” with scent leaf had the highest crude fiber (11. 92 ± 0. 20), followed by “Okpa ” with combination of these leaves (11. 30 ± 0. 06), and then the fluted pumpkin leaf (10. 01 ± 0. 12) compared with the control (3. 37 ± 0. 11). This also shows that the presence of these vegetables increased the crude fiber content of the “Okpa ” which could ease off the dryness and hardness of “Okpa ” to the palate experienced by the consumers and the constipation as a result of ingestion of “Okpa”. The percentage crude protein, fats, carbohydrate, moisture and energy values were not altered significantly at p≤ 0. 05. The sensory evaluation of the samples did not show any significant change at p ≤ 0. 05. Therefore, addition of vegetables, especially fluted pumpkin leaves could serve as a boost to the nutritional value of “Okpa ” and ease off the dryness, heaviness and hardness to palate experienced while ingestion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Bamabara groundnut, Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc, is an {{important}} grain legume that {{plays a significant role}} in sustainable agriculture, food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa. In northern Ghana one major constraint to the save preservation of bambara groundnut seeds after harvest is infestation by bruchid insects. A survey was conducted to obtain information on the existing storage systems and their implications for bruchid pest management in the Talensi-Nabdam district of Upper East region of Ghana. Six farming communities and five marketing centers were surveyed between January and March, 2012 by administering structured and semi structured questionnaires to respondents drawn by purposive sampling method. The study revealed that the major storage pests infesting bambara groundnuts in the surveyed areas were insects of the bruchid group which were dominated by three species of Callosobruhus and one species of Zabrotes. Storage structures used by farmers and traders included earthenware pots, gourds, mud silos, jute sacks, metal drums and plastic containers but jute sacks and clay pots were rampant in terms of use. Though not all the structures are effective many were used owing to their hermetic conditions against the pests, coupled with their durability, economic and ease of integration with indigenous grain protectants such as admixture with <b>vegetable</b> oils, fine <b>ash</b> and extracts from a local plant scientifically known as Hyptis spicigera. The extract from Hyptis spicigera was more (50 %) in use to preserve Bambara groundnuts because its work better in warding off the bruchid pest. The rampant postharvest losses to bambara groundnut grains in the area could be minimized if these existing storage structures and grain preservation techniques were improved.

60|$|I beheld a man {{extended}} flat {{upon his}} back, on the ground, and, despite the forced composure of his countenance, {{it was evident}} that he was suffering agony. His tormentor bent over him, working away {{for all the world like}} a stone-cutter with mallet and chisel. In one hand he held a short slender stick, pointed with a shark’s tooth, on the upright end of which he tapped with a small hammer-like piece of wood, thus puncturing the skin, and charging it with the colouring matter in which the instrument was dipped. A cocoa-nut shell containing this fluid was placed upon the ground. It is prepared by mixing with a <b>vegetable</b> juice the <b>ashes</b> of the “armor,” or candle-nut, always preserved for the purpose. Beside the savage, and spread out upon a piece of soiled tappa, were a great number of curious black-looking little implements of bone and wood, used in the various divisions of his art. A few terminated in a single fine point, and, like very delicate pencils, were employed in giving the finishing touches, or in operating upon the more sensitive portions of the body, as was the case of the present instance. Others presented several points distributed in a line, somewhat resembling the teeth of a saw. These were employed in the coarser parts of the work, and particularly in pricking in straight marks. Some presented their points disposed in small figures, and being placed upon the body, were, by a single blow of the hammer, made to leave their indelible impression. I observed a few, the handles of which were mysteriously curved, as if intended to be introduced into the orifice of the ear, with a view perhaps of beating the tattoo upon the tympanum. Altogether, the sight of these strange instruments recalled to mind that display of cruel-looking mother-of-pearl-handled things which one sees in their velvet-lined cases at the elbow of a dentist.|$|R
