5000|$|The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya (GALCK) was {{established}} in May 2006 following the convening of local and regional lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) activists by Urgent Action Fund (UAF) a local women’s rights organization. As the national umbrella organization, GALCK made considerable gains in increasing the voice and visibility of the sexual orientation gender identity and expression (SOGIE) movement until 2011/2012. The latter period, characterized by organizational and financial management challenges, brought almost all GALCK’s regular functioning to a standstill. In 2013, in a demonstration of extraordinary resilience, the community established the GALCK Reloaded Task-force (GRT) to re-activate and restructure the Coalition and re-establish its position {{at the center of}} the Kenyan SOGIE movement. Since then, the Coalition under the stewardship of the voluntary GRT has grown from strength to strength, shedding a <b>very</b> <b>positive</b> and promising <b>light</b> on the future of the Kenyan SOGIE movement.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1994 Graphics calculators {{are rapidly}} {{becoming}} more affordable to students of mathematics. In time, {{it can be}} expected these calculators will become as essential a tool for mathematics students as scientific calculators are now. This thesis investigates how best to use graphics calculators to improve student achievement and understanding of senior secondary graph-sketching topics. The Wesley College Technology Enriched Graphing Project was an experimental study which involved 180 Year 11 students (8 intact classes) over 15 lessons at two campuses of this large co-educational independent school. Two teaching programs were devised, which differed {{in the degree of}} teaching emphasis on issues of scaling and obtaining a complete picture of a graph. The effect of frequency of calculator use was also investigated with a 2 x 2 experimental design. Daily use of the calculator was found to lead to significantly more improvement on general graphing questions than less frequent use. The teaching emphasis on scaling led to significantly more improvement in students' ability to deal with potentially misleading questions where the finite view of a function provided by the calculator omitted important features. Students' attitudes to calculator use were <b>very</b> <b>positive.</b> In the <b>light</b> of these results it is recommended that schools move as quickly as possible to personal ownership of graphics calculators by students and that teaching programs emphasise scaling issues. This approach takes no more time than traditional teaching methods, but confronts student difficulties and leads to better understanding of functions.
