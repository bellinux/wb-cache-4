5|$|Plant <b>virus</b> <b>{{particles}}</b> or virus-like particles (VLPs) have {{applications in}} both biotechnology and nanotechnology. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures {{and can be}} produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression {{in a variety of}} heterologous systems. Plant <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can be incorporated into supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{material}} within <b>virus</b> <b>particles,</b> and the {{method by which}} the material is replicated, varies considerably between different types of viruses.|$|E

The initial orientation for each <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> image is {{randomly selected from}} the 60 icosahedral equivalent orientations of its capsid because the orientations computed from the virus capsid are all located within an asymmetric unit.|$|R
50|$|The <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> is enveloped and spherical, ovoid or {{variable}} in shape, with a diameter generally {{in the range}} 80-120 nm. The <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> contains around ten ribosome-like granules, a feature of arenaviruses. It bears surface projections variously described as 4-5 nm long and 10-14 nm in length and 4-6 nm in diameter.|$|R
5|$|Assembly â€“ Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of the <b>virus</b> <b>particles,</b> some {{modification of}} the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the virus has been released from the host cell.|$|E
5|$|No <b>virus</b> <b>particles,</b> bacteria, or fungi {{have been}} {{conclusively}} associated with prion diseases, although virus-like particles and Spiroplasma-like inclusions {{can be detected}} in some TSE cases, but not in controls (uninfected individuals).|$|E
5|$|Replication of <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> is {{the stage}} where a cell uses viral {{messenger}} RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.|$|E

5|$|VP1 {{is located}} in the core of the virus {{particle}} and is an RNA polymerase enzyme. In an infected cell this enzyme produces mRNA transcripts for the synthesis of viral proteins and produces copies of the rotavirus genome RNA segments for newly produced <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|E
5|$|When a {{virus infects}} a cell, the virus forces {{it to make}} {{thousands}} more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b>|$|E
5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, {{is almost always}} either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> of some virus families, such as those belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E

5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} size, shape, and {{well-defined}} chemical structures, viruses {{have been used}} as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale. Recent examples include work at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., using Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) particles to amplify signals in DNA microarray based sensors. In this application, the <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> separate the fluorescent dyes used for signalling to prevent the formation of non-fluorescent dimers that act as quenchers. Another example is the use of CPMV as a nanoscale breadboard for molecular electronics.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

5|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{problems}} {{with all of these}} hypotheses: the regressive hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b> The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of {{bacterial}} genes by bacteriophage {{is a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of <b>virus</b> <b>particles.</b> Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
40|$|The {{property}} of influenza virus suspensions to agglutinate red blood ceils {{appears to be}} {{closely associated with the}} infective activity of the virus (1). The complement-fixing antigen, on the other hand, has been shown to consist of two distinct fractions: one is intimately associated with the hemagglutinin and infective <b>virus</b> <b>particle,</b> while the other has a smaller size and is readily separable from the <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> by centrifugation or adsorption with red blood ceils (2). A preliminary report (3) showed that the infectivity and hemagglutinin of the PR 8 and Lee strains of influenza virus were associated with particles which were at least 60 m/z in diameter. Subsequent papers by other workers (4, 5) have confirmed this latter finding and have set the size of the PR 8 <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> at 80 m # and that of the Lee <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> at 100 m#. The present paper presents a further study of the various properties of influenza virus and their interrelationships, by means of experiments in the angle centrifuge and the optical ultracentrifuge, and by filtration with graded collodion membranes. It will be shown that the application of a syntheti...|$|R

5|$|Viral {{recombination}} produces {{genetic variation}} that likely {{contributes to the}} evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, in principle, to overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million <b>virus</b> <b>particles</b> per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
40|$|A new {{procedure}} for {{the separation of}} influenza <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) by electrophoresis on a slab of polyacrylamide gel resolves five discrete bands. The largest is a triplet containing the three largest RNAs (1 to 3), the intermediate sized RNP is a doublet containing RNAs 5 and 6 and the others each contain a single RNA. In addition, each RNP is composed of NP protein and an amount of M which is independent {{of the size of}} the RNP. This suggests that some <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> M is specifically associated with influenza ribonucleoprotein...|$|R

40|$|AbstractVpr {{is one of}} the {{auxiliary}} proteins encoded by the HIV- 1 genome and is selectively incorporated into the <b>virus</b> <b>particle.</b> It has been shown that Vpr incorporation in the <b>virus</b> <b>particle</b> requires only the core protein Gag. In an effort to identify the domains of Vpr which are essential for incorporation into the HIV- 1 virion, site-specific mutagenesis of vpr was carried out. Mutation of the highly conserved acidic residues in the N-terminal domain (amino acid positions 17 - 34) eliminated virion incorporation. These mutations disrupt a predicted amphipathic alpha-helical structure that is highly conserved among Vpr sequences. In contrast, alterations of the conserved cysteine (Cys 76), basic domain (Arg 87 and Lys 95), and other residues (Gln 65) did not impair the incorporation of Vpr into virus-like particles directed by HIV- 1 Gag. The results presented here suggest that protein-protein interactions mediated through the putative helical domain of Vpr may participate in its incorporation into the <b>virus</b> <b>particle...</b>|$|R
