40|$|Odor {{information}} is predominantly perceived as complex odor blends. For Drosophila melanogaster {{one of the}} most attractive blends is emitted by an over-ripe banana. To analyze how the fly’s olfactory system processes natural blends we combined the experimental advantages of gas chromatography and functional imaging (GC-I). In this way, natural banana compounds were presented successively to the fly antenna in close to natural occurring concentrations. This technique allowed us to identify the active odor components, use these compounds as stimuli and measure odor-induced Ca 2 + signals in input and output neurons of the Drosophila antennal lobe (AL), the first olfactory neuropil. We demonstrate that mixture interactions of a natural blend are very rare and occur only at the AL output level resulting in a surprisingly linear blend representation. However, the information regarding single components is strongly modulated by the olfactory circuitry within the AL leading to a higher similarity between the representation of individual components and the banana blend. This observed modulation might tune the olfactory system in a way to distinctively categorize odor components and improve the detection of suitable food sources. Functional GC-I thus enables analysis of <b>virtually</b> any <b>unknown</b> natural odorant blend and its components in their relative occurring concentrations and allows characterization of neuronal responses of complete neural assemblies. This technique {{can be seen as a}} valuable complementary method to classical GC/electrophysiology techniques, and will be a highly useful tool in future investigations of insect-insect and insect-plant chemical interactions...|$|R

We will not use the computer metaphor, as it has been replaced by the metaphor of the autonomous agent over the past decades (Russell & Norvig, 1995). Of course, an autonomous agent is not a novel idea, and has much in common with other work that dates at least back to von Uexküll's work (Salthe, 2001).

The rise in women artists during this period {{may be attributed to}} major cultural shifts. One such shift was a move toward humanism, a philosophy affirming the dignity of all people, that became central to Renaissance thinking and helped raise the status of women. In addition, the identity of the individual artist in general was regarded as more important; significant artists from this period whose identities are <b>unknown</b> <b>virtually</b> cease to exist. Two important texts, On Famous Women and The City of Women, illustrate this cultural change. Boccaccio, a 14th-century humanist, wrote De mulieribus claris (Latin for On Famous Women) (1135-59), a collection of biographies of women. Among the 104 biographies he included was that of Thamar (or Thmyris), an ancient Greek vase painter. Curiously, among the 15th-century manuscript illuminations of On Famous Women, Thamar was depicted painting a self-portrait or perhaps painting a small image of the Virgin and Child. Christine de Pizan, a remarkable late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, wrote Book of the City of Ladies in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as Anastasia, who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women.|$|R
40|$|Internal migrant {{children}} in mainland China remained <b>virtually</b> invisible or <b>unknown</b> {{in the early}} 1990 s, but, {{as the number of}} such children surged, they soon became an object of media reports and public discussion. This thesis investigates and compares the representations of migrant {{children in}} the Chinese press from 1990 ¬¬¬– 2012 and in the Twitter-like micro-blogosphere (weibo). It aims to understand {{the ways in which the}} media produce knowledge and opinions about this emerging group and, with regard to the discursive pattern, to trace the continuity and change over time as well as between different media forms. People’s Daily and Southern Weekly are chosen to examine the portrayal of migrant children in an official Party-led newspaper vis-à-vis a commercial audience-oriented press. It is argued that, despite the domination of official voices (as in People’s Daily), the commercialisation of Chinese media institutions and the ensuing diversification of media content have facilitated the expression of migrant children and diversified their images (as in Southern Weekly). At the same time, Chinese micro-bloggers have contributed to topics related to migrant children from a grassroots perspective which usually prioritises charity and philanthropy. Weibo has helped to shift the power of agenda setting from the Party-state and professional news workers to ordinary netizens (who are mainly urban and educated), but not to migrant children or migrants in general. The weibo discourse has reinforced, rather than challenged, the existing stereotypes of migrant children in the Chinese public discourse, who are continuously portrayed as a passive, subordinate and inferior group and whose voices are rarely heard in either online forums or offline media discourse. The research employs a combined methodology of qualitative discourse analysis and quantitative content analysis. The data set is comprised mainly of 217 press reports and 458 weibo tweets. The analytical themes of the discourse include the terminology referring to migrant children, rhetorical strategies, the general subjects of media discussions, and the quotations from different social groups. The discourse analysis approach is supplemented by classic content analysis which helps to reveal the general trends and themes in the texts...|$|R
