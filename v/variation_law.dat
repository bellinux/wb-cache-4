The porosity and permeability characterize the reservoir capacity and seepage capacity of the reservoir. The main purpose of facies-control modelling is to more accurately reflect heterogeneity. However, it is difficult for the fitting of the variation function to reflect the spatial <b>variation</b> <b>law</b> of the geological conditions (the <b>variation</b> <b>law</b> of sedimentary facies and the spatial distribution of channel sand bodies, etc.). Therefore, based on the modelling of the sedimentary facies, this modelling is constrained by geological experience in removing the singular values.
