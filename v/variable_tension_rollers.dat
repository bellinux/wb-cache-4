40|$|Braneworld {{models with}} <b>variable</b> <b>tension</b> are investigated, and the {{corrections}} {{on the black}} string horizon along the extra dimension are provided. Such corrections are encrypted in additional terms involving the covariant derivatives of the <b>variable</b> <b>tension</b> on the brane, providing profound consequences concerning the black string horizon variation along the extra dimension, near the brane. The black string horizon behavior is shown to be drastically modified by the terms corrected by the brane <b>variable</b> <b>tension.</b> In particular, a model motivated by the phenomenological interesting case regarding Eotvos branes is investigated. It forthwith provides further physical features regarding <b>variable</b> <b>tension</b> braneworld scenarios, heretofore concealed in all previous analysis in the literature. All precedent analysis considered uniquely {{the expansion of the}} metric up to the second order along the extra dimension, what is able to evince solely the brane <b>variable</b> <b>tension</b> absolute value. Notwithstanding, the expansion terms aftermath, further accomplished in this paper from the third order on, elicits the successive covariant derivatives of the brane <b>variable</b> <b>tension,</b> and their respective coupling with the extrinsic curvature, the Weyl tensor, and the Riemann and Ricci tensors, as well as the scalar curvature.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{electrostatic}} separators. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high <b>tension</b> <b>rollers)</b> or electrostatic separators. In high <b>tension</b> <b>rollers,</b> particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic plate separators work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons {{to the plate and}} are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, {{one of the most important}} is the water content of the particles. This is important as a layer of moisture on the particles will render the non-conductors as conductors as the layer of the water is conductive.|$|R

40|$|Regular black strings {{solutions}} {{associated to}} a dynamical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker braneworld are obtained as {{a particular case}} of a regular bulk metric, {{in the context of}} a <b>variable</b> brane <b>tension.</b> By analyzing the 5 D Kretschmann invariants, we show that the <b>variable</b> brane <b>tension</b> is capable to remove bulk singularities, along some eras of the evolution of the Universe. In particular, the black string time-dependent profile in the bulk is analyzed in the context of the McVittie metric on an Eötvös fluid braneworld, wherein the fluid dynamical brane tension depends on the brane temperature. The whole bulk is shown to be regular for a Universe dominated by non-relativistic matter or by relativistic matter/radiation, as the cosmological time elapses. In a particular case the associated black strings are shown to have finite extension along the extra dimension, what prominently modify the higher-dimensional physical singularities. For a Universe dominated by matter or radiation, we show that the brane singularities are removed along the extra dimension, as an effect of the <b>variable</b> brane <b>tension,</b> corresponding also to the vanishing of the black string horizon. In this case there is a regular solution in the bulk. We show further that no additional physical singularity is introduced in the bulk when the Universe is dominated by a cosmological constant.

The need for {{a deeper understanding of}} granular systems is made evident by their commonplace status in both the natural and industrial environments. The formation of patterns within systems of particles subject to transversely driven vibrations is one focus of research in recent years that enhances an understanding of the connection between granular systems and their surroundings. The research suggests it is plausible that particulates of a granular assembly can be segregated and positioned via waves imposed on a medium's surface. As a study in the non-contact management of granular particles, we investegate a vibrating membrane with <b>variable</b> <b>tension.</b> The model is motivated on grounds that it may broaden an understanding of particle transport through the analysis of the non-uniform membrane's vibrational characteristics. The equations of motion of the membrane are developed via the constitutive relations of an elastic membrane as set forth by the theory of partial differential equations. Interesting eigenfunctions satisfying the Helmholtz equation are derived for which their eigenvalues are used to analyze and manipulate the membrane's motion through a range of tensile forces. The membrane is subjected to external homogenous periodic forcing of frequency ?? and when ?? is the same as a natural frequency of the membrane then resonance occurs. At resonance, standing waves similar to the membrane's analytical eigenfunctions give rise to quiescent nodal curves. Particles distributed across the membrane's surface are assumed to accumulate towards and rest along the nodal curves. <b>Variable</b> <b>tension</b> is an attempt to control node/particle location. By adjusting the tension gradient along the flow axis, node location is shifted to either the left or the right for each setting of the tension gradient. Transient behavior of the wave modes under changes to the tensile force are revealed by analyzing the resonant modes spectral decomposition. It is observed that while the forcing frequency corresponding to resonant wave modes agrees with predicted frequency response values the wave structure is sensitive to changing tensile conditions while under forced oscillations...|$|R
