5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E

The <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> usually range from 20 to 200 meters in depth, although qanats {{in the province of}} Khorasan have been recorded with <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> of up to 275 m. The <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> support construction and maintenance of the underground channel as well as air interchange. Deep shafts require intermediate platforms to simplify the process of removing soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{recordings}} made by Gulam Yazdani {{indicated the}} existence of 21 <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> or air vents. But there are about 27 visible <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> or air vents inclusive of branch gallery. A number of <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> have been closed for one or other reasons. The some of the air vents are provided with masonry lining (historically without any mortar) and 2 ft high parapet (parapet is mostly modern entity). The average dimension of the air vent is 4 m2. Lack of maintenance, thick vegetation growth, and run-off erosion has led to collapse of parapets.|$|R

25|$|Bones are {{commonly}} found in caves or ‘'tomo'’ (the Maori word for doline or sinkhole; often {{used to refer to}} pitfalls or vertical cave shafts). The two main ways that the moa bones were deposited in such sites were: 1. birds that entered the cave to nest or escape bad weather, and subsequently died in the cave; and 2. birds that fell into a <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> and were unable to escape. Moa bones (and the bones of other extinct birds) have been found in caves throughout New Zealand, especially in the limestone/marble areas of northwest Nelson, Karamea, Waitomo, and Te Anau.|$|E
25|$|Following the 22 October 2012 crash, {{the major}} North Sea Super Puma operators, CHC Helicopter, Bond Offshore Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters decided to ground all AS332 and EC225 Super Puma helicopters. On 25 October 2012 it was {{announced}} that the problem was suspected to relate to the main gearbox vertical shaft; the AS 332 L1 and L2 versions of the Super Puma could be refitted with an older design, allowing them to resume flying. On 8 November 2012 some Super Pumas of Bond Offshore Helicopters returned to flight. The EC225 grounding continued into 2013, following the validation of new safety measures by the EASA, the type was progressively returned to service following modifications. By mid-2015, all 49 EC225s operating in the North Sea fleets in the UK had been retrofitted with a redesigned bevel wheel <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> to avoid any recurrence.|$|E
25|$|For documenta VI (1977), Serra {{designed}} Terminal, four 41-foot-tall trapezoids {{that form}} a tower, situated {{in front of}} the main exhibition venue. After long negotiations, accompanied by violent protests, Terminal was purchased by the city of Bochum and finally installed at the city's train station in 1979. Carnegie (1984–85), a 39-foot-high <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> outside the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, received high praise. Similar sculptures, like Fulcrum (1987), Axis (1989), and Torque (1992), were later installed in London's Broadgate, at Kunsthalle Bielefeld, and at Saarland University, respectively. Initially located in the French town of Puteaux, Slat (1985) consists of five steel plates - four trapezoidal and one rectangular - each one roughly 12 feet wide and 40 feet tall, that lean on one another to form a tall, angular tepee. Already in 1989 vandalism and graffiti prompted that town’s mayor to remove it, and only in December 2008, after almost 20 years in storage, Slat was re-anchored in La Défense. Because of its weight, officials chose to ground it in a traffic island behind the Grande Arche.|$|E

50|$|The {{humidity}} of the oases is {{also used}} to supplement the water supply to the foggara. The temperature gradient in the <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> causes air to rise by natural convection, causing a draft to enter the foggara. The moist air of the agricultural area is drawn into the foggara in the opposite direction to the water run-off. In the foggara it condenses on the tunnel walls and the air passes out of the <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts.</b> This condensed moisture is available for reuse.|$|R
25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted water chambers on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the surging {{phenomena}} with the propagation of multiple interfaces between open channel free surface flows and pressurized pipe flows, which can be seen due to the rapid change of flow discharge in the sewer network system, the tailrace tunnel of hydropower plants, etc. The circular pipe with multiple <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> is used as the experimental set-up to investigate the fundamental characteristics of phenomena. The temporal and spatial variations of the pressure and depth in the pipe after the instantaneous interception of discharge are measured under some hydraulic conditions. The maximum elevetion of water surface at <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts</b> {{is related to the}} hydraulic variables such as the discharge and the position of <b>vertical</b> <b>shafts.</b> It is tried to reproduce the phenomena numerically by means of the simulation model proposed by authors.

500|$|Nests {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} sites, {{including}} holes in wood, roots of plants, twigs of trees and shrubs, between rocks, in the soil, and under paving stones. Sometimes, banded sugar ant colonies form small mounds, which are less than 20cm (8in) in diameter and usually funnel-shaped and ephemeral. Mounds are not constructed in undisturbed regions where land degradation has not occurred. Instead, the entrance of a nest consists of a smooth-walled <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> that is [...] in diameter. Chambers in the nest have a similar appearance to the nest entrance (shaft-like walls), and the floors within the chambers are typically [...] in length with an arched roof that is [...] in height.

500|$|In general, {{externally}} generated hot gas {{technologies are}} similar to internal combustion technologies in that they also process oil shale lumps in <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> kilns. Significantly, though, the heat in these technologies is delivered by gases heated outside the retort vessel, and therefore the retort vapors are not diluted with combustion exhaust. The Petrosix and Paraho Indirect employ this technology. In addition to not accepting fine particles as feed, these technologies do not utilize the potential heat of combusting the char on the spent shale and thus must burn more valuable fuels. [...] However, {{due to the lack}} of combustion of the spent shale, the oil shale does not exceed [...] and significant carbonate mineral decomposition and subsequent CO2 generation can be avoided for some oil shales. [...] Also, these technologies tend to be the more stable and easier to control than internal combustion or hot solid recycle technologies.|$|E
500|$|The {{entrance}} immediately {{leads to}} a [...] long steep stairway and then down on to a corridor which heads west. The corridor ends in a straight <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{at the top of}} which is the so-called upper corridor, an unfinished passage which goes south {{toward the center of the}} pyramid. At the bottom of the shaft is a T-shaped crossway. To the left, this crossway leads south to the lower corridor, half-way of which is a narrow stairway, so narrow that a sarcophagus could hardly have been passed through it. The lower corridor then finishes in the king's burial chamber. In this area of the stairway, Barsanti drew another gallery leading above the burial chamber, but this gallery is absent in Reisner's and Fisher's notes. To the right of the T-shaped crossway is a U-shaped gallery system. The ground plan of the gallery system resembles that of a comb, comprising rows of chambers, totalling 32, which were possibly destined to be storage rooms for the gravegoods. The gallery proved to be [...] "clean and empty, as if the workmen had only left".|$|E
