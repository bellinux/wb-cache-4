5|$|For Halo 3, it {{was decided}} a new <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> for the Flood was needed. The task of {{developing}} the new Flood forms, organic Flood terrain, and other miscellaneous changes fell to Vic DeLeon, Bungie's Senior Environment Artist. With the addition of mutable forms in Halo 3, the only fictional constraint on the designer's imaginations was that the Flood altered the DNA of its victims by digesting.|$|E

His body of work is permeated by materialistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, practical special effects, innovative soundscapes, large-format film photography, and analogous relationships between <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> and narrative elements. In addition to his filmmaking, he is a vocal advocate for film preservation and the continued availability of film stock.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{announced}} in 2009, The Witness had a lengthy development period. Blow started {{work on the}} title in 2008 shortly after releasing Braid. The financial success of Braid allowed him to hire a larger production team without ceding control over the final product. In order to create the game's <b>visual</b> <b>language,</b> the team developed their own game engine and retained artists, architects, and landscape architects to design the structures on the island. This required a protracted development process, and the game's release was delayed from 2013 to 2016. Original plans for release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were abandoned as the game engine became more demanding, and the team ultimately opted for an initial release on Windows and the PlayStation 4, with support for other platforms following.|$|E
40|$|Communication is {{sharing and}} {{conveying}} information. In visual communication especially visual messages {{have to be}} formulated and interpreted. The interpretation is relative to a method of information presentation method which is human construction. This holds also {{in the case of}} <b>visual</b> <b>languages.</b> The notions of syntax and semantics for <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> are not so well founded as they are for natural <b>languages.</b> <b>Visual</b> <b>languages</b> are both syntactically and semantically dense. The density is connected to the compositionality of the (pictorial) languages. In the paper Charles Sanders Peirce’s theory of signs will be used in characterizing <b>visual</b> <b>languages.</b> This allows us to relate <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> to natural languages. The foundation of information presentation methods for <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> is the logic of perception, but only if perception is understood as propositional perception. This allows us to understand better the relativity of information presentation methods, and hence to evaluate the cultural relativity of visual communication...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} use of <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> requires a precise understanding of their meaning. Moreover, {{it is impossible to}} prove properties of <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> like soundness of transformation rules or correctness results without having a formal language definition. Although this sounds obvious, it is surprising that only few work has been done about the semantics of <b>visual</b> <b>languages,</b> and even worse, there is no general framework available for the semantics specification of different <b>visual</b> <b>languages.</b> We present such a framework that is based on a rather general notion of abstract visual syntax. This framework allows a logical as well as a denotational approach to visual semantics, and it facilitates the formal reasoning about <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> and their properties. We illustrate the concepts of the proposed approach by defining abstract syntax and semantics for the <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> VEX, Show and Tell, and Euler Circles. For the latter we also prove a rule for visual reasoning. 1...|$|R

25|$|In the 14th century much of Central Asia, {{and many}} areas beyond it, were conquered by Timur (1336–1405) {{who is known}} in the west as Tamerlane. It was during Timur’s reign that the nomadic steppe culture of Central Asia fused with the settled culture of Iran. One of its {{consequences}} was an entirely new <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> that glorified Timur and subsequent Timurid rulers. This <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> was also used to articulate their commitment to Islam. Timur's large empire collapsed soon after his death, however.

40|$|In the <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> {{community}} {{there has}} been a growing consensus that <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> will be most successful in the case of special purpose languages.

This paper discusses specification of <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> and the generation of visual environments. We focus on a picture definition language, Vodl, which serves as the basis for defining the syntax of <b>visual</b> <b>languages.</b> We present the language definition and an example showing how Vodl is used in defining language syntax and thereafter generating visual editors. Finally, we discuss how to extend this approach in creating a visual specification formalism and a supporting environment for specifying the syntax and semantics of <b>visual</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R

25|$|The International Exhibition of Modern Art of 1913, {{known today}} as the Armory Show, was a {{landmark}} event {{in the history of}} art. This monumental series of exhibitions showcased the works of the most radical European artists of their time alongside those of progressive American contemporaries.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Bate Tichenor's move to Mexico in 1953, she began what would become a {{lifetime}} journey through her art and mysticism, inspired by her belief in ancestral spirits, to achieve self-realization. While painting alone and in isolation, she removed her familiar and societal masks to find her own personal human and spiritual identities; she would then reposition those hidden identities with new masks and characters in her paintings that represented her own sacred beliefs and truths. This guarded internal process of self-discovery and fulfillment was allegorically portrayed with a cast of mythological characters engaged in magical settings. She painted a dramatization of her own life and quests on canvas through an expressive <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> and an artistic vocabulary that she kept secret.|$|E
25|$|Abstract art uses a <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> of shape, form, {{color and}} line {{to create a}} {{composition}} which may exist {{with a degree of}} independence from visual references in the world. Western art had been, from the Renaissance up {{to the middle of the}} 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.|$|E

40|$|This thesis work {{presents}} a methodology for modeling and implementing <b>visual</b> <b>languages.</b> The approach {{relies on the}} syntactic framework of eXtended Positional Grammars (XPG, for short). This is a formalism to model the basic elements (visual symbols) of the visual notation, their syntactic properties, the relations between them, {{and a set of}} syntactic rules to formally define the feasible visual sentences. We present a powerful LR-based (XpLR) methodology for parsing <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> described by XPGs. The result is the possibility of describing and compiling a broad class of <b>visual</b> <b>languages</b> yet keeping most of LR parsing efficiency. We describe this new algo-rithm, named XpLR(0) parser, and provide heuristics able to solve a number of conflicts usually arising in the previous applications of LR methodology to <b>visual</b> <b>languages.</b> The expressive power of the formalism has been highlighted by modeling UML state diagram languages, which represent one of the most complex <b>visual</b> modeling <b>languages</b> used in the software engineering field.

[...] Dave Rolinson notes that, while [...] "the adaptation inevitably misses Dickens's nuanced and often unsettling prose, ... it achieves comparably skilful effects through <b>visual</b> <b>language</b> and sound, heightening theme and supernatural mood. ... The production heightens the story's crucial features of repetition and foreshadowing." ...|$|E

Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists.
