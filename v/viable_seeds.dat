5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> by apomictic seed.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has {{an aerial}} seed bank in its canopy {{in the form of}} the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which {{germinate}} and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B.speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B.speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment.|$|E

40|$|Background/Question/Methods An exotic {{haplotype}} of Phragmites australis {{is rapidly}} invading wetlands across North America {{where it can}} form large monotypic stands and out-compete native vegetation. In the Chesapeake Bay, Phragmites is more abundant in subestuaries in developed watersheds. Little is known, however, about how this plant spreads and what factors may contribute to its success. Our study addressed the role of sexual reproduction and potential for spread by seed in the invasion of Phragmites in the Chesapeake Bay. We evaluated <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production in 45 Phragmites patches from 9 subestuaries with different levels of watershed development (3 forested, 3 mixed-developed, 3 developed) to determine {{the potential impact of}} land-use on reproductive output. We also assessed patch level genetic diversity using 8 microsatellite markers to determine the contribution of genetic diversity to <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> output. Finally, we focused on four of these patches to determine the contribution of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> output to Phragmites seed bank densities. Results/Conclusions We found that Phragmites <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> production was highly variable within and among the 9 subestuaries of the Chesapeake Bay.

25|$|At {{right is}} pictured the {{national}} flower of Bhutan (Meconopsis gakyidiana), commonly called the blue poppy (though taxonomically {{it is not}} of the poppy Genus or species, but only poppy-like; thus it cannot produce opiom or its derivatives). The blue poppy (national flower of Bhutan) was the source of an ecological mystery for nearly a century, due to its misclassification as Meconopsis grandis. In 2017, after three years of field work and taxonomic studies, its classification was corrected by Bhutanese and Japanese researchers. The problem may have originally arisen due to the now understood finding that some Himalayan flora readily hybridize with each other and produce <b>viable</b> <b>seeds,</b> causing wider (and unknown) morphological diversity.|$|E
500|$|Banksia dentata, {{commonly}} known as the tropical banksia, is a species of tree in the genus Banksia. It occurs across northern Australia, southern New Guinea and the Aru Islands. Growing as a gnarled tree to [...] high, it has large green leaves up to [...] long with [...] (toothed) margins. The cylindrical yellow inflorescences (flower spikes), up to [...] high, appear over the cooler months, attracting various species of honeyeaters, sunbirds, the sugar glider and a variety of insects. Flowers fall off the ageing spikes, which swell and develop follicles containing up to two <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> each.|$|E
500|$|The high seed {{maturation}} and viability {{rates are}} offset, however, by an extremely low seedling survival rate. This is almost solely due to moisture stress. In one study, an estimated 17,100 <b>viable</b> <b>seeds</b> were released following an experimental fire. Fewer than 5% of them germinated, and only eleven plants survived the first summer drought. The last plants to die were in depressions, in shaded areas or amongst leaf litter; and the eleven survivors {{were all on}} road shoulders, where they benefited from road runoff and a [...] thick mulch of pisolitic laterite. The inevitable conclusion is that seedling survival is primarily determined by water availability.|$|E

500|$|The {{cream to}} yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, can appear {{at any time}} of year. They arise on the ends of one- or two-year-old stems and are roughly {{cylindrical}} in shape with a domed apex, measuring [...] high and [...] wide at anthesis. Each is a compound flowering structure, with a large number of individual flowers arising out of a central woody axis. A field study on the southern sandplains revealed an average count of 1369±79 on each spike. The perianth is grey-cream in bud, maturing to a more yellow or cream. The style is cream and the tip of the pollen-presenter maroon. Ageing spikes are grey, with old flowers remaining on them, and develop up to 20 large red follicles each. Roughly oval and jutting out prominently from the spike, each follicle is [...] long by [...] wide and [...] high and is covered in dense fur, red-brown initially before aging to grey. It remains closed until opened by bushfire, and contains one or two <b>viable</b> <b>seeds.</b>|$|E
500|$|Emus forage in a {{diurnal pattern}} {{and eat a}} variety of native and {{introduced}} plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as Acacia, Casuarina and grasses being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes. This provides {{a large part of}} their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from Acacia aneura until the rains arrive, after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of Cassia and in spring, they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of Santalum acuminatum, a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat, and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large <b>viable</b> <b>seeds,</b> which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland {{in the early twentieth century}} when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth (Cactoblastis cactorum [...] ) whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of biological control.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gail Wallin, {{executive}} director of the Invasive Species Council of B.C., and co-chair of the Canadian Council on Invasive Species, by 2015 it was found in all provinces in Canada except Manitoba and Saskatchewan.

[...] At Mission Point Park in Davis Bay, British Columbia municipal crews attempted to eradicate it by digging out the plant to a depth of about three metres with an excavator. It grew back twice as large the next year. To avoid an epidemic as in the United Kingdom, some provinces in Canada are pushing for relaxation of provincial limits on the use of herbicides close to waterways so knotweed can be aggressively managed with strong chemicals.

40|$|Musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.) {{has been}} the subject of {{intensive}} efforts at control in Nebraska since it was recognized as a major threat to pasture and rangelands in the late 1950 ’s. It was placed on the Nebraska noxious weed list by the Legislature in 1959, and is also considered noxious by official act of most surrounding states. Some early studies of methods to control it were published in New Zealand in 1955, 1960, 1961, and 1962 (1, 2, 3, 15), and in Nebraska in 1964, 1965, and 1968 (12, 7, 4, 5). Control methods using herbicides were most effective when plants were seedlings or undergoing active vegetative growth in the rosette stage. For many reasons, attempts at control are often delayed until the rosettes have bolted, and the plants have formed buds or begun to bloom (Figures 2 and 3). The effects of commonly used herbicide or mowing treatments at these later stages of maturity were generally observed to be variable, and the relative value of such efforts was not clear. Guidelines are needed by those concerned with economic control of musk thistle. Reports have been received of unpublished work performed in a neighboring state, which indicate that treatment with [(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid] 2, 4 -D at bud and bloom stages may nearly eliminate production of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> from musk thistle in that state. Field observation of similar treatments attempted in Nebraska indicate that such results would probably occur rarely, if at all in Nebraska. These considerations prompted the studies reported in this paper. The objectives of the experiments were:(a) To determine the reduction in numbers of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> produced by musk thistle following treatment at later stages of maturity with kinds and rates of herbicides in common use. (b) To determine the effects of mowing at the later stages of maturity on production of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> by the mowed stalks and by any regrowth. (c) To determine the stage of maturity at which terminal heads on mowed stalks of musk thistle might already contain <b>viable</b> <b>seed,</b> and how the amount of <b>viable</b> <b>seed</b> produced from such heads might increase with maturity at the time of mowing.
