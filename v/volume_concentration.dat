5|$|Various legal {{definitions}} of beer exist in different countries. Historically, {{the most famous}} of these was the Reinheitsgebot, which applied to parts of the Holy Roman Empire and Germany and required beer to be made from only water, hops, and barley. Today in Canada, the Canadian Government’s Food and Drug Regulations state that beer must have alcohol content that ranges from 1.1% to 8.6%, though it also includes a stipulation that it could be greater than 8.6% and labeled accordingly. Beer in South Korea must have less than 25% ABV, which means {{that it has to be}} 25 mL of alcohol or less per 100 mL of solution and can be considered ‘lite’ only if it has less than 30 kcal per 100ml. Additionally, beer in South Korea must use only water, hops, and starches (wheat, rice, barley, corn, or potato) as ingredients in the brewing process. In Singapore, beer must have at minimum 1.0% alcohol by <b>volume</b> <b>concentration</b> at 20°C. It is often brewed from a mixture of grains like malt, sugars or its equivalent, and hops or other vegetables.|$|E

To do this, the governing equations for base liquid and nanoparticle phase are solved numerically. The two-phase results show higher heat transfer enhancements {{in comparison to the}} homogeneous modeling results. Also, it has been observed that the relative velocity and temperature between the phases is negligible and the nanoparticles distribute in the base liquid evenly. For lower <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations,</b> base liquid contributes more than the nanoparticle in the heat transfer but, for higher <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the nanoparticle contribution is dominant.

40|$|Nanorefrigerant is {{one kind}} of nanofluids. It is the mixture of {{nanoparticles}} with refrigerants. It has better heat transfer performance than traditional refrigerants. Recently, some researches have been done about nanorefrigerants. Most of them are related to thermal conductivity of these fluids. Viscosity also deserves as much consideration as thermal conductivity. Pumping power and pressure drop depend on viscosity. In this paper, the volumetric and temperature effects over viscosity of TiO 2 /R 123 nanorefrigerants have been studied. Numerical conditions include temperature from 300 to 325 K, nanoparticle concentrations from 0. 5 % up to 2 %, mass fluxes from 150 to 200 kgm- 2 s- 1, inlet vapor qualities from 0. 2 to 0. 7 and diameter of tube from 6 to 10 mm. The effect of pressure drop {{with the increase of}} viscosity has also been investigated. Based on the analysis it is found that viscosity of nanorefrigerant increased accordingly with the increase of nanoparticle <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations</b> and decreases with the increment of temperature. Furthermore, pressure drop augmented significantly with the intensification of <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations</b> and vapor quality. Therefore, low <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations</b> of nanorefrigerant are suggested for better performance of a refrigeration system...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{long-term}} and temporary measurements {{were conducted to}} study the improvement of air quality in Beijing during Olympic Games period (8 – 24 August 2008). To evaluate actions taken to improve the air quality, comparisons of particle number and volume size distributions of August 2008 and 2004 – 2007 were performed. The total particle number and <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations</b> were 14 000 cm− 3 and 37 μm 3 cm− 3 in August of 2008, respectively. These were reductions of 41 % and 35 % compared with the mean values of August 2004 – 2007. A cluster analysis on air mass history and source apportionment were performed, exploring reasons of the reduction of particle concentrations. Back trajectories were classified into five major clusters. Air mass from south direction are always associated with pollution events during the summertime of Beijing. In August 2008, the frequency of air mass arriving from south has been twice higher compared to {{the average of the}} previous years, these southerly air masses did however not result in elevated particle <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations</b> in Beijing. This result implied that the air mass history was not the key factor, explaining reduced particle number and <b>volume</b> <b>concentrations</b> during the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Four factors were found influencing particle concentrations using a Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. They were identified to local and remote traffic emissions, combustion sources as well as secondary transformation. The reductions of the four sources were calculated to 47 %, 44 %, 43 % and 30 %, respectively.

Often, sample preparation itself for mass spectrometry can be avoided by coupling mass spectrometry to a chromatography method, or some other form of separation before entering the mass spectrometer.
