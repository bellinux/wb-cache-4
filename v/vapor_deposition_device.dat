40|$|Gas {{aggregation}} is a {{well known}} method used to produce clusters of different materials with good size control, reduced dispersion, and precise stoichiometry. The cost of these systems is relatively high and they are generally dedicated apparatuses. Furthermore, the usual sample production speed of these systems is not as fast as physical <b>vapor</b> <b>deposition</b> <b>devices</b> posing a problem when thick samples are needed. In this paper we describe {{the development of a}} multipurpose gas aggregation system constructed as an adaptation to a magnetron sputtering system. The cost of this adaptation is negligible and its installation and operation are both remarkably simple. The gas flow for flux in the range of 60 - 130 SCCM (SCCM denotes cubic centimeter per minute at STP) is able to completely collimate all the sputtered material, producing spherical nanoparticles. Co nanoparticles were produced and characterized using electron microscopy techniques and Rutherford back-scattering analysis.

Silicon nitride is deposited from silane and ammonia gas mixture diluted in argon in the 13. 56 MHz RF plasma with adjustable power. The conditions of deposition experiments were modified alternating the silane to ammonia flow ratio and the RF power, while other process parameters were supposed to be constant. The process responses measured were the deposition rate, film thickness, refractive index, surface morphology and film composition. It was found a strong influence of silane to ammonia flow ratio to the deposition rate, the refractive index and the composition of the film. Greater ratios, causing higher deposition rates, tend to give the lower refractive index, poorer surface and lower nitrogen content in resulting film. The RF power was also found to non-linearly influence the deposition rate and resulting film properties.
