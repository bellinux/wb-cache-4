40|$|Abstract ? The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype diversity in new commercial irrigated rice fields in the Araguaia River Valley, state of Tocantins, Brazil. The causal agent of rice blast has heavily affected rice production in the region. Despite the efforts of breeding programs, blast resistance breakdown has been recorded shortly {{after the release of}} new resistant cultivars developed for the region. Among the causes of resistance breakage is the capacity of the fungus to rapidly develop new pathotypes. A sample of 479 M. oryzae monosporic isolates was obtained and tested using the international rice blast differential set. Isolate collections were made in small areas designed as trap nurseries and in scattered sites in their <b>vicinity.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of 250 M. oryzae isolates from three trap nurseries indicated the presence of 45 international M. oryzae races belonging to seven pathotype groups (IA-IG). In the isolates tested, 61 M. oryzae pathotypes belonging to all but the IH group were detected. The new areas of irrigated rice in the Araguaia River Valley have the highest diversity of M. oryzae pathotypes reported so far in Brazil. 201...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the identification of}} quantitative trait loci (QTL) for important traits in cattle line crosses. One of these traits is birth weight of calves, which affects both animal production and welfare through correlated effects on parturition and subsequent growth. Birth weight {{was one of the}} traits measured in the Davies' Gene Mapping Project. These data form the motivation for the methods presented in this thesis. Multiple QTL models have been previously proposed and are likely to be superior to single QTL models. The multiple QTL models can be loosely divided into two categories : 1) model building methods that aim to generate good models that contain only a subset of all the potential QTL; and 2) methods that consider all the observed marker explanatory variables. The first set of methods can be misleading if an incorrect model is chosen. The second set of methods does not have this limitation. However, a full fixed effect analysis is generally not possible as the number of marker explanatory variables is typically large with respect to the number of observations. This can be overcome by using constrained estimation methods or by making the marker effects random. One method of constrained estimation is the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO). This method has the appealing ability to produce predictions of effects that are identically zero. The LASSO can also be specified as a random model where the effects follow a double exponential distribution. In this thesis, the LASSO is investigated from a random effects model perspective. Two methods to approximate the marginal likelihood are presented. The first uses the standard form for the double exponential distribution and requires adjustment of the score equations for unbiased estimation. The second is based on an alternative probability model for the double exponential distribution. It was developed late in the candidature and gives similar dispersion parameter estimates to the first approximation, but does so in a more direct manner. The alternative LASSO model suggests some novel types of predictors. Methods for a number of different types of predictors are specified and are compared for statistical efficiency. Initially, inference for the LASSO effects is performed using simulation. Essentially, this treats the random effects as fixed effects and tests the null hypothesis that the effect is zero. In simulation studies, it is shown to be a useful method to identify important effects. However, the effects are random, so such a test is not strictly appropriate. After the specification of the alternative LASSO model, a method for making probability statements about the random effects being above or below zero is developed. This method is based on the predictive distribution of the random effects (posterior in Bayesian terminology). The random LASSO model is not sufficiently flexible to model most QTL mapping data. Typically, these data arise from large experiments and require models containing terms for experimental design. For example, the Davies' Gene Mapping experiment requires fixed effects for different sires, a covariate for birthdate within season and random normal effects for management group. To accommodate these sources of variation a mixed model is employed. The marker effects are included into this model as random LASSO effects. Estimation of the dispersion parameters is based on an approximate restricted likelihood (an extension of the first method of estimation for the simple random effects model). Prediction of the random effects is performed using a generalisation of Henderson's mixed model equations. The performance of the LASSO linear mixed model for QTL identification is assessed via simulation. It performs well against other commonly used methods but it may lack power for lowly heritable traits in small experiments. However, the rate of false positives in such situations is much lower. Also, the LASSO method is more precise in locating the correct marker rather than a marker in its <b>vicinity.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the Davies' Gene Mapping Data using the methods described in this thesis identified five non-zero marker-within-sire effects (there were 570 such effects). This analysis clearly shows that most of the genome does not affect the trait of interest. The simulation results and the analysis of the Davies' Gene Mapping Project Data show that the LASSO linear mixed model is a competitive method for QTL identification. It provides a flexible method to model the genetic and experimental effects simultaneously. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] School of Agriculture, Food and Wine, 2006...|$|E

When ceramic and spatial data were combined, patterns emerged suggesting that fewer hinterland sites were occupied during the height of Town Creek's occupation, and more hinterland sites were occupied when Town Creek's population was dwindling.

40|$|The recognition, {{internalization}} and intracellular {{processing of}} antigen {{are the main}} functions of dendritic cells (DCs). In the course of these processes, DCs differentiate and acquire the ability to produce cytokines responsible for polarization of the immunological response. Therefore, vaccination with tumor antigen-loaded DCs {{is one of the}} most promising approaches to induce tumor-specific immune response. The purpose of this study was to analyze the migratory abilities, from an injection site to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tLN), of DCs applied as an anti-tumor vaccine and their capacity for immune response activation. Mouse DCs of the established JAWS II cell line transduced with EGFP gene or ex vivo bone marrow-isolated DCs (BM-DCs) stained with intravital CFDA dye were loaded with MC 38 colon carcinoma tumor lysate (TAg) and then administered peritumorally to MC 38 tumor-bearing C 57 BL/ 6 mice. On the first, third, fifth and seventh days after injection the tumors, tLNs and spleens were examined. The TAg-loaded DCs migrated more effectively to the tLNs than did the unloaded control DCs; however, the majority of them remained in the tumor <b>vicinity.</b> Immunohistological <b>analysis</b> of the tumor tissues demonstrated that only TAg-loaded DCs activated an immune response. Seven days after DCs vaccine administration, numerous necrotic areas and some apoptotic bodies were observed in the tumor tissue. However, the anti-MC 38 tumor cytotoxic activity of spleen and tLN cells from mice treated with both TAg-loaded and unloaded DCs reached a maximum on the fifth day after DC injection. Concluding, TAg-loaded DCs migrated more efficiently to tLNs and were more effective activators of local (but not systemic) cellular immune response than were unloaded DCs. We hypothesize that only the application of TAg-loaded DCs to tumor-bearing mice as an adjuvant supporting chemotherapy may activate a more effective anti-tumor response...|$|R

Air quality is being affected adversely due to several reasons such as increasing number of industries without having proper emission handling systems and increasing number of vehicles. Many industrial stacks observed in Sri Lanka today are not constructed according to the proper stack design requirements. The quality of stack emissions or the dispersion of pollutants from a specific stack is seldom analyzed mainly because of the high costs involved. Even analysis is done on the dispersion from a specific stack it is difficult to get good representative results because the meteorological conditions vary frequently. In this study a stack emission dispersion model named AUSPLUME which is developed by the Victorian Environmental Protection Authority and recommended by several organizations for 'regulatory purpose was studied. This work mainly looks at the following: 1. The applicability of the model in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 11. Model emissions from the stacks at Holcim Lanka cement plant at Puttlam with the use of AUSPLUME before and after installing a new dust handling system The purpose of the EIA is to predict and identify potentially significant environmental impacts of development projects and to suggest mitigation measures to minimize the negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts. Main stages in the EIA process are, 1. Screening (find out whether an EIA is required) 11. Scoping (identification of main issues) lll. Collection and analysis of information IV. Public involvement v. Communicating the findings In the process of analyzing the information AUSPLUME can be used. With available information about the stack, emissions and the meteorological data of the area of concern, the model can predict the concentrations of selected constituents at ground level or elevated levels in the down wind direction. The areas of worst impact, limit of the buffer zone, effects to the high rise buildings or effects to the selected areas of important like high bio diversity, archeology, and residences can be identified using the results obtained with AUSPLUME. For the analysis of the stack emission dispersion from the Holcim Lanka cement plant at Puttlam, the meteorological data obtained at the Palavi weather monitoring station of the Meteorological Department were used. There are two similar stacks at the factory which are placed close by and therefore both of them were considered as a single point source with an equivalent diameter. The area was considered to be a flat terrain since there were no disturbances in the <b>vicinity.</b> The <b>analysis</b> results on the dispersion of particulate matter, NOz and SOz emissions from the stack were compared with ambient air quantity standards for Sri Lanka and European Guideline values which were established by considering human health hazards other than carcinogenity. Certain values were found to be above the limits and the rest below the limit. Anyway in this analysis raw emission data were used and in the real life the raw emissions are mixed with clean air before released to the atmosphere. Therefore due to the dilution the real values can be expected to be much lower. Predicted values were compared with field measurement values available and with predicted values from SCREEN 3 model. The results obtained can be used for decision making purposes with a good understanding about their inaccuracy...|$|R
40|$|Summary Tropical {{deforestation}} {{has strong}} impacts on many ecosystem {{services such as}} global climate regulation, preservation of biodiversity and regulation of sediment and water fluxes. Not surprisingly, the monitoring of tropical deforestation processes has {{received a lot of}} attention from both policy makers and scientists during the last decades. Recent reports show that several tropical South American and Asian countries were, during the last decades, able to slow down and even reverse the deforestation trend and enter a phase of net reforestation. However, in most tropical African countries this so called forest transition was not observed. Despite an extensive body of literature on the causes of tropical deforestation the mechanisms that steer a region towards the path of sustainable agricultural intensification (with a forest transition) or towards the path of unsustainable expansion of marginal farming land are not yet fully understood because of two reasons: (1) many studies focus on individual cases which are not necessarily representative at a regional scale level, (2) regional scale studies are often based on statistical relations between proxy-data thereby neglecting characteristics and motivations of individual households that take certain decisions in specific socio-economic contexts. The overall objective of this thesis was to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the causes of tropical deforestation by (1) evaluating land use decisions made by individual households and by (2) up scaling and extrapolating the findings to a regional scale level. Southwest Ethiopia was selected as a case study area because: (1) this region still holds an important reserve of natural or semi-natural forest resources, (2) the region has been characterized by an exponential population growth both by high birth rates and by (forced) resettlement programs, (3) the area provides food for its local population but has also the potential to produce coffee as cash crop of global significance. In order to address the overall objective of this thesis, the following specific research questions were formulated: What are the livelihoods of households in southwest Ethiopia and to what extent can they be correlated with observed deforestation patterns? To what extent are rural-rural migrations and resettlement programs responsible for accelerated deforestation? To what extent is deforestation at regional scale steered by the competition between subsistence farmers and cash crop farmers? Is it possible to develop optimal scenarios? The first research question was addressed by developing a livelihood typology on the basis of household interviews in 9 villages in Mana district, Jimma zone of the Oromia regional state. A spatial analysis of observed deforestation patterns (1957 - 2007) showed that both livelihood type and the accessibility to markets has controlled to a large extent the spatial pattern of deforestation during the past 50 years. Forest was lost mainly at remote locations away from the main roads where market integration is difficult. Farmers in these locations are relatively poor and self-subsistent which implies that population increase automatically led to new deforestation. Places very near to market places were spared from deforestation because of the presence of off-farm jobs in the towns. Significantly less deforestation was observed in areas that are suitable for the growth of shaded coffee. The areas above 2000 m. a. s. l that are not suited for shaded coffee are typically inhabited by relatively poor households who are living far from roadsides and thus are less integrated to the surrounding major markets. As a result, they depend more on subsistence farming causing more deforestation than other households. In order to address the second research question, the location of recent immigrants was mapped in 8 rural villages and a single town in Dedo district, Jimma zone. Land use practices of both the indigenous and new immigrants were characterized by means household interviews and focus group discussions. By means of a buffer analyses it was evaluated to what extent more deforestation occurred in the surroundings of immigrant households. The analysis showed that the study area lost 80 % of its forest cover over the past five decades (1957 - 2007). Demographic growth due to resettlement programs and a shift in livelihood system introduced by settlers were identified as key drivers of deforestation. Moreover, lack of awareness, habitat destruction to deter crop-damaging wild pests, wood extraction for fuel, charcoal, and construction material aggravated deforestation. The third research question was addressed by mapping forest cover change at regional scale (ca. 40, 000 km¬≤) through interpretation of Landsat images of 1986 and 2006. Secondly, the physical land suitability for maize and coffee cultivation was evaluated for all land units in the study area on the basis of land characteristics and crop requirements. This allowed to assess potential crop yields. By evaluation of location-specific production and transportation costs, potential profits for both coffee and maize were assessednbsp;the different land units. On the basis of this information land use optimization scenariosnbsp; 2030 were developed focusing on either food security (FS) or profit maximization (PM) with or without protection of the existing forest areas. Results of the regional forest cover change analysis showed that the forest cover in the study area has declined by 18 % between 1986 and 2006 which was mainly driven by expansion of subsistence and commercial farms. The high demand for agricultural land by smallholder farmers was fueled by increasing population pressure caused bynbsp;natural increase asnbsp;as immigration from 1970 onwards. Results from land evaluation revealed that the spatial patterns of land suitability (except for some overlaps in few localities) reflect the real situation on the ground whereby coffee and maize cultivation are ideally suitable in the eastern and southwestern parts of the study area respectively. Crop yield assessments showed that at present farmers in the study area reach an average coffee yield of ca. 0. 56 ton ha- 1 and an average maize yield of 2. 47 ton ha- 1 Because of high transportation costs in comparison with the market prices, in most cases it is not profitable to bring maize to the market. Coffee on the other hand has a higher market price and can be sold with profits on the market places. Results from FS scenarios showed that food security can‚Äôt be guaranteed through an increasing market price for maize. It isnbsp;through enhancing land productivity that it is possible to produce sufficient amount of maize yield to feed the growing population. However, all the non-forest protection FS-scenarios showed the possibility of meeting the future food demand by extending maize cultivation into the existing forest area. However, a future increase of the maize yield by 50 % would result in a landscape with a higher forest cover by 2030. In all the profit maximization (PM) scenarios, maize can never compete with coffee not even with an increase in maize price (+ 30 %) or an increase of the maize productivity (+ 50 %). This would imply that all maize farmers should convert to coffee growing resulting in a forested landscape. The fact that at present maize is still grown by the majority of the farmers can be considered as a result of an economic lock-in. It is obvious that both farmers and the environment would benefit from an increase of the coffee forest whereby the area is no longer producing its own food for consumption but cash incomes are generated via the sale of coffee. But the opposite evolution was detected: over the last decades an increasing population resulted in an ongoing deforestation mainly for maize production. Reasons for this evolution are the fact that most farmers can‚Äôt make the necessary initial investments for the cultivation of coffee. Since it takes a minimum of three years before coffee plants can be harvested, financial reserves are necessary to bridge this gap. Since very few farmers can afford such reserves they are stuck in self-subsistence and low productive maize production. Moreover, the lack of local capital makes the area also very vulnerable for land grabbing by (foreign) investors outside of the study area whereby potential profits would leave the study area. A way out of this lock-in could be an increase of the maize yield and an improvement of the accessibility of remote locations thereby lowering transportation costs to market places. This would allow farmers to generate a food surplusnbsp;could then be invested in coffee cultivation.
