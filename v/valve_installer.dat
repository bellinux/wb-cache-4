50|$|The {{reversing}} valve has two states, relaxed and energized. The energized state is typically achieved by applying 24 volts AC, which {{is commonly used}} in HVAC. The heat pump can be designed by the manufacturer to produce cooling or heating with the {{reversing valve}} in the relaxed state. When the reversing valve is energized, it will produce the opposite conditioning. In other words, a reversing <b>valve</b> <b>installed</b> {{in such a way}} as to produce cooling when relaxed will produce heating when energized. Likewise, a reversing <b>valve</b> <b>installed</b> to produce heating when relaxed will produce cooling when energized.|$|R

50|$|The {{first use}} of NOREM was as {{replacement}} discs in three Chemical Volume Control System isolation valves at Consolidated Edison's Indian Point unit 2.

5000|$|Most {{downhole}} safety <b>valves</b> <b>installed</b> {{as part of}} {{the completion}} design are classed as [...] "tubing retrievable". This means that they are installed as a component of the completion string and run in during completion. Retrieving the valve, should it malfunction, requires a workover. The full name for this most common type of downhole safety valve is a Tubing Retrievable Surface Controlled Sub-Surface Valve, shortened in completion diagrams to TRSCSSV.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{recirculating}} engine-out gases into the intake manifold {{on the cold}} start of direct-injection diesel engines is investigated. Two types of recirculation are examined. The first is low-pressure recirculation of engine-out gases into the intake manifold where their rate is controlled by a gas recirculation (GR) <b>valve</b> <b>installed</b> between the exhaust and intake mani-fold. The second is high-pressure recirculation by restricting {{the flow of the}} engine-out gases using a butterfly (BF) <b>valve,</b> <b>installed</b> in the exhaust system after the turbocharger to increase the back pressure and the rate of recirculated gases. Since there is no combustion during cranking, these gases contain evaporated hydrocarbons and partial oxidation products, mostly formaldehyde (HCHO). Experimental investigations on a four-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine indicated that high rates of cranking gas recirculation (CGR) increase the ignition delay and lengthen the cranking period. Since higher concentrations of hydrocarbons (HC) are expected to enhance the autoignition process, it is suspected that the recirculated HCHO would have an opposite effect. These opposing effects are investigated using the ChemKin die-sel cycle simulation model. The model results demonstrated the effect of HCHO on slowing the autoignition and combustion reactions...|$|R
50|$|Gas is {{injected}} into the cylinder inlet manifold by individual gas electromagnetic <b>valves</b> <b>installed</b> {{as close to the}} suction valves as possible. The valves are separately timed and controlled by injection control unit. This system interrupts the gas supply to the cylinder during the long overlap of the suction and exhaust valves (just typical for slow-speed and medium-speed engines - within the valve overlap cylinder scavenging is performed). This avoids substantial gas losses and prevents dangerous gas flow to the exhaust manifold.|$|R

His workshops were fully equipped and employed several people, there he designed and manufactured experimental balloons and meteorological instruments.|$|R

50|$|Other {{reconstruction}} measures {{included the}} installation of axle box tightening wedges and {{the replacement of the}} Krauss-Helmholtz bogies. Despite often expressed views to the contrary, the valves were not replaced or rebuilt as part of the reconstruction. The 52.80 had standard piston valves with Winterthur pressure equalisation and hence poor riding qualities when running light. Not until the 1980s were Trofimoff valves and cylinder safety <b>valves</b> <b>installed</b> on some locomotives at RAW Meiningen. This improved the riding performance hugely when the engines ran without a train, something which was also noticeable in terms of savings in lubricants and fuel.|$|R
50|$|The {{gas-lift}} mandrel is {{a device}} {{installed in the}} tubing string of a gas-lift well onto which or into which a gas-lift valve is fitted. There are two common types of mandrels. In a conventional gas-lift mandrel, a gas-lift <b>valve</b> is <b>installed</b> as the tubing {{is placed in the}} well. Thus, to replace or repair the valve, the tubing string must be pulled. In the side-pocket mandrel, however, the <b>valve</b> is <b>installed</b> and removed by wireline while the mandrel is still in the well, eliminating the need to pull the tubing to repair or replace the valve.|$|R

Steady state simulations of the blood flow through the blood chamber of Pediatric Ventricular Assist Device (PVAD) have been performed with ANSYS CFX 14. 0. Main assumptions in the present paper have included: motionless discs, rigid walls, non-Newtonian model of blood.

The brake segment that was supposed to have stopped the purple train failed, and the purple train continued until it collided with the stopped red train. An investigation showed that a faulty brake <b>valve,</b> <b>installed</b> a few days earlier by Disney (not by the ride manufacturer Intamin), was the cause.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes {{called a}} check valve or a {{backflow}} preventer, a chemigation valve is an apparatus designed to protect water supplies from agricultural chemicals used during chemigation, the application of chemicals such as fertilizers and pesticides through irrigation water. [...] Most chemigation valves consist of a spring-loaded check valve, a low pressure drain, an air and vacuum relief valve, and an injection port for introducing the chemicals downstream of the check valve. Many chemigation valves also have a 4-inch inspection port so that a person can reach inside and feel if the check valve is still functional. Some governments {{require the use of}} two chemigation <b>valves</b> <b>installed</b> in series if hazardous chemicals are to be injected.|$|R

50|$|Until recently, constant-flow systems set the {{standard}} in HVAC system design.

However, the energy usage is high, since these systems and the pumps driving them rarely operate at the 100% load they were designed for, calling into question the effectiveness of balancing this type of system in the first place. Further, the process of proportional balancing to commission the system is long, painstaking and expensive.|$|R
