High-precision, safe and efficient <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is a challenge for pipeline transportation.

5000|$|A <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. <b>Gate</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the <b>gate</b> <b>valve,</b> the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|R

Injection pressure can be controlled by <b>valve</b> <b>gate</b> open timing. In this work, we decided the <b>valve</b> <b>gate</b> open timing to minimize the injection pressure.

In order to reduce computational cost, we performed an approximate optimization using meta-models that replaced expensive computer simulations.

30|$|The {{important}} inherent nonlinearities {{requirements and}} the physical constraints enjoined by the system dynamics of the generation units are taken into consideration to obtain an accurate perception for the EPS. One {{of the most important}} constraints of power plants is the rate of generation power change because of the limitation of mechanical movements. The physical system dynamics of power plants is represented by GRC and the maximum/minimum limit of the <b>valve</b> <b>gate</b> (i.e., governor deadband (GDB)). The GRC limits the generation rate of output power, which is given as 20 % pu. MW/minute, and 10 % pu MW/minute for non-reheat and reheat turbines, respectively. However, the actual GRC of the hydraulic power plant is about 50 % pu MW/minute, which is higher than the generation rate corresponding to any practical disturbance and hence it will be neglected [22]. On the other side, the GDB restricts the valve opening/closing. Where the GDB of the non-reheat and reheat power plants equal ± 0.05, while the GDB of the hydraulic power plant is ± 0.01. In this paper, the RESs have low-order dynamic models, which are considered sufficient for frequency stability analysis as reported in [22, 26]. Therefore, the power variations of RESs; the wind power variation (∆PWT) and the PV solar power variation (∆PPV), and the load power variation (∆PL) are considered as disturbance signals to the EPS.|$|E

The coupling method is applied to compressible flow in hydraulic systems. The MOC code is implemented {{as a set of}} boundary conditions in the OpenFOAM open source CFD software. The coupling is realized by two linear equations originating from the characteristics equation and the Riemann constant equation, respectively. The coupling method is validated using three simple water hammer cases and several coupling configurations.

This paper deals with the experimental analysis and numerical simulation regarding the flow forces of a mechatronical pressure regulator for natural gas powered internal combustion engines. For the experimental analysis a measurement device was constructed to determine these forces {{as well as other}} global flow parameters by variation of the pressure ratio and the strokes of the <b>valve</b> <b>gate.</b> The series of tests were simulated {{on the basis of the}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -code FLUENT. Thereby the model was validated through the comparison of the results deriving from the experimental analysis and the results provided by the numerical simulation. It was shown that the flow forces have a strong dependence on the pressure ratio but are not influenced by the mass flow rate. Accordingly the flow forces are independent of the stroke. By the use of the numerical simulation a visualization of the inner flow characteristics was obtained. Thus the potential for an improvement in the geometry was derived. Besides a generation of eddies in the low and high pressure chamber, backflow occurred in the valve bung as a result of shocks. This took place at low pressure ratios and resulted in a decreasing flow coefficient due to contraction and deceleration of the fluid entering the control edge. At high pressure ratios, a relocation of the flow contraction towards the theoretical flow cross sectional area and a decreasing of the generation and impact of eddies in the valve bung were detected. mp 201...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel piezoelectrically actuated microvalve for flow control in fuel cells. A fuel cell is an electrochemical device, which directly converts chemical energy {{stored in a}} fuel (e. g. hydrogen) and an oxidizer (e. g. oxygen) directly into electrical energy. Poor flow distributions within the cell {{have been attributed to}} degraded performance and even damage. In this study, it is proposed to embed microvalves directly into the fuel cells to manage the gas flows and improve efficiency, performance, and reliability. The microvalve has four parts. The actuator is a piezoelectric trimorph which has two piezoelectric layers and one brass layer sandwiched between them and has dimensions of 20000 x 4000 x 290 microns. It also has a <b>valve</b> <b>gate</b> placed on the tip. For a 5 -volt input, a deflection of 32 microns can be achieved in the trimorph tip, which is what modulates the flow through the valve. The valve design and analysis are complete. Maximum stress on the bender reaches up to 60 Mpa when the the fluidic and thermal forces are at their maximum. This maximum stress is below the tensile dynamic strength values of piezoelectric and brass layers used. A minimum factor of safety of 1. 5 is obtained at 20 degrees C. At the operating temperature, which is about 100 degrees C the factor of safety is higher since the stresses are much lower. The drag and pressure forces are found to reduce the free deflection by only 0. 2 microns whereas the thermal expansion forces increases the deflection almost by the same amount.
