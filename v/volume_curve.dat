5000|$|Another type of {{curve is}} called the {{logarithmic}} ratio (also known as [...] "audio taper", or an inverse-logarithmic ratio. [...] the log/audio-taper more closely matches human hearing, with finer control at lower levels, increasing dramatically past the 50% point. Here {{it is important to}} remember that the perceived volume of a sound has a logarithmic relationship with its level in decibels. A fade that works on a logarithmic scale would thus counteract the curve of a linear fade. In fade-ins the shape of the perceived <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> looks like the level in decibels pulled towards the middle part of the line to the bottom right corner. The fade-out in turn looks like it has been pulled toward the bottom-left corner. A logarithmic fade takes a line that has already been curved and straightens it out 15. The logarithmic fade sounds consistent and smooth since the perceived volume is increased over the whole duration of the fade. This makes this curve very handy for fading standard pieces of music. It is best used on a long fade-out since the fade has a perceived linear nature. Also a fade-out sounds very neutral when incorporated to parts of music with natural ambience. In cross-fades this type of curve sounds very natural. When this curve is applied the perceived volume of the fade’s midpoint is at about 50% of the maximum - when the two sections are summed the output volume is fairly constant.|$|E

Pulsations can easily be concealed due to the small movements of the aneurysm wall, making post-processing highly demanding. We hypothesized that the quantification of aneurysm pulsation is technically feasible and can be improved by computer-aided post-processing. Images of 14 cerebral aneurysms were acquired with an ECG-triggered 4 D CTA. Aneurysms were post-processed manually and computer-aided on a 3 D model. <b>Volume</b> <b>curves</b> and random noise-curves were compared with the arterial pulse wave and <b>volume</b> <b>curves</b> were compared between both post-processing modalities.

When the aluminum oxide was exposed to cavitation, the erosion originated at defects such as pores and holes. Particles were removed granule by granule, and the erosion pits spread throughout the speciment surface. The number of erosion pits increased exponentially. By the analyses of multiplication and annihilation process of the erosion pits, {{the model of the}} <b>volume</b> loss <b>curve</b> was established. The <b>volume</b> loss rate <b>curve</b> u and the <b>volume</b> loss <b>curve</b> V with exposure time were expressed by three parameters α, β and c in the following equation. u=α/β 1 /(1 +e^), V=α/βt- 1 /βln((1 +C) /(1 +ce^)) Especially, the parameter c relates to a reciprocal of the initial volume loss rate, and was estimated to be low for the material with high initial defect density. As was expected, the value of c is lower for aluminum oxide than that for pure copper, and the value is lower for a roughened specimen of copper than that for a smooth specimen.

We studied whether this feature was in relation with access recirculation. Firstly, we studied if the manoeuvre of reversed position of the blood lines created the same feature in the blood <b>volume</b> <b>curve.</b> Secondly, two medical teams systematically checked {{for the presence of}} spikes and measured the access recirculation by way of an ultrasound dilution technique. The manoeuvre of reversed position of the blood lines invariably reproduced the same feature on the curve of the optical blood volume measurement in case of a recirculation greater than 20 %. In the normal position of the blood lines, the 16 patients with an access recirculation greater than 20 % had spikes.

The special spike of the optical blood <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> occurring during the ID measurement clearly detects access recirculation.

The volumes between 25 - 50 % (V 25 - 50) and 25 - 75 % (V 25 - 75) of the expiratory carbon dioxide tension versus <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> were determined in 29 emphysematous patients (20 severely obstructed and 9 moderately obstructed), 12 asthma patients in exacerbation of symptoms, and 28 healthy controls.

With regard to phase 2 of the expiratory CO 2 versus <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> (mixture of anatomic deadspace and alveolar air), a plot of intercept versus slope of the relationships of (V 25 - 50) and (V 25 - 75) versus inspiratory volume (VI) from functional residual capacity (FRC), obtained during natural breathing frequency, proved to be most discriminating in the separation between healthy controls and severely obstructed emphysema patients. Separating healthy controls and severely obstructed emphysema patients {{on the basis of the}} discriminant line for V 25 - 50, 9 of the 12 asthma patients in exacerbation were classified as normal, and only 5 of the 9 moderately obstructed emphysema patients as emphysematous.

It is suggested that NTG produces disproportionate dila-tation of the arterial system, having its greatest effect on arteries near the heart, including the coronaries and great vessels branching off the aorta, and on left intraventricular cavity pressure.

These tests were designed to demonstrate the impact of ammonia- nitrogen and sodium chloride on the biological degradation process. The anaerobic test set-up includes bench-scale test reactors and respirometers used for measuring gas production volume and rate. The experimental data using the gas production volumes and rates were plotted and analyzed. The hourly rate of gas production significantly decreases before the daily production volume decreases. Also, the gas production <b>volume</b> <b>curves</b> showed little or no toxicity when the gas production rates showed toxicity and acclimation.

40|$|Analysis of airflow in the {{terminal}} portion of the maximal expiratory flow <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> has been suggested as a useful test for the early diagnosis of chronic airways obstruction. Whether such an analysis can identify early disease, and whether any subsequent action can prevent the progress of chronic airways obstruction, is unknown and will require prospective studies. As a precursor of such a study {{we have tried to}} establish the intrasubject variability of those tests of forced expiration which may be used for screening. We therefore measured expiratory flow volume curves of five healthy males and five healthy females aged 20 - 30 years as this is an age-group in which early detection of airways obstruction may be of value. Flow volume curves were obtained on the same day of the week for six weeks, and on three separate days during this period we carried out three flow volume curves every hour from 9 am to 6 pm. The data were subjected to analysis of variance to determine the variability of each measurement. Data were collected from forced expired volume in one second (FEV 1) forced vital capacity (FVC), maximum expiratory flow rates at 50 % and 75 % of expired vital capacity, and forced expiratory time (FET). The results showed no consistent pattern of diurnal variation over the working day. The variation in any subject for FEV 1 and FVC over the study period was considerably less than variations detected in the maximal expiratory flow rates at 50 % and 75 % of the expired vital capacity and FET. Our results suggest that the intrasubject variation found in flow rates of {{the terminal}} portion of the maximal expiratory flow <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> and forced expiratory time may limit the usefulness of these tests in detecting early airways obstruction. FEV 1 and FVC are more reproducible tests and are therefore particularly suited for cross-sectional screening.

It determines susceptibility to stress as well as stress coping styles. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to assess whether healthy subjects differ from bronchial asthma patients with regard to temperamental variables and stress coping styles, and whether these factors may also differentiate patients with severe asthma from those with the milder form. The study also assesses whether the results of flow <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> analysis correlate with temperamental traits and stress coping styles. Material and methods : The study was conducted in a group of 65 asthma patients and 62 healthy controls. All underwent flow <b>volume</b> <b>curve</b> examination and psychological tests: Formal Characteristics of Behavior – Temperament Inventory (FCB-TI) and Coping in Stress Situations (CISS) questionnaire.

The remaining temperamental traits and stress coping styles did not differ between the groups. Additionally, the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) value was found to correlate negatively with the intensity of the emotion-oriented stress coping style, whereas FEV 1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) were found to positively correlate with briskness, emotional reactivity and endurance, while a negative correlation was found with activity.
