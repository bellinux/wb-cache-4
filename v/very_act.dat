5|$|Potbelly sculptures {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they have been associated with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic hearth. A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of giving birth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{governance}} of the jurists Gregorius, Aurelius Arcadius Charisius, and Hermogenianus, the imperial government began issuing official books of precedent, collecting and listing all the rescripts that had been issued from the reign of Hadrian (r. 117–38) to the reign of Diocletian. The Codex Gregorianus includes rescripts up to 292, which the Codex Hermogenianus updated with a comprehensive collection of rescripts issued by Diocletian in 293 and 294. Although the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of codification was a radical innovation, given the precedent-based design of the Roman legal system, the jurists were generally conservative, and constantly looked to past Roman practice and theory for guidance. They were probably given more free rein over their codes than the later compilers of the Codex Theodosianus (438) and Codex Justinianus (529) would have. Gregorius and Hermogenianus' codices lack the rigid structuring of later codes, and were not published {{in the name of}} the emperor, but in the names of their compilers. Their official character, however, was clear in that both collections were subsequently acknowledged by courts as authoritative records of imperial legislation up to the date of their publication and regularly updated.|$|E

The Fifth Amendment provides that no person “shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.” The Supreme Court has, since 1976, applied the so-called “act-of-production doctrine.” Under this doctrine, a person can invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against the production of documents only where the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of producing the documents is incriminating in itself.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Klaeber, among others, {{argued for}} a {{connection}} between Beowulf and Virgil near {{the start of the}} 20th century, claiming that the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely. Similarly, in 1971, Alistair Campbell stated that the apologue technique used in Beowulf is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed Beowulf could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across Virgil's writings.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of conceiving and {{creating}} his {{city in the}} northern swamps, Peter has imposed order on the primeval natural scene depicted {{at the beginning of}} the poem. The city itself, ‘graceful yet austere’ in its classical design, is, as much as the Falconet statue, Peter’s living monument, carrying on his struggle against the ‘wild, tumultuous’ Finnish waves.Its granite banks may hold the unruly elements in check for most of the time, but even they are helpless against such a furious rebellion as the flood of 1824. The waves’ victory is, admittedly, short-lived: the flood soon recedes and the city returns to normal. Even so, it is clear that they can never be decisively defeated;they live to fight another day.|$|E

25|$|Maimonides and Nachmanides {{differed}} {{about the}} reason for the sacrificial system. Maimonides wrote that {{the reason for}} the offerings was because when the Israelites lived in Egypt and Chaldea, the Egyptians worshipped sheep and the Chaldeans worshipped demons in the form of goats. And people in India never slaughter cattle. Thus God commanded the Israelites to slaughter cattle, sheep, and goats to God, so that worshipers of the other lands would know that God required the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> that they considered to be the utmost sin, and through that act God would forgive Israel's sins. God thus intended to cure the people of the other nations of false beliefs, which Maimonides characterized as diseases of the soul, for diseases are healed by medicines that are antithetical to the diseases.|$|E

The tide was out and his boats so loaded that only by great skill was he able to cross it with his sloop, and escape; for the French, who had at once attempted to prevent his landing and thus to capture his cannon and the supplies he had on board, got so close to him, that they hailed him, and summoned him to surrender, promising that no harm should befall him. As soon as Ribault perceived that the boats had gotten out of his reach, he gave up the attempt and started in pursuit of the San Salvador, which was already six or eight leagues away.|$|E
500|$|Berger's {{choice of}} [...] "framework for {{understanding}} Wicca {{within the context}} of late modernity" [...] was that of structuration, a theory put forward by the English sociologist and political theorist Anthony Giddens (1938) in his book The Constitution of Society (1984). Structuration theory maintains that both structure and agency influence human beings in their choices; the former refers to the recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit the choices and opportunities available for an individual, whilst the latter refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices. Berger argued that whilst the beliefs and practices of Wiccans were [...] "in part determined by social factors, such as class, race and gender", at the same time these Wiccans exerted a level of control and self-determination over their lives [...] "both by the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of becoming a Witch and through the self-conscious use of rituals to create a persona." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{previously}} prolific band were unusually quiet, the UK music press began to speculate. Melody Maker {{calculated that the}} total recording cost had come close to £250,000; however, McGee, Green, and Shields dispute this. Shields argued that that estimated cost (and Creation's near-bankruptcy) was a myth exaggerated by McGee because the Creation owner [...] "thought it would be cool." [...] According to Shields, [...] "The amount we spent nobody knows because we never counted. But we worked it out ourselves just by working out how much the studios cost and how much all the engineers cost. 160 thousand pounds was the most we could come to as the actual money that was spent." [...] In Green's opinion, the Melody Maker's estimate erred on the low side, by £20,000. He said, [...] "Once you'd even got it recorded and mixed, the <b>very</b> <b>act</b> of compiling, EQ-ing, etcetera took weeks on its own." [...] In a December 1991 interview, Shields said {{that most of the}} money claimed to have been spent on the album was simply [...] "money to live on" [...] over three years, with the album itself only costing [...] "a few thousand". He also claimed that the album represented only four months work over two years. Shields later said that most of the money spent was the band's own money, and that [...] "Creation probably spent fifteen to twenty thousand pounds of their own money on it, and that's it.
