5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the House on a 357-66 <b>vote.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members. Fourteen years later, federal {{prosecutors}} used the Patriot Act's expansion of currency transaction reporting requirements to indict Hastert on federal charges.|$|E
5|$|Cook County Assessor James Houlihan {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election in 2010. Within hours, Berrios said he planned to announce his candidacy for assessor. On February 2, 2010 Berrios won the three-way Democratic primary with 39% of the <b>vote,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> primary with the lowest turn-out since 1958.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E

5|$|Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating {{petitions}} {{to run as}} {{an independent}} candidate for assessor. Berrios dropped a challenge to Claypool's nominating petitions after Berrios' lawyers examined Claypool's 90,000 signatures, 65,000 more than required. Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 percent of the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to his failure to get enough suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Frank {{ran for the}} U.S. House of Representatives in the 4th congressional district, {{hoping to}} succeed Father Robert Drinan, who had left Congress, {{following}} a call by Pope John Paul II for priests to withdraw from political positions. In the Democratic primary held on September 16, 1980, Frank won 52% of the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-candidate field. As the Democratic nominee, he faced Republican Richard A. Jones {{in the general election}} and won narrowly, 52%–48%.|$|E

5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 2002 the Moderate Party gained 15.3 percent of the votes—its lowest share of the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> general election since 1973. Following the loss, Lundgren {{was forced to resign}} his position as leader of the Moderate Party. After the 2002 election Reinfeldt was elected as leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group, spokesman for economic policy and vice chairman of the parliament's finance committee. On 25 October 2003 he was unanimously elected as the new leader of the Moderate Party.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{protections for}} voters are {{contained}} in Section 11. Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.|$|E

5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> presidential election. Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E
5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E

He was first elected in 1999, {{finishing}} sixth with 27,745 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field of 20 (with the top nine elected), he was re-elected in 2001 (finishing second with 43,191 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field of 26) and in 2003 (finishing sixth with 26,573 <b>votes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field of 26). He resigned from City Council in order to take his seat on the Hamilton County Commission. Chris Monzel, a Republican who had lost his council seat in the last election, was appointed to fill out DeWine's term on City Council.|$|R
5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, Patton {{returned}} to Pike County. In 1989 he was re-elected {{for a third}} term as judge/executive, receiving over 70percent of the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> three-way Democratic primary and subsequently winning the general election by nearly a three-to-one margin. He immediately began preparing for another run for lieutenant governor in 1991. In the earlier campaign, the UMWA had been vociferously opposed to Patton because employees in his coal mines had been affiliated with the Southern Labor Union. Skipper Martin introduced him to Teamsters leaders, and Patton worked with them to unionize Pike County employees. He also worked with Kelsey Friend to pass the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Act, a measure giving financial incentives to companies that located in economically depressed rural counties.|$|E
5|$|In April 1973, anti-Chogyal {{agitation}} {{broke out}} and protestors demanded popular elections. The Sikkim police {{were unable to}} control the demonstrations, and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene. India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji, and produced an agreement, which envisaged {{the reduction of the}} Chogyal to the role of a constitutional monarch and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power-sharing formula. The Chogyal's opponents won an overwhelming victory, and a new Constitution was drafted providing for Sikkim {{to be associated with the}} Republic of India. On 10 April 1975, the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India. This resolution was endorsed by 97 percent of the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> referendum held on 14 April 1975, following which the Indian Parliament amended the constitution to admit Sikkim into India as its 22nd state.|$|E

5|$|In February 1761 Blackstone was {{considered}} as a potential Tory candidate for the rotten borough of Hindon in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect – {{at the same time}} refusing the offer of appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat. This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> particular way, and the grant of a patent of precedence at the same time actually increased the demand on his time. Court records show him pleading before Lord Mansfield in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in Tonson v Collins, a copyright case, Thiquet v Bath, an important case on international law, and R v d'Eon, acting for the prosecution in a feud over Louis XV's newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The LM {{sought to}} {{seize control of}} the LCL agenda by winning key {{positions}} on the state executive at the annual general meeting in September, but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level, and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM's plans. The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high-profile contest received 47% of the <b>vote</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> narrow defeat. He received around 90% among urban delegates and around 33% of the rural votes, the latter figure shocking the conservatives. The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process.|$|E
