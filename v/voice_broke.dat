5|$|In {{the first}} vote of 2008, she placed {{third in the}} January 3 Iowa Democratic caucus behind Obama and Edwards. Obama gained ground in {{national}} polling {{in the next few}} days, with all polls predicting a victory for him in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton gained a surprise win there on January 8, defeating Obama narrowly. It was the first time a woman had won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. Explanations for Clinton's New Hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically, especially by women, after her eyes welled with tears and her <b>voice</b> <b>broke</b> while responding to a voter's question the day before the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{youngest}} {{of seven children}} of Hjálmtýr E. Hjálmtýsson, a bank clerk, and Margrét Matthíasdóttir, a writer, Paul Oscar was born on 16 March 1970 in Reykjavík. As a child he displayed artistic talent in drawing, writing fairy tales and singing – his mother had him sing for the women in her sewing club and at family birthday parties. He also spent much time singing in choirs and in media commercials, and recorded his first album {{at the age of}} seven. His first leading role in a professional theatre production was at 12years of age in the musical version of Rubber Tarzan, a popular Danish children's novel by Ole Lund Kirkegaard (1940–1979). His <b>voice</b> <b>broke</b> two weeks after the musical's last performance, and he did not sing for the next few years.|$|E

25|$|The radio-announcer that Peter {{listens to}} on the rainy day near the {{beginning}} of the film is played by Douglas Gresham, co-producer of the movie and C. S. Lewis's stepson. Keynes' <b>voice</b> <b>broke</b> during filming, so some of his voice track had to be re-looped by his sister Soumaya. Mr. Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing, which is of Sim-Evan Jones' father.|$|E
25|$|Verdonck {{was born}} in Turnhout. From his {{earliest}} years, {{he was in the}} household of Cornelis Pruenen, senator and treasurer of Antwerp; in addition he was a choirboy at Antwerp Cathedral until about the age of 9. In 1572 he went to Spain {{to be part of the}} choir of Philip II in Madrid, where he stayed until his <b>voice</b> <b>broke</b> in early 1580, at which time he returned to the Netherlands to study in Antwerp with Séverin Cornet, and possibly with Hubert Waelrant as well. His earliest works, published along with those of Cornet, date from this period.|$|E
25|$|Dutch Tilders {{was born}} on 29 August 1941 as Mattheus Frederikus Wilhelmus Tilders (anglicised as Matthew Frederick William Tilders) in Nijmegen, Netherlands.

6000|$|Redfield {{put himself}} in touch rather than in sight amidst the {{darkness}} which the disembodied <b>voices</b> <b>broke</b> upon. [...] "Enraghty's house? Then we've got him. Come on!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was about}} to ascend to his room, and wash up a bit before going to supper, when the sounds of <b>voices</b> <b>broke</b> upon his ear, coming from the parlor.|$|R
500|$|While {{recognising}} the boy's obvious musical talent, {{his father}} knew the insecurity {{of a musical}} career and discouraged him from pursuing it. While studying at a private school in Bayswater, Sullivan, then aged 11, persuaded his parents and the headmaster {{to allow him to}} apply for membership in the choir of the Chapel Royal. [...] Despite concerns that Sullivan at nearly 12 years of age was too old to give much service as a treble before his <b>voice</b> <b>broke,</b> he was accepted and soon became a soloist and, by 1856, was promoted to [...] "first boy". [...] Even at this age, Sullivan's health was delicate, and he was easily fatigued.|$|E
500|$|Formby left formal {{education}} {{at the age of}} eight or nine, and did not learn to read until well into his teenage years. To earn money for the household, he sang on street corners for coppers; the family's poverty worsened when, in October 1890, Lawler died from pulmonary tuberculosis at the age of 33. Formby secured a job at a cotton mill and spent two years as a loom builder. He supplemented his wages by singing in pubs, alehouses and free-and-easies, the last being places where informal arrangements were made for patrons to provide their own entertainment. Around this time he joined up with another boy to form an act, [...] "the Glenray Brothers" [...] (also [...] "the Glen Ray Brothers"), which was profitable enough to have a manager; the act continued until Formby's boy soprano <b>voice</b> <b>broke,</b> after which the pair separated.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to a lawyer father and {{psychologist}} mother. He began his acting career {{as a child in}} 1949, in radio drama and summer stock theatre. His cousins Murray and Donald Davis ran the Straw Hat Players in Ontario in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and rehearsed in the basement of Davis' house. When they needed a boy they gave William his first professional acting job. He went on from there to have a career as a boy actor on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio before his <b>voice</b> <b>broke.</b> [...] In 1955 he enrolled in the University of Toronto to study philosophy, but actively pursued a career as an actor alongside future actor Donald Sutherland. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. While at university he switched his attention from acting to directing and with his partner, Karl Jaffary, took over and ran the Straw Hat Players for four years.|$|E

2500|$|When his <b>voice</b> <b>broke</b> in 1816, Goss {{left the}} choir {{and went to}} live with his uncle. The elder Goss was well known as a teacher, and was at the time {{teaching}} James Turle, later organist of Westminster Abbey. The young Goss, however, became a pupil of Thomas Attwood, organist of St Paul's Cathedral. Unlike the rigid and harsh Smith, Attwood, a former pupil of Mozart, was a musician of wide sympathies and kind disposition. Mendelssohn called him [...] "dear old Mr. Attwood", and Goss became devoted to his teacher, under whom he learnt the art of composition and orchestration.|$|E
2500|$|Sumsion {{was born}} in Gloucester, a cathedral city on the River Severn. [...] In 1908, {{at the age of}} nine, Sumsion became a {{probationer}} in the Gloucester cathedral choir, which was then under the direction of Herbert Brewer. [...] After two years Sumsion became a full chorister and sang with the choir until 1914. From 1911 to 1915 he was organist at Ashleworth, a small village six miles from Gloucester, responsible for the church choir and the [...] "organ blower" [...] for a fee of £5 a quarter, quite a responsibility for a 12 year old. Gloucester was (and is) one of the three host cities, along with Worcester and Hereford, of the Three Choirs Festival, an annual festival of choral emphasis first held in the early 18th century. [...] Sumsion would later write of his musically formative experiences at the cathedral: ‘Quite soon after my entry into the choir I was singing with the [...] Festival Chorus and gradually absorbing the choral music of the great classical composers and the contemporary writers, of whom the giant was certainly Elgar.' [...] When Sumsion’s treble <b>voice</b> <b>broke</b> at age 15, he became an ‘articled pupil’ to Brewer, a designation connoting a three-year apprenticeship in organ, choral direction, and music theory. [...] As one of Brewer’s articled pupils Sumsion was {{following in the footsteps of}} his slightly older contemporaries, Herbert Howells and Ivor Gurney. [...] Sumsion passed the Associateship exam of the Royal College of Organists in 1915, and in July 1916 joined Howells in passing the Fellowship exam; though he was only 17, Sumsion was awarded the Turpin prize for the second-highest marks in the practical component.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly <b>voices</b> <b>broke</b> {{upon his}} ear, {{and he heard}} Hardwick and Macklin enter the rear office. By {{applying}} his ear to the key-hole Hal heard what was said. If they opened the closet door, he determined to make a bold dash for liberty.|$|R
50|$|The third prebend was the organist, who {{was also}} {{in charge of the}} Song School for the {{instruction}} of the youth in plainsong and descant, which stood {{on the west side of}} the church.

6000|$|... "Yes, if we don't break {{our necks}} {{before that time}} comes, Dick," [...] and as Sam spoke he went down into a meadow hole up to his knees. Dick helped him out, and {{as he did so}} the sound of two <b>voices</b> <b>broke</b> upon their ears.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{the sound}} of <b>voices</b> <b>broke</b> on them, nearer than before. Pointing to a covered walk {{that led to the}} house, he said, in his usually cool, calm tone, [...] "Go in that way; I will cover your retreat." [...] And turning, he went to meet the merry hunters.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the hunter}} laid {{his ear to}} the ground, and listened. Faint beats, like throbs of a pulsing heart, shuddered from the soft turf. Stronger they grew, till the hunter raised his head. Dark forms approached; <b>voices</b> <b>broke</b> the silence; the {{creaking}} of a wagon scared away the wolves.|$|R

The murmur grew louder and he paused to listen.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the sale}} of its <b>voice</b> <b>broking</b> {{business}} to global banking firm Tullett Prebon in December 2016, ICAP plc was renamed NEX Group, while Tullett Prebon became TP ICAP.
