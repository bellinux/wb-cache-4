5000|$|Measurement can {{be defined}} as [...] "the {{assignment}} of numerals to objects or events according to rules."Almost all psychological experiments involve some sort of measurement, if only to determine the reliability and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results,</b> and of course measurement is essential if results are to be relevant to quantitative theories.|$|E

50|$|SUDAAN's {{strength}} lies it {{its ability}} to compute standard errors of ratio estimates, means, totals, regression coefficients, and other statistics {{in accordance with the}} sample design, greatly increasing the accuracy and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> Many, if not most, data sets require attention to correlation and weighting, but few statistical software packages offer the user the opportunity to specify how data are correlated and weighted. For many years, SUDAAN remained the only broadly applicable software for analysis of correlated and weighted data. Currently Mplus offers similar capacities for a much broader set of models.|$|E
50|$|Sensitivity to acute thermal {{stimulation}} is {{the most}} common test used in live species pain research. The behavioral reflex evoked by noxious heat stimuli is a relatively good predictor of pain sensitivity and its reduction through various analgesics. One significant limitation of thermal assays lies in the specificity and <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> in animals as models of human pain. Very {{little is known about the}} functional mechanics of nociceptive afferents in murine subjects, thus the translation of any pain response observed from these animals to humans is questionable.|$|E

Research contributions using FARS by researchers from many countries appear in many non-U.S. technical publications, and provide a significant database and knowledge bank on the subject.

It also encourages awardees to share software and inventions or otherwise act to make the innovations they embody widely useful and usable.b.

50|$|In 1876, the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs (later {{known as}} the National League or NL) was {{established}} after the NA proved ineffective. The league placed its emphasis on clubs rather than on players. Clubs could now enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs. Clubs were required to play the full schedule of games instead of forfeiting scheduled games when the club {{was no longer in}} the running for the league championship, which happened frequently under the NA. A concerted effort was made to curb gambling on games, which was leaving the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> in doubt. The first game in the NL—on Saturday, April 22, 1876 (at the Jefferson Street Grounds, Philadelphia)—is often pointed to as the beginning of MLB.|$|E

5000|$|Hartman and Baldwin [...] discuss further {{advantages}} of the Real-Time Delphi approach: First, the number of experts participating in the real-time study can be increased due to {{a higher degree of}} automation during and improved possibilities for analysis after the study. Additionally, the Internet provides the possibility to invite a worldwide expert panel to participate in the study. Second, the degree of interaction among the experts can be increased {{due to the fact that}} they can immediately react on others’ comments. Additionally, the time frame between giving own answers and getting insights into others’ responses is very short, which encourages stronger cognitive examination with the respective issue in question. Hartman and Baldwin [...] argue that with the help of this procedure the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> is maximised.|$|E
5000|$|The doctor-patient {{relationship}} {{is key to}} the practice of healthcare and is central to the delivery of high quality efficient care while maintaining costs. Controversy surrounds the extent and existence of supplier induced demand (SID). Some believe it is ideological rather than evidence-based. <b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> from different models is reported to lack consensus, making policy difficult to develop and implement. [...] Normative definitions cast negative aspersions on physicians indicating they act as imperfect agents for their own self-interests. A positive perspective of SID focuses on a physician's ability to shift a patient's demand curve to the right. [...] Demand inducement refers to a [...] "physician's alleged ability to shift patients' demand for medical care at a given price, that is, to convince patients to increase their use of medical care without lowering the price charged." [...] Economists have explored how this additional care will affect patient welfare.|$|E
5000|$|Important Steps in Application of the Theory [...] When {{applying}} the TPB as a theoretical framework, certain steps should be followed to promote increased <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> First, target behavior should be specified {{in terms of}} action, target, context, and time. For example, the goal might be to “consume at least one serving of whole grains during breakfast each day in the forthcoming month”. In this statement, “consuming” is the action, “one serving of whole grains” is the target, “during breakfast each day” is the context, and “in the forthcoming month” is the time. Once a goal is specified, an elicitation phase {{can be used to}} identify salient issues. The pertinent and central beliefs for a certain behavior may be very different for different populations. Therefore, conducting open-ended elicitation interviews {{is one of the most}} crucial steps in {{applying the}} TPB. Elicitation interviews help to identify relevant behavioral outcomes, referents, cultural factors, facilitators, and barriers for each particular behavior and target population under investigation. The following are sample questions that may be used during an elicitation interview: ...|$|E
