40|$|Abstract—Motion {{estimation}} {{is a major}} computational task in real-time <b>vision</b> <b>circuits</b> {{and artificial}} retinas that require energyefficient, high-speed, and microminiaturized circuitry. Traditionally, the motion estimation is made by means of velocity-tuned filters (VTFs), a class of spatiotemporal signal processing circuitry. However, conventional VTFs have limitations in area, power, and speed for real-time motion computation because they employ bulky and slow analog circuitry. In this paper, we propose a nanoscale VTF that employs quantum dot arrays to perform temporal filtering to track moving and stationary objects. The new velocity-tuned filter is not only amenable for nanocomputing, but also superior to other VTFs in terms of area, power, and speed. We also show that the proposed nanoarchitecture for VTF is asymptotically stable in the specific region where f ′(Sn,m) ≥ 0.

40|$|Vision is an {{important}} sense; it allows animals to create {{an image of the}} surrounding environment based on emitted or reflected photons. The sensory interface that transforms photons into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain is the retina of the eye. From the retina, these electrical signals are conveyed via axons to a wide array of neuronal networks, many of which are not fully understood. One of the principal targets of retinal axons is the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, a structure in charge of relaying information from the retina to visual cortex. The dLGN is however not the only thalamic nucleus that transmits visual information to the cortex. The lateral posterior (LP) nucleus of the thalamus is also part of the <b>vision</b> <b>circuit</b> relaying messages to cortical structures. In contrast to the dLGN, LP does not get visual information directly from the retina. Its main inputs are the superior colliculus and visual cortex itself. The precise anatomy of axonal projection originating each of these two thalamic nuclei is still not completely understood. Here we use viral tracing approaches in the mouse to identify the exact cortical regions targeted by the thalamocortical axons emanating from dLGN and LP. We discover that in primary visual cortex (V 1), dLGN and LP have in part complementary and in part overlapping projection pattern: The dLGN projects axons in layers I, IV and VI, while the LP projects to layer I, and the deeper layers of V 1. In secondary visual cortex (V 2) the projection pattern of LP become denser and the border between V 1 and V 2 shows a rapid increase in axon density as well as overlapping projections to dLGN axons in V 2. These studies further confirm previous work on cats and primates, and validate the mouse as an outstanding model to study vision. Biotechnolog...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{neuronal}} circuits perform computations on {{the cellular}} and molecular level {{is a crucial}} step towards deciphering how brains function. Yet, the complete elucidation of mechanisms underlying simple computations such as the visual detection of movement is still missing. In this dissertation, I employ genetically accessible model organism Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the neurotransmitter systems that are used by cells in the neuronal circuit for motion vision. The contribution of this dissertation to current knowledge about the neuronal circuit for motion vision in D. melanogaster is as follows: In the publication “Neural circuit to integrate opposing motions in the visual field”, together with my colleagues, we identify two new types of neurons in the motion <b>vision</b> <b>circuit</b> termed LPi 3 - 4 and LPi 4 - 3 cells that receive input from the local motion detectors, the T 4 and T 5 neurons and provide inhibitory input to wide-field motion-selective lobula plate tangential cells. Using antibody immunostainings and single-cell transcriptome analysis, we show that the neurotransmitter used by the LPi 3 - 4 and LPi 4 - 3 neurons is glutamate. Glutamate released from the LPi 3 - 4 neurons opens a chloride channel GluClα on the dendrites of the LPTCs and thus, its role at this synapse is inhibitory. In addition, we demonstrate that the LPi 3 - 4 neurons are necessary for tuning of the lobula plate tangential cells to movement in a specific direction in naturalistic situations where competing visual stimuli moving in various directions are present. In the publication “RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of direction-selective T 4 /T 5 neurons in Drosophila”, I provide the first genome – wide transcriptome analysis of the T 4 and T 5 neurons. The obtained gene expression database characterizes the expression levels of all neurotransmitter receptors in T 4 and T 5 neurons and thus, gives information on which neurotransmitters provide input to T 4 and T 5 neurons. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis reveals the co-existence of the cholinergic and GABAergic markers in D. melanogaster neurons {{that has not been}} described previously. This study also analyzes the biophysical implementation of the computations performed by the T 4 and T 5 neurons on the molecular level. In the publication “Transgenic line for the identification of cholinergic release sites in Drosophila melanogaster”, using the newly generated FRT-STOP-FRT-VAChT::HA allele, I show that the Mi 1 and Tm 3 neurons possess cholinergic release sites in their axons and thereby likely provide cholinergic input to the local motion detectors, the T 4 neurons. The FRT-STOP-FRT-VAChT::HA allele described in this study is a universal tool that can serve for the identification of cholinergic cells also in other neuronal circuits in D. melanogaster...|$|E

The program was originally designed with robotic vision chips in mind, so the simulator has built-in functionality for handling images as input and as output. CMVSIM has two intended uses. The first use is in simulating algorithms, whereby CMVSIM is used to simulate grids of idealized circuit elements so that a designer can tune the idealized network realization of a particular algorithm. The second, and more important, use is in simulating actual VLSI circuits, whereby CMVSIM is used to simulate a VLSI circuit at an analog level. It is in this arena where CMVSIM's capabilities are so important, because VLSI realizations of <b>vision</b> <b>circuits</b> (for example) can easily have hundreds of thousands of devices, and yet the circuit must be simulated in its entirety at an analog level.

The VVP can transform hundreds of 128 -D SIFT vectors into a 64 -D histogram for object matching by using the binary-tree-based architecture, and 16 calculators for the computations of the Euclidean distances are designed for each of the two processors in each level.

40|$|Inhibitory interneurons {{represent}} a diverse population of cell {{types in the}} central nervous system, whose general role is to suppress activity of target neurons. The timing of spikes in principal neurons has millisecond precision, and I asked what are the roles of inhibition in shaping the temporal codes that emerge from different parallel local neural circuits. First I investigated the local circuitry of melanopsin-containing ganglion cells in the mouse retina, which are intrinsically photosensitive and responsible for circadian photoentrainment. Using transsynaptic viral tracing, I identified three types of melanopsin-containing ganglion cell, and found that inhibitory (GABAergic) dopaminergic amacrine cells are presynaptic {{to one of these}} types. These results provided a direct circuitry link between the medium time scale process of light-dark adaptation, which involves dopamine, and the longer time scale of the circadian rhythm. Next I characterised a subpopulation of genetically-identified neurons in the mouse retina, in order to compare the precise timing of inhibition in different circuits at a high temporal resolution. I identified eight physiologically and morphologically distinct ganglion cell types and found that each circuit could be described by a 'motif' that represented the inhibitory-excitatory interactions that lead to cell-type-specific firing patterns. The cell would fire only when the change in excitation was faster than the change in inhibition. Therefore the role of inhibition is to detect 'irrelevance' in the visual scene, only allowing the ganglion cell to fire at specific time points relating to functions that are both parallel and complementary to the other cell types. Finally, I looked deeper within the neural circuitry of one of the genetically-identified cell types, to study the mechanism of 'fast inhibition' in detecting approaching objects. Through two-photon targeted paired recordings of postsynaptic ganglion cells and presynaptic amacrine cells, I found evidence that the AII amacrine cell - a well-characterised glycinergic inhibitory interneuron known to be involved in night <b>vision</b> <b>circuits</b> - conveys fast inhibitory information to the ganglion cell via an electrical synapse with an excitatory neuron of day vision circuitry only during non-approach motion. Therefore, it appears that the role of inhibition is to dynamically interact with direct excitatory neural pathways during 'irrelevant' stimulation, suppressing or completely blocking activity, resulting in precisely timed spikes that occur in the brief moments when excitation changes faster than inhibition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} synthesizing Class AB log-domain filters that satisfy dynamic differential-mode and common-mode constraints simultaneously. Whereas the dynamic differential-mode constraint imposes the desired filtering behavior, the dynamic common-mode constraint solves the zero-dc-gain problem, a shortcoming of previous approaches. Also, we {{introduce a}} novel push–pull circuit that serves as a current-splitter; it rectifies a differential signal into the ON and OFF paths in our log-domain filter. As an example, we synthesize a first-order low-pass filter, and, to demonstrate the rejection of dc signals, we implement an adaptive filter by placing this low-pass circuit in a variable-gain negative-feedback path. Feedback gain is controlled by signal energy, which is extracted simply by summing complementary ON and OFF signals—dc signals do not contribute to the signal energy nor are they amplified by the feedback. We implement this adaptive filter design in a silicon chip that draws biological inspiration from visual processing in the mammalian retina. It may also be useful in other applications that require dynamic time-constant adaptation.

40|$|Loss of a sensory {{modality}} {{leads to}} widespread changes in synaptic function across sensory cortices, which {{are thought to}} be the basis for cross-modal adaptation. Previous studies suggest that experience-dependent cross-modal regulation of the spared sensory cortices may be mediated by changes in cortical circuits. Here, we report that loss of vision, in the form of dark exposure (DE) for 1 week, produces laminar-specific changes in excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the primary auditory cortex (A 1) of adult mice to promote feedforward (FF) processing and also strengthens intracortical inputs to primary visual cortex (V 1). Specifically, DE potentiated FF excitatory synapses from layer 4 (L 4) to L 2 / 3 in A 1 and recurrent excitatory inputs in A 1 –L 4 in parallel with a reduction in the strength of lateral intracortical excitatory inputs to A 1 –L 2 / 3. This suggests a shift in processing in favor of FF information at the expense of intracortical processing. Vision loss also strengthened inhibitory synaptic function in L 4 and L 2 / 3 of A 1, but via laminar specific mechanisms. In A 1 –L 4, DE specifically potentiated the evoked synaptic transmission from parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons to principal neurons without changes in spontaneousminiature IPSCs (mIPSCs). In contrast, DE specifically increased the frequency of mIPSCs in A 1 –L 2 / 3. In V 1, FF excitatory inputs were unaltered by DE, whereas lateral intracortical connections in L 2 / 3 were strengthened, suggesting a shift toward intracortical processing. Our results suggest that loss of <b>vision</b> produces distinct <b>circuit</b> changes in the spared and deprived sensory cortices to shift between FF and intracor-tical processing to allow adaptation.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} neuromorphic cortical-layer {{processing}} microchip for address event representation (AER) spike-based processing systems. The microchip computes 2 -D convolutions of video information represented in AER format in real time. AER, {{as opposed to}} conventional frame-based video representation, describes visual information as a sequence of events or spikes in a way similar to biological brains. This format allows for fast information identification and processing, without waiting to process complete image frames. The neuromorphic cortical-layer processing microchip {{presented in this paper}} computes convolutions of programmable kernels over the AER visual input information flow. It not only computes convolutions but also allows for a programmable forgetting rate, which in turn allows for a bio-inspired coincidence detection processing. Kernels are programmable and can be of arbitrary shape and arbitrary size of up to 32 32 pixels. The convolution processor operates on a pixel array of size 32 32, but can process an input space of up to 128 128 pixels. Larger pixel arrays can be directly processed by tiling arrays of chips. The chip receives and generates data in AER format, which is asynchronous and digital. However, its internal operation is based on analog low-current circuit techniques. The paper describes the architecture of the chip and circuits used for the pixels, including calibration techniques to overcome mismatch. Extensive experimental results are provided, describing pixel operation and calibration, convolution processing with and without forgetting, and high-speed recognition experiments like discriminating rotating propellers of different shape rotating at speeds of up to 5000 revolutions per second.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I present new {{contributions}} to the fields of neuroscience and computer science. The neuroscientific contribution is a new technique for automatically reconstructing complete neural networks from densely stained 3 d electron micrographs of brain tissue. The computer science contribution is a new machine learning method for image segmentation {{and the development of}} a new theory for supervised hierarchy learning based on ultrametric distance functions. It is well-known that the connectivity of neural networks in the brain can have a dramatic influence on their computational function. However, our understanding of the complete connectivity of neural circuits has been quite impoverished due to our inability to image all the connections between all the neurons in biological network. Connectomics is an emerging field in neuroscience that aims to revolutionize our understanding of the function of neural circuits by imaging and reconstructing entire neural circuits. In this thesis, I present an automated method for reconstructing neural circuitry from 3 d electron micrographs of brain tissue. The cortical column, a basic unit of cortical microcircuitry, will produce a single 3 d electron micrograph measuring many 100 s terabytes once imaged and contain neurites from well over 100, 000 different neurons. It is estimated that tracing the neurites in such a volume by hand would take several thousand human years. Automated circuit tracing methods are thus crucial to the success of connectomics. In computer <b>vision,</b> the <b>circuit</b> reconstruction problem of tracing neurites is known as image segmentation. Segmentation is a grouping problem where image pixels belonging to the same neurite are clustered together. While many algorithms for image segmentation exist, few have parameters that can be optimized using groundtruth data to extract maximum performance on a specialized dataset. In this thesis, I present the first machine learning method to directly minimize an image segmentation error. It is based the theory of ultrametric distances and hierarchical clustering. Image segmentation is posed as the problem of learning and classifying ultrametric distances between image pixels. Ultrametric distances on point set have the special property that(cont.) they correspond exactly to hierarchical clustering of the set. This special property implies hierarchical clustering can be learned by directly learning ultrametric distances. In this thesis, I develop convolutional networks as a machine learning architecture for image processing. I use this powerful pattern recognition architecture with many tens of thousands of free parameters for predicting affinity graphs and detecting object boundaries in images. When trained using ultrametric learning, the convolutional network based algorithm yields an extremely efficient linear-time segmentation algorithm. In this thesis, I develop methods for assessing the quality of image segmentations produced by manual human efforts or by automated computer algorithms. These methods are crucial for comparing the performance of different segmentation methods and is used through out the thesis to demonstrate the quality of the reconstructions generated by the methods in this thesis. by Srinivas C.
