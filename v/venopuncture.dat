50|$|Since the femoral {{triangle}} provides {{easy access}} to a major artery, coronary angioplasty and peripheral angioplasty is often performed by entering the femoral artery at the femoral triangle. Heavy bleeding in the leg can be stopped by applying pressure to points in the femoral triangle. Another clinical significance of the femoral triangle is that the femoral artery is positioned at the midinguinal point (midpoint between the pubic symphysis and the anterior superior iliac spine); medial to it lies the femoral vein. Thus the femoral vein, once located, allows for femoral venipuncture.. Femoral <b>venopuncture</b> is useful {{when there are no}} superficial veins that can be aspirated in a patient, in the case of collapsed veins in other parts of body (e.g. arms). The positive pulsation of the femoral artery signifies that the heart is beating and also blood is flowing to the lower extremity.|$|E

Assistant Professor, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences 3. Instructor, Department of Health, Faculty of Health, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences 4. Instructor, Department of Nursing, Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Lorestan University of Medical Sciences Abstract Background: Neonates {{expose to}} painful {{procedures}} even when come to birth healthy. Pain reduction {{is a definite}} right for each living creature during medical intervention. It has bee proved by many studies that painful experiences during babyhood, besides the early complications such as tachycardia, tachypnea and increase of body metabolic needs, can intensify individual’s physiologic and behavioral responses to pain in next stages of life. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the efficacy of supine, prone and kangaroo care (KC) positions on diminishing the pain response of term neonates during acute pain of <b>venopuncture.</b> Materials and methods: In this clinical trial study, 50 healthy neonates between 39 to 40 weeks of gestational age with physiologic icter requiring bilirubin estimation were assigned to receive a venous puncture and assessed for their responses to the pain of <b>venopuncture</b> performed in a standard manner. Blood sampling was performed by an expert nurse in charge of each neonate in three positions including supine, kangaroo care (KC) at a 24 -hour interval during 3 days. The place and condition of sampling were equal for all neonates. Pain responses were assessed using DAN scale, then the gathered data were analyzed using SPSS software and statistical tests. Results: According to the obtained results there was no significant differences between pain score in supine and prone positions. Limb movements score in supine position was significantly higher than two other positions (P< 0. 001) and vocal expression score in KC position was significantly higher than two other positions. In supine position, pain profile score was significantly lower in subjects with higher weight and there was same result in KC position. Conclusion: Based on the results, KC position seems to effectively decrease pain during <b>venopuncture</b> and other painful procedures, but it is suggested to do similar studies to complete the outcome of the present study...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} and {{risk factors for}} anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were investigated in goats of the Serido Oriental microregion, Rio Grande do Norte state, Northeast region of Brazil. Three hundred and sixty-six blood samples from goats collected by jugular <b>venopuncture</b> were used. For the serologic diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection, the indirect fluorescent-anti body test (IFAT) with cut-off value 1 : 64 was carried out. The prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies was 30. 6 % [95 % CI = 25. 9 - 35. 6 %] with titers ranging from 1 : 64 to 1 : 16, 384. The {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} showed that the risk factors associated to anti-T. gondii antibodies were presence of cats in the herd, extensive/semi-intensive management systems and lack of mineral supplementation.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: 					Hantavirus is a genus of {{ribonucleic acid}} (RNA) viruses {{included}} in the family Bunyaviridae. Hantaviruses are rodent-borne zoonoses that, in the last 18 years, became an emergent public health problem in the Americas, causing a severe cardiopulmonary syndrome. This disease has no specific treatment and has a high case fatality. The transmission of hantavirus to man occurs by inhaling aerosols of rodent excreta. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to hantavirus in the population of the rural settlement of Tup&# 227; in the county of Marcel&# 226;ndia, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. 													METHODS:					 The participants of the serologic survey were visited at their homes and selected randomly among the settlement population. Blood samples of the participants were collected by <b>venopuncture.</b> The serum samples were tested by an IgG-ELISA using an N recombinant protein of Araraquara hantavirus as antigen, using the protocol previously established by Figueiredo et al. 													RESULTS: 					IgG antibodies to hantavirus were detected in 7 (13 %) of the 54 participants. The positivity was higher among men. It was observed that there was an association of seropositivity to hantavirus within the participants born in the south of Brazil. 													CONCLUSIONS:					 The results suggest that, in this rural area, everyone is exposed to the same risk of becoming infected with hantavirus, and, therefore, there is a need to intensify surveillance activities and education of the local people to prevent this viral infection...|$|E
40|$|Background: While the arteriopuncture is {{a painful}} and {{relatively}} risky procedure {{and may be}} complicated by some problems, <b>venopuncture</b> required for assessing the venous blood gases (VBG) is an easier procedure with fewer complications. Considering the mentioned notion, substituting the VBG values for of ABG values can prevent such complications. This study was carried out {{with the aim of}} determining whether the VBG values can be replaced for ABG values in the management of mechanically ventilated patients admitted in ICU wards. Materials and Methods: This study was carried out on 102 patients admitted in ICU ward of Shahid Beheshti. After performing the Allen test, ABG was taken from radial artery of one hand and immediately VBG from the brachiocephalic vein of the other. The ABG and VBG indexes were calculated using a GEM 3000 system. After the data collection and calculation of mean and standard deviation of all indexes, two methods were compared using paired t-test, subsequent correlation ratio and the linear regression model. Results: Among the 102 hospitalized patients 70 were males and the remaining 32 females. The results of comparing the ABG and VBG indexes in terms of Pearson-correlation coefficient and the relevant significant level were: pH (0. 801, P< 0. 001) PCO 2 (0. 835, P< 0. 001) HCO 3 (0. 768, P= 0. 369) PO 2 (0. 287, P< 0. 001) SaO 2 (0. 317, P< 0. 001) BE (0. 810, P< 0. 011). Conclusion: While there was a significant correlation between the ABG and VBG indexes, but with the consideration of the power of correlation, the substitution of VBG for ABG is not recommended for mechanically ventilated patients...|$|E
40|$|This work aims {{to detect}} the {{presence}} of Babesia canis vogeli in dogs from Recife, Pernambuco via molecular and parasitological detection methods, and to assess the risk factors associated with this parasite. A total of 146 dogs (male and female) of varying breeds and ages that presented clinical symptoms of babesiosis were assessed at a clinical care center in the Veterinary School Hospital. Blood was obtained via <b>venopuncture</b> for hemoparasite detection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using a commercial kit, DNA was extracted from blood samples. For the PCR reaction, an approximately 590 base pair long genetic sequence was used {{to detect the}} presence of B. canis vogeli. The forward primer, denoted as BAB 1 (5 ’-GTG AAC CTT ATC ACT TAA AGG- 3 ’), was specific for a conserved region on the 18 S rRNA gene of Babesia spp., and the antisense primer was denoted as BAB 4 (5 ’-CAA CTC CTC CAC GCA ATC G- 3 ’). PCR results suggested {{that the percentage of}} Babesia canis vogeli infection was 4. 8 %. Through descriptive statistical analysis of the data, we observed that there was higher frequency of parasite infection associated with male dogs above two years of age, with a defined breed, from the countryside, are domiciled, and also suffer from tick infestation. We conclude that regardless of the type of risk factor, babesiosis can be found throughout Recife, Pernambuco, and its prevalence does not vary in most regions of Brazil. Our results indicate that PCR is a sensitive test for the detection of blood parasites, and should be performed as a clinical routine. </p...|$|E
40|$|Several {{tests are}} {{available}} for evaluation of respiratory disorders {{but most of them}} are invasive and associated with some risk or patient discomfort. Examples include bronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage, BAL) [1], <b>venopuncture</b> [2] and sputum induction [3]. Noninvasive sampling of nongaseous substances contained in expired air, collected as exhaled breath condensate (EBC) has been used to detect inflammatory markers and by-products including nitric oxide and arachidonic acid metabolites and proteins [4]. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a protein that has been implicated in neurogenic airway inflammation and this pilot study aimed to develop a non-invasive approach for evaluation of allergic airway inflammatory disease by measuring and comparing levels of NGF in the induced sputum and EBC of ten (10) asthmatics and ten (10) non-asthmatics. Though twenty (20) subjects were sampled, an unexpected event due to a defective NGF kit inadvertently resulted in an unsuccessful analysis of fifteen (15) sets of specimen (6 non-asthmatics and 9 asthmatics), limiting the study. This study is significant because occupational lung diseases are the number one work-related illness in the United States and occupational asthma is the most common form [9]. Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) is the commonest cause of occupational asthma and workers exposed to TDI vapor may develop inflammatory conditions including asthma, rhinitis and nasal irritation [7]. Results: NGF was detected and measured only in sputum, with a mean NGF level of 210 (210 - 210, range 0) in asthmatics and 164 (7 - 280, range 273) in non-asthmatics. Nonetheless, we failed to reject the null hypothesis (number 3). Conclusion: This limited study did not have adequate power (power 11 %) due to the small sample size and thus lacks internal validity. Further studies are needed using a larger sample size...|$|E

Para confirmação diagnóstica dos casos alterados, foram {{realizadas}} eletroforeses das hemoglobinas em acetato de celulose com pH 8, 6 e em citrato de ágar com pH 6, 2, em amostra de sangue total dos neonatos e dos seus progenitores. Foram analisados, 1. 615 indivíduos, e identificada a presença da hemoglobina S em 20 amostras e da hemoglobina C em seis amostras. Esses valores, correspondem a uma freqüência de 1, 2 % para o gene da anemia falciforme e 0, 4 % para o gene da doença de hemoglobina C, independente da raça ou ascendência. Esses dados, sugerem que a inclusão da triagem neonatal universal para hemoglobinopatias nos projetos já implementados para fenilcetonúria e hipotireoidismo congênito, apresenta vantagens e deve ser considerada pelos programas de saúde. This {{study was}} conducted to establish the frequency of hemoglobinopathies among newborns undergoing screening tests for metabolic diseases at the University Hospital (Hospital de Clínicas) in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Testing for abnormal hemoglobins was performed by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis on agarose gel with blood obtained by heel stick and applied to filter paper. For confirmatory testing of abnormal neonatal screening, a <b>venopuncture</b> blood sample was obtained from the infant and parents and then submitted to hemoglobin electrophoresis on cellulose acetate at pH 8. 6 and citrate agar at pH 6. 2. A total of 1, 615 subjects were studied: 20 samples showed the Hb S pattern and six samples showed Hb C. Thus, frequency of the sickle cell gene was 1. 2 % and that of the Hb C gene was 0. 4 %, regardless of race or origin.

40|$|A {{proliferation}} of literature has investigated {{the effect of}} road transport in farm animals (Stockman et al., 2013). In horses loading is a critical point of transportation, often causing injures both to horses or owners and wasting time (Ferguson and Rosalez Luis, 2001). Loading is considered a mental stress in horses (Waran and Cuddeford, 1995). Horses have to leave a familiar environment and herd. They often have a negative association with the truck: {{a long period of}} isolation, no possibility of escape, and racing or competition after unloading (Slater and Dymond, 2011). Studies on transport stress are adequate but those about only loading procedures are few and need replication (Shanahan, 2003). The aim of this work was to investigate the effects that loading, short isolation in the truck and unloading without a travel experience had on physiological and behavioral parameters after many repetitions. Fourteen Quarter Horses, accustomed to travel, homogeneous for live weight (500 ± 25 kg), body condition score (3 ± 0. 25 arbitrary units; Martin-Rosset, 1990) and age (6 ± 1 years), were recruited in this study. Each animal was loaded into the truck, without any reinforcements or punishments, spent one minute inside (tied parallel to the direction of travel), unloaded and returned to its box stall. The experiment was repeated 12 times. All animals were tested on the same day once weekly over 12 weeks. The horses were examined at rest in their stalls (Time I), after loading (Time II) and after unloading (Time III). Each examination included the registration of heart rate (HR) by Heart Monitor (Polar) and respiratory rate (RR) by the observation of chest-wall movements. At Time I and III blood samples were collected by <b>venopuncture</b> to assess cortisol level, PCV and total protein. All phases were recorded by video camera to score the horse behavior. A group of ten persons marked the horses during loading, isolation and unloading applying a behavioral score (BS) from 1 (relaxed) to 5 (refusal to load). Maximal time for loading was set at 5 minutes [...] General Linear Model analysis for repeated measures revealed differences in the HR and RR over the experimental period and in PCV and cortisol between rest and after unloading (Table 1). The BS was also significantly different among the different transport phases (loading (1. 96 ± 1. 35) and unloading (1. 79 ± 0. 78) vs short isolation (1. 38 ± 0. 56); F= 12. 91; P< 0. 001). Our data confirmed that horses were under stress by loading into a truck. They released adrenaline that caused the significant increase of HR, RR and PCV. Cortisol level also showed an upward trend, which is typical after a stressful situation. We suggest that loading into the truck is still a fearful experience after 12 repetitions, so this event requires appropriate management even in horses well trained and accustomed to transport. Further studies are needed in this field to develop new methods of loading procedure to reduce stress and safeguard horses’ welfare...|$|E
40|$|A ulceração aftosa recorrente (UAR) é uma das lesões mais freqüentes da cavidade bucal, comprometendo a qualidade de vida de seus portadores muitas vezes de maneira importante. Embora sua etiopatogenia ainda não esteja esclarecida, vários fatores têm sido consistentemente relacionados ao surgimento da UAR, especialmente alterações imunológicas e genéticas, conduzindo grande parte da investigação científica para esses campos do conhecimento. Os receptores Toll-Like (TLR) reconhecem produtos moleculares derivados, principalmente, de microrganismos, desencadeando a resposta inflamatória protetora. Entretanto, anormalidades em sua função podem estar relacionadas ao desenvolvimento de doenças, pela ativação aberrante do sistema imunológico. A proposta desta investigação foi a de se avaliar a expressão dos receptores TLR- 2, TLR- 4 e TLR- 7 através do RT-PCR em tempo real, a partir de amostras de sangue periférico e da mucosa bucal de população portadora de UAR e indivíduos controles sadios. Cinco pacientes UAR e quatro controles voluntários compuseram a casuística estudada, sendo submetidos à biópsia de lesões de UAR ou de mucosa de revestimento sadia. Na mesma sessão os pacientes tiveram sangue coletado por venopunção. Posteriormente, ambos os materiais foram submetidos aos procedimentos laboratoriais de extração do RNA e análise de expressão dos receptores TLR por meio da técnica de RT-PCR real time. Não houve diferença significativa na expressão destes receptores entre portadores de UAR e controles sadios, nos dois tipos de amostra. Estudos mais aprofundados são necessários a fim de se verificar a real participação destes receptores na UAR, visto que não há outros estudos nesta área e a amostra analisada foi pequena. Recurrent aphthous {{stomatitis}} (RAS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common oral mucosal diseases which may cause serious impairment on patients quality of life. Despite its still unknown pathogenesis, several factors have been consistently associated with RAS, especially genetic and immunological changes, which has driven a lot of research effort towards these issues. Toll-Like receptors (TLR) recognize molecular products, mainly derived from microorganisms, triggering the inflammatory response. However, abnormalities in their function may give rise to the development of diseases, through abnormal activation of the immune system. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the expression of receptors TLR- 2, TLR- 4 and TLR- 7 in peripheral blood and tissue samples of RAS and healthy controls, through real time RT-PCR technique. Five UAR patients and four healthy volunteers with no RAS history composed the casuistic and were submitted to biopsy of their UAR lesions or normal oral mucosa. On that same session patients had a blood sample taken through <b>venopuncture.</b> Both samples (tissue and blood) were, afterwards, submitted to lab procedures of RNA extraction and toll-like receptors expression through real time RT-PCR. There were no significant differences in the expression of these receptors between RAS and healthy controls in the two sample types. Further studies are necessary to allow sound conclusions on the actual participation of these receptors in RAS, since the sample followed were small and there are no similar studies published...|$|E
