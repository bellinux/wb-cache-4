25|$|To {{lay out the}} Walschaerts gear, the {{proportions}} of the combination lever must be chosen. The total movement of the valve rod in mid gear should be symmetric between front and back dead centre. A displacement of the union link end by half the piston travel must cause a valve rod displacement of the valve lead plus the <b>valve</b> <b>lap.</b> The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with radius rod to {{the distance between the}} valve rod end to the pivot with the radius rod should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to <b>valve</b> <b>lap</b> plus lead.|$|E

A <b>valve</b> ball's <b>lapping</b> instrument with a cup shaped cutter, and build the lapping mathematics model is studied in this paper.

Driven by Vic Elford and Kurt Ahrens, the pole sitter's 4.9-litre engine dropped an inlet <b>valve</b> after 225 <b>laps.</b> Both drivers had also been entered on the team's other car, a red and white 917 K with the 4.5-litre engine, qualified by Hans Herrmann and Richard Attwood in rather low 15th spot, {{but they did not}} drive after their own car failed.|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{abrasive}} particle size, shape, and sharpness are {{studied in}} multi-axis lapping of sealing regions {{of stainless steel}} ball valves. Twelve experimental runs, investigating changes in the abrasive particle {{as a function of}} lapping load and motion, are performed during lapping. The influence of changes in the lapping load and motion are investigated using design of experiments. Changes in the size, shape, and sharpness of the abrasive particle are influenced by the load and by the motion of the seats and balls of the <b>valves.</b> Combinations of <b>lapping</b> load and motions, as opposed to any individual variable, tend to dominate the influence on the changes in the abrasive particle...|$|R
5000|$|The first kind is {{the steam}} lap, {{which is the}} amount by which the valve {{overlaps}} the port on the live steam side of the valve piston (i.e. the distance the valve needs to move to just begin to uncover the port). [...] Secondly, there is the exhaust lap, which is the amount by which the valve overlaps the port on the exhaust side of the <b>valve</b> piston. Exhaust <b>lap</b> is generally given to slow-running locomotives. [...] This is because it allows the steam {{to remain in the}} cylinder for the longest possible amount of time before being expended as exhaust, therefore increasing efficiency. [...] shunter locomotives tended to be equipped with this addition.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a design of adaptive pressure controller for hydraulic servo valve with unknown dead zone. In general to reduce leakage flow, the servo <b>valves</b> adopt positive <b>lap</b> structures. This makes dead zone larger and is obstacle for precise positioning control. To compensate of such dead zone and unknown physical parameters of system, adaptive control strategy is examined for simple pressure control system. First {{it is assumed}} that only the flow gain of servo valve can be known by experiment and the adaptive controller is designed. This controller is examined on water hydraulic servo system which has larger leakage and positive lap for lower viscosity of tap water. The experimental results show that the better tracking performance is obtained comparing with PI or conventional adaptive controller without dead zone compensation. Then the controller is extended for unknown flow gain case...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model and}} its simulation results of an agricultural vehicle electrohydraulic (E/H) steering system. The dynamic characteristics of an E/H steering system {{plays an important role}} in realizing accurate steering control for an automatically guided agricultural vehicle. E/H steering systems are typically nonlinear with large deadband, asymmetric flow gain, time delay, hysteresis, and saturation, which result in difficulties in the system analysis, design, and control. In this paper, a mathematical model has been developed for an E/H steering system. This model has taken the main components of the E/H steering system, including a PWM driver, an E/H proportional directional control valve, steering actuating cylinders, steering linkage, and wheel-ground interactions, into consideration. It was then linearized with assumptions of incompressible fluid, the zero <b>lapped</b> <b>valve,</b> and frictionless. This model has been validated via vehicle steering tests. A third order liner model with considering the deadband, saturation, and time delay could well approximate the dynamic response within the steering angle range of 15 to 15 degrees. The validated model was used to estimate the dynamic behaviors of E/H steering systems in steering controller design. Those parameters are critical for designing high performance steering controller...|$|R
