25|$|A sense antenna {{normally}} {{consists of}} a single <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> positioned {{some distance from the}} crossed loops, in line with one of the two loops, at a distance about the same as the distance between the two vertical portions of the loop. The sense antenna's output is mixed with the loop it is in-line with, through a switch that allows it to be turned on or off. When switched on, it produces a voltage that suppresses the output of the rear section of the loop, re-enforcing the forward section. The resulting reception pattern is modified from its original figure-8 to a cardioid.|$|E

5000|$|At low {{frequencies}} (such as AM broadcast), arrays of vertical towers {{are used to}} achieve directionality [...] and they will occupy large areas of land.

50|$|In low-frequency {{applications}} involving loaded or nonloaded <b>vertical</b> <b>antennas,</b> {{the effective}} height {{is the moment}} of the current distribution in the vertical section, divided by the input current. For an antenna with a symmetrical current distribution, the center of radiation is the center of the distribution. For an antenna with asymmetrical current distribution, the center of radiation is the center of current moments when viewed from points near the direction of maximum radiation.|$|R

5000|$|In {{this mode}} the radio wave propagates by {{interacting}} with the conductive surface of the Earth. The wave [...] "clings" [...] {{to the surface and}} thus follows the curvature of the Earth. Ground waves propagate in vertical polarization so <b>vertical</b> <b>antennas</b> (monopoles) are required. Since the ground is not a perfect electrical conductor, ground waves are attenuated as they follow the Earth’s surface. Attenuation is proportional to the frequency making this mode mainly useful for LF and VLF frequencies (see also Earth-ionosphere waveguide).|$|R
50|$|A <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> {{being less}} visible than a {{mechanically}} tilted one, {{the use of}} purely electrical tilt with no mechanical tilt is an attractive choice for aesthetic reasons which are very important for operators seeking acceptance of integrated antennas in visible locations.|$|E

This is the same as ERP, except that a short <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> (i.e. a short monopole) is used as the reference antenna instead of a half-wave dipole.|$|E
50|$|The Adcock {{antenna array}} {{has been widely}} used commercially, and {{implemented}} in <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> heights ranging from over 130 feet (40 meters) in the LFR network, to as small as 5 inches (13 cm) in tactical direction finding applications (receiving in the UHF band).|$|E
50|$|The type of antenna and its {{polarization}} {{has a major}} {{effect on}} ground wave propagation. Vertical polarization is subject to considerably less attenuation than horizontally polarized signals. In some cases the difference can amount to several tens of decibels. It {{is for this reason}} that medium wave broadcast stations use <b>vertical</b> <b>antennas,</b> even if they have to be made physically short by adding inductive loading. Ships making use of the MF marine bands often use inverted L antennas as these are able to radiate a significant proportion of the signal that is vertically polarized.|$|R
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both <b>vertical</b> <b>antennas</b> could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|R

In the <b>vertical</b> <b>antenna</b> (a), the current must go to zero at the top. In the T (b), the current flows into the horizontal wire, increasing the current in the top part of the vertical wire.
