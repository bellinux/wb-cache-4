60|$|The {{cemetery}} is {{beneath the}} church, but entirely above ground, and lighted by {{a row of}} iron-grated windows without glass. A corridor runs along beside these windows, and gives access {{to three or four}} <b>vaulted</b> <b>recesses,</b> or chapels, of considerable breadth and height, the floor of which consists of the consecrated earth of Jerusalem. It is smoothed decorously over the deceased brethren of the convent, and is kept quite free from grass or weeds, such as would grow even in these gloomy recesses, if pains were not bestowed to root them up. But, as the cemetery is small, and it is a precious privilege to sleep in holy ground, the brotherhood are immemorially accustomed, when one of their number dies, to take the longest buried skeleton out of the oldest grave, and lay the new slumberer there instead. Thus, each of the good friars, in his turn, enjoys the luxury of a consecrated bed, attended with the slight drawback of being forced to get up long before daybreak, as it were, and make room for another lodger.|$|E
50|$|These apartments {{look out}} over the park to the Bosphorus. The network of ribbed {{vaulting}} suggests Gothic revival architecture, but it actually adds weight to the structure instead of sustaining it. The blue-and-white tiles on the wall are arranged in hexagons and triangles in the Bursa manner. Some show delicate patterns of flowers, leaves, clouds or other abstract forms. The white plasterwork is in the Persian manner.On both wings of the domed court are eyvans, <b>vaulted</b> <b>recesses</b> open on one side.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{the central}} dome, the sculpted white marble {{fountain}} within an octagonal pool {{adds to the}} beauty of the mosque. On one's left and right side are two large eyvans (a <b>vaulted</b> <b>recess</b> open on one side).|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} {{collapse}} of the tomb due to the immense weight of the pyramid, the architects designed the hut-shaped chamber using cross <b>vaulting</b> and <b>recessed</b> buttresses.|$|R
6000|$|Respecting {{which you}} are to observe, that the first Christian churches in the catacombs {{took the form of}} a blunt cross naturally; a square chamber having a <b>vaulted</b> <b>recess</b> on each side; then the Byzantine churches were {{structurally}} built {{in the form of an}} equal cross; while the heraldic and other ornamental equal-armed crosses are partly signs of glory and victory, partly of light, and divine spiritual presence. [Footnote: See, on this subject generally, Mr. R. St. J. Tyrwhitt's [...] "Art-Teaching of the Primitive Church." [...] S. P. B. K., 1874.] ...|$|R
25|$|The most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} interior decoration is the ceiling fresco, the grandiose Triumph of the Name of Jesus by Giovanni Battista Gaulli. Gaulli also frescoed the cupola, including lantern and pendentives, central <b>vault,</b> window <b>recesses,</b> and transepts' ceilings.|$|R
6000|$|The captain {{entered by}} the main door of the chapel, where ten or twelve wounded were now lying, tended by peasant women. Berenger merely passed through, seeing as he went the black hood busy over a freshly-brought-in-patient. He found a door which {{admitted}} him through the rough screen of boards to the choir {{where he had been}} in the earlier part of the day. The moonlight came through the shivered eastern windows, but a canvas curtain had been hung so as to shelter Philip's <b>vaulted</b> <b>recess</b> from the cold draught, and the bed itself, with a chair beside it, looked neat, clean, and comfortable. Philip himself was cheery; he said the bullet had made a mere flesh-wound, and had passed out on the other side, and the Lady of Hope, as they called he, was just such another as Aunt Cecily, and had made him very comfortable, with clean linen, good cool drinks, and the tenderest hand. But he was very sleepy, so sleepy that he hardly cared to hear of the combat, only he roused himself for a moment to say, 'Brother, I have seen Dolly.' ...|$|R
50|$|Gaulli {{decorated}} the entire dome including lantern and pendentives, central <b>vault,</b> window <b>recesses,</b> and transepts' ceilings. The original contract stipulated the dome {{was to be}} completed in two years, and the remainder by the end of ten years. If it met the approval of a panel, Gaulli was to be paid 14,000 scudi plus expenses. Gaulli's main vault fresco was unveiled on Christmas Eve, 1679. After this, he continued frescoing of the vaults of the tribune and other areas in the church until 1685.|$|R
40|$|Part of the Hurley {{negative}} collection.; Condition: silvering.; See PIC FH/ 3918, The Holy City, 1949 and cover. "Bazaar in Old Jerusalem. Except for two narrow lanes, no wheeled traffic {{may enter}} the Old City. Narrow, picturesque alley-ways thread a passage between high walls {{and lead to}} the bazaars, long <b>vaulted</b> tunnels <b>recessed</b> on either side with den-like shops. Shafts of light from gaps in the roof pierce the gloom and these openings serve as vents for the smoke and odours that drift from the numerous smithies and cook shops. Along these dark corridors men and women as diverse in type as the garments they wear jostle as they shuffle along. The plate illustrates such a scene in the Market of the Butchers".; Hurley series: Palestine, World War II...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{cavities}} are tangible {{signs of}} past generations’ actions: a legacy that holds unique features because every wall, every <b>vault,</b> every <b>recess</b> obtained by material removing is an original and not repeatable piece. The study of these underground spaces requires a specific approach {{aimed at the}} recognition of their constructive singularities and should follow rigorous measurement procedures. In this sense, two activities, the one related to the Grotto of Saints in Enna, a space carved into the rock, showing frescoes from 13 th century BC {{and the other to}} the Necropolis of Realmese (9 th- 7 th centuries BC) in Calascibetta, were conducted based on an integrated approach between traditional techniques and data capture technologies. Both sites represent an interesting field of study in terms of 3 D data acquisition and investigation aimed at drawing up conservation and valorisation projects able to give back to the community these important witnesses of civilization and culture...|$|R
50|$|Konkovo (Конько́во) is {{a station}} on the Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. It was {{designed}} by N. Shumakov, G. Mun, and N. Shurygina and opened on 6 November 1987 with the southward extension of the line. The station is of a single vault design, {{the only one on}} the radius. Its cross-section is meant to resemble two rows of sickles with the blades pointing inward, a design feature enhanced by the recessed light fixtures and metal accent strips in the spaces between the plaster ceiling panels. The bases of the <b>vault</b> is strongly <b>recessed</b> and faced with reddish ceramic tile.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Abbasid palace, {{built around}} 775, is the al-Ukhaidir Fortress.It {{has a plan}} derived from earlier Sasanian and Umayyad palaces.The palace lies in the desert about 180 km {{to the south of}} Baghdad.It is rectangular in shape, 175 by 169 m, with four gates. Three are in half-round towers that protrude from the wall, and one in a rectangular recess in the wall. Inside there is a vaulted entrance hall, a central court, an iwan (hall) open to the court opposite the entrance hall, and residential units.Sasanian techniques persist in the construction of vaults with pointed curves using rubble and mortar faced with brick and stucco, blind arches as decorations for large wall surfaces, and long <b>vaulted</b> halls with <b>recesses</b> behind arches supported by heavy pillars. Verbal descriptions indicate that palaces in Baghdad had similar layout, although on a larger scale.|$|R
5000|$|At their {{greatest}} extent, the burial grounds around Brighton's parish church covered three separate sites around Church Street and Dyke Road. The small northern extension {{laid out in}} 1824 was superseded by the elaborately planned western extension of 1840, designed by prominent local architect Amon Henry Wilds. [...] The lavish plan {{was based on the}} Oriental style popular in Brighton since the redesign of the Royal Pavilion in the 1820s. [...] Complaints over the cost meant that the main feature, a stone pyramid in the centre of the site, was not built, but Wilds did provide an arched entrance and a terrace of 14 Tudor-Gothic stone burial <b>vaults</b> with <b>recessed</b> entrances along the north side. [...] They have steps on the east and west sides leading to a walkway {{across the top of the}} terrace. There appear to be 14 vaults, but the 14-bay exterior is in fact false: the recessed entrances, with their Tudor-style arched doorways, are blank (with one exception). Separating each bay is a pinnacled buttress. The steps to the east are the more elaborate set: they have stuccoed walls with moulded terracotta panels to the piers. The vaults are built of rubble faced with stucco, and are a Grade II-listed structure— as is the Classical-style entrance archway fronting Dyke Road. It was erected in 1846, and is built mostly of yellow brick with some stonework. The arch has a keystone and is flanked by Doric pilasters topped by a cornice and entablature.|$|R

2500|$|The castle's {{outbuildings}} {{consist of}} a big water cistern and a stable, {{which would have been}} rendered useless {{in the event of a}} siege. The castle's gates were located inside a two storey rectangular tower, which encompassed a Frankish style pointed arch. To the west of the tower there are three barrel <b>vaulted</b> buildings and <b>recess</b> all Frankish in origin. The buildings immediately behind the gate are three irregularly shaped chambers, the fourth building's ruins can be found nearby. The castle's main stairway then branches to the west leading to a two storey, unvaulted Byzantine building, which is divided into three large chambers. The castle's upper ward included a rectangular Byzantine cistern, interconnected with 4 rectangular wards containing pipes for collecting water. On upper ward's eastern side was guarded by a short, Frankish, groin vaulted tower. On its sides was the eastern cistern and a building that may have served as a church. At the extreme west of the castle stands a ruined, isolated tower. The lack of a kitchen or a food storage, points to the fact that rooms were multi functional in their nature.|$|R
60|$|In the temple, the people, as they worshipped {{beneath the}} long colonnades, or beheld the lofty porticoes from the street, {{were left to}} imagine the {{corresponding}} majesty and symmetry of {{the interior of the}} structure, and were not admitted to discover how grievously it disappointed the brilliant expectations which the exterior was so well calculated to inspire; how little the dark, narrow halls of the idols, the secret <b>vaults</b> and gloomy <b>recesses</b> within, fulfilled the promise of the long flights of steps, the broad extent of pavement, the massive sun-brightened pillars without. So in the religion, the votary was allured by the splendour of processions; by the pomp of auguries; by the poetry of the superstition which peopled his native woods with the sportive Dryads, and the fountains from which he drank with their guardian Naiads; which gave to mountain and lake, to sun and moon and stars, to all things around and above him, their fantastic allegory, or their gracious legend of beauty and love: but beyond this, his first acquaintance with his worship was not permitted to extend, here his initiation concluded. He was kept in ignorance of the dark and dangerous depths which lurked beneath this smooth and attractive surface; he was left to imagine that what was displayed was but the prelude to the future discovery of what was hidden of beauty in the rites of Paganism; he was not admitted to behold the wretched impostures, the loathsome orgies, the hideous incantations, the bloody human sacrifices perpetrated in secret, which made the foul, real substance of the fair exterior form. His first sight of the temple was not less successful in deceiving his eye than his first impression of the religion in deluding his mind.|$|R
