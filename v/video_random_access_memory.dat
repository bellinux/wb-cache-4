40|$|Abstract. With the {{increasing}} programmability of GPUs (graphics processing units), these units are emerging as an attractive computing platform {{not only for}} traditional graphics computation but also for general-purpose computation. In this paper, to study the performance of programmable GPUs, we describe the design and implementation of LU decomposition {{as an example of}} numerical computation. To achieve this, we have developed and evaluated some methods with different implementation approaches in terms of (a) loop processing, (b) branch processing, and (c) vector processing. The experimental results give four important points: (1) dependent loops must be implemented {{through the use of a}} render texture in order to avoid copies in the <b>video</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (VRAM); (2) in most cases, branch processing can be efficiently handled by the CPU rather than the GPU; (3) as Fatahalian et al. state for matrix multiplication, we find that GPUs require higher VRAM cache bandwidth in order to provide full performance for LU decomposition; and (4) decomposition results obtained by GPUs usually differ from those by CPUs, mainly due to the floating-point division error that increases the numerical error with the progress of decomposition. ...|$|E

30|$|Recently, various {{non-volatile}} <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (NvRAM) such as magnetic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (MRAM), ferroelectric <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (FeRAM), phrase change memory (PCM), and resistive <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RRAM) {{were widely}} investigated and discussed for applications in portable electronic products {{which consisted of}} low power consumption IC [1], non-volatile memory [2 – 6], and TFT LCD display [7 – 10]. To overcome the technical and physical limitation issues of conventional charge storage-based memories [11 – 18], the resistive <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RRAM) device which consisted of the oxide-based layer sandwiched by two electrodes was a great potential candidate for the next-generation non-volatile memory because of its superior properties such as low cost, simple structure, fast operation speed, low operation power, and non-destructive readout properties [19 – 42].|$|R
25|$|Dynamic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a type}} of <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to static <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.|$|R

SLIM includes methodology for calculating target cycle times and target WIP levels for individual manufacturing steps, heuristic algorithms for factory floor scheduling, and optimization-based capacity analysis. Between 1996 and 1999, Samsung Electronics Corp., Ltd., implemented SLIM in all its semiconductor manufacturing facilities. It reduced manufacturing cycle times to fabricate dynamic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> devices from more than 80 days to less than 30. Considering the decline of selling prices for dynamic <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> devices, SLIM enabled Samsung to capture an additional $ 1 billion in sales revenue compared to the revenue it would have realized had cycle times not been reduced.
