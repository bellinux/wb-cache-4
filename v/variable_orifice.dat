50|$|The {{needle valve}} may be located {{proximal}} or distal to the inlet port; {{these two types}} of flowmeter are respectively called 'non-compensated' or 'compensated'. The original Thorpe tube flowmeter is the non-compensated type: it works with a fixed orifice and variable pressure. The non-compensated type is more accurate for low flow rates, such as are used in neonatal units, laboratory experiments, or anaesthetic machines. Compensated flowmeters work with a <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> and fixed pressure. They read back pressure, and take into account resistance changes downstream from the needle valve. If pressure exceeds 50 psig downstream, flow ceases.|$|E
5000|$|The PCV valve is a <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> that {{controls}} the flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|E

The three basic approaches to structural control may be defined as follows passive control systems,active control systems and semi-active control systems. These systems have received much attention recently because they have versatility and adaptability of active control systems. Although there is a wide variety of these energy absorbing devices, but all have one thing in common. they absorb energy from the structure. Semi-active control systems possess the advantages of both active and passive control systems. <b>Variable</b> <b>orifice</b> dampers are semi-active control devices that utilize the hydraulic fluid flow to generate controllable damping forces. Depending {{on the state of the}} structure, the energy absorbing property of the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> dampers is changed on the fly.

The flow channel was identical to an SRE fuel channel and included simulated upper and lower plenums. The fuel element mockup was equipped with a Hallam-type <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> at the channel exit and a fixed orifice in the strainer basket {{at the bottom of}} the element. Tests were performed to determine the optimum size for the fixed orifice and the temperature adjustment capability of the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> using this optimum fixed orifice.

40|$|External {{gear pumps}} {{are the most}} widely {{employed}} source of power in hydraulic applications, allowing good performance and low manufacturing costs. The present paper reports the description of a numerical model for the simulation of these kind of machines, developed by the authors. The model has been implemented using the software AMESim®, introducing new in-house C++ models, with the main aim of an accurate prediction of the pressure ripple at the delivery port and the calculation the flow rate time course through the pump. In fact the reduction of flow pulsations {{is one of the}} crucial targets in the development of these machines. The fluid dynamic model of the pump is based on a finite volumes framework: each chamber presents uniform fluid proprieties and is connected with the adjoining ones by <b>variable</b> <b>orifices.</b> The pump is described by the interaction between a fluid dynamic model, that predicts the instantaneous pressures and the flow rates between the chambers, with a geometrical sub-model for the evaluation of the actual values of the variable volumes (defined by teeth, housing, and side wear plates) and the throat areas, as functions of the shaft angular position. This paper reports a deep description of the fluid dynamic model and a comparison between its numerical results and data available from experiments, showing how a correct evaluation of the flow when the chambers expand (and oil is pushed from the supply tank) or decrease (and oil is ejected into the outlet port) allows a good prediction of the pump characteristics. The results reported in the paper show how the model can be a powerful tool for design and development of external gear pumps, e. g. it easily allows the prediction of the maximum and minimum pressure reached inside the teeth space volumes, giving important information to prevent cavitation and damages as well as to reduce the pump noise.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Portable {{peak flow}} meters {{are used in}} {{clinical}} practice for measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) at many different altitudes throughout the world. Some PEF meters are affected by gas density. This study was undertaken to establish which type of meter is best for use above sea level and to determine changes in spirometric measurements at altitude. METHODS: The <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> mini-Wright peak flow meter was compared with the fixed orifice Micro Medical Microplus turbine microspirometer at sea level and at Everest Base Camp (5300 m). Fifty one members of the 1994 British Mount Everest Medical Expedition were studied (age range, 19 - 55). RESULTS: Mean forced vital capacity (FVC) fell by 5 % and PEF rose by 25. 5 %. However, PEF recorded with the mini-Wright peak flow meter underestimated PEF by 31 %, giving readings 6. 6 % below sea level values. FVC was lowest in the mornings and did not improve significantly with acclimatisation. Lower PEF values were observed on morning readings and were associated with higher acute mountain sickness scores, although the latter may reflect decreased effort in those with acute mountain sickness. There was no change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) at altitude when measured with the turbine microspirometer. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the fall in FVC at 5300 m is unknown but {{may be attributed to}} changes in lung blood volume, interstitial lung oedema, or early airways closure. <b>Variable</b> <b>orifice</b> peak flow meters grossly underestimate PEF at altitude and fixed orifice devices are therefore preferable where accurate PEF measurements are required above sea level...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} {{the ability of}} Doppler color flow mapping to accurately and reproducibly assess the flow volume and kinetic energy of in vitro fluid Jets, a Doppler color flow mapping system was interfaced with an image processing computer. An aliasing correction algorithm was used to extend the upper limit of measurable velocity to 184 cm/s. Images were analyzed for jet area (equal to {{the total number of}} image pixels) and jet energy (equal to the sum of all pixel velocities squared), both integrated over all frames of the injection and in single maximal frames. The Doppler flow mapping area and energy measurements were compared with known flow volume and delivered kinetic energy, and the effects of four experimental <b>variables</b> (<b>orifice</b> area, gain setting, chamber compliance and chamber size) were evaluated. Jet area correlated nonlinearly with flow volume and was markedly affected by each of these experimental variables, increasing by 40 to 150 % from the smallest to the largest orifice size, 15 to 94 % with the highest versus the lowest gain setting, 1 to 54 % with greater chamber compliance and 7 to 70 % in the large versus the small chamber. In contrast, jet energy correlated linearly with delivered kinetic energy up to 350, 000 ergs, at which point velocities started to exceed the extended velocity range and second wrap aliasing occurred. The relation was not affected by orifice area, gain or compliance, and was only minimally affected by chamber size. The relations between jet area and injection volume were best described by second degree polynomial equations, and coefficients of determination (R 2) were highest when examining each individual experimental setting separately (R 2 = 0. 91 to 0. 99) rather than when grouping data for all settings of each of the four variables (R 2 = 0. 53 to 0. 91). The relation between jet energy and delivered kinetic energy was best described by linear regression, and examining each individual setting separately (R 2 = 0. 89 to 0. 99) did not improve the fit of the data over grouping data {{for each of the four}} variables (R 2 = 0. 92 to 0. 98). Doppler color flow mapping area measurements have limited ability to predict flow volume because the relation between the two is curvilinear and affected by a number of variables. In contrast, Doppler flow mapping energy measurements in an in vitro setting appear to be linearly related to delivered kinetic energy, are not affected by these variables and may therefore allow Doppler flow mapping quantification of kinetic energy transfer by fluid jets...|$|R

This research explores valve design, dynamic modeling, and techniques to achieve flow control for a forced-feedback metering poppet valve system. In particular, nonlinear and linear models of a forced feedback configuration are developed and tuned through the use of root locus techniques. Typical steady state conditions as well as extreme high and low pressure drops are simulated in attempts to uncover instabilities and other possible undesirable performance characteristics of the valve. It is shown that by using a <b>variable</b> inlet <b>orifice</b> to the control volume as opposed to a constant orifice, desired system bandwidth and stability can be achieved.

Density and size effects of non-disintegrating dosage forms on GI transit were investigated. Total GI transit times range from 2 to 33 days for 22 administrations of these nondisintegrating dosage forms. Pigs are found to not be an appropriate animal model for studying bioavailability or GI transit of non-disintegrating, non-erodible oral release dosage forms. Development of controlled release dosage forms where the mechanism of drug release is diffusion through polymeric membrane formed via film coating utilizing fluid-bed technology requires optimization of several processing and formulation variables. The influence of a processing <b>variable</b> (nozzle <b>orifice</b> opening) and a few formulation variables (individual vs. combination plasticizer, or a water-insoluble additive) on dissolution of a model drug (acetaminophen) spray coated with Aquacoat® were studied. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information for a model drug (acetaminophen) and computer simulation were used to develop a dosage form with a 12 hour sustained release for oral administration to children and adults for maximum analgesic and antipyretic effect. Simulated plasma acetaminophen concentration-time curves were similar to observed bioavailability study profiles. In vitro and preliminary in vivo results from an adult human volunteer indicate that sustained therapeutic saliva acetaminophen concentration is possible using the newly developed acetaminophen molded tablet dosage form.

40|$|Traditionally, growers spray uniform {{application}} of pesticides over the target area regardless of variations in pest infestations. In recent years, variable rate application (VRA) technologies {{have made it possible}} to apply pesticides in variable rates across the field. In pesticide application, nozzles play a vital role. In general, pesticides are applied using conventional nozzles. Most conventional nozzles vary flow rates only over a 2 : 1 range when operated within the recommended pressure range due to a fixed spray orifice. Conventional nozzles vary droplet sizes tremendously when there are speed and application rate changes which results in inefficient application. Conventional nozzles have limitations when used for VRA. A new nozzle called Varitarget nozzle (U. S.

To this end, a multi-rate test was implemented in two production wells routed individually to a test separator in field operational conditions. The well flow rate was varied in steps {{by changing the}} choke opening. The ranges of fluid properties and flow conditions achieved during the experiment were: wellhead pressure from 9073 kPa to 13, 278 kPa, wellhead temperature from 47. 8 C to 53. 5 C, downstream choke pressure from 6770 kPa to 7913 kPa, downstream choke temperature from 41. 6 C to 49. 1 C, gas–oilratio from 1144 Sm 3 =Sm 3 to 2068 Sm 3 =Sm 3, water-cut from 4. 64 % to 58. 35 %, standard oil specific gravity from 0. 7988 to 0. 8058, standard gas specific gravity from 0. 7340 to 0. 7550, standard oil flow rate from 46 : 86 Sm 3 =d to 266 : 65 Sm 3 =d, standard gas flow rate from 62 : 68 103 Sm 3 =d to 296 : 65 103 Sm 3 =d, standard water flow rate from 18 : 06 m 3 =d to 159 : 33 m 3 =d. The wells tested showed a different dynamic behavior: while well # 2 did not vary significantly the stream composition with flow rate, well # 1 produced under gas coning, a near well-reservoir phenomenon that governs {{the contribution of the}} reservoir gas-cap to the total stream composition. The multi-rate tests generated two data sets with 1424 flow conditions through two flange-tap orifice plates installed upstream (wellhead) and downstream of a cage choke valve. The ranges of <b>orifice</b> <b>variables</b> were: <b>orifice</b> diameter from 0. 03479 m to 0. 0430 m, beta factor from 0. 4946 to 0. 6507, differential pressure from 15 kPa to 187 kPa. The virtual metering system presented in Paz et al. (2010) was used to correlate the experimental data. The associated model, suitable for differential pressure measuring devices, includes effects such as flow concentration and slip (through Chisholm’s correlation), generalizing the mass flow rate versus pressure drop relationship for multiphase flow. The total mass flow rate depends on a set of variables evaluated at metering conditions: density and viscosity of the liquid and gas phase, mass quality, pressure drop across the flow meter and geometry (contraction area and beta factor). The determination of the fluid properties at metering conditions was made by using black-oil correlations. These correlations are based on a set of input variables at standard condition that characterizes the stream composition such as gas–oil ratio, water–oil ratio and specific gravities of each phase. A comparison was made between the multiphase flow rates predicted by the model and the ones simultaneously measured at the test separators. The oil, gas and water standard volumetric flow rate deviations (coefficients of variation of the root mean square deviations) were below 3 : 52 %. It was theoretically demonstrated and experimentally verified that a systematic error exists when the homogeneous model (equal phase velocities) is considered in the formulation, resulting in a flow rate underestimation. When the homogeneous model was used to correlate the data, this effect increased the deviation up to 10 : 5 %. Flow pattern at the wellhead was characterized as intermittent and annular-mist. Lockhart–Martinelli parameter varied from 0. 362 to 0. 836; despite of the experimental data being beyond the wet gas region, the multi-rate tests showed that Chisholm’s over-reading can be successfully extrapolated to these rang...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{landing gears}} are {{currently}} optimised to have optimal {{performance in the}} rare case of a hard landing. The resulting suspension layout may lead to unsatisfactory oscillations when the aircraft is taxiing on a rough runway; runway unevenness can excite elastic structural modes, leading to passenger and crew discomfort. Although there are existing modifications of aircraft shock absorbers to reduce the problem, the basic design conflict between the requirements for landing and for rolling cannot be fully overcome by a passive suspension layout. Semi-active suspension techniques promise {{a solution to this}} problem. A semi-active suspension, i. e. a damper with a <b>variable,</b> controlled <b>orifice</b> cross-section, is capable of reducing fuselage vibrations effectively while being relatively light-weight and low system complexity. In this thesis, three control laws, a skyhook-type controller, a fuzzy-logic controller, and a state feedback controller are designed for the application to a semi-active suspension for an aircraft nose landing gear. Regarding the aircraft flexibility, the landing gear can no longer be designed independently from the aircraft. The layout of the controllers is therefore undertaken using an integrated design approach. Airframe and landing gear properties are determined taking into consideration models from different engineering disciplines involved in the aircraft development process, making the oleo design part of the concurrent engineering loop. The aircraft model is set up in a multibody simulation environment. The control laws are developed in a control design tool; special consideration is given to the requirements of semi-active actuators. The controllers are exported into the simulation environment and their parameters are optimised by means of multi-objective optimisation. In a further step, the performance of the three control strategies are compared with each other and additionally with passive and fully active approaches. The dependence of the control performance on operational parameters (aircraft weight and speed, runway roughness) is assessed, and limitations due to realistic actuators restrictions are discussed. Finally, the benefits and disadvantages of semi-active nose landing gear control are summarized and open problems are addressed...|$|R

The demand for improvement in this area has only increased as a result of the following two situations: First, deregulation has produced a heightened demand for both reduced electrical cost and improved grid connectivity. Second, environmental concerns have simultaneously resulted in a need for both increased efficiency and reduced carbon and NOx emissions. A potential approach to addressing both these needs would be improvement in the area of combustion control. This would result in a better heat rate, reduced unburned carbon in ash, and reduced NOx emissions. However, before feedback control can be implemented, the ability to monitor coal flow to the burners in real-time must be established. While there are several ''commercially available'' products for real-time coal flow measurement, power plant personnel are highly skeptical about the accuracy and longevity of these systems in their current state of development. In fact, following several demonstration projects of in-situ coal flow measurement systems in full scale utility boilers, it became obvious that there were still many unknown influences on these instruments during field applications. Due to the operational environment of the power plant, it has been difficult if not impossible to sort out what parameters could be influencing the various probe technologies. Additionally, it has been recognized for some time that little is known regarding the performance of coal flow splitters, even where rifflers are employed. Often the coal flow distribution from these splitters remains mal-distributed. There have been mixed results in the field using <b>variable</b> <b>orifices</b> in coal pipes. Development of other coal flow control devices has been limited. An underlying difficulty that, to date, has hindered the development of an accurate instrument for coal flow measurements is the fact that coal flow is characterized by irregular temporal and spatial variation. However, despite the inherent complexity of the dynamic system, the system is in fact deterministic. Therefore, in principle, the coal flow can be deduced from the dynamics it exhibits. Nonetheless, the interactions are highly nonlinear, rendering standard signal processing approaches, which rely on techniques such as frequency decomposition, to be of little value. Foster-Miller, Inc. has developed a methodology that relates the complex variation in such systems to the information of interest. This technology will be described in detail in Section 2. A second concern regarding the current measurement systems is installation, which can be labor-intensive and cost-prohibitive. A process that does not require the pulverizer to be taken off line would be highly desirable. Most microwave and electrostatic methods require drilling up to 20 holes in the pipe, all with a high degree of precision so as to produce a proper alignment of the probes. At least one electrostatic method requires a special spool piece to be fitted into each existing coal pipe. Overall, these procedures are both difficult and very expensive. An alternative approach is pursued here, namely the development of an instrument that relies on an acoustic signal captured by way of a commercial accelerometer. The installation of this type of sensor is both simpler and less invasive than other techniques. An accelerometer installed in a pipe wall need not penetrate through the wall, which means that the system may be able to remain on line during the installation. Further, due to the fact that the Dynamical Instruments technology, unlike other systems, does not rely on uniformity of the air or coal profile, the installation location need not be on a long, straight run of pipe. In fact, an optimal signal is obtained near a pipe elbow. This is fortuitous, as bends are often more accessible on pipes in a power plant than straight sections. In contrast to measurement systems that rely on the uniformity of the air and coal profile, the accuracy of the system under development will not compromised by varying levels of flow uniformity...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis provides a methodology of designing, modeling and controlling a fully pneumatic semi-active vibration isolator system. The prototype vibration isolator system {{has the ability to}} adjust the damping and natural frequency characteristics of the system. It consists of an air spring, a <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> valve, and an accumulator. In this conguration, the spring characteristics are provided by the air spring and accumulator, while the <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> valve provides the damping characteristics. The valve is computer regulated according to the innovative control laws that were developed for the pneumatic system. The vibration isolator system is designed to work in the vibration environment that is typically observed in the case of Class 7 and 8 vehicles as dened by the U. S Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. In order to design a vibration isolator system for the intended application, a benchmarking study was conducted to gain additional insight on OEM vibration isolator systems features and limitations. Based on the insights obtained from this study, the design requirements for the system were dened. This paper presents a methodology of producing a plant model that is based on supplier 2 ̆ 7 s engineering specications and experimental characterization. The plant model includes a complete characterization of nonlinear pressure to volume and eective area to ride height relationships. A detailed design process of selecting and implementing components to optimize system performance is also provided. The plant model was then used to design three semiactive controllers that use position and pressure feedback signals that exploit the nonlinear characterizations to measure direct force generation. The semi-active controllers that were designed for this novel pneumatic vibration isolator system include: a LQI (Linear Quadratic Impulse) optimal controller, Modied Skyhook controller, and a Relative Displacement controller. This vibration isolator system was designed, fabricated, and tested using a prototype electronic height control system. A comprehensive design process for the specialized height control system is also presented. The performance of the system was evaluated using a custom testing apparatus that was built specically for this vibration isolator research. The testing apparatus was designed to accommodate dierent isolator systems and excite them with simulated road disturbances to obtain head-to-head system comparisons. This research presents a comparison between the system performances of an OEM Peterbilt cab suspension unit and the innovative fully pneumatic semi-active vibration isolator prototype using the three dierent control laws. It was found that the properly tuned controllers were able to provide desired dynamic characteristics over the range of common ride frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of gas exchanges {{is essential in}} mechanical ventilation and in respiratory monitoring. Among {{the large number of}} commercial flowmeters, only few kinds of sensors are used in these fields. Among them, <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> meters (VOMs) show some valuable characteristics, such as linearity, good dynamic response, and low cost. This paper presents the characterization of a commercial VOM intended for application in respiratory monitoring. Firstly, two nominally identical VOMs were calibrated within ± 10 [*]L·min− 1, to assess their metrological properties. Furthermore, experiments were performed by humidifying the air, to evaluate the influence of vapor condensation on sensor’s performances. The condensation influence was investigated during two long lasting trials (i. e., 4 hours) by delivering 4 [*]L·min− 1 and 8 [*]L·min− 1. Data show that the two VOMs’ responses are linear and their response is comparable (sensitivity difference of 1. 4 %, RMSE of 1. 50 [*]Pa); their discrimination threshold is < 0. 5 [*]L·min− 1, and the settling time is about 66 [*]ms. The condensation within the VOM causes a negligible change in sensor sensitivity and a very slight deterioration of precision. The good static and dynamic properties and the low influence of condensation on sensor’s response make this VOM suitable for applications in respiratory function monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{the exit}} {{temperature}} of the coolant from each fuel channel of the Hallam Nuclear Power Facility reactor is obtained by adjusting the coolant flow rate by a remotely operated <b>variable</b> <b>orifice.</b> Two variable orifices were designed and the hydraulic characteristics determined. Both orifice designs utilized a tapered plug {{moving in and out}} of a restricted flow passage at the upper end of the fuel channel. Data were obtained on pressure drop as a function of flow rate at different orifice plug positions; all measurements were made using water, and data were converted to equivalent values for sodium. Either type of orifice was capable of adjusting flow rate to match the power output of a fuel element at any location in the reactor core. The temperature sensitivity (change in exit temperature per unit change in orifice plug position) of the first type of orifice was low (lO deg F/in.) when used in combination with a central fuel element, and high (7 OO deg F/in.) when used with a peripheral element. The temperature sensitivity of the second type was more uniform (varying from 90 to 250 deg F/ in.). Consequently, the second type of orifice was selected for the HNPF. (auth...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{hypothesis}} that invasively derived jet <b>variables</b> including regurgitant <b>orifice</b> area and momentum determine the characteristics of Doppler color flow jets in patients with aortic regurgitation. Background. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the velocity distribution of a regurgitant jet is best characterized by the momentum of the jet, which incorporates orifice area and velocity of flow through the orifice. Methods. Peak jet momentum, peak flow rate and regurgitant orifice area were determined with intraaortic Doppler catheter and cardiac catheterization techniques in 22 patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. These invasively derived variables were compared with apical and parasternal long-axis Doppler color echocardiographic variables obtained in the catheterization laboratory. Results. Jet momentum increased significantly with the angiographic grade of regurgitation. The apical color jet area of aortic regurgitation increased linearly with jet momentum and regurgitant orifice area in vivo, but the correlations were only moderately good (r = 0. 63 and 0. 65, respectively). Color jet length also increased linearly with jet momentum and with regurgitant orifice area. There was only a trend for Doppler color jet width to increase with all invasively derived jet variables. Conclusions. Whereas jet area by Doppler color flow imaging is directly related to both orifice area and jet momentum in vivo, Doppler color variables measured in planes normal to the orifice do not correlate well enough with either jet momentum or regurgitant orifice area to predict jet Flow variables in patients with aortic regurgitation. It is likely that the important influence of adjacent boundaries will limit the use of the velocity distribution of aortic regurgitant jets for determining the severity of diseas...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ester) drug-loaded {{microspheres}} {{are most}} commonly prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation/extraction {{in which the}} polymer is dissolved in an organic solvent which is dispersed in an aqueous continuous phase. Typically, the o/w or more complex w/o/w (required for encapsulation of hydrophilic actives) emulsions are produced by homogenization, sonication or high speed stirring which yield microspheres with wide size distributions. Standard deviations of 25 - 50 % of the mean diameter are not uncommon for microspheres prepared by such technologies. This lack of control and predictability are limitations of the current technologies. Particle size is a primary determinant of drug release and particle deposition following in vivo administration. Any variation {{in the size of}} particles will lead to sub-optimal delivery in which release kinetics are difficult to control. A long-sought after goal in particulate drug delivery technologies has therefore been to precisely control the size of the particles. Many theoretical and experimental studies have shown that uniformly sized liquid-liquid dispersions can be formed by laminar jet break-up. However, to date nobody has used the resulting dispersions for the preparation of drug loaded polymeric microparticles. The aim of this project was therefore to investigate the application of laminar jet break-up for the preparation of o/w dispersions for the fabrication of monodisperse biodegradable microparticles of controlled and predictable size. In this study, poly(@-caprolactone) was used as the polymer and was dissolved in an organic solvent (initially and mainly, dichloromethane). The organic polymer solution was loaded into a high precision syringe pump and pumped through orifices of different diameters into an aqueous phase containing poly(vinyl alcohol) as surfactant. The dispersions were subsequently stirred to facilitate solvent removal leading to polymer precipitation and microparticle formation. Resulting microparticles were characterized by optical microscopy and low angle laser light scattering. In the first series of investigations (Chapter 2), the effect of orifice diameter, flow rate (particularly within the laminar jet region), type of organic solvent and polymer/surfactant concentrations on the size and polydispersity of the microparticles were investigated. Uniformly sized microspheres (polydispersity index < 0. 5) were observed to form in both the dripping and laminar jet flow regions. Microspheres formed in the laminar region were however smaller and there was a trend of decreasing particle size and polydispersity upon approaching the flow velocity resulting in maximum jet-length. In the dewaving region, polydispersity of the particles was found to increase. Consequently, all further studies were undertaken in the laminar jet region using the flow rate yielding maximum jet length. Polydispersity as well as size of micrparticles was influenced by concentration of poly(vinylalcohol) in the continuous aqueous phase (used as viscosity modifier and surfactant). A concentration of 0. 91 % w/v poly(vinylalcohol) was found most suitable with higher/lower concentrations resulting in increased polydispersity as a result of viscosity and interfacial effects. Size and polydispersity of microspheres was found to be also influenced by the organic solvent used to dissolve the poly(ester) with dichloromethane yielding the smallest and most uniformly dispersed microspheres. Size of microspheres produced from dispersions prepared by laminar jet break-up not surprisingly increased with both the size of the orifice used for jetting and the concentration of polymer. In chapter 3, a factorial designed study combined with mathematical modelling was used to investigate whether a relationship existed between the response variable of particle size and these two independent process <b>variables</b> (nozzle <b>orifice</b> diameter and polymer concentration) for microspheres prepared under conditions {{based on the results of}} chapter 2 (namely jetting at a velocity yielding maximum jet length, using dichloromethane as the organic solvent and using a poly(vinylalcohol) concentration of 0. 91 % w/v in the aqueous phase). Based on the results of four trials (22 factorial design), a linear, algebraic first-degree polynomial correlation was predicted to describe the effects of nozzle orifice diameter, polymer concentration and their interaction on the mean particle size of microspheres. The model was validated by 11 experimental results within the factor space. It was found that the predicted values of ten experiments (means, n= 3) were within ± 5. 5 % of the calculated values. Only one experimental result deviated by greater than 10 % from that predicted. The model thus allows a prescribed size of particles to be prepared by selecting the appropriate nozzle orifice size and polymer concentration...|$|R
40|$|During high {{frequency}} jet ventilation (HFJV) the clearance {{of carbon dioxide}} appears to be very variable. This {{may be the result}} of differences in the volume of gas delivered to the trachea or of variations in the pattern of gas transport in the conducting airways and alveoli. Since it is difficult to collect true mixed expired gas during HFJV, we have studied the effects of adding deadspaces of different lengths and volumes on the elimination of carbon dioxide from a lung model. METHODS The model lung (Manley Lung Ventilator Per-formance Analyser) consisted of a spring-loaded bellows with a <b>variable</b> <b>orifice</b> to simulate airway resistance.
