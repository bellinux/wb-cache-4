5000|$|<b>Cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is a spray {{form of an}} oil as a lubricant, {{lecithin}} as an emulsifier, and a propellant such as food-grade alcohol, nitrous oxide, {{carbon dioxide}} or propane. <b>Cooking</b> <b>spray</b> is applied to frying pans and other cookware to prevent food from sticking. Traditionally, cooks used butter, shortening, or oils poured or rubbed on cookware. [...] Most <b>cooking</b> <b>sprays</b> have less food energy per serving than an application of vegetable oil, because they are applied in a much thinner layer: US regulations allow many to be labelled [...] "zero-calorie"; in the UK sprays claim to supply [...] "less than 1 calorie per serving". Popular US brands include Pam, Crisco, and Baker's Joy. Sprays are available with plain vegetable oil, butter and olive oil flavor.|$|R

Coating the inside of a measuring cup with the spray allows sticky substances such as honey to pour out more easily.

50|$|Cooking {{is done on}} a {{charcoal}} grill. The grates are greased with pork fat, bacon, oil, butter or <b>cooking</b> <b>spray</b> {{in order to prevent}} sticking. While the meat is gently cooked over light to medium heat, it is basted after every turn with the marinade or with beer, sprayed directly from a gently shaken bottle. This serves to improve the taste and prevents a drying of the meat on the cooking surface. Moreover, the cooking temperature is regulated by gently spraying beer directly on the charcoal; the rising steam helps to cook and flavour the meat.|$|R

50|$|Lecithin {{can easily}} be {{extracted}} chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, benzene, etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as soybeans, eggs, milk, marine sources, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in nonstick <b>cooking</b> <b>spray.</b>|$|R

Current detection methods cannot {{meet the needs}} for rapid detection of adulterated oils on line or in field. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research was to develop a rapid optical sensing method based on fluorescence quenching of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) for identification of adulterated <b>vegetable</b> <b>cooking</b> oils. High quality hydrophilic photoluminescent nanoparticles were synthesized by encapsulating hydrophobic QDs into the micellar structure of an amphiphilic surfactant cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) via phase transfer method. TEM, AFM, and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to characterize the prepared CTAB-coated QDs. Oil samples were first captured into the core of the two-layer-structural micelle and then the fluorescence of CTAB-coated QDs, working as fluorescence probes, was selectively quenched by components of the adulterated oils. Heavy metal ions and free radicals were presumed to be main quenchers. After quenching for 1 min, fluorescence intensity was measured and converted to quenching percentage to determine the adulteration concentration. The results showed that in comparison with oil-soluble QDs, water-soluble CTAB-coated QDs had a greater ability to identify oil adulteration. A good quantitative relationship between quenching percentage and adulteration concentration (y = 5. 96 x + 14. 99; R- 2 = 0. 94) was obtained. The sensitive, simple and low-cost sensing method did not require sample pretreatment and could detect refined used oils at 0. 4 % or higher concentrations in soybean oil within 2 min, showing great potentials for rapid screening of used oils and quantitative analysis of used oil adulteration in field.

50|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{were once}} {{often used as}} propellants, but since the Montreal Protocol came into force in 1989, they have been {{replaced}} in nearly every country due to the negative effects CFCs have on Earth's ozone layer. The most common replacements are mixtures of volatile hydrocarbons, typically propane, n-butane and isobutane. Dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl ethyl ether are also used. All these have the disadvantage of being flammable. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are also used as propellants to deliver foodstuffs (for example, whipped cream and <b>cooking</b> <b>spray).</b> Medicinal aerosols such as asthma inhalers use hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA): either HFA 134a (1,1,1,2,-tetrafluoroethane) or HFA 227 (1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) or combinations of the two.
