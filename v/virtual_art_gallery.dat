40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the public {{presentation}} of self through <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> <b>galleries,</b> singling out the field of photography. Photography has always been disputed as being part of the highbrow arts because of its popular character. Today, anyone who owes a photo camera can experience photography as art, without a rigorous training. Everybody is able to expose the photos freely to a large number of people, on the Internet. Consequently, the Internet opens up a virtual space, in which photo artists and amateurs can promote their works and exhibit them in a personal online gallery, which represents their place in the virtual vastness. Therefore, my research approaches the matter of the virtual gallery as an identitary place, being focused on finding out why artists choose to exhibit in virtual galleries. I asked myself what are the new functions of the <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> galleries?Are they understood as online markers that distinguish the owners in these virtual environments? In other words, are these personal galleries a way of expressing online identities...|$|R

40|$|With the {{development}} of new modes of web interface and 3 D virtual environment, the concept of navigability is considered an important element to understand users’ experience with the interface. Particularly in the context of <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> <b>galleries,</b> navigability can influence users’ level of immersive and enjoyable experience of artworks. Responding to the conflicting evidence showing both positive and negative effects of higher navigability on the evaluation of online art exhibitions, this study examines the impact of navigability on flow-like experiences (i. e., skill-challenge match, immersion) and user enjoyment and behavioral intention. Thirty-five undergraduate students participated in a between-subjects experimental study with two conditions (2 D interface for low navigability vs. 3 D interface for high navigability). Participants in the low navigability condition reported lower levels of skill-challenge match and higher levels of immersion and enjoyment than those in the high navigability condition. Also, we found that immersion, not a skill-challenge match, mediated the effect of navigability on enjoyment which led to behavioral intention. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Language {{is key to}} culture. It is {{a direct}} {{cultural}} medium {{as well as a}} means of recording and providing access to non-lingual elements of culture. Language is also fundamental to a sense of cultural identity. For this reason, it is vital, in a changing Europe, that we preserve the multi-lingual character of our society in order to move successfully towards closer co-operation at a political, economic, and social level. Language engineering is the application of knowledge of language to the development of computer software which can recognise, understand, interpret, and generate human language in all its forms. The paper provides a high level view of the ‘state of the art’ in language engineering and indicates ways in which it will have a profound impact on our culture in the future. It shows how advances in language engineering are an important aid in maintaining cultural diversity in a multi-lingual European society, while enabling the development of social cohesion across cultural and national divides. It addresses issues raised by the prospect of the Multi-lingual Information Society, including education, human communication with technology and information management, as well as aspects of digital cities such as tele-presence in digital libraries, <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> <b>galleries</b> and electronic museums. The paper raises the issue of language as a factor in cultural domination, showing the contribution that language engineering can make towards countering it. The paper also raises a number of controversial issues concerning the likely benefits arising from the ways in which language is likely to influence the culture of Europe. ...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{validity}} {{should be}} the cornerstone of any assessment of cognitive functioning.

The AGT involves three visual search subtests displayed in a <b>virtual</b> reality (VR) <b>art</b> <b>gallery,</b> designed to assess visual attention within an ecologically valid setting. To evaluate the relation between AGT and standard neuropsychological assessment scales, data were collected on a normative sample of healthy adults (n = 30). The measures consisted of concurrent paper-and-pencil neuropsychological measures [Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB), and Color Trails Test (CTT) ] along with the outcomes from the three subtests of the AGT. The results showed significant correlations between the AGT subtests describing different visual search exercises strategies with global and specific cognitive measures.

The training and testing data are the average and variance {{of a set of}} visitors' attention data computing by the proposed function of the visit time and observation distance variables.

Virtual exhibits may afford opportunities for both the artist and the patron to display, view and perhaps purchase various digital art forms. The aim of this chapter is to examine user interaction with digital artworks inside a virtual gallery space along a metric based on a virtuality continuum. The chapter describes a number of experiments where users interacted with a <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> <b>gallery</b> and were then extensively interviewed and surveyed. The gallery is a three-dimensional graphic digital construction within the RMIT University virtual campus in Second Life. Users take on the form of online avatars to access the Second Life online environment and experience various colourful art objects in a simulated gallery environment. The experiment initially employs the taxonomy of Milgram and Kishino (1994) to assist the discussion of real, virtual and mixed-reality media.

The purpose of the experiment was to determine if the level of lighting quality and degree of texture resolution increased the participants ’ sense of presence as measured by physiological responses. Findings indicated that, as participants moved from a low-stress environment to an adjacent high-stress environment, there were significant increases in all physiological measurements. The experiment did not discriminate between conditions. In the second experiment (Gallery Experiment), 63 participants experienced a non-stressful <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> <b>gallery.</b> This experiment studied the influence of lighting quality, position, and intensity on movement and attention.

40|$|Virtual reality (VR) {{technology}} has matured {{to a point}} where humans can navigate in virtual scenes; however, providing them with a comfortable fully immersive role in VR remains a challenge. Currently available sensing solutions do not provide ease of deployment, particularly in the seated position due to sensor placement restrictions over the body, and optic-sensing requires a restricted indoor environment to track body movements. Here we present a 52 -sensor laden garment interfaced with VR, which offers both portability and unencumbered user movement in a VR environment. This chapter addresses the systems engineering aspects of our pervasive computing solution of the interactive sensorized 3 D VR and presents the initial results and future research directions. Participants navigated in a <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> <b>gallery</b> using natural body movements that were detected by their wearable sensor shirt and then mapped the signals to electrical control signals responsible for VR scene navigation.
