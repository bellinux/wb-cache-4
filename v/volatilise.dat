5000|$|After mashing, {{the beer}} wort is boiled with hops (and other {{flavourings}} if used) {{in a large}} tank known as a [...] "copper" [...] or brew kettle - though historically the mash vessel was used and is still in some small breweries. [...] The boiling process is where chemical and technical reactions take place, including sterilization of the wort to remove unwanted bacteria, releasing of hop flavours, bitterness and aroma compounds through isomerization, stopping of enzymatic processes, precipitation of proteins, and concentration of the wort. Finally, the vapours produced during the boil <b>volatilise</b> off-flavours, including dimethyl sulfide precursors. The boil is conducted {{so that it is}} even and intense - a continuous [...] "rolling boil". The boil on average lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of water the brewer expects to evaporate.

30|$|More {{recent studies}} have {{supported}} and expanded upon the aforementioned thermal decomposition mechanisms of polyurethane foams. Garrido and Font (2015) reported two main steps in the inert-atmosphere decomposition of flexible polyurethane foams. The first step is the decomposition of the urethane bonds to release and <b>volatilise</b> isocyanates up to 300  °C, with long chain alcohols being {{left behind in the}} condensed phase, followed by the alcohols degrading at around 400  °C. Isocyanates were primarily produced during the first stage, and in the second stage primarily carbonyls (R 2 -C[*]=[*]O) and hydrocarbons were detected using infrared analysis.|$|E

30|$|Chambers et al. (1981) {{reported}} similar data {{by analysing}} the inert-atmosphere pyrolysis {{of a series}} of biscarbamates to act as model compounds representing polyurethane foams. At 300  °C, free isocyanates and alcohols were produced from the decomposition of these biscarbamates. At this temperature around one third of the compounds mass was lost as volatile products, and the regenerated alcohol products were mainly present in the residue of the sample. Again, above 600  °C the compound and any “yellow smoke” present was decomposed into smaller volatile fragments. The study also suggested that any remaining isocyanates residue would react with themselves to produce polycarbodiimides, thus anchoring the isocyanate precursors in the condensed phase until around 600  °C, where they would fragment. While this may occur to some degree, it is generally accepted {{that the majority of the}} diisocyanates produced in the decomposition of polyurethanes are either <b>volatilised</b> or converted into their amine derivative and then <b>volatilised.</b>|$|R
40|$|Volatilisation {{rates of}} five {{pesticides}} (parathion-methyl, endosulfan, fenpropimorph, lindane, trifluralin) applied in formulations were determined from soil surfaces and French beans.

Toluene extracts of the adsorbent were analyzed by gas chromatography. Volatilisation from soil surfaces within 24 hours increased in the order parathion-methyl = fenpropimorph < endosulfan < lindane < trifluralin. For all compounds volatilisation from French beans was higher as compared to volatilisation from soil surfaces. Volatilisation rates from plant surfaces were 50 - 70 per cent for parathion-methyl, endosulfan, fenpropimorph, and lindane. Trifluralin was nearly completely <b>volatilised</b> within 24 hours.

30|$|The {{difference}} in the decomposition of rigid and flexible polyurethane foams was investigated by Chun et al. (2007). They attributed the different decomposition mechanisms to the physical form of the polyurethane foam, rather than to any chemical differences. Rigid foam decomposed between 200 and 410  °C, while flexible foam decomposed between 150 to 500  °C. The authors reported GC/MS analysis of the condensed phase products obtained. In both rigid and flexible foams, aniline and p-aminotoluene were reported, which correlates {{with the work of}} Ravey and Pearce (1997) who reported that isocyanates that did not <b>volatilise</b> were converted into amines in the condensed phase. Rigid polyurethanes primarily produced aromatic compounds in the condensed phase products of decomposition, whereas flexible polyurethanes produced aromatics, alcohols, aldehydes and heterocycles.|$|E
40|$|On heating at {{volatilisation}} temperatures, polystyrene (PS) and telechelic chloromethoxyphosphonated polystyrene (TPPS) behave {{differently in}} the very early stage of the process. The initial rate of volatilisation of PS is zero and increases with conversion whereas TPPS polymers <b>volatilise</b> at an initial high rate which decreases with conversion. However, in the main stage of volatilisation (from 10 - 20 to 70 % weight loss) both polymers liberate the same volatile products through the same basic mechanism of depolymerisation. Nevertheless, the overall rate of volatilisation of TPPS polymers in this stage is much lower than that of PS. This is attributed to the creation in degrading TPPS polymers of less reactive chain carriers of the depolymerisation process which are stabilised by the phosphoryl group...|$|E

Through the use of the empirical models, operators were able to optimise the chlorine dose rates. However, some distribution systems require further minimisation of THM concentrations.

40|$|The {{volatilisation}} of lindane from {{soil and}} French beans was {{tested in a}} wide tunnel under defined conditions. <b>Volatilised</b> lindane was determined directly by passing a partial air stream through an adsorbent. Applications of a lindane formulation onto soil and plant surfaces were performed using a moving nozzle. Soil volatilisation experiments were conducted using differnt air velocities (0. 4, 1. 1, 1. 7 m/s). At higher air velocities the volatilisation rate increased from 12 % to 31 % within 24 h (initial dose 100 %). For plant experiments with different velocities (0. 4, 1. 0, 2. 0 m/s) the volatilisation rate increased from 52 % to 62 % at the highest velocity. Additionally, as higher air velocities were applied, air concentrations of lindane during the first hour decreased from 1. 61 micron gramm/cbm at 0. 4 m/s to 0. 61 micron gramm/cbm at 2. 0 m/s.

40|$|Abstract- Mass {{spectrometry}} is now {{established as}} a useful method for establishing the sequence of small peptides (2 - 10 residues), following their derivatisation (by N—acetylation and permethylation) to increase volatility. The strength of the method lies {{in its ability to}} deal with simple mixtures of peptides and to identify unusual amino acids. The weakness of the method (relative to some wet-chemical approaches to sequencing) lies in the current inability of the method to sequence larger peptides, and the relatively low sensitivity when working with peptides near the molecular weight limit of the method. This last shortcoming is due to our present inability to <b>volatilise</b> and efficiently produce high mass ions from the larger peptides, the inherent sensitivity of mass spectrometry being in contrast extremely high. The use of deuterated reagents in degradation and derivatisation reactions provides a powerful method for structure elucidation of glycopeptide antibiotics containing unusual amino acids...|$|E
40|$|Biofuels {{offer the}} {{potential}} to substitute for {{a large proportion of}} fossil fuels, however it is considered that the utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass, via second generation (or biorefining) technologies, will be necessary for this to be achieved economically and sustainably. The lignocellulosic matrix is complex and recalcitrant to conversion but research in biorefining is advancing rapidly and commercial facilities are expected in the near-term. These facilities will either employ hydrolytic mechanisms to break apart the structural polysaccharides of the biomass, or thermochemical procedures to dehydrate and <b>volatilise</b> the feedstock. Catalysts serve vital roles in both approaches: Acids and enzymes facilitate the hydrolysis of cellulose; while metal and biological catalysts can alter the volatilisation profiles of biomass or reform the gases that are liberated in the thermochemical process.

40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) fluxes were {{estimated}} by three inverse modelling methods over a sorghum field following {{the application of}} 240 kg N ha− 1 of urea pills under a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. Ammonia volatilisation started following irrigation, which coincided with the third urea application. The maximum volatilisation rate was reached 7 days after irrigation. A clear dependence of the NH 3 volatilisation on irrigation and rainfall events was observed. The NH 3 fluxes ranged from − 2. 5 to 45 μg NH 3 m− 2 s− 1. The canopy compensation point jumped from 9 μg NH 3 m− 3 before urea hydrolysis to 131 μg NH 3 m− 3 afterwards, while the soil compensation point varied in the meantime from 24 to 800 μg NH 3 m− 3 on average.

A linear relationship was found to exist between losses of weight and total sulphur. Attempts were made to describe devolatilisation in terms of reaction kinetics, but with no real success; rate-controlling steps are evidently of a physical, rather than a chemical nature.

40|$|The {{remote sensing}} of fire {{severity}} is a noted goal {{in studies of}} forest and grassland wildfires. Experiments were conducted to discover and evaluate potential relationships between the characteristics of African savannah fires and post-fire surface spectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral region. Nine instrumented experimental fires were conducted in semi-arid woodland savannah of Chobe National Park (Botswana), where fire temperature (Tmax) and duration (dt) were recorded using thermocouples positioned at different heights and locations. These variables, along with measures of fireline intensity (FLI), integrated temperature with time (Tsum) and biomass (and carbon/nitrogen) <b>volatilised</b> were compared to post-fire surface spectral reflectance. Statistically significant relationships were observed between (i) the fireline intensity and total nitrogen <b>volatilised</b> (r 2 = 0. 54, n = 36, p 3 ̆c 0. 001), (ii) integrated temperature (Tsum-µ) and total biomass combusted (r 2 = 0. 72, n = 32, p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and (iii) fire duration as measured at the top-of-grass sward thermocouple (dtT) and total biomass combusted (r 2 = 0. 74, n = 34, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and total nitrogen <b>volatilised</b> (r 2 = 0. 73, n = 34, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). The post-fire surface spectral reflectance {{was found to be}} related to dt and Tsum via a quadratic relationship that varied with wavelength. The use of visible and shortwave infrared band ratios produced statistically significant linear relationships with fire duration as measured by the top thermocouple (dtT) (r 2 = 0. 76, n = 34, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and the mean of Tsum (r 2 = 0. 82, n = 34, p 3 ̆c 0. 001). The results identify fire duration as a versatile measure that relates directly to the fire severity, and also illustrate the potential of spectrally-based fire severity measures. However, the results also point to difficulties when applying such spectrally-based techniques to Earth Observation satellite imagery, due to the small-scale variability noted on the ground. Results also indicate the potential for surface spectral reflectance to increase following higher severity fires, due to the laying down of high albedo white mineral ash. Most current techniques for mapping burned area rely on the general assumption that surface albedo decreases following a fire, and so if the image spatial resolution was high enough such methods may fail. Determination of the effect of spatial resolution on a sensor’s ability to detect white ash was investigated using a validated optical mixture modeling approach. The most appropriate mixing model to use (linear or non-linear) was assessed using laboratory experiments. A linear mixing model was shown most appropriate, with results suggesting that sensors having spatial resolutions significantly higher than those of Landsat ETM+ will be required if patches of white ash are to be used to provide EO-derived information on the spatial variation of fire severity...|$|R

40|$|High {{temperature}} {{processes such as}} in situ smouldering {{and thermal}} remediation techniques can achieve rapid removal of organic contaminants from soils in much shorter time periods than traditional remediation technologies. Thermal remediation processes use heat or heated water to <b>volatilise</b> the contaminant within the soil to enable its extraction. High temperatures affect the particle size distribution, mass loss, mineralogy and permeability of the soil. In sandy soils, the particle size decreases with increasing temperature due to a mobilisation of fines, which is likely due to the bond of fines to the sand grains being affected by temperature. In clayey soils, the overall particle size increases with increasing temperature due to aggregation and cementation of the clay fraction. Permeability seems {{to be affected by}} treatment type rather than temperature alone, comparing heat treated and smouldered samples showed an increase of sand permeability by approximately two magnitudes. This study illustrates the effects of high temperature and smouldering processes on soil characteristics and dynamic behaviour.
