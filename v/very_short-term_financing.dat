40|$|The {{financial}} and economic crisis {{should not be}} seen solely as a problem but also {{as an opportunity to}} reform the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) in a non-conventional way: through jurisprudence. By instituting a <b>very</b> <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> facility as an emergency measure, the European Council of Finance Ministers (Ecofin) will give de facto responsibility for imposing the conditions on Greece to the European Commission. This ‘ties the hands ’ of the Ecofin and thus makes the imposition of structural reforms more credible since it puts unambiguous limits on Member States ’ increasing debt and deficits. Furthermore, this process works much faster than creating new legislation in the conventional way and implicitly leads to more political integration. In the end, it shows that the EU needed this crisis to enforce structural reforms, and by limiting Member States ’ fiscal policy, moves towards further political integration, albeit not via the front door but through the back door. Europe has always progressed that way...|$|E

30|$|The {{managing}} of inventories {{is one of}} {{the most}} significant tasks that every manager must do efficiently and effectively in any organization so that their organization can grow. Now, all the organizations are involved in a global competitive market and then these organizations are taking seriously the activities related to manage inventories. Thus, recently the practitioners and researchers have been increasing their interest in optimizing the inventory decisions in a holistic way. Thus, the manager tries to find out different ways through which the cost associated with inventory can reduce and the profit of the organization can increase. Recently, the business operations such as share marketing and trade credit financing have been a powerful tool to increase sales and profits. In practice, vendors allow a fixed period to settle the payment without penalty for their customers to increase sales and reduce on-hand inventory. In fact, a permissible delay in payment decreases the cost of inventory holding because this action decreases the amount of capital invested in inventory for the duration of the permissible period. Furthermore, for the period of the delay in payment, the retailer can accumulate revenue on sales and earn interest on that revenue via share marketing investment or banking business. This type of inventory problem is known as inventory problem with permissible delay in payments. In today’s severely competitive business environment, business men are increasingly using trade credit to stimulate the demand of the products and attract more customers. As a result, the trade credit financing plays an important role in modern business operations as a source of funds aside from banks and other financial institutions (Yang and Birge 2013). In India, the non-state-owned enterprises often obtain limited support from banks. Therefore, the trade credit policy is adopted as a <b>very</b> important <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> method. On the other hand, the policy of granting trade credit adds not only an additional cost but also an additional dimension of default risk (i.e., the event in which the buyer will be unable to payoff its debt obligations) to the retailer (Teng et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{financial}} claims held by uninformed outside investors impose a tax on insider opportunism by diluting the ownership stake of opportunistic owner-managers. By thus limiting managerial opportunism, <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> increases firm value and social welfare.

40|$|Firms {{that face}} {{seasonal}} demand account for an important {{fraction of the}} U. S. economy. However, there is surprisingly little evidence on these firms' financing decisions. Yet, studying these decisions provides a natural setting {{to shed light on}} the types of capital (i. e. cash or debt) that firms use to manage <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> needs. Using seasonal firms as a setting to examine this issue, I show that seasonal financing needs are met with debt with low exposure to information asymmetry, such as short-term debt and trade credit. I further show that cash reserves, which have high carrying costs and can at time lead to agency problems, are not used for seasonal financing needs. Further, as financial flexibility theory would predict, I document that seasonal firms maintain more conservative financial policies to increase the ability to use debt for <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> needs. Specifically, seasonal firms are less levered and have long-term debt with a longer average maturity. Further, seasonal firms adjust toward leverage targets slower during fiscal quarters when debt is used for <b>short-term</b> <b>financing.</b> Overall, my findings indicate that firms minimize costs associated with <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> needs by using debt with low issuance costs and the use of this debt impacts the overall capital structure of the firm...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} financing structure and bank liquidity risk. We compare the findings between Islamic and conventional banks for the case of Malaysia. We adopt four measures to represent financing structure; namely 1) real estate financing, 2) financing concentration, 3) stability of <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> structure and 4) stability of medium-term financing structure. Two BASEL III liquidity risk measures are tested; namely, liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to measure short- and long-term liquidity risk, respectively. Based on panel data regression comprising 27 conventional and 17 Islamic banks from 1994 to 2014, our findings show that real estate financing and stability of <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> structure for Islamic banks are positively related to both liquidity risk measures. This implies that {{an increasing number of}} real estate financing and a stable <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> structure may increase Islamic banks’ short- and long-term liquidity risks. However, although real estate financing does not affect conventional banks’ liquidity risks, a stable <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> structure and increasing financing concentration can positively influence bank long-term liquidity risk. Our findings shed light crucial policy implications for regulatory bodies and market players in the context of liquidity risk management framework as well as the need to develop a separate framework between conventional and Islamic banking institutions...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we follow}} the market {{microstructure}} approximation to examine an empirical question that, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, has not been previously addressed: whether the information asymmetry concerning firms’ market valuation affects their <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> structure. To do so, we focus on the Spanish case, a market with high levels of short-term debt combined with a bank-oriented financial system. We analyze whether the degree of information asymmetry associated with a firm affects the choice between the different alternative sources of <b>short-term</b> private debt <b>financing,</b> i.e., bank debt and trade credit. In addition, since the choice of <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> may be determined by restrictions in the public debt market and/or in the long-term private debt market, we also analyze the influence of information asymmetries on debt maturity, public debt and long-term bank debt.|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} investigates efficiency {{differences between}} two important financial approaches that {{credit card companies}} use to attract customers. Since the cash-back offer has been already investigated by previous studies, this study focuses upon the balance transfer offer and then compares {{them in terms of}} their influences on consumers’ <b>short-term</b> <b>finance.</b> The proposed research utilizes the three-stage investigation. The first stage is related to consumers’ choice on offers. The second stage estimates the offer’s overall and monthly effects on payment, spending, and changes on debt in order to capture consumers’ dynamic finance conditions. The last stage estimates the effects on balance transfer and cash-back offers compared with control and non-promotional finance conditions. This study finds that the balance transfer offer is more effective in making a financial impact to consumers’ <b>short-term</b> <b>finance</b> than the cash-back offer.|$|R

An important feature of the dataset is that it contains account information both from the specific credit card company (CCC) and from the Equifax (EFX) bureau for every consumer.

30|$|Our {{findings}} show that market microstructure measures of information asymmetry explain debt structure and, in particular, <b>short-term</b> debt <b>financing</b> decisions of listed firms. Our results reveal that information asymmetry {{in the stock market}} reduces firms’ debt maturity, i.e., firms face more restrictions to obtain long term debt. In addition, firms with higher informational asymmetries face more difficulties in accessing public debt and bank debt, in particular short-term bank debt. Thus, in their choice between <b>short-term</b> <b>financing</b> sources, they have to rely on account payables as an alternative source of financing to overcome the financial constraints induced by information asymmetry problems.|$|R
