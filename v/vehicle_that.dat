5|$|In 2007, two {{tractor-trailer}} trucks collided in {{a tunnel}} along the truck lanes for southbound I-5 at the interchange. A resulting fire started, soon encompassing the entire tunnel along with 30 other trucks and one passenger <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> {{were in the}} tunnel at the time. The truck tunnel was closed for several days for structural damage inspections and repairs.|$|E
5|$|On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} series of new X-planes over the next 10 years. One of the planes will reportedly be a supersonic <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> burns low-carbon biofuels and generates quiet sonic booms.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> can be recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity {{stored in the}} rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of {{electric vehicle}}s that includes all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E

5|$|Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, {{slid off}} the runway while {{attempting}} to land {{at the airport in}} a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.|$|E
5|$|Filming in the Czech Republic's Barrandov Studios {{began in}} May. The crew took over {{sections}} of the Old Town in Prague. While filming in the city on April 26, people were injured when a bus and several cars collided with a four-wheel-drive <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> appeared to have braking problems. The emergency services confirmed those taken to hospital had minor injuries. Filming wrapped after a month in Prague. Additional second unit filming took place in Paris, Egypt, Tokyo, the Arctic, and underwater.|$|E

5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
5|$|President Roosevelt {{personally}} visited Kentucky {{to campaign}} on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As {{governor of the}} state, Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley {{in the back seat}} of the open-topped <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E
5|$|The Chevrolet CobaltSS {{comprises}} three sport compact {{versions of}} the Chevrolet Cobalt that were built on the General Motors Delta platform at Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, United States. The three versions included two forced induction inline‑four Ecotec engines and a third naturally aspirated engine that was later called the CobaltSport. SS is an abbreviation of Super Sport, a moniker used by Chevrolet to denote high performance upgrades for the <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> meet certain criteria.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening in}} 1885 of the Saint-Louis–Dakar railway {{increased}} the traffic over the bridge. The railway reached {{all the way}} to Sor and all the goods hauled between the coast and the railway station had to cross over the bridge. To prevent the breakdown of the bridge a special decree was given so that the maximum weight for a <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> crosses the bridge to be less than one and a half tonnes. With all its difficulties the bridge remained in service 32 years, until 1897 when it was dismantled.|$|E
5|$|Tom Comstock {{comes home}} {{the next day}} to find his son {{returned}}, alive but shaken. Black deduces that the paint swatch matches paint used on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> killed Burke's son; he also realizes that the boys are being kidnapped to force their fathers to confess hidden sins—Comstock's son was returned after he revealed his affair, while Orlando's son was killed because he kept secret a crime involving money. From there, Black sees that Charlie's kidnapping means that Birckenbeuhl is the hit-and-run driver.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{began his}} stage career on Armistice Day. After World War I he found only limited success in vaudeville. He earned his living stoking the furnace at a {{department}} store, {{and got a}} night job washing and repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the chorus of the musical comedy, Have a Heart. The following season he had a bit part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour. Calleia supplemented his salary by working as assistant stage manager and repairing trunks at $3 each.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} fall into two main categories. There are <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> are lightly armored, and then stock <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> have had armor hidden in their body. The Light Armor Vehicles (LAVs) are popular among governments, whereas the <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> have the hidden armor are more popular for high level civilians or sometimes ambassadors. Although these vehicles use two different styles of armor, they both have been designed and tested {{to be able to}} stop a 7.62 mm armor-piercing round. The LAVs were also designed to be highly mobile, durable and carry a payload whether it is combat-ready troops or equipment. Their flagship model GURKHA is produced in three configurations, namely; MPV, LAPV and RPV and caters to law enforcement, police and military purposes.|$|R

5|$|Filming {{started in}} Austria in December 2014, with {{production}} {{taking in the}} area around Sölden—including the Ötztal Glacier Road, Rettenbach glacier and the adjacent ski resort and cable car station—and Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee, before concluding in February 2015. Scenes filmed in Austria centred on the Ice Q Restaurant, standing in for the fictional Hoffler Klinik, a private medical clinic in the Austrian Alps. Filming included an action scene featuring a Land Rover Defender Bigfoot and a Range Rover Sport. Various airplane models were used in filming, from a life-sized plane with detachable wings to film the crash in the woods, to plane fuselages either built atop snowmobiles or shot from nitrogen cannons. Production was temporarily halted first by an injury to Craig, who sprained his knee whilst shooting a fight scene, and later by an accident involving a filming <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> saw three crew members injured, {{at least one of them}} seriously.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{government}} grant announcement, Kevin Rudd, Australia's Prime Minister at the time, stated that production would support 600 new {{jobs at the}} Elizabeth facility; however, this failed {{to take into account}} Holden's previous announcement, whereby 600 jobs would be shed when production of the Family II engine ceased in late 2009. In mid-2013, Holden sought a further A$265million, in addition to the A$275million that was already committed by {{the government}}s of Canberra, South Australia and Victoria, to remain viable as a car manufacturer in Australia. A source close to Holden informed the Australian news publication that the car company is losing money on every <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> it produces and consequently initiated negotiations to reduce employee wages by up to A$200 per week to cut costs, following the announcement of 400 job cuts and an assembly line reduction of 65 (400 to 335) cars per day.|$|E
5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the upmarket version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.|$|E

5|$|Jaguar {{customers}} {{attempting to}} withdraw from their contracted purchases were given the option to buy themselves out of their contracts, but by 1995, the issue had resulted in legal action as buyers claimed the specification changes rendered any contracts void. Jaguar produced evidence clearly demonstrating that the vehicle specification shown in the contract matched the <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> was delivered, and the presiding judge, John Donaldson, quickly ruled in Jaguar's favour. The last of the unsold XJ220s were sold for £127,550 plus VAT in 1997. While never officially approved {{for sale in the}} United States, the XJ220 was approved under the Show and Display exemption by 2001.|$|E
5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> crossed into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1979, a bus {{carrying}} 18 American Navy sailors {{was forced}} to stop by a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing Emil White and John Ball. Both the EPB and the OVPRR accepted responsibility for the attack, citing it as payback for the unclarified death of Ángel Rodríguez Cristóbal (previously arrested for protesting the Navy's activities in the island of Vieques) in a federal prison in Tallahassee, which had raised controversy because the photographic evidence displayed signs of contusions and contradicted the official account that he had simply committed suicide. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> was moving three soldiers to the UPR.|$|E
