5|$|Sharks display {{three ways}} to bear their young, varying by species, oviparity, <b>viviparity</b> and ovoviviparity.|$|E
5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, this method is called <b>viviparity.</b> This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental <b>viviparity,</b> with the developing embryos at first receiving nourishment from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk", enriched with proteins, fat, and mucus) {{produced by the}} mother and delivered through specialized outgrowths of the uterine lining. Mature females have two functional ovaries and uteruses. Reproduction occurs year-round, with males apparently capable of mating every year and females every other year. The gestation period is unknown. Reported litter sizes range from 17 to 20; at least the number of ova, and perhaps also the number of young, increases {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental <b>viviparity,</b> in which the developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining of the uterus bears a series of parallel lengthwise folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The litter size ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{evidence}} {{provided by the}} embryo suggests that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous, making it the first viviparous archosauromorph asides from possibly metriorhynchids. This {{is consistent with the}} separation of its sacral ribs from its sacrum, which indicates a mobile pelvis that could have functioned in giving birth. While the otherwise absence of viviparous archosaurs has been historically attributed to common attributes inherited from the archosaurian stem-lineage, the discovery that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous suggests that this phenomenon is due to lineage-specific lifestyle restrictions. Although the sex-determination systems among living archosauromorphs are diverse, with crocodilians and turtles using temperature-dependent sex determination, phylogenetic modelling suggests that Dinocephalosaurus retained the basal condition of genotypic sex determination from early diapsids, and that this system facilitated its transition to an obligately marine lifestyle alongside <b>viviparity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental <b>viviparity,</b> meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the slender}} smooth-hound is diverse, but {{dominated}} by small, benthic bony fishes and decapod crustaceans. It exhibits a specialized form of aplacental <b>viviparity</b> with oophagy: the females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30–80 ova, of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes {{the rest of}} the ova and stores the yolk material in its external yolk sac. The growing embryo is mainly sustained by this yolk sac during gestation, though it may be additionally supplied with histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The typical litter size is two pups, one per uterus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the slender smooth-hound as Least Concern; it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers, and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity.|$|E
25|$|In horned lizards (genus Phrynosoma), <b>viviparity</b> (live birth) {{has evolved}} {{multiple}} times, based on ancestral reconstruction methods.|$|E
25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lay amniotic eggs {{covered with}} leathery or calcareous shells. An amnion, chorion, and allantois are present during embryonic life. The eggshell (1) protects the crocodile embryo (11) and keeps it from drying out, {{but it is}} flexible to allow gas exchange. The chorion (6) aids in gas exchange between the {{inside and outside of}} the egg. It allows carbon dioxide to exit the egg and oxygen gas to enter the egg. The albumin (9) further protects the embryo and serves as a reservoir for water and protein. The allantois (8) is a sac that collects the metabolic waste produced by the embryo. The amniotic sac (10) contains amniotic fluid (12) which protects and cushions the embryo. The amnion (5) aids in osmoregulation and serves as a saltwater reservoir. The yolk sac (2) surrounding the yolk (3) contains protein and fat rich nutrients that are absorbed by the embryo via vessels (4) that allow the embryo to grow and metabolize. The air space (7) provides the embryo with oxygen while it is hatching. This ensures that the embryo will not suffocate while it is hatching. There are no larval stages of development. <b>Viviparity</b> and ovoviviparity have evolved in many extinct clades of reptiles and in squamates. In the latter group, many species, including all boas and most vipers, utilize this mode of reproduction. The degree of <b>viviparity</b> varies; some species simply retain the eggs until just before hatching, others provide maternal nourishment to supplement the yolk, and yet others lack any yolk and provide all nutrients via a structure similar to the mammalian placenta. The earliest documented case of <b>viviparity</b> in reptiles is the Early Permian mesosaurs, although some individuals or taxa in that clade may also have been oviparous because a putative isolated egg has also been found. Several groups of Mesozoic marine reptiles also exhibited <b>viviparity,</b> such as mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and Sauropterygia, a group that include pachypleurosaurs and Plesiosauria.|$|E
25|$|In placental species, parent-offspring {{conflict}} {{can result}} {{in the evolution of}} strategies, such as genomic imprinting, for embryos to subvert maternal nutrient provisioning. Despite several attempts to find it, genomic imprinting has not been found in the platypus, reptiles, birds or fish. The absence of genomic imprinting in a placental reptile, the southern grass skink, is interesting as genomic imprinting was thought {{to be associated with the}} evolution of <b>viviparity</b> and placental nutrient transport.|$|E
25|$|Crocodiles, most {{sea turtles}} and some lizards control {{offspring}} gender by manipulating {{the temperature of}} the developing eggs' environment; i.e. they do not have distinct sex chromosomes. Live-bearing reptiles do not regulate sex through incubation temperature. A study in 2009, which examined 94 living species of reptiles, birds and mammals, found that the genetic control of sex appears to be crucial to live birth. It was concluded that with marine reptiles such control predated <b>viviparity</b> and was an adaptation to the stable sea-climate in coastal regions. Genetics likely controlled sex in ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse have {{an unusual}} {{lifecycle}} {{which may be}} due to the richness of their food source. A female fertilizes only one egg at a time and retains each egg within her uterus to have the offspring develop internally during the first three larval stages, a method called adenotrophic <b>viviparity.</b> During this time, the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus. In the third larval stage, the tsetse larva leaves the uterus and begins its independent life. The newly independent tsetse larva crawls into the ground, and develops a hard outer shell called the puparial case, in which it completes its morphological transformation into an adult fly.|$|E
25|$|The unusual body {{structure}} of elasmosaurids would have limited the speed {{in which they}} could swim and their paddles may have moved in manner similar to birds wings but could not twist and were thus held rigidly. A 2015 study concluded that locomotion was mostly done by the fore-flippers while the hind-flippers function in maneuverability and stability, while a 2017 study concluded that the hind-flippers of plesiosaurs produced 60% more thrust and had 40% more efficiency when moving along in harmony with the fore-flippers. The paddles were so rigid and specialized for swimming that they could not have come on land to lay eggs like sea turtles. Thus they most likely gave live birth to their young like sea snakes. Evidence for <b>viviparity</b> in plesiosaurs {{came in the form of}} a fossil of an adult Polycotylus with a single fetus inside.|$|E
25|$|The spadenose shark (Scoliodon laticaudus) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, {{and part of the}} family Carcharhinidae. It is common in the {{tropical}} Indian and western Pacific Oceans, where it forms large schools in shallow water. A small shark reaching a length of , the spadenose shark is named for its distinctively flattened, triangular snout. It is a predator of small bony fishes and invertebrates. This species exhibits the most advanced mode of <b>viviparity</b> of any fish, in which the developed embryos form a highly complex placental connection to the mother at a very small size. Females breed year-round, giving birth to six to 18 pups after a gestation period of five to six months. The spadenose shark is harmless to humans and is valued by artisanal and commercial fishers for its meat and fins. Its abundance ensures it forms a significant component of many fisheries in South and Southeast Asia. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyosaurs were viviparous, i.e. bore live young {{instead of}} laying eggs. Although they were {{reptiles}} and descended from egg-laying, oviparous, ancestors, <b>viviparity</b> {{is not as}} unexpected as it first appears. Air-breathing marine creatures must either come ashore to lay eggs, like turtles and some sea snakes, or else give birth to live young in surface waters, like whales and dolphins. Given their streamlined and transversely flattened bodies, heavily adapted for fast swimming, {{it would have been}} difficult if not impossible for ichthyosaurs to move far enough on land to lay eggs. This was confirmed as early as 9 December 1845 when naturalist Joseph Chaning Pearce reported a small embryo in a fossil of Ichthyosaurus communis. The embryo, with a length of eleven centimetres, was positioned in the birth canal of its two-and-a-half metre long mother, with its head pointed to the rear. Pearce concluded from the fossil that ichthyosaurs had to have been viviparous.|$|E
25|$|Natural history data is scant {{for most}} Galeus species. They feed on {{various types of}} {{invertebrates}} and fishes {{on or near the}} bottom. In Suruga Bay, the dietary compositions of G. eastmani and juvenile G. nipponensis differ significantly, suggesting there is reduced interspecific competition between co-occurring Galeus species. Reproductive modes within the genus are notably diverse: while most species are oviparous and lay encapsulated eggs on the sea floor, there is a single aplacental viviparous species (G. polli) that retains eggs internally and gives live birth. Among the oviparous species, most (e.g. G. murinus, G. nipponensis) exhibit single oviparity, in which only a single egg matures within each of the female's oviducts at a time. In contrast, a few species such as G. atlanticus and G. melastomus exhibit multiple oviparity, in which several eggs can mature within each oviduct simultaneously. Single oviparity is considered to be the basal condition, while multiple oviparity and aplacental <b>viviparity</b> are thought to be more derived.|$|E
500|$|Like other {{stingray}}s, the estuary stingray exhibits aplacental <b>viviparity,</b> {{with the}} developing embryos sustained initially by yolk {{and later by}} histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females probably produce offspring every year. Courtship, in which the male follows the female and bites her disc, has been observed at night in water approximately [...] deep in Hays Inlet from July to October. The newborns measure around [...] across and [...] long. Young rays have {{been caught in the}} Nerang and Macleay Rivers and in Hays Inlet; such fresh or brackish environments may serve as nurseries. Males mature at around [...] across and seven years of age, and females mature at around [...] across and 13 years of age. This disparity in maturation size between the sexes is among the widest known for stingrays. The maximum lifespan is estimated to be 16 years for males and 23 years for females.|$|E
500|$|Most {{sharks are}} ovoviviparous, {{meaning that the}} eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother's body and that the egg's yolk and fluids {{secreted}} by glands in {{the walls of the}} oviduct nourishes the embryos. The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct's fluids. As in <b>viviparity,</b> the young are born alive and fully functional. Lamniforme sharks practice oophagy, where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs. [...] Taking this a step further, [...] sand tiger shark sharklets cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos. [...] The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth. The whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous, because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted. Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas, including bays, river mouths and shallow reefs. They choose such areas for protection from predators (mainly other sharks) and the abundance of food. Dogfish have the longest known gestation period of any shark, at 18 to 24 months. Basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods, but accurate data are lacking.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the false}} catshark, the slender smooth-hound {{exhibits}} aplacental <b>viviparity</b> with oophagy, {{in a form}} different from that in the mackerel sharks. Mature females have a single functional ovary, on the right side, and two functional uteruses. Only one embryo develops within each uterus at a time, resulting in litters of two (rarely one) pups. The uterus inner surface is covered by [...] Within a uterus, 30–80 ova [...] across are packed into a single rigid, amber-colored capsule; of these, only one ovum is fertilized and develops into an embryo, while the remaining ova begin to break down. The embryo consumes these other ova and transfers the yolk material into its external yolk sac, which serves as its main source of nourishment during gestation; this oophagous process is completed by an embryonic length of [...] The embryo may also receive secondary nutrition {{in the form of}} histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. When the embryo is [...] long, it emerges from the capsule, which by that time has become translucent and gelatinous. Embryos [...] long have well-developed external gill filaments. The external yolk sac is entirely absorbed when the embryo is [...] long and close to being born. Males and females reach sexual maturity at approximately [...] long.|$|E

2500|$|The Viperidae (vipers) is {{a family}} of venomous snakes found {{in most parts of}} the world, {{excluding}} Antarctica, Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar, Hawaii, various other isolated islands, and north of the Arctic Circle. All have relatively long, hinged fangs that permit deep penetration and injection of venom. Four subfamilies are currently recognised. They are also known as viperids. The name [...] "viper" [...] is derived from the Latin word vipera, -ae, also meaning viper, possibly from vivus [...] ("living") and parere ("to beget"), referring to the trait <b>viviparity</b> (giving live birth) common in vipers but not in snakes at large.|$|E
2500|$|The spadenose shark has {{the most}} {{advanced}} form of placental <b>viviparity</b> known in fish, {{as measured by the}} complexity of the placental connection and the difference in weight between the egg and the newborn young. Newly ovulated eggs measure only [...] in diameter, while the developing embryos become dependent on their mother for sustenance at a length of only [...] The placental stalk, formed from the yolk sac, has an unusual columnar structure and is covered by numerous long appendiculae that support a massive capillary network, providing a large surface area for gas exchange. The placental tissue contacts the uterine wall in a unique structure called the [...] "trophonematal cup", where nutrients are transferred from the mother's bloodstream into the placenta.|$|E
5000|$|Adenotrophic <b>viviparity</b> means [...] "gland fed, live birth". This is the {{reproductive}} mode of insects such as tsetse flies (Glossinidae), keds (Hippoboscidae) and bat flies and Nycteribiidae. Adenotrophic <b>viviparity</b> is a characteristic {{feature of the}} superfamily Hippoboscoidea.|$|E
50|$|Reproduction is {{a special}} kind of <b>viviparity,</b> called placental <b>viviparity.</b> This is when the shark carries its live young in a placental-like structure, {{complete}} with umbilical cord. The placenta structure is derived from the wall of the embryonic yolk sac that has fused with the uterine wall.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>viviparity</b> among fish.|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of embryos within Incisoscutum is of evolutionary importance as these fossils reveal that arthrodires had advanced reproductive biology {{and were able}} to give birth to live young. The Incisoscutum fossils show the oldest record of <b>viviparity</b> in any vertebrate, therefore internal fertilization and <b>viviparity</b> must have evolved in the vertebrates at least 380 million years ago and outside the gnathostomes.|$|E

5000|$|Pregnancy {{has been}} {{traditionally}} {{defined as the}} period during which developing embryos are incubated in the body after egg-sperm union. Despite strong similarities between <b>viviparity</b> in mammals, researchers have historically been reluctant {{to use the term}} [...] "pregnancy" [...] for non-mammals because of the highly developed form of <b>viviparity</b> in eutherians. Recent research into physiological, morphological and genetic changes associated with fish reproduction provide evidence that incubation in some species is a highly specialized form of reproduction similar to other forms of <b>viviparity.</b> [...] Although the term [...] "pregnancy" [...] often refers to eutherian animals, it has also been used in the titles of many international, peer-reviewed, scientific articles on fish, e.g.|$|E

50|$|In fish, {{fertilisation}} of eggs can {{be either}} external or internal. In many species of fish, fins have been modified to allow Internal fertilisation. Similarly, development of the embryo can be external or internal, although some species show a change between the two at various stages of embryo development. Thierry Lodé described reproductive strategies {{in terms of the}} development of the zygote and the interrelationship with the parents; there are five classifications - ovuliparity, oviparity, ovo-viviparity, histotrophic <b>viviparity</b> and hemotrophic <b>viviparity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In cold waters {{it is more}} {{difficult}} to precipitate dissolved calcium, which results in reduced body size of animals supported by calcium skeletons, leading to <b>viviparity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{is no one}} mode of {{reproduction}} that is universally superior in selective terms, but in many circumstances <b>viviparity</b> of various forms offers good protection from parasites and predators and permits flexibility in dealing with problems of reliability and economy in adverse circumstances. Variations on the theme in biology are enormous, ranging from trophic eggs to resorption of partly developed embryos in hard times or when they are too numerous for the mother to bring to term, but among the most profoundly advantageous features of <b>viviparity</b> are various forms of physiological support and protection of the embryo, such as thermoregulation and osmoregulation. Since the developing offspring remains within the mother’s body, she becomes, in essence, a walking incubator, protecting the developing young from excessive heat, cold, drought, or flood. This offers powerful options for dealing with excessive changes in climate or when migration events expose populations to unfavourable temperatures or humidities. In squamate reptiles in particular, there is a correlation between high altitudes or latitudes, colder climates {{and the frequency of}} <b>viviparity.</b> The idea that the tendency to favour egg-retention selectively under cooler conditions arises from the thermoregulatory benefits, and that it consequently promotes the evolution of <b>viviparity</b> as an adaptation, is known as [...] "the cold climate hypothesis".|$|E
