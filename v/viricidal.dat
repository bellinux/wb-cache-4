Inhibition was greatest at a concentration of 200 μg of rifampin/ml.

The <b>viricidal</b> properties of chlorine and CAT were compared. Kinetics of inactivation of poliovirus type 2 by chlorine and CAT in chlorine demand-free water were investigated by using a kinetic apparatus. Inactivation of the virus by chlorine and CAT occurred in two steps. The initial linear part of the inactivation curve followed a pseudo-first-order reaction with the virus. An obvious dose-response relationship was demonstrated with CAT. The rate of inactivation of the virus by CAT was faster in acid medium than in alkaline medium. Inactivation kinetic studies were performed at different temperatures, and the kinetic, Arrhenius, and thermodynamic parameters were evaluated. The rate of inactivation of poliovirus type 2 by chlorine was faster than that by CAT under identical conditions. A mechanism for the viral inactivation in acid conditions was proposed which led to a rate equation consistent with the experimental results.

40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} CFTR chloride channel {{is involved in}} pathogen entry into epithelial cells, and provides the glutathione and hypochlorous acid necessary for bactericidal and <b>viricidal</b> actions. CFTR mutations block these effects, diminishing pathogen defence and allowing pathogen accumulation in the extracellular space, where antibody encounter is likely. The pathogen antigens observed in {{cystic fibrosis}} (including P. Aeruginosa, S. Aureus and S.

Antibodies to pathogens and autoantigens may also target the CFTR protein, acting as antagonists, further compromising its function. The tripartite relationship between pathogen antigens, autoantigens and the CFTR protein creates a feed forward cycle, diminishing {{the function of the}} CFTR protein and increasing the probability of pathogen accumulation and further antibody encounters at every turn. Kegg pathway analysis of the CFTR/autoantigen interactome indicates that the CFTR protein is also involved in pathogen entry pathways, diabetes and pancreatic and gastric acid secretion pathways, in pathways related to cardiac myopathy, and in the gonadotrophin signalling network, all which are relevant to cystic fibrosis. Interruption of this cycle by antigen and antibody adsorption, and possibly by immunosuppressant therapy may perhaps be of clinical benefit in cystic fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the development, synthesis, properties, and {{applications}} of nano materials for critical technologies, including three areas: (1) 	 Microbial contamination of drinking water is a serious problem of global significance. About 51 % of the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States can be attributed to contaminated ground water. Development of metal oxide nanoparticles, as <b>viricidal</b> materials is of technological and fundamental scientific importance. Nanoparticles with high surface areas and ultra small particle sizes have dramatically enhanced efficiency and capacity of virus inactivation, which cannot be achieved by their bulk counterparts. A series of metal oxide nanoparticles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles and iron oxide-silver nanoparticles, coated on fiber substrates was developed in this research for evaluation of their <b>viricidal</b> activity. 	We also carried out XRD, TEM, SEM, XPS, surface area measurements, and zeta potential of these nanoparticles. MS 2 virus inactivation experiments showed that these metal oxide nanoparticle coated fibers were extremely powerful <b>viricidal</b> materials. Results from this research suggest that zinc oxide nanoparticles with diameter of 3. 5 nm, showing an isoelectric point (IEP) at 9. 0, were well dispersed on fiberglass. These fibers offer an increase in capacity by orders of magnitude over all other materials. Compared to iron oxide nanoparticles, zinc oxide nanoparticles didn’t show an improvement in inactivation kinetics but inactivation capacities did increase by two orders of magnitude to 99. 99 %. Furthermore, zinc oxide nanoparticles have higher affinity to viruses than the iron oxide nanoparticles in presence of competing ions. The advantages of zinc oxide depend on high surface charge density, small nanoparticle sizes and capabilities of generating reactive oxygen species. The research at its present stage of development appears to offer the best avenue to remove viruses from water. Without additional chemicals and energy input, this system can be implemented by both points of use (POU) and large-scale use water treatment technology, which will {{have a significant impact on}} the water purification industry. (2) 	A new family of aliphatic polyester lubricants has been developed for use in micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), specifically for hard disk drives that operate at high spindle speeds (> 15000 rpm). Our program was initiated to address current problems with spin-off of the perfluoroether (PFPE) lubricants. The new polyester lubricant appears to alleviate spin-off problems and at the same time improves the chemical and thermal stability. This new system provides a low cost alternative to PFPE along with improved adhesion to the substrates. In addition, it displays a much lower viscosity, which may be of importance to stiction related problems. The synthetic route is readily scalable in case additional interest emerges in other areas including small motors. (3) 	The demand for increased signal transmission speed and device density for the next generation of multilevel integrated circuits has placed stringent demands on materials performance. Currently, integration of the ultra low-k materials in dual Damascene processing requires chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to planarize the copper. Unfortunately, none of the commercially proposed dielectric candidates display the desired mechanical and thermal properties for successful CMP. A new polydiacetylene thermosetting polymer (DEB-TEB), which displays a low dielectric constant (low-k) of 2. 7, was recently developed. This novel material appears to offer the only avenue for designing an ultra low k dielectric (1. 85 k), which can still display the desired modulus (7. 7 Gpa) and hardness (2. 0 Gpa) sufficient to withstand the process of CMP. We focused on further characterization of the thermal properties of spin-on poly (DEB-TEB) ultra-thin film. These include the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), biaxial thermal stress, and thermal conductivity. Thus the CTE is 2. 0 * 10 - 5 K- 1 in the perpendicular direction and 8. 0 * 10 - 6 K- 1 in the planar direction. The low CTE provides a better match to the Si substrate which minimizes interfacial stress and greatly enhances the reliability of the microprocessors.

40|$|The thermal {{consequences}} of coal utilization are most meaningfully assessed {{in comparison with}} the form of power generation replaced by coal which is most likely nuclear. The different effects are influenced by siting decisions and the intrinsic thermal efficiencies of the two fuel systems. Nuclear power plants discharge 50 %o more waste heat to the atmosphere through cooling towers or to a water body than coal-fired plants. Coal-fired plants require about as much water as nuclear power plants. Nearly every property of water is affected nonlinearly by temperature, and biological effects may amplify these changes because protein denaturation takes place more rapidly above 30 °C and these high temperatures affect bactericidal and <b>viricidal</b> activity ofchlorine compounds. Usually algal populations change from a dominance of diatoms and green algae to dominance by blue-green algae.

In 1941 Francis and Brightman (15) reported the develop-ment or increase in the viral inactivating capacity of nasal secretions of individuals in the acute and convalescent stages of influenza and later, the en-hanced capacity of nasal secretions to inactivate the virus when vaccination with influenza virus induces a significant increase in titer of neutraliz-ing antibodies in the blood (16). In 1948 Bell (17), working with polio virus, published addi-tional evidence that the neutralizing substance is specific antibody, although in two instances in which the nasal secretions neutralized the virus, * Submitted for publication February 19, 1964; ac...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Qualitative and {{quantitative}} tests {{have been carried}} out to assess the value of Cidexl, a glutaraldehyde solution, as a disinfectant. Most of the tests were qualitative and were carried out in conditions as closely resembling those found in hospital practice as possible. Recently used anaesthetic equipment, catheters, and a cysto-scope, which had been artificially contaminated with suspensions of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, and Esch. coli, were used in the tests. The results show Cidex to be a useful disinfectant with a valuable potential in disinfecting hospital articles which, due to their perishable nature or the fragility of component parts, cannot be treated by physical means. This paper presents results of several tests done on Cidex, an activated glutaraldehyde solution, to assess its effectiveness as a disinfecting agent. Pre-vious work by Pepper and Chandler (1963) has shown it to have a sporicidal effect and Borick, Dondershine, and Chandler (1964) have published details of work done on its <b>viricidal</b> properties. These aspects have not been examined in the present study. The purpose here is to assess the ability of this agent to kill organisms which cause the most trouble in hospital cross-infection, notably Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudo-monas pyocyanea, under conditions resembling those found in day-to-day hospital practice. METHODS OF TESTING DISINFECTANTS That no single test to date is universally used is proof that no single test is completely satisfactory. In 1903 Rideal and Walker described their 'phenol coefficient ' method. This test is valid only for fluids resembling phenol and is misleading and inaccurate for others. The Chick Martin test has many similar dis-advantages...|$|E
40|$|Ammi majus L. is an imperiled {{medicinal}} plant, {{which contains}} various medically important and uncommon extraordinary secondary metabolite compounds [...] An efficient organogenesis protocol was established for Ammi majus through in vitro process of leaf callusing, shooting and rooting by using different combination of auxins and cytokinins. In vitro cultured juvenile leaf explants were used directly for callus formation on MS supplemented with different concentration of IAA, Kn and CH. Maximum percentage response for callus formation was 97. 7 after 5 weeks of incubation on MS supplemented with 2 mg/l IAA, 2 mg/l Kn and 1000 mg/l CH. About 81 % of calluses converted to shoot on callusing medium supplemented with 50 mg/l glutamine and 40 mg/l adenine, after 80 days of culture. Plantlets with shoot {{were transferred to}} half strength of MS with different concentration of IBA and glutamine. Maximum rooting of 75. 96 % was observed on half strength of MS supplemented with 0. 2 % of IBA and 100 mg/l glutamine. The present study gives reliable in vitro regeneration protocol for Ammi majus L. from leaf explants, which {{may be used for}} future commercial‐scale propagation and genetic study. Ammi majus L. also known as bishop’s weed from Apiaceae family is one of the wild pharmacopoeial plant species. Native origin of Ammi majus is northern Africa, southern Europe and western Asia (Queensland). At least 16 psoralens have now been identified in Ammi majus. The seed contains furanocoumarins (Hamerski and Matern 1988), which stimulate pigment production in the skin that is exposed to bright sunlight (Bown 1995, Chevallier 1996). Thus, this specie is one of the richest known sources of linear furocoumarins. This furocoumarins when activated by sunlight acts as bactericidal, herbicidal, fungicidal, mollscicidal, larvicidal, nematicidal, insecticidal, ovicidal and <b>viricidal.</b> Therefore it is considered as a natural pesticide. An infusion is used to calm the digestive *Author for correspondence...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{consequences}} of coal utilization are most meaningfully assessed {{in comparison with}} the form of power generation replaced by coal which is most likely nuclear. The different effects are influenced by siting decisions and the intrinsic thermal efficiencies of the two fuel systems. Nuclear power plants discharge 50 % more waste Rheat to the atmosphere through cooling towers or to a water body than coal-fired plants. Coal-fired plants require about 2 / 3 as much water as nuclear power plants. Nearly every property of water is affected nonlinearly by temperature, and biological effects may amplify these changes because protein denaturation takes place more rapidly above 30 degrees C and these high temperatures affect bactericidal and <b>viricidal</b> activity of chlorine compounds. Usually algal populations change from a dominance of diatoms and green algae to dominance by blue-green algae. All organisms experience elevated metabolic rates at higher temperatures which may affect total energy needs, foraging ability, reproduction, migration and susceptibility to disease. Intake structures inevitably draw many organisms into the cooling system of a power plant, but the number and kind are influenced by its location, configuration, and mode of operation. Use of water recirculation systems reduces water use and with it, the number of organisms entrained. Mechanical damage in the cooling system to small organisms is generally low, but fish and their larvae and eggs may be seriously damaged. Discharge effects may also be severe but are generally local. The near field, where there are strong shear velocities and rapid temperature changes are particularly stressful to fish, and stringent limitations on the timing and strength of discharges may be required to reduce these stresses to nondamaging levels. Off-stream cooling systems may increase cloudiness, ground fog, precipitation, temperature and local winds, but these effects generally extend no further than 1000 m even in winter. There is considerable potential for using condenser cooling water for agricultural and aquacultural purposes such as irrigation, frost protection, undersoil heating, greenhouse heating and climate control. However, over the next few decades little of this waste heat is likely to be used creatively. The thermal {{consequences of}} implementing NEP are locally serious but do not pose regional problems. Creative use of the waste heat for aquaculture, agriculture, cogeneration, and power for energy intensive industries can be a powerful means of mitigating undesirable effects...|$|E
40|$|PEROXONE is an {{advanced}} oxidation process generated by combining ozone and hydrogen peroxide. This process stimulates {{the production of}} hydroxyl radicals, which {{have been shown to}} be superior to ozone for the destruction of some organic contaminants. In this study, pilot-scale experiments were conducted to evaluate the microbicidal effectiveness of PEROXONE and ozone against three model indicator groups. Escherichia coli and MS 2 coliphage were seeded into the influent to the preozonation contactors of a pilot plant simulating conventional water treatment and were exposed to four ozone dosages (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 4. 0 mg/liter), four hydrogen peroxide/ozone (H 2 O 2 /O 3) weight ratios (0, 0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 8), and four contact times (4, 5, 12, and 16 min) in two source waters [...] Colorado River water and state project water [...] of different quality. The removal of heterotrophic plate count bacteria was also monitored. Results of the study indicated that the microbicidal activity of PEROXONE was greatly affected by the applied ozone dose, H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratio, contact time, source water quality, and type of microorganism tested. At contact times of 5 min or less, ozone alone was a more potent bactericide than PEROXONE at all H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratios tested. However, this decrease in the bactericidal potency of PEROXONE was dramatic only as the H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratio was increased from 0. 5 to 0. 8. The fact that the bactericidal activity of PEROXONE generally decreased with increasing H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratios was thought to be related to the lower ozone residuals produced. The <b>viricidal</b> activity of PEROXONE and ozone was comparable at all of the H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratios. Heterotrophic plate count bacteria were the most resistant group of organisms. Greater inactivation of E. coli and MS 2 was observed in Colorado River water than in state project water and appeared to result from differences in the turbidity and alkalinity of the two waters. Regardless of source water, greater than 4. 5 log 10 of E. coli and MS 2 was inactivated at an applied ozone dosage of 2. 0 mg/liter (and a 4 -min contact time) when the H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratio was less than or equal to 0. 5. Comparative disinfection experiments indicated that free chlorine was the most potent bactericidal agent, followed (in descending order of effectiveness) by ozone, PEROXONE, and chloramines. These results indicate that the PEROXONE process must be optimized for each source water to achieve microbicidal effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|HIV- 1 {{survival}} kinetics in {{peritoneal dialysis}} effluent. Viable and potentially infectious HIV- 1 has been {{recovered from the}} peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). No information had previously been available as to how long HIV- 1 could survive in this environment, and no data were available as to how long HIV- 1 could survive on peritoneal dialysis exchange tubing (PDET). Therefore, {{this study was designed}} to answer these questions. HIV- 1 Mn was added to PDE and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 0 to 14 days. Following centrifugation, the cellular component of the PDE mixture was placed in co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from HIV negative donors. Aliquots from the co-cultures were removed after 14 days and assayed for the HIV- 1 -P 24 antigen. High levels of HIV P 24 antigen were recovered up to and including seven days of room temperature incubation. HIV could not be recovered from PDE that had been incubated at room temperature for 10 to 14 days. Ten milliters of HIV-PDE mixture was placed within PDET and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. The solution was then removed by gravity drainage. After drying times of 0 to 168 hours, the tubing was flushed with HIV culture medium and placed in co-culture with PBMCs from HIV negative donors. The culture supernatant was assayed for the HIV- 1 P 24 antigen as a marker of viral replication. High levels of HIV- 1 P 24 antigen were recovered from the PDET wash for up to and including 48 hours of drying time. No viable virus could be detected for drying times of between 72 and 168 hours. To determine if common disinfectants found in the dialysis unit could inactivate HIV, dilutions of Amukin™ 50 % and household bleach were prepared at final concentrations ranging from 1 : 32 to 1 : 2048. These disinfectant solutions were incubated with PDE containing HIV for 10 minutes. The cellular fraction of the PDE was isolated by centrifugation, washed, and placed in co-cultures with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. HIV P 24 antigen levels were assayed every three days for 28 days. Amukin™ 50 % and a 10 % household bleach solution were effective in killing HIV in PDE at dilutions up to and including 1 : 512. These results indicate that HIV can survive in PDE at room temperature for up to seven days. HIV can survive on peritoneal dialysis exchange tubing for up to 48 hours. Final dilutions of 1 : 512 Amukin™ 50 % and 10 % household bleach, after 10 minutes of exposure, are effective <b>viricidal</b> agents in disinfecting PDE...|$|E
