25|$|The large, {{distinctive}} and powerful cats are popular zoo exhibits. The Siberian tiger is bred {{under the auspices}} of the Species Survival Plan (SSP), in a project based on 83 tigers captured in the wild. According to most experts, this population is large enough to stay stable and genetically healthy. Today, approximately 160 Siberian tigers participate in the SSP, which makes it the most extensively bred tiger subspecies within the program. Developed in 1982, the Species Survival Plan for the Siberian tiger is the longest running program for a tiger subspecies. It has been <b>very</b> <b>fortunate</b> and productive, and the breeding program for the Siberian tiger has actually been used as a good example when new programs have been designed to save other animal species from extinction.|$|E

The badly damaged Stockholm, {{through the use of}} both her own lifeboats and those from the stricken Andrea Doria, took on a total of 545 survivors, of whom 234 were crew members from the Andrea Doria; 129 survivors had been rescued by Cape Ann, 159 by Pvt.

Hopkins. Île de France undoubtedly played the largest role in the rescue, having taken on a total of 753 survivors.|$|E
25|$|The early 1840s were {{a time of}} {{economic}} depression in New South Wales brought on by a severe drought in 1839, so Blacket was <b>very</b> <b>fortunate</b> to immediately gain employment from Bishop Broughton as Inspector of the Schools {{in connection with the}} Church of England in the Colony. This position involved the design and supervision of the building of schools, churches and parsonages. As the colony rapidly expanded, many school buildings were designed to be multi-purpose, serving as churches on Sunday and sometimes as court houses. Blacket began work on 1 January 1843, and on 18 January delivered to the Bishop the plans for the church of All Saint's, Patrick Plains (now Singleton). He estimated that it could be built for £700. It was eventually completed in 1850 for £713.11s.6d. Other churches that he supervised, designed or extended were St John's Ashfield (1843), St Mary's Balmain (1843), St Paul's Carcoar (1845), the old St Stephen's, Newtown (1845) and Christ Church St Laurence, Sydney.|$|E

25|$|In 1840, upon {{graduation}} from the gymnasium, Pisemsky joined the Faculty of Mathematics at Moscow State University, having overcome resistance {{from his father}} who insisted upon his son enrolling in the Demidov Lyceum, for it was closer to home and his education {{there would have been}} free. Pisemsky later regarded his choice of faculty as a <b>very</b> <b>fortunate</b> one, even while admitting he drew little practical value out of university lectures. Attending assorted lectures by professors from other faculties, he became acquainted with Shakespeare, Schiller, Goethe, Corneille, Racine, Rousseau, Voltaire, Hugo and George Sand and started to form an educated view on the history of Russian literature. Contemporaries pointed at Pisemsky's two major influences of the time: Belinsky and Gogol. Besides, as Pisemsky's friend Boris Almazov remembered, Pavel Katenin, the follower of French classicism and Russian translator of Racine and Cornel, whom Pisemsky knew through being a neighbour, exerted some influence upon him as well. According to Almazov, Pisemsky had a considerable dramatic talent, and it was Katenin who helped him to develop it.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{opened the}} last Serie A weekend of February away to Genoa, who {{were led by}} Pasquale Marino, the coach who took charge of much of Parma's 2010–11 season. With neither side having scored since 5 February, it was a {{surprise}} when the scoring was opened so easrly in the game; Massimo Gobbi swept home {{from the edge of the}} area after just five minutes. Giovinco then had what looked like a fair goal ruled out for offside just before half-time. Parma did get their second goal after the break after a brilliant run from Jonathan Biabiany ended in a Giovinco chance with the follow-up falling to Sergio Floccari, who converted against his former employees. With just over ten minutes to go, Genoa were <b>very</b> <b>fortunate</b> to be given a penalty for Francesco Modesto's accidental handball inside the area; Rodrigo Palacio tapped in after Mirante's save. Genoa then should have had a penalty after a reckless Modesto challenged went unpunished. The referee inexplicably allowed 7 minutes of injury time; Palacio used the sixth to break the offside trap and slot home to level the score and earn a point for his team.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{returned}} home to start the 2004 English season but finally was green-lighted to make his Test debut for England after Vaughan sustained a knee injury in the nets. The initial plan was to promote Mark Butcher to the now vacant opening batsman position, and include Paul Collingwood in the middle order. Butcher declined {{to move up the}} order and batted third, meaning Strauss was asked to open the batting and Collingwood missed out on a place in the side. Vaughan's injury turned out to be <b>very</b> <b>fortunate</b> for Strauss who, in his first Test innings, top scored with 112 and contributed 82 in the second innings before being run out, with Nasser Hussain taking responsibility for the dismissal. This put Strauss on a series of exclusive lists including being the second English player to score a century on his debut at Lord's, third opener to score a hundred on debut, the fifteenth English player to score a century on his debut, the first since Graham Thorpe in 1993 and only the fourth English player to score a century and half century on his debut. Strauss also made the first dismissal of the Test, catching Stephen Fleming off Simon Jones and was awarded Man of The Match for his efforts. The performance by Strauss excelled his role as a filler for Vaughan, leading to Hussain retiring from cricket allowing for Vaughan to move down the order and Strauss retaining the role of opener opposite Marcus Trescothick. Strauss' form declined over the series, with one half century in the second Test and his first Test duck along with a six in the third Test.|$|E
