40|$|This paper {{presents}} preliminar {{results of}} Particle Image Velocimetry based analysis of initial particle velocity determination on bubble eruptions in a 2 -D freely bubbling fluidized beds. A narrow two-dimensional non-reacting fluidized bed was constructed {{with the aim}} to measure the origin of ejected particles and the initial particle velocity distribution in a freely fluidized bed using coarse sand particles. The bubble ejection mechanism was observed taking into account not only the origin of particles ejected but also the initial particle velocity distributions {{as well as the}} effect of other neighboring exploding bubbles. Due to the large variety of topologies possible, only vertically interacting bubbles are presented. Our results, show that the assumption of initial velocity linear dependence with the angle predicts fidelity of only the velocity for purely <b>vertical</b> <b>raising</b> bubbles at low angles. Measurements of ejection velocities show that initial velocities in the combined layer are well higher than the particles in the nose of the leading bubble. Consequently, avoiding the coalescence of bubbles at the bed surface can lead to less particle entrainment out of the bed and thus shorter fluidized beds.

The trailing bubble nose shows blurring caused by excessive exposure. Left surface is falling owing to a previous eruption...|$|E

40|$|Trajectory {{optimization}} of {{a generic}} launch vehicle is considered in this paper. The trajectory from launch point to terminal injection point is divided in to two segments. The first segment deals with launcher clearance and <b>vertical</b> <b>raise</b> of the vehicle. During this phase, a nonlinear feedback guidance loop is incorporated to assure <b>vertical</b> <b>raise</b> in presence of thrust misalignment, {{centre of gravity}} offset, wind disturbance etc. and possibly to clear obstacles as well. The second segment deals with the trajectory optimization, where {{the objective is to}} ensure desired terminal conditions as well as minimum control effort and minimum structural loading in the high dynamic pressure region. The usefulness of this dynamic optimization problem formulation is demonstrated by solving it using the classical Gradient method. Numerical results for both the segments are presented, which clearly brings out the potential advantages of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|Preventing and {{minimizing}} pain {{in laboratory}} animals {{is a basic}} tenet of biomedical research and is warranted for ethical, legal, and scientific reasons. Postoperative analgesia is an important facet of pain management. A sustained-release formulation of buprenorphine was tested in rats for analgesic efficacy and plasma concentration over a 72 -h time period. Rats were injected subcutaneously with either 1. 2 mg/kg sustained-release formulation (Bup-SR), 0. 2 mL/kg buprenorphine HCl (Bup-HCl), or an equivalent volume of sustained-release vehicle and tested in a thermal nociception model or a surgical postoperative pain model. In both models, Bup-SR showed evidence of providing analgesia for 2 to 3 d. Thermal latency response in rats that received the sustained-release formulation increased 28. 4 % and 15. 6 % compared with baseline values on days 1 and 2, respectively. Rats with a unicortical tibial defect and treated with Bup-SR showed similar willingness to bear weight on the hindlimbs as did negative-control animals (no surgery), demonstrated by counting vertical raises; rats treated with Bup-HCl had significantly fewer <b>vertical</b> <b>raises</b> than did control rats for 5 d after surgery. Plasma concentrations of buprenorphine remained over 1 ng/mL for 72 h after a single dose of Bup-SR. Taken together, {{the results indicate that}} this formulation of buprenorphine may be a viable option for treating postsurgical pain in laboratory rats...|$|R

The speaker's {{intention}} was to have analyzed, as far as possible, {{the action of the}} forming forces in one wave of simple elevation, the Mont Salève, and in another of lateral compression, the Mont Brezon: but the investigation of the Mont Salève had presented unexpected difficulty. Its façade had been always considered to be formed by <b>vertical</b> beds, <b>raised</b> into that position during the tertiary periods; the speaker's investigations had, on the contrary, led him to conclude that the appearance of vertical beds was owing to a peculiarly sharp and distinct cleavage, at right angles with the beds, but nearly parallel to their strike, elsewhere similarly manifested in the Jurassic series of Savoy, and showing itself on the fronts of most of the precipices formed of that rock.

The paper addresses these issues empirically, focussing on the popular perception of commercial and hobby drones in Switzerland. This provides {{a deeper understanding of}} the driving forces and obstacles that shape current drone developments and highlights that the societal diffusion of private drones today transforms the very ways in which the aerial realm is lived and perceived, as a highly contested space of risks, opportunities, and power.

In this paper, we study the economic development of the Swedish railway and explore if and how the deregulation has affected cost efficiency. We use a longitudinal econometric approach in our study and conclude that <b>vertical</b> separation <b>raises</b> costs, and also that the introduction of competition lowers costs.

5000|$|The scrotum is an {{anatomical}} male reproductive {{structure that}} consists of a suspended dual-chambered sack of skin and smooth muscle that is present in most terrestrial male mammals and located under the penis. One testis is typically lower than the other, which functions to avoid compression {{in the event of}} impact. The perineal raphe is a small, <b>vertical,</b> slightly <b>raised</b> ridge of scrotal skin under which is found the scrotal septum. It appears as a thin longitudinal line that runs front to back over the entire scrotum. The scrotum contains the external spermatic fascia, testes, epididymis and ductus deferens. It is a distention of the perineum and carries some abdominal tissues into its cavity including the testicular artery, testicular vein and pampiniform plexus. In humans and some other mammals, the scrotum becomes covered with pubic hair at puberty. The scrotum will usually tighten during penile erection and when exposed to cold temperature.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} product prices {{determine}} organizational design by studying how trade policy affects vertical integration. Property rights theory asserts that firm boundaries are chosen by stakeholders to mediate organizational goals (e. g., profits) and private benefits (e. g., operating in preferred ways). We present an incomplete-contracts {{model in which}} <b>vertical</b> integration <b>raises</b> output {{at the expense of}} lower private benefits. A key implication is that higher prices should result in more integration, since the organizational goal becomes relatively more valuable than private benefits. Trade policy provides a source of exogenous price variation to test this proposition: higher tariffs should lead to more vertical integration; moreover, ownership structures should be more alike across countries with similar levels of protection. To assess the evidence, we construct firm-level indices of vertical integration for a large set of countries and industries and exploit cross-section and time-series variation in import tariffs to examine the impact of prices on organizational choices. Our empirical results provide strong support for the predictions of the model...|$|R

40|$|Summary:. Low-lying rectal cancers {{are being}} treated more {{frequently}} with robotic-assisted abdominoperineal resection, obviating the need for laparotomy {{and the ability to}} <b>raise</b> <b>vertical</b> rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flaps. For female patients, posterior vaginectomy often accompanies the resection. Combined pudendal thigh flaps as an extension of bilateral gluteus advancement flaps allow for posterior vaginal resurfacing with thin pliable fasciocutaneous flaps, which rest on the gluteal flap soft-tissue bulk that obliterates the pelvic dead space. For patients with advanced cancers who have had neoadjuvant chemoradiation, the pudendal skin paddle can be planned more laterally to bring in healthier medial thigh skin.
