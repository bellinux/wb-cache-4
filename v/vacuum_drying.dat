25|$|Screening the fibre {{involves}} using a mesh {{made from}} non-corroding and inert material, such as aluminium, which is stretched {{in a wooden}} frame {{similar to that of}} a window. The size of the paper is governed {{by the size of the}} frame. This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a uniform coating of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press very gently to ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTEM Study of Heavitree {{quartzite}} deformed at {{high temperatures}} and a pressure of 1. 5 GPa {{with three different}} preparations: water-added, <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried,</b> and sodium doped show {{a wide range of}} dislocation microstructure. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> sample has a very heterogeneous dislocation distribution varying from almost no dislocations to very high densities. Dislocation nucleation occurs by cross-slip mechanisms, such as Frank-Read sources and Orowan loops around hard inclusions. Shear bands develop in the basal plane composed of two closely spaced shear planes. Dislocations have straight segments and they are aligned along directions of dense packing, suggesting strong Peierls stress control due to the crystal structure. No voids, bubbles or dislocation walls where observed in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> sample. The sodium-doped sample had a homogeneous high dislocation density. The water-added sample has a significantly lower, relatively uniform dislocation density. Bubbles associated with dislocations are seen in every grain. Dislocations were either present in loops around bubbles or as straight dislocations with small bubbles spaced along the dislocation line. Some of the long straight dislocations are aligned parallel to the c-axis. Sub-grains where very frequent, sometimes form cells of about 2 p,m in diameter with straight edges. Analysis of dislocations show 1 / 3 and [c] dislocations in sub-grain walls and free 1 / 3 dislocations on prism planes. There is clear evidence for dislocation climb with sub-grain walls, dislocation cells, dislocation junctions and dislocation debris of small loops. The major difference between <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> and water-added samples are the homogeneity of the microstructure and evidence for climb in the water-added sample. Glide is clearly difficult, with a high Peierls stress in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> sample as shown by areas of very low and very high dislocation density and the crystallographic control of dislocation line direction. The sodium-doped sample indicates that nucleation was easy by the high homogenous dislocation density, but no climb recovery has taken place. The density is high and the dislocations are strongly interacting causing tangles; no evidence for crystallographic control can be observed at these levels of strain. The activation energy for creep in Heavitree quartzite decreases with inferred water content of the specimens form 185 kJ mol(- 1) for <b>vacuum</b> <b>dried</b> to 151 for 0. 4 wt% water-added samples. Analysis of diffusion data for oxygen under hydrothermal conditions and inferred diffusion data for the hydrogarnet defect and dislocation velocity suggests activation energies for these processes are similar to the activation energy for the dislocation creep of Heavitree quartzite and other quartz aggregates. For data from the previously published experiments with the highest stress resolution there is a correlation between the A pre-factor in the power law creep equation and the activation energy for creep. It is speculated that the correlation may be due to variable hydrogarnet defect concentrations...|$|R

A study of three drying technologies, in which 3 mm thick carrot slices were dried, illustrated the rapid dehydration rate {{that can be achieved}} using microwave <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying.</b> Freeze drying took approximately 3 days to reach the end point of 9.9 percent moisture content, air drying took 8 hours, and microwave <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> only required 33 minutes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> is {{the mass}} {{transfer}} operation {{in which the}} moisture present in a substance usually wet solid is removed by means of creating vacuum. In chemical process industries like food, pharmaceutical, agricultural, textile, paper & pulp etc. drying is an essential unit operation to remove moisture.Vacuum drying is generally used for the drying of those substances which are hygroscopic and heat sensitive {{and is based on}} the principle of creating a vacuum to decrease the pressure below the vapor pressure of the water. With the help of vacuum pumps, the pressure is reduced around the substance to be dried. This decreases the boiling point of water inside that product and, thus, increases the rate of evaporation significantly. The result is a significantly increased drying rate of the product. The pressure maintained in <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> is generally 0.0296 -0.059 atm and the boiling point of water is 25-30 ◦C. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>drying</b> process is a batch operation which is performed at reduced pressures and lower relative humidity compared to ambient pressure. That is why the drying occurs faster under these conditions.|$|E
