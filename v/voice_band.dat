In <b>Voice,</b> <b>Band,</b> and Orchestra, the {{students}} audition for a spot in one of Lafayette's Bands, Orchestras, or Choirs, and have an additional music class which all music majors take together depending on grade. In Visual Art, students are split by grade level.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Universal Republic Records {{executive}} Tom Mackay tapped Appleberry {{to produce}} and mix iTunes single versions of every song performed on the show. Sold in conjunction with each episode, the TV schedule imposed strict deadlines on production, with each week requiring an average of 12 mastered singles. Faced with these challenges, Appleberry assembled a team of record makers and engineers to record The <b>Voice</b> <b>Band</b> and the contestants. Initially working at studios around LA, Appleberry has made Henson Recording Studios {{a home for the}} production. Since the show's inception, Appleberry has produced and mixed over 1600 songs for The Voice. In 2014, the show's catalog hit 20 million download sales.|$|E

5000|$|The SF tone may {{occupy a}} small portion of the user data channel spectrum, e.g., 1600 Hz or 2600 Hz (SF [...] "in-band signaling)". There may be a notch filter at the precise SF frequency, either {{filtering}} the circuit at all times or only when the circuit is off-hook, to prevent the user from inadvertently disconnecting a call if the users voice has a sufficiently strong spectral content at the SF frequency, a falsing condition known as talk-off. Notoriously, this property was exploited by blue boxers and other toll fraudsters. The SF tone may also be just outside the user <b>voice</b> <b>band,</b> e.g., 3600 Hz.|$|E
50|$|Dillard Center for the Arts (DCA) {{provides}} {{training in}} dance, music, theater, and visual arts, {{as well as}} an academic schedule.

5000|$|The twelve channel scheme, {{in order}} to {{maintain}} some bandwidth and routing compatibility, was carried through to the short haul carriers, as well, as they started developing to eliminate <b>voice</b> <b>band</b> open wire trunk lines in the 1950s. The Bell System vacuum-tube driven N-1 Carrier of the early 1950s was the most used twelve channel carrier system, using double sideband/unsuppressed carrier operation which didn't need network timebase synchronization to maintain frequency accuracy. N-2 was similar in heterodyning scheme, but in discrete transistorized [...] "plug-in unit" [...] architecture, while N3 used the same frequency plan but a scheme of using single sideband with a different voice channel {{on each side of the}} carrier, a technique first seen on the 16 channel Type [...] "O" [...] open wire short haul carrier of the 1950s. This doubled the capacity to 24 channels, the same as a basic digital Type T PCM carrier introduced in the late 1950s, which became the now-ubiquitous [...] "T-1" [...] of the digital world.|$|E
50|$|All phones (or other <b>voice</b> <b>band</b> devices) must be {{connected}} via a filter (either a separate filter for each phone or one filter covering multiple phones) to avoid interference between the phones and the DSL signal. If the data transmission is still audible, using two DSL filters, daisychained in series, should eliminate the problem. The RJ11 female port provided on the filter case simply connects the DSL router {{directly to the}} phone line (most DSL filters have a socket marked DSL or ADSL that just connects the DSL line pair directly through to the incoming phone line pair via the BT plug, without any filtering or processing of any kind). The ringer wire is unnecessary in unfiltered parts of the wiring and its removal can often improve performance and reliability of the broadband service. This {{is due to the}} unbalancing effect that the ringer wire (on long extensions) can have on the matched twisted pair. Thus reducing the signal to noise ratio and also the high frequency response of the subscriber line.|$|E
