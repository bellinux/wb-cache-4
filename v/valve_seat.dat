25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the flush <b>valve</b> <b>seat)</b> by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user pushes a lever, which lifts the flush valve from the <b>valve</b> <b>seat.</b> The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|E
25|$|Free-flow: Either of {{the stages}} may {{get stuck in}} the open position, causing a {{continuous}} flow of gas from the regulator known as a free-flow. This can be triggered by a range of causes, some {{of which can be}} easily remedied, others not. Possible causes include incorrect interstage pressure setting, incorrect second stage valve spring tension, damaged or sticking valve poppet, damaged <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> valve freezing, wrong sensitivity setting at the surface and in Poseidon servo-assisted second stages, low interstage pressure.|$|E
50|$|Some older {{cars have}} {{relatively}} soft <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> that wear faster when operated without leaded fuel. These usually can be updated with hardened <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> that resist wear, {{regardless of whether}} leaded or unleaded fuel is used.|$|R

25|$|The piston in {{the first}} stage is rigid and acts {{directly}} on the seat of the valve. The pressure in the intermediate pressure chamber drops when the diver inhales from the second stage valve, this causes the piston to lift off the stationary <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> as the piston slides into the intermediate pressure chamber. The now open valve permits high pressure gas to flow into the medium pressure chamber until the pressure in the chamber has risen enough to push the piston back into its original position against the seat and thus close the valve.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve lifter. This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve lifter shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E
25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5Â°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> on some regulators.|$|E

50|$|Inexpensive engines {{may have}} <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> that are simply {{cut into the}} {{material}} of the cylinder head or engine block (depending {{on the design of}} the engine). Some newer engines have seats that are sprayed on rather than being pressed into the head, allowing them to be thinner, creating more efficient transfer of heat through the <b>valve</b> <b>seats,</b> and enabling the valve stems to function at a lower temperature, thus allowing the valve stems (and other parts of the valvetrain) to be thinner and lighter.|$|R
2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{problem with the}} CVH is the {{tendency}} to drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> which most often happens in vin number P engines, due to the steel PM <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts in the aluminum head. (the 2000-2004 Ford Focus with the 2.0L CVH/SPI SOHC engine and also seen in 1991-2002 Ford Escorts). These engines usually drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder (this peculiarity {{may have something to}} do with the engines secondary harmonics) [...] With the factory valve seats, the typical life of the 2.0L SPI in a Focus is about 100 to 120k miles, but it can happen as early as 70k miles. When the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the piston and cylinder head. In some cases, the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> is drawn from its cylinder through the intake manifold into another cylinder until it is obliterated. A <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> dropping into the cylinder can scar the cylinder wall and bend the piston connecting rods.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the valve guide hole axis, deviation of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces from concentricity with the valve guide holes, and deviation of the machined conical section of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface. Automated quality control of inserted and machined valve seats has traditionally been very difficult to achieve until the advent of digital holography which has enabled high-definition metrology for measuring all of these listed deviations.|$|E

50|$|The {{drawback}} to the monobloc head is {{that access to}} the inside of the combustion chamber (the upper volume of the cylinder) becomes difficult.

5000|$|The first {{screw-down}} tap mechanism was patented {{and manufactured}} by the Rotherham brass founders Guest and Chrimes in 1845. Most older taps use a soft rubber or neoprene washer which is screwed down onto a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> {{in order to}} stop the flow. This is called a [...] "globe valve" [...] in engineering and, while it gives a leak-proof seal and good fine adjustment of flow, both the rubber washer and the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> are subject to wear (and for the seat, also corrosion) over time, so that eventually no tight seal is formed in the closed position, resulting in a leaking tap. The washer can be replaced and the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> resurfaced (at least a few times), but globe valves are never maintenance-free.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} days of engine building, the poppet valve was a major problem. Metallurgy was lacking, and the rapid opening and closing of valves against {{cylinder}} heads led to rapid wear. They would need to be re-ground in a process known as a 'valve job'.
