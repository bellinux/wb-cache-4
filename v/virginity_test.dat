Alone in the {{afternoon}} in Alsemero's room, she feels too ashamed {{to have sex with}} her new husband on their wedding night. In Alsemero's closet, she finds many medicines. One is a pregnancy test kit and another a <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> kit. Diaphanta enters, looking for Alsemero. Beatrice tells Diaphanta that she will offer 1000 ducats to any virgin if she secretly has sex with her husband Alsemero, instead of her, on their wedding night. But to test whether Diaphanta is a virgin or not, both of them take the <b>virginity</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> shows that Beatrice is not a virgin whereas Diaphanta is, as she has exhibited the usual symptoms of first yawning, then sneezing, and finally laughing. They arrange for Diaphanta to go to Alsemero's bed that night, in the pitch darkness, and pretend to be Beatrice.|$|E

40|$|Text in EnglishThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the experience explore the experience of <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> of female adolescents in the uThungulu district of KwaZulu-Natal. A qualitative research was conducted to explore and describe the experiences of female adolescents on <b>virginity</b> <b>testing.</b> In-depth phenomenological interviews were conducted on 18 participants during data collection. Proponents of <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> believe that <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> is a traditional practice that can assist in reducing HIV infection and teenage pregnancy amongst the youth. On the other hand, opponents of <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> strongly believe that the practice of <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> interferes with human rights and Constitutional prescripts that protect the rights to equity, privacy, bodily integrity and sexual autonomy of young women. The study found that participants had only positive experiences of the practice of <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> and none expressed having any negative experiences. The findings also confirmed that <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> is being done irrespective of different opinions from different scholars and experts on the subject.

50|$|A <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> is the {{practice}} and process of determining whether a person, usually a girl or woman, is a virgin; i.e., whether she has never engaged in sexual intercourse. The test typically involves a check {{for the presence of}} an intact hymen, on the assumption that it can only be torn as a result of sexual intercourse.|$|E
50|$|Requiring {{a female}} {{to undergo a}} <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> is widely seen as harmful, {{especially}} when it is performed {{on behalf of a}} government. The practice is seen as sexist, perpetuating the notion that sexual intercourse outside of marriage is acceptable for men, but not for women, and suggesting that a women's sexual activity should be subject to public knowledge and criticism, while men's should not.|$|E

5000|$|Preventing {{the spread}} of HIV and teenage {{pregnancy}} are examples of reasons given by proponents of <b>virginity</b> <b>testing.</b> In 2004, a Zimbabwean village chief, Naboth Makoni, stated that he would adopt a plan to enforce <b>virginity</b> <b>tests</b> {{as a way of}} protecting his people against HIV. He explained that he focuses on girls because he believes they are easier to control than boys. In South Africa, where <b>virginity</b> <b>testing</b> is banned, the Zulu tribe believes that the practice prevents {{the spread of}} HIV and teenage pregnancy.

50|$|Virginity {{testing was}} also used on women {{entering}} the United Kingdom on a so-called fiancee visa, when {{they said they were}} immigrating to marry their fiances who were already living in the country.

In January 1979, a woman was required by British immigration officers to undergo a <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> when she arrived in London claiming that she was there to marry.

50|$|The Karims keep {{themselves}} to themselves, and Ashraf is particularly protective of his daughter, Shireen.

However Shireen continues to see Ricky behind his back and when her brother, Sohail, reveals the relationship, Ashraf is furious. He bans her from seeing him and bans Ricky from his shop. Ashraf decides that the only way to stop her from fraternising with undesirable men is to marry her off to an eligible Muslim suitor - much to Shireen's dismay. Muslim culture dictates that betrothed women must be virgins before marrying and so in the light of her dalliance with Ricky, Ashraf decides that Shireen has to have a <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> performed.

As a result, Sophie goes through a period of self- hate, ashamed to show anyone her body, including her husband (80) viii. Sophie's struggles to overcome frigidity in relation to intimacy with her husband Joseph, as well as her bulimia parallels Martine's struggle bear a child with Marc to term, as well her insomnia, and detrimental eating habits (61-62) v. Due to Martine's rape by a Tonton Macoute and Sophie's abuse by her mother, [...] "each woman must come to terms with herself before she can enter into a healthy relationship with a man, and these men attempt to meet these women on the latter's own terms" [...] (68) vi.The pinnacle of this mirroring comes when Sophie chooses to be her mother's Marassa, a double of herself for her mother, to share the pain, the trials and the tribulations, the ultimate connection: to become one with her mother. Marassas represent [...] "sameness and love" [...] as one, they are [...] "inseparable and identical. They love each other because they are alike and always together" [...] vii. This connection between Sophie and her mother Martine has also been challenged through Sophie's own connection with her daughter Brigitte: [...] "Martine's totally nihilistic unwillingness to begin again with the draining responsibilities of motherhood comments upon and stands in stark contrast to Sophie's loving desire to bring her daughter Brigitte into the welcoming" [...] (79) viii.|$|E

We found that the continuing practice of uncritically collecting forensic reports and the refusal to closely examine the specific dynamics of oppression (medical, cultural, legal, political) in which the victims of sexual abuse are necessarily implicated actually increases the power of medicine and law to adversely function as tools of oppression.

40|$|Master of EducationThis {{thesis is}} a study of a nineteenth - century teacher, Martha G. Neven, whose life was spent in the {{marginal}} role of temporary teacher in the Victorian Education Department until she was deemed {{by the state to}} be insane and admitted to Kew Asylum. Martha, or Grace as she was also known, taught at a time of transition in the Education Department as it became a public service department. Teaching, one hospitable to women teachers, including married women, became increasingly classified as a career to attract more male staff. The Public Service Act of 1889 and the retrenchment measures of the 1890 s prohibited married women, with some exceptions, from tenured employment in the Department. In 1891 Grace made a forced marriage to a man who very shortly afterwards was admitted to an asylum: When the secret marriage {{came to the attention of}} the Department she was forced to resign. The Education Department's Special Case File describes this incident, the <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> she was required to take to prove her innocence, the Department's support for her divorce and her reinstatement as teacher. Further research showed that Grace's second marriage also failed, leaving her, a deserted wife, to earn her living as a temporary teacher. This study explores what it is possible to "know" of Grace as the "good and mad" woman of the nineteenth - century records. It argues that there is another representation of Grace's life which acknowledges her achievements and her strategies for survival for thirty - seven years in a Department which exploited its married women temporary teachers.

40|$|The study {{examines}} adolescents' knowledge, {{attitudes and behavior}} {{in the areas of}} sexuality, fertility and family formation. The aim of the study is to document, nationwide, information that will contribute to the formulation of appropriate policies and effective programs to address adolescent needs in the area of sexuality, sexual behavior and their consequences. The sample comprised 179 males and 225 females between the ages of 13 and 19, all resident in Kiribati {{at the time of the}} survey. The distribution of the sample reflects the national distribution of the population. A multistage sampling procedure was employed to produce the desired sample size. A questionnaire was administered to each respondent. The study found that young people of Kiribati had little factual information about the menstrual cycle and its significance, the fertile period and pregnancy. Sex education appears to have no impact on the level of awareness of young people. Though few young people claimed to have experienced coitus, the findings are interesting despite the suspiciously low numbers. The mean age at first coitus for girls is about 14 years and for boys 15. Most had their first sexual encounter on the beach, pointing to the need for parental supervision. A significant proportion of those who were sexually active have had more than three partners, a significant health risk exposure. The findings are all the more interesting because this is a society that still carries out a <b>virginity</b> <b>test</b> as part of the wedding ceremony. Data also show the low level of young people's knowledge about contraception. Social disapproval is a major factor in adolescents' not seeking family planning information. Services are geared to older married women. It appears schools and parents do very little in this area. There also appears to be very little communicaion between young people and parents about contraceptive use and sexual responsibilities. Knowledge about sexually transmitted infections is almost non-existent, whether concerning their symptoms, mode of transmission or means of avoidance. Such level of ignorance leave the people of Kiribati particularly exposed to disease transmission from overseas. There is much to be done by the Ministry of Health and Education Department in raising awareness among young people of the risks, symptoms to watch for and means of avoidance. Data reveal the disturbing level of ignorance on sexual and reproductive health. In addition many young people consult no one at all about their problems. Apparently there is no guidance in this area - or little except rather negative please for good behavior from the Church, parents and school. There is great need for support for young people as they develop life skills such as behaving responsibly, making informed choices and managing intimate relationships...|$|E
