40|$|Two <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{containing}} the same active substances are considered bioequivalent {{if they are}} pharmaceutically equivalent, {{they have the same}} bioavailability and comparable plasmatic curve. Sometimes bioequivalence can be investigated with in vitro-studies, like dissolution test. The BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) -based biowaiver approach is useful to reduce in vivo bioequivalence studies, it may represent a “surrogate” for in vivo bioequivalence. This concept is applicable to immediate release and solid pharmaceutical products for oral administration and systemic action having the same pharmaceutical form. BCS-based biowaivers are applicable to substances with “high solubility” and “high permeability” (BCS-class I) like Enrofloxacin and Metronidazole, or “high solubility” and “low permeability” (BCS-class III) like Spiramycin. The objective of this research work was to develop two new products "comparable" and "alternative" respect to the products already on the market. In the first project, conventional release tablets of "Spiramycin" and “Metronidazole” were developed in two different doses, equivalent to a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> on the market. In the second project, conventional release tablets of "Enrofloxacin" were developed in two different doses, equivalent to a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> on the market. Bioequivalence studies were conducted using BCS-based biowaivers approach. Both projects are divided into different steps: formulation development, development and validation of analytical method, and bioequivalence in vitro-study. Bioequivalence between “new” and “originator” product has been demonstrated using the dissolution tests and comparing the dissolution curves. Active ingredients are rapidly and equally released by the two formulations at all pH values. The analysis of variance carried out by applying the two-way ANOVA test shows that the effect of the composition of the product is not significant, while the effect of the time is highly significant. “Developed” and “originator” products are pharmaceutically equivalent and bioequivalent, so they can be considered therapeutically equivalent...|$|R

No studies have been conducted to describe and assess the adequacy of the current routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to these farmers. A combination of focus groups, self-administered questionnaires and direct observations was used to collect information for the purpose of describing and understanding the situation regarding the supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district. A combination of semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and direct observation was used to gather information. The results indicated that the routes and methods of supply of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> to the farmers of the Madikwe district were inadequate. The annual sales from outlets within the Madikwe district were poor, with a total of 396 units sold over a period of one year, although there were approximately 2000 farmers in the Madikwe district who were potential clients for these outlets. The majority of products sold by these outlets were ectoparasiticides, followed by Tetracycline antibiotics. The outlets within the Madikwe district were unable to supply vaccines, as they did not have adequate facilities for the storage of these thermolabile products. Farmers had to travel an average of 70 km if they wished to purchase <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> from farmers' co-operatives and pharmacies in larger towns outside the Madikwe district. The routes and methods of supply did not ensure correct storage, and safe and effective use of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> Several examples of misuse and incorrect storage and handling of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> were discovered. Inadequate information transfer, inaccessibility of outlets, poor reliability and quality of outlets and poor service were discovered as reasons for the inadequacy of the routes and methods of supply.

40|$|International audienceOxfendazole, methyl- 5 (6) -phenylsulfinyl- 2 -{{benzimidazole}} carbamate, is {{a member}} of the benzimidazole family of anthelmintics. Anthelmintic benzimidazoles are widely used in meat producing animals (cattle, sheep and pigs) for control of endoparasites. The extensive use of veterinary drugs in food-producing animals can cause the presence of small quantities of the drug residues in food. Maximum residue limit or "MRL" means the maximum concentration of residue resulting from the use of a <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> which may be legally permitted recognized as acceptable in food. The FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (1999) evaluations of toxicological and residue data, reported that oxfendazole (MRL) has toxicological hazards on human health. The toxicity of oxfendazole (MRL) was tested in male and female mice and their fetuses. Chromosomal aberrations, teratological examination and biochemical analysis were the parameters used in this study. The results show that oxfendazole MRL induced a mutagenic effect in all tested cell types. Also, oxfendazole exhibit embryotoxicity including teratogenicity. The biochemical results show that oxfendazole induced a disturbance in the different biochemical contents of all tested tissues. So, we must increase the attention paid to the potential risk of oxfendazole residues in human beings and should stress the need for careful control to ensure adherence to the prescribed withdrawal time of this drug...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary medicinal product sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire.

Cecum samples were taken 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours post-dosing on days 3 and 7 of the treatment. These samples were analysed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC/MS/MS). The results show that 105 IU/kg did not expose the cecum to inhibitory concentrations and 210 IU/kg failed to maintain bactericidal levels {{for more than a}} few hours. The 420 IU/mg dose maintained bactericidal concentrations for the entire 24 -hour period with 2102 µg/kg as the lowest mean concentration measured over the considered period, a value close to the target Minimal Bactericidal Concentration of 1860 µg/ml estimated for bacitracin in vitro. Concentrations obtained at 840 IU/kg were far higher. These results justify a daily dose of 420 IU/kg/day in the treatment of intestinal infections where Clostridium perfringens can be isolated. In addition, after 30 days of continuous administration at 420 IU/kg body weight, blood concentrations remained below the detection limit (< 37. 5 µg/l).

40|$|Introduction: The most {{frequently}} used method to administer <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the intensified poultry and pig industry is by application in feed or drinking water. Besides <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> also technological-, sensory-, nutritional- and zootechnical additives {{can be added to}} the feed. Some of these feed additives contain high amounts of clays and are primarily intended to be used as mycotoxin binders. Mycotoxin binders (short: binders) are deemed to adsorb mycotoxins in the gut of the animal thereby preventing the oral absorption of toxic compounds. Most binders contain montmorillonite clays which have previously been reported to decrease the clinical efficacy of tilmicosin 1 and the oral absorption of tylosin 2, both in broiler chickens. Therefore, the aim of this project was to investigate the effect of binders on the oral bioavailability of frequently used veterinary drugs in mass medication, in vitro and in vivo, in broiler chickens. Material and Methods: First, the in vitro adsorption of sulfadiazine (SDZ), trimethoprim (TRIM), tylosin (TYL), doxycycline (DOX) 3, diclazuril (DICL), lasalocid (LAS) and salinomycin (SAL) to 6 different mycotoxin binders and active carbon (AC, used as positive control) was assessed in a single-concentration adsorption screening assay. The binders or AC were incubated for 4 hours in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at three different pH’s and 37 °C for 4 h with each one of the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>product</b> mentioned above. Next, two in vivo pharmacokinetic experiments were executed in broiler chickens with 2 selected clay-based binders or active carbon. Pharmacokinetic profiles were determined for SD +TRIM and DOX 3 in broilers that received a single oral bolus containing a daily dose of either drug solely, or the combination of binder and drug. Results: Several binder-drug combinations showed over 90 % in vitro adsorption for TRIM, DOX, DICL, LAS or SAL. Results of the 2 in vivo experiments demonstrated a significant interaction of 2 clay-based binders and DOX 3, since these binders were able to lower the oral bioavailability of DOX to less than 40 % compared to broilers receiving only DOX. No interactions of these binders with SDZ+TRIM combinations were seen...|$|R
40|$|A {{ranking system}} for <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and {{medicated}} feed additives {{has been developed}} {{as a tool to}} be applied in a risk-based approach to the residue testing programme for foods of animal origin in the National Residue Control Plan. In the context of food sampling and residue testing for the National Residue Control Plan, there is firstly, the risk to human health from residues of chemical substances in food and secondly, the issue of non-compliance with regulations relating to residues in food due to improper farm practices; both these elements are included in the developed risk-ranking of substances. Three characteristics of substances that may occur as residues in food are included in the developed risk-ranking system: ‘Potency’, as measured by the acceptable daily intake value assigned to each substance; ‘Usage’, as measured by the three factors of number of doses, use on individual animals or for group treatment, and withdrawal period; ‘Residue Occurrence’, as measured by non-compliant samples in the National Residue Control Plan. The risk-ranking system for substances has been developed using a scoring system applied to the various parameters to give an overall score. It is a relatively simple system, designed to provide a basis for selecting the <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives that might be prioritised for residue testing. However, a number of limitations are associated with the system and this risk-ranking of substances represents only one component of a total risk-based approach to designing the residue testing programme. Other factors which should be taken into account include issues such as evidence of misuse of <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives and changes to maximum residue limits in the specifications for particular <b>veterinary</b> <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and medicated feed additives.

Information by EFSA on the progress of the research carried out on alternative methods for the detection of marine biotoxins Marine biotoxins are produced by planktonic algae and can be found in various filter-feeding bivalve molluscs such as mussels, scallops, oysters and clams. A representative of the European Food Safety Authority gave a presentation on "EFSA's risk assessments on marine biotoxins". EU limit values are established in order to avoid poisoning which is characterised by symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The EFSA has provided scientific opinions for 2 marine biotoxins: okadaic acid and analogues (OA); and azaspicacid group (AZA) 1 and established acute reference doses for these two marine biotoxins. The EFSA´s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain concluded that the mammalian bioassays have shortcomings that make them inappropriate for assessing the current EU limits. Biochemical and analytical methods have the greatest potential to replace the mammalian bioassay for the detection of OA and AZA toxins and to detect their levels below the current regulatory limit.

50|$|The EMA {{operates}} as a decentralised scientific agency (as opposed to a regulatory authority) of the European Union and its main responsibility is the protection and promotion of public and animal health, through the evaluation and supervision of medicines for human and veterinary use. More specifically, it coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorised products and national referrals, developing technical guidance and providing scientific advice to sponsors. Its scope of operations is <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> for human and veterinary use including biologics and advanced therapies, and herbal <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The agency is composed of the Secretariat (ca. 600 staff), a management board, seven scientific committees (human, <b>veterinary</b> and herbal <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> orphan drugs, paediatrics, advanced therapies and pharmacovigilance risk assessment) {{and a number of}} scientific working parties. The Secretariat is organised into five units: Directorate, Human Medicines Development and Evaluation, Patient Health Protection, Veterinary Medicines and Product Data Management, Information and Communications Technology and Administration. The Management Board provides administrative oversight to the Agency: including approval of budgets and plans, and selection of Executive Director. The Board includes one representative of each of the 28 Member States, two representatives of the European Commission, two representatives of the European Parliament, two representatives of patients' organisations, one representative of doctors' organisations and one representative of veterinarians' organisations. The Agency decentralises its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4500 experts throughout the EU. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities (NCAs) of EU Member states.|$|R
40|$|Cell-based therapies {{have been}} in use in {{veterinary}} medicine for years. However, the legal requirement of manufacturing, {{placing on the market}} and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals are not as well developed as the respective requirements of chemical pharmaceuticals. Cell-based <b>veterinary</b> pharmaceuticals are <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{in the sense of the}} pharmaceutical law of the European Union (EU). For that reason, such <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> principally require official approval for their manufacture and an official marketing authorisation for their placement on the market before being used by the veterinarian. The manufacture, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals without manufacturing approval and marketing authorisation is permitted only in certain exceptional cases determined by EU and individual Member State law. Violations of this requirement may have consequences for the respective veterinarian under criminal law and under the code of professional conduct in the respective Member State. The regular use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the scope of a therapeutic emergency as well as the import of such veterinary pharmaceuticals from non-European countries for use in the EU are currently out of the question in the EU because of a lack of legal bases. Here, we review the general legal requirement of manufacturing, placing on the market and use of cell-based veterinary pharmaceuticals within the EU and point out different implementations of EU law within the different Member States...|$|R
40|$|The Slovenian {{government}} aims {{to regulate}} prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> {{to manage and}} reduce public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> This paper aims to investigate the association between the regulated wholesale prices of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products,</b> and to estimate regression model for public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> in the non hospital consumption. In the empirical research are included 758 regulated prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> prescribed by the outpatients’ department on a prescription (Rp) during the years 2003 – 2010, which are financed from public expenditures. The correlation and regression analyses are used {{in order to establish}} the association between the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The correlation analysis confirmed a strong positive correlation of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, a weak correlation with the wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and with the classification lists of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The multiple regression analysis confirmed a positive significant impact of the wholesale price of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> and the number of Rp or the number of boxes on the Rp prescription, on the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The research has confirmed the association of the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> with the regulated wholesale prices for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> It has underlined the importance of the rational prescription and use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>products.</b> The explanatory variables included in the regression model for the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products</b> explained up to 94 % of variability in the public expenditures for <b>medicinal</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
