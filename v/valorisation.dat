25|$|Bomber and Coastal Command {{attacks against}} {{invasion}} barge concentrations in Channel ports were widely {{reported by the}} British media during September and October 1940. In {{what became known as}} 'the Battle of the Barges' RAF attacks were claimed in British propaganda to have sunk large numbers of barges, and to have created widespread chaos and disruption to German invasion preparations. Given the volume of British propaganda interest in these bomber attacks during September and earlier October, it is striking how quickly this was overlooked once the Battle of Britain had been concluded. Even by mid-war the bomber pilots' efforts had been largely eclipsed by a continuing focus on the Few, this a result of the Air Ministry's continuing <b>valorisation</b> of the ″fighter boys″, beginning with the March 1941 Battle of Britain propaganda pamphlet.|$|E

40|$|Although modern {{systems of}} mass {{education}} are typically defined in {{their opposition to}} violence, {{it has been argued}} that it is only through an insistent and critical focus upon violence that radical thought can be sustained. This article seeks to take up this challenge in relation to Walter Benjamin’s lesser-known writings on education. Benjamin retained throughout his life a deep suspicion about academic institutions and about the pedagogic, social and economic violence implicated in the idea of cultural transmission. He nonetheless remained committed to the possibility of another kind of revolutionary potential inherent to true education and, when he comes to speak of this in his Critique of Violence, it is remarkable that he describes it as manifesting an educative violence. This article argues that Benjamin’s philosophy works toward a critique of educative violence that results in a distinction between a ‘first’ and ‘second’ kind of education and asks whether destruction might have a positive role to play within pedagogical theories in contrast to current <b>valorisations</b> of creativity and productivity...|$|R
40|$|Among European {{regional}} stereotypes few {{come across}} as strongly and consistently as ‘Bavaria’. Its strength {{is derived from the}} ways in which it appears to be firmly and comprehensively grounded in its land and its people. This article traces the way in which some of the stereotype’s associated forms and images, principally those related to the domestic environment, were first conceived during the nineteenth century. The principal claim is that it was the nineteenth century artists, architects and designers in the Kunststadt Munich, who, helped by the critics, arrived at very specific <b>valorisations</b> of their designs, which could then be applied in an essentialist way to all artefacts of the region, old or new. The article divides the Munich design activities into two phases. During the 1850 s designers aimed for a poetic and ‘volkstümlich / popular’ kind of decoration of common objects, including scenes from Bavarian ‘folk’ poetry. In the second phase, during the 1870 s and 1880 s, interest turned more directly to the domestic environment of Alpine houses, valorising a plain wooden character. Clearly, an absolute belief in in a primeval and unchanging ‘Bavaria’ cannot be entertained any more. But neither should one classify it all as modern kitsch. The latter attitude must be the reason why the subject has hardly been touched on in the copious art histories of Munich so far...|$|R

Blending utopian vision and progressive gender ideology with social darwinist and eugenic rhetoric—the period's prevailing framework—the Society's view, not hereditarian, however, posed humankind's regeneration as pivoting at health education. Sidestepping issues of poverty and inequality, it took health as a personal responsibility and duty of citizenship, whereby health and happiness were attainable by all who consumed a high-fibre diet, exercised, and got ample sunshine, while using birth control and reforming men's dress. Although embracing modern science, technology, and mass media, New Health Society suggested <b>valorisation</b> of [...] "native" [...] culture, and found the bowels central to health, while constipation anchored many of civilisation's ills.

40|$|International audienceArt museums {{have for}} some years {{experienced}} {{a major shift in}} management methods. Whereas museums are often described as secular institutions, reluctant to innovation and devoted initially to the preservation of cultural heritage, they recently entered a new era where management has become critical to support their future. Emergent managerial practices have prompted a significant amount of research, most of which characterizes a new age for the large museum, the competition paradigm: these accounts frame the contemporary museum trend as being one in which globalisation, economic value creation and pressures for income building. This article argues that these accounts of museums' strategies are somehow restrictive and incomplete. It builds on a design perspective of management to give an alternative account of the historical and contemporary transformations. Museums' genealogy shows that these organisations face a shift from traditional rule-based approach to more innovative design methods, which profoundly destabilizes curatorship and traditional organisations. The paper is based on empirical evidence within a large art museum, the Louvre, which implements considerable efforts to seek this form of design-driven innovation, especially by undertaking an R&D on art display. It argues that museums are currently engaging in a creative process aimed at forging new meanings and renewing the symbolic value of their main product: exhibition and collection display; exploring new <b>valorisations</b> appears at the forefront of museum strategy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sweet {{cherries}} (Prunus avium L.) are a nutritious fruit {{which are}} rich in polyphenols and have high antioxidant potential. Most sweet cherries are consumed fresh and {{a small proportion of}} the total sweet cherries production is value added to make processed food products. Sweet cherries are highly perishable fruit with a short harvest season, therefore extensive preservation and processing methods have been developed for the extension of their shelf-life and distribution of their products. Scope and approach: In this review, the main physicochemical properties of sweet cherries, as well as bioactive components and their determination methods are described. The study emphasises the recent progress of postharvest technology, such as controlled/modified atmosphere storage, edible coatings, irradiation, and biological control agents, to maintain sweet cherries for the fresh market. <b>Valorisations</b> of second-grade sweet cherries, as well as trends for the diversification of cherry products for future studies are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Sweet cherry fruit have a short harvest period and marketing window. The major loss in quality after harvest include moisture loss, softening, decay and stem browning. Without compromising their eating quality, the extension in fruit quality and shelf-life for sweet cherries is feasible by means of combination of good handling practice and applications of appropriate postharvest technology. With the drive of health-food sector, the potential of using second class cherries including cherry stems as a source of bioactive compound extraction is high, as cherry fruit is well-known for being rich in health-promoting components...|$|R
40|$|This thesis evaluates African {{reactions}} to the 1984 - 85 Ethiopian famine and broader discourses about food, hunger, aid and agriculture through an analysis of reports, editorials and letters in the African press {{during the height of}} global concern about famine in Ethiopia. Africa's leaders blamed famine on agricultural underdevelopment {{as a consequence of the}} continent's marginality in the global economy. While these discourses revealed how food was a means by which the industrialised world maintained dominance over the developing world, they concealed how African states' political and social divides determined which groups starved and which groups continued to eat. The Ethiopian famine amplified calls for the development of large-scale, technologically-advanced farming as a means to ensure Africa's political and economic independence on one hand, and <b>valorisations</b> of "traditional" African foods on the other. Debates over the fixture of African farming were shaped by a paternalistic attitude towards rural populations, especially women, on the part of Africa's urban elites, and revealed how the production and consumption of food is productive of local and transnational political and social networks. As well as examining discourses about food, I examine how Africans responded to events such as Live Aid, which raised millions of dollars for famine relief. While scholars have criticised these events for ignoring the politics of famine, my research shows how Africans saw these events as speaking to them as political subjects in a way that official relief efforts did not...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor a {{long time}} ago {{considered}} as a region devoid of big aquifers, Brittany’s region has a piezometric network since 10 years contrary to other regions equipped since the 1970 s. Its implementation was financed by Loire-Bretagne Water Agency, BRGM, Regional Council of Brittany, and Regional Department for the environment. Since 2008, network’s supervision and follow-up is financed by ONEMA and BRGM. Brittany’s piezometric network is constituted by 52 boreholes equipped with automatic acquisition of water level and with data’s remote transmission. Among these points, 48 are settled in hard-rock aquifers (4 others follow alluviums or tertiary aquifers). Their location has been carefully cogitated, and it allows to cover main geological and hydrogeological formations existing in Brittany and takes into account weather conditions very contrasted from west to east and between coast and the inland. After check and validation, data are stored and put at the public’s disposal on the French national groundwater database called ADES. 10 years after its implementation, piezometric network’s basic data of Brittany are useful for various <b>valorisations</b> and plenty of different uses : evaluation of groundwater bodies quantitative status, bulletins of groundwater’s level situations, elaboration of indicators piezometric dedicated to the departmental management of the drinking water, contribution of groundwater to rivers flows, diagnosis of floods by water table rise, interactive dashboard…Acquired data have also allowed to better understand Brittany’s hard-rock aquifers : dynamics and slowness, cycles of data variation, memory effect, overflowing, time of water table’s drop, and blocking high levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from deindustrial to post industrial city from the 1970 s exposed how cities developed regeneration strategies as their traditional industrial base experienced terminal contraction. These strategies to re-make urban places positioned at their core an {{improvement of the}} built environment either by retaining and adapting or demolishing and replacing historic buildings. Decisions to re-use or demolish revealed the contemporary <b>valorisations</b> of the past as they mediated {{the extent to which}} the reinvention of the city embraced or denied the cumulative memories of the city. Unravelling these decisions revealed the process of urban change by exposing the management of urban regeneration, the actors and agencies involved, their motives, constraints and failings and their ability to access funding. How these actors valued, perceived, and subsequently received the cityscape was revealed by their decisions whether or not to incorporate the historic environment in their vision for the city. Moreover, how public and private agencies such as local authorities, government quangos, and entrepreneurs manipulated the existing capital stock to attract people and investment into the inner cities was a vital component of urban regeneration. Four stages of re-making places: recognising place, managing urban change, seducing urban users, and manipulating the historic environment that each exposed the contemporary valuations of the past were identified and were explored through an examination of two British and one French urban centre. By these means, and using these examples, the research located the practice of restoration and re-use in the context of place-making and value judgements to question {{the extent to which the}}re was a contemporary place for urban history.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The aim of {{this study}} is a {{conceptual}} and theoretical exploration of literary plagiarism. Chapter One traces various definitions of plagiarism and contrasts plagiarism with copyright infringement. It is argued that plagiarism is a social construct which cannot be defined solely in terms of textual features and must be contextualised. Authorial intention and reader reception {{play a key role in}} the discourse of plagiarism, since both reveal the prevailing contemporary textual ethics underlying textual production. The literature review in Chapter Two analyses the ways in which plagiarism has been interpreted in the last fifty years contrasting essentialist definitions of plagiarism with postmodern theories of plagiarism as a discourse of power. Plagiarism is contextualised within modern and postmodern aesthetics. In Chapter Three, the discourse of authorship as a stable and unified category is destabilised and challenged. What counts as plagiarism is argued to be inseparable from changing <b>valorisations</b> of authorship. Paradigms of authorship are then contrasted to illustrate how textual values change from one era to another, affecting dominant representations of authorship and plagiarism. Originality is explored as the pivotal construct on which the Romantic model of individual authorship depends - the model in which our current views of plagiarism have their origin. The plagiarist or 'nonauthor' is commonly viewed as everything the author is not: a copyist, unoriginal and immoral. Chapter Four analyses this construction of the plagiarist in the context of a South African case study in which Stephen Watson, Head of Department of English at the University of Cape Town, accused writer Antjie Krog of plagiarism. An analysis is made of the debate which ensued in a South African online journal, as well as of the press documentation surrounding the case. An interview was also conducted with Watson once the debate subsided. The conclusion reached from this study affirms that plagiarism is not an easily definable phenomenon since it depends on cultural notions that are in flux. Social, economic and technological changes also bring to bear on the literary institution, models of authorship and the consequent treatment of plagiarism. By enlarging the range of motivations for textual practices traditionally labelled as plagiarism, this thesis argues for a new conception of plagiarism, one that engages various discourse participants and contexts...|$|R

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{facilitate}} the (re) generation of integral theory and integral education theory through exploring and enacting postconventional modalities emerging from worldviews and paradigms beyond modernity and formal thought. Its quest sits in service to humanity-within-biosphere, with particular reference to education. The format involves a collection of published papers (one co-authored) cohered through an extensive introduction, interleafs, and conclusion. A generative critique of Ken Wilber’s integral theory is given, notably through a focused engagement with postformal thought. This leads to an ecology of academic fields being brought into play to help generate new types of integral thinking. Such exploration also helps develop postformal theory or postconventional poetics. In addition to postformal thought, fields include complexity theory, critical theory, ecosophy, futures studies, hermeneutics, poetics and poststructuralism. Each variously contributes to the postconventional ensemble which is cohered through creative transdisciplinarity: complexity theory supports an emergent research process and a partly decentralised format; critical theory emphasises {{the contrast between the}} modern-formal developmental level and that beyond; Guattari’s ecosophy complexly integrates biospherical, social and conceptual domains; futures studies complements historical awareness regarding temporal contextualisation; hermeneutics foregrounds construct-awareness; poetics enables an enactment of the metaphor “text as music”; whilst poststructuralism precipitates a deterritorialisation and “dialecticisation” of integral theory in addition to a querying of certain textual conventions. Contexts of integral studies and integral education are addressed, both theoretically through Ernest Boyer’s scholarship of integration, and historically through the identification of a Western genealogy including Classical, Hermetic, Neoplatonic, Renaissance, Humanist and Reconstructive Postmodern moments. Additionally, planetary consciousness is effected through Native American, Islamic and counter-hegemonic perspectives. Critiques include address of modernistic “economies of truth” including economism, technicism and atomism, Wilber’s orientation toward Green thinking, Richard Slaughter’s perspective on Causal Layered Analysis, and Wilberian integral education theory. <b>Valorisations</b> are given to “complexities of truth” including archetypes, “eco-logics,” holarchies, “nanotextology,” open systems, spiritual orientations, and vision-logic. Cross-level education is addressed in relation to content (knowledge, curricula), occasion (identities, pedagogy) and system; for each, a critical contrast is identified between approaches and interpretations following a modern atomistic template and those arising from more integrative sensibilities with respect to complexities of identity, peer relationalities and contextusalisations. The study contributes to numerous discourses including integral studies, postconventional studies, philosophy of education, critical education, ecology, futures studies, and transdisciplinarity entailing the meta-dialogue between art and science. Framed as an ethical “conceptual concerto,” this creative academic artefact offers “passion for the possible. ...|$|R
