40|$|Variable {{inlet guide}} vane (IGV) is used to control the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. The efficient operation of IGV {{is limited to the}} range of aerodynamic characteristics of their vane profiles. In order to find out the best <b>vane</b> <b>profile</b> for IGV regulation, the modern optimization method was adopted to optimize the inlet guide <b>vane</b> <b>profile.</b> The main methodology idea was to use artificial neural network for continuous fitness evaluation and use genetic algorithm for global optimization. After optimization, the regulating performance of IGV has improved significantly, the prewhirl ability has been enhanced greatly, and the pressure loss has been reduced. The mass flow and power of compressor reduced by using the optimized guide vane at large setting angles, and the efficiency increased significantly; the flow field distribution has been improved obviously, since the nonuniform distribution of flow and flow separation phenomenon greatly weakened or even completely disappeared. The achievement of this research can effectively improve the regulation ability of IGV and the performance of compressor...|$|E

These modern manufacturing techniques make it possible to work boiler feed pump impellers and diffusers out of a single forging block, complete with front shroud. The manufacturing process begins with numeric simulation and profile optimization directly on the screen; the hydraulic engineer then transmits the 3 D data online to the manufacturing engineer; and the vane channel is divided into several segments so that the impeller/diffuser can be manufactured from the solid blank.

Fan peripheral velocity was 47 m/s. Air volume flow rate was changed by turning of rear part of the inlet guide vanes. At turning of 20 deg the flow was separated on the IGV profiles. The synthetic jets were introduced through radial holes in machine casing in the location before flow separation origin. Synthetic jet actuator was designed {{with the use of}} a speaker by UT AVCR. Its membrane had diameter of 63 mm. Excitation frequency was chosen in the range of 500 Hz – 700 Hz. Synthetic jets favourably influenced separated flow on the <b>vane</b> <b>profiles</b> in the distance of (5 – 12) mm from the casing surface.

These changes show that their contribution on stageefficiency is rather minor, while they have a huge reduction on blade loadings. Moreover, it is shown that the shorter radial distance of vaneless space does not necessarilymean an increased loading thanks to the eliminating in-phase fluctuations on pressureand suction sides. It is found that the impeller reacts to the upstream static pressure disturbance, whichis caused by the applied geometry change and its resultant flow field in the wedge diffuser, but not to the radial location of a certain profile. In addition, the results indicatethat the wedge diffuser aerodynamic performance is driven by time-averaged flow fieldbehaviour...|$|R

By equipping such return vane with the swirl stop set from the trailing edge to the main shaft position, the unstable head characteristics can be also suppressed successfully at the lower discharge.

Prior to the replacement of these vanes, small-scale, two-dimensional tests were conducted to assess the aerodynamic performance of the original, 1930 's technology vane geometry and a new vane geometry which was developed using a modern cascade design code.

In the Jhimruk power plant the sediment load makes it necessary to repair the system once a year, and the power plant is shut down if the concentration of sediments is exceeding 3000 ppm. Several different measures have been tried to minimize the wear on the system. This Master thesis describes the theoretical definition of erosion and examines both designs and materials affecting erosion. The work is based on earlier work and strive for better design of Jhimruk power plant. The main objective of the thesis is to define different guide vane designs that affect and reduce sediment erosion in a Francis turbine. The work is carried out using several NACA designs for the guide vanes and implementing sediments in the flow to simulate sediment erosion. The assignment include utilization of several programs, including the Matlab-based design tool Khoj, the meshing tools Ansys Turbogrid and Ansys ICEM, and the CFD calculation tool Ansys CFX. The simulations in Ansys CFX are done using the Tabakoff erosion model. The erosion on the reference parts show similar tendencies as previous work, while the new designs in general show heighten erosion tendency. The simulations show in general the same tendency for the reference runner and the optimal runner. The results produced in this thesis show the difference in sediment erosion handling by different guide <b>vane</b> <b>profiles,</b> affecting the pressure distribution along the guide vanes and thus disrupting the inlet conditions on the runner. In this thesis the implementation of NACA 2412 enhancing the pressure difference across the guide vane shows the best effect of erosion reduction, while the design changes equalizing this pressure difference generally show an increased erosion tendency along the runner. The results are thus opposite of the expected results. The implementation of the optimal runner design show that the use of NACA 4412 with pressure difference enhancing effect reduces the erosion maximum for the design changes. </p...|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{interface}} of combustor and high-pressure turbine of power generation gas turbines with individual can combustors. More specifically the thesis presents the development and aerothermal investigation of the integrated combustor vane concept. In this novel concept, first introduced in 2010, the conventional nozzle guide vanes (NGVs) are removed and flow turning is achieved by vanes that extend the combustor walls. The concept was developed using the inhouse CFD code TBLOCK. Aerothermal experiments were conducted using the Oxford combustor-turbine high-speed research facility. The linear cascade is comprised of two can combustor transition ducts and either four conventional vanes (CVs) or two integrated vanes (IVs). The experimental study validates the linear numerical simulations of the integrated vane development. Annular full stage simulations, used to evaluate aerodynamics and stage efficiency, confirm the trends of the linear numerical and experimental results and thus demonstrate the concept's potential for real gas turbine applications. Results show a reduction of the total pressure loss coefficient at the exit of the stator vanes by more than 25 % due {{to a reduction in}} profile and endwall loss. Combined with an improved rotor performance demonstrated by unsteady stage simulations, these aerodynamic benefits result in a gain in stage efficiency of 1. 5 %. A distinct reduction in HTC levels on vane surfaces and endwalls on the order of 40 %- 50 % is observed. This is attributed to the transferral of the combustor wall's boundary layer onto the integrated vane and to the removal of the horse-shoe vortex system. Furthermore it is shown that engine-realistic combustor flow with swirl leads to a slight, non-detrimental shift in the heat transfer coefficient distributions and to a less homogenous turning distribution downstream of the integrated <b>vanes.</b> Three-dimensional <b>vane</b> <b>profiling</b> is suitable to modify the downstream turning and thus counteract the increased losses downstream of the two-dimensional integrated vanes incurred by the combustor's swirl. The experimental and numerical investigation of the newly developed integrated vane's endwall and leading edge cooling geometries shows a superior surface coverage of cooling effectiveness, and the cooling requirements for the first vane are expected to be halved. Moreover, by halving the number of vanes, simplifying the design and eliminating the need for vane leading edge film cooling, manufacturing and development costs can be significantly reduced. </p...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experimental}} {{study is to}} examine the influence of trailing-edge coolant ejec-tion with the span-wise inclination on the aerodynamic loss of turbine nozzle guide vanes. This study uses a cascade of five vanes located in the test section of a low-speed wind tun-nel. The <b>vanes</b> have the <b>profile</b> of high-pressure nozzle guide vanes, and the central vane is equipped with the internal cooling and the trailing-edge coolant ejection. The coolant is ejected through trailing-edge slots that are inclined in the span-wise direction at angles varying from 0 deg to 45 deg in 15 deg increments. The results indicate an opti-mum ejection rate, at which the aerodynamic loss is minimum. There is a little variation in loss as the span-wise inclination is varied when the ratio of coolant to mainstream gas mass flow rate is less than 1. 5 %. For higher coolant flow rates, however, the loss increases with increases in the span-wise ejection angle. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4006663...|$|R

40|$|Variable {{inlet guide}} vane (VIGV) is used to control the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. Due to the tip clearance of the guide vanes and the defect of the traditional guide vane profiles, the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas. Two kinds of inlet flow channels were proposed to eliminate the influence of tip clearance. These structures were numerically investigated at different setting angles.

The Changi East reclamation project is a mega project that involves creation of land space as large as 3, 000 hectares in multiple phases between 1991 and 2005. Ground investigation plays {{a critical role in}} the Changi project which involved substantial amount of ground improvement works after reclamation by sand filling. One important aspect of the investigation was to evaluate the geotechnical characteristics of the underlying compressible soils beneath the original seabed for the selection of suitable methods of ground improvement. The other important aspect of the investigation was to characterize and verify the compactness of the reclaimed sand fill. Many types of in situ tests were extensively used in the project. The field vane shear test provides correlations between the undrained shear strength and depth for the upper and the lower marine clay strata in the Northern part and the Southern Part of the reclaimed site.

40|$|The need {{to design}} high {{performance}} of a cooled gas turbine is considered with emphasis made on coupled aerodynamic and heat transfer optimization of the vane, blade, and single stage cooled gas turbine by using a multiobjective optimization method. The aerodynamic profile is designed to have three sections and the cooling structure to consist of a serpentine passage, with a tail transverse channel and trailing edge slots. The optimization platform is built up in an in-house code using a cooling structure parametric method based on MATLAB, as well as automatic grid generation methods, a blade profile parametric program in FORTRAN, the soft ware ISIGHT and ANSYS-CFX. The optimization platform evaluates the aerodynamic effects through the aerodynamic efficiency and presents the cooling effect by the high-temperature coefficient.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} unsteady flow at the inlet of the runner in a Francis turbine. The main goal has been to find {{a connection between the}} design of the wicket gate and the dynamic load on the runner due to rotor stator interaction. The working hypothesis has been based on the theory that correct profiling of the wicket gate can make the pressure distribution at the inlet of the runner more uniform, and hence, reduce the dynamic load on the runner. Velocity measurements by means of Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) have been carried out in a cascade rig with different wicket gate profiling. Also, the pressure around the surface of one wicket gate has been measured. CFD calculations, validated with the LDA-measurements, have been used to calculate the pressure distribution at the inlet of the runner with different profiling of the wicket gate and the corresponding load on the runner. The LDA measurements have shown that the wake in a turbine cascade follows the classic wake theory fairly well. The wakes tends to mix out faster than according to the wake theory, due to the accelerated flow field. The CFD results deviate somewhat from the LDA measurements, but have shown good agreement with relative changes in the geometry. The 2 D CFD calculations under-estimates the depth of the wake with ca 25 % while with 3 D calculations the deviation is about 10 %, which has been considered to be good agreement. Due to this consideration, it has been found trustworthy to use CFD to compare pressure distribution with different profiling of the wicket gate. The results show that by profiling the guide vanes asymmetric with the ’flat’ side pointing toward the runner, the pressure distribution becomes more uniform. This is also shown by the pressure measurements around the guide <b>vane</b> <b>profile.</b> A simplified CFD-calculation of guide vane/runner interaction has shown that a more uniform pressure distribution at the inlet of the runner will reduce the dynamic load variation on the runner blade without increasing the losses in the flow.
