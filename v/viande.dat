Hume, of course, the urbane, cheerful, gentlemanly, letter-writing eighteenth century, full of attraction, and much that I don't yet know as to his work. Burns, the sentimental side that there is in most Scotsmen, his poor troubled existence, how far his poems were his personally, and how far national, the question of the framework of society in Scotland, and its fatal effect upon the finest natures. Scott again, the ever delightful man, sane, courageous, admirable; the birth of Romance, in a dawn that was a sunset; snobbery, conservatism, the wrong thread in History, and notably in that of his own land.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is simple, yet complex: to provide a {{systematic}} analysis of Balzac's references to the visual arts, {{not only in the}} Comédie Humanine but in the apprentice novels and miscellaneous writings. In the words of this year's Année Balzacienne, it sets out to be a "bilan d'influences et d'allusions picturales", and as such is the first recent project in this field. It is a simple project in that it largely confines itself to the presence, in Balzac's work, of identifiable visual refences. It is complex in that there are many thousands of such refences, sometimes moulding and inspiring the creation of character or setting, sometimes merely serving as objects in the novels (a painting, a porcelain vase or a buhl sideboard), sometimes - but less often present in a didactic manner; moreover, the Comédie Humaine itself {{is in a state of}} constant evolution, as when (for instance) a Joseph Bridau is substituted for a Delacroix, or a Watteau fan for a pearwood crucifix carved by Giradon; and to add still further to the complexity, the territory of this exploration includes not only the visual indebtedness but equally Balzac's personal involvement with painting, sculpture, architecture, furnishing and engraving - together with a brief analysis of his fictional artists. Much has been written already about the theoretical aspects of Balzac's concern with painting, sculpture and engraving. This detailed account of the visual sources will, it is hoped, assist later theoretical discussions. Yet such is the range of the novelist's interest that even this account must be selective. In the chronological outline of Balzac's interest in the visual arts, it is stressed that even as a youth he had ample opportunity to study many of what were then considered the finest masterpieces in European painting. Until 1816 pictures confiscated from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands were held at the Louvre — in addition to that gallery's "indigenous" collection. There were also his visits to foreign collections: Vienna, Munich, Venice, Florence, Milan, St Petersburg, Berlin, Dresden, The Hague, Amsterdam, Rome. Almost equally important were his actual contacts with painters such as Delacroix and Boulanger, the failed painter Gautier, and the sculptor Théophile Bra. Despite Bazlac's indebtedness to Girodet's "Endymion", Delacroix's colourful treatment of the Faust theme, and his special debts to Sigalon and Delorme, much the greater debt to contemporary French art is to caricature, which influenced him in the choice of certain types of subject-matter. Many of his early serial publications - L'Usurier for example — are transpositions into words of visual image popularised by Gavarni and Monnier. The same interest in caricature accounts for the part played in the Comédie Humaine only in the novels - by dandies, lorettes, grisettes and the stock figure of the crass bourgeois. In traditional French painting Balzac appreciated the Rococo style at a time when it had only recently begun to be fashionable again. Amongst Dutch, Flemish and German painters, he disparaged Rubens for his "montagnes de <b>viandes</b> flamandes, saupoudrées de vermillon"; he almost equated Rembrandt with the genre painters in his admiration for "les vieillards que le pinceau de Van Ostade, de Rembrandt, de Miéris, de Gérard Dow a tant caressés"; from Flemish painting he derived both Porbus and a mythical artist, Frenhofer, to whom yet another Flemish artist, Mabuse, supposedly transmitted the ultimate secrtes of his art. In Italian painting Raphael was the outstanding personality, both to Balzac and most of his contemporaries; in the Comédie Humaine he is usually associated with angelie and etherial virtue; its radiantly pure virgins are modelled upon Raphael's Madonnas, but so too are some of its loveliest courtesans. Balzac almost certainly saw the "Apollo Belvedere", the "Antinott", the "Venus de' Medici" and other masterpieces of Classical sculpture during their confiscation in France; such statues inspire many fictional portraits. The portrait of Camille Maupin reflects a topical interest in Egyptology. Of the sculptors of his own time Balzac found Canova and Thorwaldsen the most congenial, neo-Classicism being more suited to sculpture than to painting. In architecture he undoubtedly failed to respond to much that is great and imaginative. Like Stendahl, he was indifferent to the Baroque style, even the Baroque architecture of Paris. What most elated him in erchitecturw was the vastness of such buildings as Bourges Cathedral. In Balzac's treatment of furnishings and settings, modern furniture is made into a symbol of parvanu vulgarity. Furnishings and settings of many historical epochs are presented in the novels, from the early fourteenth century to the First Empire. Of all these Balzac infinitely preferred the Louis XV style: again, he was a forerunner in the revival of interest in the eighteenth century. Engravings are not an aspect of the visual arts in which Balzac appreciated the best. The only great engravers to have exerted any marked influence upon the Comédie Humnaine are Callot and Delacroix: Callot in his inspiration of La Frélore, and Delcroix in that he helped to popularise the Faust theme. Painters, sculptors, writers — even natural scientists — are all artists, In Balzac's definition of the term; and the primary loyalty of all is to their own art. Balzac does not share the Romantic notion of the artist's role as Philosopher King. As in the cases of Claës and Poussin, art can give rise to heartrending conflicts of loyalty, but all true artists resolve such conflicts to the advantage of their art. Other qalities of the true artist are spontaneity and ingenousness, qualities that would debar him from the political mission of a Lamartine or Hugo. Sarrasine, La maison du Chat-qui- Pelote and Le Chef-d'oeuvre all emphasize that the artist's dedication and naiveté lead to a discordance with reality - an idea essentially derived from Hoffmann. In the main, Balzac's artists fail to achive worldly success. Grassou, who does achieve it, is a second-rate ddauber. But he pleases the wealthy middle class, whereas Joseph Bridau, the true artist, disgruntles them. Joseph is totally worsted in his conflict with Flore Brazier and Max Gilet; though eventually he becomes wealthy, it is only through an irony of fate. Artistic success in the Comédie Humaine isn dearly and bitterly won, but money is a stimulus to creative effort — as is an understanding woman. As Steinbeck's career reveals, the greatest danger threatening any artist is failure through sheer lack of application. But hardly less serious a danger is to theorize, rather than experiment brush in hand. Indeed, an artist's indolence often arises from the much greater difficulty of executing works of art than conceiving them. Excessive theorizing leads Frenhofer to the opposite pitfall, a constant process of retouching, an obsessive desire for an impossible perfection. Yet despite his tragic slowness in production Frenhofer may have been the pioneer of abtstract art — whose still greater tragedy lay in his own destruction of his work. </p...|$|R

The artefacts, which include previously unpublished material, are examined together with evidence for animal breeding and hunting, {{with a view to}} considering the whole range of resources provided by animals, be they real or symbolic. As a result of this analysis, it is suggested here that while domestication {{is an integral part of}} society, hunting is transferred from the material to the ideological sphere. Use of resources from domestic animals becomes so important in economic terms that its impact can be seen in settlement architecture. At the same time, hunting becomes a socially valued and emblematic factor which eventually influences and transforms burial practices and probably also the underlying social structure. This phenomenum occurs over a wide area of western and central Europe and is undoubtedly an important factor in the development of the Neolithic. A fresh insight into the neolithisation process is thus offered, integrating different and previously unexploited data. The transfer of hunting from the real to the symbolic sphere is interpreted as resulting from the interaction of two entirely different cultural entities. To put it simply, one is a hunting culture with Mesolithic origins and the other an animal husbandry culture belonging to Neolithic settlers. Yet the situation is far more complex because Mesolithic people could have herded and Neolithic people actually did hunt. The interpretation proposed here is based to a large extent on evidence for changes in hunting practices, involving «‑specialized‑» hunting of red deer, an animal which was accorded a special status. It is suggested, as a working hypothesis, that the two cultural entities could have lived side by side with little métissage in Linear Pottery villages throughout the duration of this culture. They would have lived in houses of different sizes and each would have had specific meat diets. In fact the slight differences that are not easily detectable in the archaeological record reflect profound differences in food customs and way of life, which maintained a strong and long-lasting separation between these two contrasting entities. This cohabitation with almost no intermixing was replaced by a first episode of fusion towards the end of the Linear Pottery which reduced the vivacity of the Mesolithic component, while at the same time contributing to the downfall of the Linear Pottery Culture. True cultural or even «‑ethnic‑» métissage occurred and this altered Neolithic social and economic organization through the appropriation of certain hunter-gatherer values. From then on there followed cyclic episodes of fusion between the two kinds of culture, linked to the spatial expansion of the Neolithic, right up to its final stages. The origins of the «‑chalcolithisation‑» process may lie in one of the last, or perhaps the very last of these episodes. Mots-clés.

European Neolithic, bone industry, bone ornaments, bone antler, teeth, use of tools, symbolic traits. Résumé. Nous proposons ici une étude des objets élaborés avec les matières osseuses. Cette étude est placée dans la perspective de la dynamique évolutive et culturelle générale du Néolithique du VI e au IV e millénaire avant J. -C. en Europe tempérée. L'examen de mobiliers osseux inédits, provenant d'habitats et de sépultures, combiné aux données de l'élevage et de la chasse, tente de cerner l'ensemble des ressources, matérielles comme idéelles, que l'exploitation animale fournit entre le Rubané, le Michelsberg et le Chasséen. Une fois structuré, cet ensemble de données conduit à observer un transfert de la sphère matérielle à l'idéel concernant la chasse, et ce à mesure que la société s'enracine dans la domestication. Autrement dit, l'économie se renforce dans l'exploitation des ressources animales domestiques de manière assez forte pour influencer l'architecture de l'habitat-; c'est du moins l'idée que défend cet article. En parallèle, la chasse devient un facteur emblématique et socialement valorisant qui, à son tour, influence les pratiques funéraires et, vraisemblablement aussi, ébranle les fondements de la structure sociale qui avait cours jusqu'alors. Ce transfert, qui se produit sur un vaste territoire, de l'ouest européen jusqu'aux confins de l'Europe centrale, possède indéniablement une certaine prégnance dans l'évolution du Néolithique de cette aire. Son origine sociologique paraît s'imposer, offrant matière à réviser le processus de la néolithisation grâce à des arguments tout à fait différents de ceux qui sont habituellement considérés pour ce sujet. Le recyclage de la pratique concrète de la chasse vers l'idéel est interprété comme le résultat de l'interaction de deux entités culturelles bien dissociées. En schématisant, l'une, ayant la culture de la chasse, serait d'origine mésolithique-; l'autre, ayant la culture des animaux domestiques, serait originaire des colons néolithiques. La situation est en fait bien plus compliquée car les «-Mésolithiques-» pratiqueraient l'élevage tandis que les «-Néolithiques-» chassent. L'interprétation proposée est fondée sur l'évolution de la pratique cynégétique et une certaine «-spécialisation-» de celle-ci sur une espèce donnée, le cerf, auquel est conféré un statut très particulier. Considérant ce nouvel argument, on aboutit à penser qu'une période de cohabitation sans mélange (ou très peu) entre les deux entités sociales serait possible tout au long du Rubané et au sein des villages de cette culture. Les deux entités en présence se manifesteraient en habitant des maisons de tailles différentes et en mangeant des <b>viandes</b> spécifiques. Ces différences, très subtiles sur le plan matériel et difficiles à détecter, masquent en fait des pratiques alimentaires et des habitus profondément différents, qui maintiennent une distinction sociale forte entre elles. La cohabitation presque sans mélange de ces deux entités sociales au cours du Rubané pourrait laisser la place à un premier épisode de fusion à la fin de cette culture-; cette hypothèse explicite la fin du Rubané qui est en même temps la fin de la vivacité de la composante mésolithique déjà intégrée dans les villages de cette culture. Un vrai mélange culturel sinon «-ethnique-» pourrait se produire ensuite au sein d'une organisation et d'une structure économique dans la logique du Néolithique tandis qu'il s'approprie certaines des valeurs sociales des chasseurs-cueilleurs. À partir de là, des épisodes de fusion cycliques entre ces deux cultures se succéderaient, liés à l'expansion territoriale du Néolithique. Ce phénomène possède encore vraisemblablement une suite jusque dans les dernières étapes du Néolithique. Le dernier de ces épisodes, ou parmi les derniers, pourrait être une des origines du processus de «-chalcolithisation-». Abstract.
