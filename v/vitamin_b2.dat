25|$|Vitamin B was {{originally}} {{considered to have}} two components, a heat-labile vitamin B1 and a heat-stable <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2.</b> In the 1920s, <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> {{was thought to be}} the factor necessary for preventing pellagra. In 1923, Paul Gyorgy in Heidelberg was investigating egg-white injury in rats; the curative factor for this condition was called vitamin H (which is now called biotin or vitamin B7). Since both pellagra and vitamin H deficiency were associated with dermatitis, Gyorgy decided to test the effect of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> on vitamin H deficiency in rats. He enlisted the service of Wagner-Jauregg in Kuhn’s laboratory. In 1933, Kuhn, Gyorgy, and Wagner found that thiamin-free extracts of yeast, liver, or rice bran prevented the growth failure of rats fed a thiamin-supplemented diet.|$|E

25|$|In other {{countries}} such as the Netherlands and Denmark, even with sufficient intake of niacin, cases have been reported. In this case deficiency might happen {{not just because of}} poverty or malnutrition but secondary to alcoholism, drug interaction (psychotropic, cytostatic, tuberclostatic or analgesics), HIV, <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> and B6 deficiency, or malabsorption syndromes such as Hartnup and carcinoid.|$|E
25|$|Severe niacin {{deficiency}} typically {{manifests itself}} as the disease pellagra. Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> and B6, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency. An excess of leucine, an essential amino acid, in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency.|$|E

They are added back to the semolina flour once it is ground. Vitamins added include niacin (Vitamin B3), riboflavin (<b>Vitamin</b> <b>B2),</b> folic acid (Vitamin B9) and thiamine (Vitamin B1), added back {{in the form of}} thiamin mononitrate.

25|$|Milk {{is not an}} {{important}} source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.. However, milk is considered {{an important}} source of vitamin A, and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses revealed that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk also is not {{an important source of}} these vitamins. However, we did find a significant decrease in <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> concentrations after pasteurization. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization {{does not appear to be}} a concern in diminishing the nutritive value of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2,</b> so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2.</b> Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E
25|$|Further, the {{researchers}} {{noted that a}} yellow-green fluorescence in each extract promoted rat growth, and that the intensity of fluorescence was proportional to the effect on growth. This observation enabled them to develop a rapid chemical and bioassay to isolate the factor from egg white in 1933, they called it Ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the same preparation (a growth-promoting compound with yellow-green fluorescence) from whey using the same procedure (lactoflavin). In 1934 Kuhn’s group identified the structure of so-called flavin and synthesized <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2.</b>|$|E

25|$|FAD plays a {{major role}} as an enzyme {{cofactor}} along with flavin mononucleotide, another molecule originating from riboflavin. Bacteria, fungi and plants can produce riboflavin, but other eukaryotes, such as humans, have lost the ability to make it. Therefore, humans must obtain riboflavin, also known as <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2,</b> from dietary sources. Riboflavin is generally absorbed in the small intestine and then transported to cells via carrier proteins. Riboflavin kinase (EC 2.7.1.26) adds a phosphate group to riboflavin to produce flavin mononucleotide, and then FAD synthetase attaches an adenine nucleotide; both steps require ATP. Bacteria generally have one bi-functional enzyme, but archaea and eukaryotes usually employ two distinct enzymes. Current research indicates that distinct isoforms exist in the cytosol and mitochondria. It seems that FAD is synthesized in both locations and potentially transported where needed.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{concentrations}} of vitamins in bovine milk samples can differ significantly {{as a result}} of a number of factors, including cow breed, season, country, vitamin concentrations in feed, and frequency of milkings. However, changes resulting from pasteurization are likely dependent on the time and temperature of pasteurization conditions. Meta-regression was used to assess the roles of time and temperature in between-study heterogeneity. The duration of pasteurization was positively correlated with folate concentrations, and a direct inverse relationship was found between pasteurization temperature and vitamin C concentrations. Multivariate analysis of time and temperature revealed a significant negative correlation between these variables and <b>vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> concentrations. These results indicate a likely relationship between time, temperature, and vitamin concentrations in milk; however, further research is needed to tease apart these effects because they appear to differ by vitamin.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. Geographic tongue does not usually cause any symptoms, {{and in those}} cases where there are symptoms, an oral parafunctional habit may be a {{contributory}} factor. Persons with parafunctional habits related to the tongue may show scalloping {{on the sides of}} the tongue (crenated tongue). Some suggest that hormonal factors may be involved, because one reported case in a female appeared to vary in severity in correlation with oral contraceptive use. People with geographic tongue frequently claim that their condition worsens during periods of psychologic stress. Geographic tongue is inversely associated with smoking and tobacco use. Sometimes geographic tongue is said to run in families, and it is reported to be associated with several different genes, though studies show family association may also be caused by similar diets. Some have reported links with various human leukocyte antigens, such as increased incidence of HLA-DR5, HLA-DRW6 and HLA-Cw6 and decreased incidence in HLA-B51. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>B2</b> deficiency (ariboflavinosis) can cause several signs in the mouth, possibly including geographic tongue, although other sources state that geographic tongue is not related to nutritional deficiency. Fissured tongue often occurs simultaneously with geographic tongue, and some consider fissured tongue to be an end stage of geographic tongue.|$|E
