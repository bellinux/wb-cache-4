40|$|Fugitive dust {{emissions}} from the storage and handling of mine tailings presents environmental and safety concerns, {{which must be}} addressed to promote the land sustainability and {{the health and safety}} of individuals around a tailings storage facility (TSF). The investigated dust control methods were agglomeration, binder slurry injection, and topical spray. The Dust Busters determined that pelletizing was the most practical method of agglomeration. In order to produce durable pellets from the mine tailings, which consist primarily of silica, a binder must be added. A variety of binders were considered including magnesium and calcium chloride, bentonite, barite, cement, vinyl polymers, acrylic polymers, starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, and a commercial lignosulfonate/bitumen blend. Portland cement proved to be the most effective binder in regards to the pellet’s cost, structural integrity, and longevity. However, due to the abrasive nature of the tailings, pelletizing is not cost effective in comparison to other dust suppression techniques. Binder slurry injection incorporates a pugmill mixer to inject a binding agent into the tailings slurry. Addition of a binder allows the slurry mixture to form a rigid crust that prevents fugitive dust once dried on the existing tailings dam. While the injected slurry is effective at minimizing {{dust emissions}}, it is not economically feasible due to high capital costs. The most effective, environmentally safe, and economically feasible solution to reduce the dust associated with tailings storage facilities is a topical spray solution consisting of a <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer.</b> The <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer,</b> at relatively low concentrations, produces a robust yet permeable crust along the surface of the tailings, which is unmatched in comparison to the other binding agents. By applying the binder as topical solution rather than injecting the binder into the slurry, the capital cost for effective dust suppression is reduced by eliminating the additional process equipment required for both pelletizing and binder slurry injection. Treating 400 acres per year with a <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer</b> application costs $ 110, 000. Existing equipment and personnel are adequate to change from the current magnesium chloride treatment to a <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer</b> treatment. Current yearly treatments using the magnesium chloride cost approximately $ 240, 000 -$ 720, 000 assuming 1 - 3 applications per year across the 400 acre area; thus changing to a <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer</b> treatment will save $ 130, 000 -$ 390, 000 per year...|$|E
40|$|A {{versatile}} synthetic {{strategy has}} been developed which enables the facile incorporation of cleavable functional groups, i. e., esters, thioesters, and disulfides, into the carbon−carbon backbone of vinyl-based polymers. Through the synthesis of novel cyclic monomers, RAFT-mediated radical ring-opening copolymerizations with traditional vinyl monomers such as methyl methacrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, and 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate lead {{to the introduction of}} controlled degradability into these widely used <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer</b> systems. An additional benefit of this strategy is the inherent versatility available through the incorporation of cyclic monomers containing diverse functional groups such as esters, thioesters, disulfides, and silyl ether units that allow degradation under basic/acidic, reductive, or enzymatic conditions. By integrating multiple, orthogonal cyclic monomers into linear copolymer backbones, well-defined systems with programmable degradation profiles are obtained which allows for tunable, selective, and stepwise degradation of the vinyl polymer backbones...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the behaviour of waterglass- or NaOH-activated slag mortars after carbonation. The {{effect of a}} superplasticizer based on <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer</b> and shrinkage reducing polypropylenglycol derivative admixtures on that process was also examined. The same tests were run on cement mortars for reference purposes. The mortars were carbonated in a chamber ensuring CO 2 saturation for four and eight months, after which ages the samples were tested for mechanical strength; mercury porosimetry and mineralogical (XRD, FTIR) and microstructural characterization (SEM/EDX) were also conducted. The results obtained indicate that alkali-activated slag mortars were more intensely and deeply carbonated than Portland cement mortars. Carbonation took place directly on the gel, causing decalcification. When waterglass was the alkaline activator used, carbonation caused a loss of cohesion in the matrix and an important increase in porosity and decrease in mechanical strength. When a NaOH solution {{was used as the}} alkali activator, carbonation enhanced mortar compaction and increased mechanical strength. Finally, in waterglass-activated slag mortars, the inclusion of organic admixtures had no effect either on their behaviour after carbonation or the nature of the reaction products.

40|$|Alkali-activated slag (AAS) binders are {{obtained}} by a manufacturing process less energy-intensive than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and involves lower greenhouse gasses emission. These alkaline cements allow {{the production of}} high mechanical strength and durable concretes. In the present work, the adsorption of different superplasticizer admixtures (naphthalene-based, melamine-based and a <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer)</b> on the slag particles in AAS pastes using alkaline solutions with different pH values have been studied in detail. The effect of the superplasticizers on the yield stress and plastic viscosity of the AAS and OPC pastes have been also evaluated. The results obtained allowed us {{to conclude that the}} adsorption of the superplasticizers on AAS pastes is independent of the pH of the alkaline solutions used and lower than on OPC pastes. However, the effect of the admixtures on the rheological parameters depends directly on the type and dosage of the superplasticizer {{as well as of the}} binder used and, in the case of the AAS, on the pH of the alkaline activator solution. In 11. 7 -pH NaOH-AAS pastes the dosages of the superplasticizers required to attain similar reduction in the yield stress are ten-fold lower than for Portland cement. In this case the superplasticizers studied show a fluidizing effect considerably higher in 11. 7 -pH NaOH-AAS pastes than in OPC pastes. In 13. 6 -pH NaOH-AAS pastes, the only admixture observed to affect the rheological parameters is the naphthalene-based admixture due to its higher chemical stability in such extremely alkaline media.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Stabilizers for polymerization of water-soluble high-molecular vinyl monomers contain water-soluble branched chain copolymer(s) (I) of: (a) cationic vinyl monomer(s) (II) selected from diallyldimethyl- ammonium chloride (IIA), vinylpyridinium chloride (IIB) and N-vinylimidazolinium chloride (IIC) or omega -(trimethylammonium) - (hydroxy) alkyl (meth) acrylate or -(meth) acrylamide halides and methosulfates of formula (IID); and (b) amphiphilic, monoallyl-end-functionalized block copolyether(s) (III) with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains and hydrophobic polybutylene glycol (PBG) chains.

An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included {{for the production}} of high-solid dispersions of water-soluble cationic high-molecular vinyl copolymers. USE - Cationic vinyl polymers, especially copolymers of cationic vinyl compounds with acrylamide, are widely used in separation processes for water treatment and waste liquor purification, in the paper, coal and ore industries or in petroleum recovery for flocculation, retention or dewatering. ADVANTAGE - Existing process for producing polymers of this type have various drawbacks, e. g. give polymers forming very viscous systems at concentrations below 10 wt. %, a product in 1 : 2 ratio with a hardly degradable oil phase, a product with bimodal molecular weight distribution of very limited use or a polymer unsuitable for separation technology. The present process gives a high-solid dispersion of water-soluble cationic high-molecular <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer</b> and avoids these drawbacks. The viscosity during production and use is much lower than usual and nearly constant. The final dispersion has low viscosity and excellent storage stability.

30|$|Concrete {{materials}} are in general very durable. However, an aggressive environment can cause deterioration and total collapses of concrete structures {{long before they}} have reached the designed end of life. Sulphate environment {{represents one of the}} aggressors with significant influence on the durability of concrete. A special type of sulphate deterioration of concrete materials is biocorrosion—the process caused by presence and activities of microorganisms producing sulphuric acid. Studies of the biological processes behind the corrosion of wastewater infrastructure with reference to the role of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulphur-oxidising bacteria (SOB), studies of the chemical effects of sulphates and sulphuric acid on concrete mixes as well as laboratory research methodologies were studied in [1]. Initiating the bacterial processes, sulphates present in the sewer system are converted into the sulphides by sulphate-reducing bacteria such as Desulfovibrio spp. The biofilms with SRB in pipelines with intense corrosion had lower cell numbers but much higher total hydrogenase activity [2]. In the study [3], various mechanisms proposed for SRB-induced corrosion such as biocatalytic cathodic sulphate reduction (BCSR); three stages mechanism (Romero mechanism) or sulphide and hydrogen-induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC) were investigated. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that the concentration of Acidithiobacillusthiooxidans (A. thiooxidans) in concrete surface layer may be the best indicator of its biodeterioration intensity [4]. Dubravka et al. [5] has presented a review on microbial processes in municipal waste water collection system, which occur when concrete is exposed to microbacterial and biodegradation favourable environment. Overview [6] has tried to compile the status of knowledge in the field of biodeterioration of concrete, identify areas where more information is needed, and describe nanotechnologies {{that can be used to}} obtain the research goals. Zivica and Bajza in [7] described in detail the sources of the gaseous and liquid acidic media, principles of acidic attack and its chemical effects on the attacked material and its resulted degradation. Results of the study on aggressivity of selected carboxylic and sulphonic acids, phenols and some others are published in [8]. Observed increased expansions followed by crack propagation at the action of some media were adjudged to the cooperation of the mechanism. The highest aggression showed the solution of naphtensulphonates and p-toluene sulphonic acid [8]. A special type of sulphate deterioration of concrete materials is biocorrosion—the process caused by presence and activities of microorganisms producing sulphuric acid. Five different concrete compositions were tested in [9] including a reference mixture with high sulphate-resistant Portland cement and four different polymer cement concrete with a styrene–acrylic ester polymer, an acrylic polymer, a styrene butadiene polymer and a <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymer,</b> respectively. The change in pH of the simulation solutions, changes of Ca 2 + concentration of the simulation solution, change in height of the different concrete mixtures and change in weight of the different concrete mixtures were presented. Also results of comparison between the microbiological tests and the chemical tests are published in [9]. Experiments lead to conclusion that concrete composition with the styrene–acrylic ester polymer showed in both tests a higher resistance than the reference, mixture while the compositions with the acrylic polymer and the styrene butadiene polymer had a lower resistance than the reference mixture [9]. In work [10] deterioration mechanisms associated with cementitious materials made with calcium aluminate cement those made with ordinary Portland cement are presented. These samples were exposed to accelerated test relevant to these materials, as well as any other materials that can be used in sewer networks. According to [11, 12] biodeterioration mechanisms of cementitious materials in sewer networks also bring in a succession of microorganisms clearly identified in the case of ordinary Portland cement. Samples were prepared for laboratory and for in situ experiments. Studies carried out in the laboratory indicate that the simple chemical tests (with the addition of sulphuric acid) do not allow estimation of the service life of materials in sewer system [10]. A part of development of a computer model to describe the carrion concrete made with Portland/Portland blastfurnace cement/concrete with calcium aluminate cement at pH value between 4.0 and 6.5 are presented in [13]. According to this work, degree of the corrosion is defined by the thickness and porosity of the corroded layer and if abrasion effect occurs, the thickness of removed material. Classification of test methods for concrete corrosion determination and evaluation were presented in [14]. Test methods can be classified according to: the aggressive environment (sewers, underground structures, chemical plants…); the scale of test methods; the type of aggressive species (organic acid, salts, soft water…); parameters to accelerate degradation in simulation tests; the way of measuring the degradation of the specimens (thickness changes, mass loss, expansion, residual strength of specimens, pH changes of liquid); Ca, Fe, Al, Si and other ions released in liquid. Often combinations of the multiple relevant indicators are necessary [14].|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} offered miscibility {{maps for}} blend systems of cellulose esters (CEs) including cellulose acetate (CA), propionate (CP), and butyrate (CB) with <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymers</b> containing an N-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP) unit, i. e., poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone-[co]-vinyl acetate) [P(VP-[co]-VAc) ] and poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone-[co]-methyl methacrylate) [P(VP-[co]-MMA) ]; the maps were constructed {{based on data}} of thermal analysis {{as a function of}} the degree of ester substitution (DS) of the CE component and the VP fraction in the copolymer component. The blend system using CP among the three CEs imparted the largest region of miscible pairings with the <b>vinyl</b> <b>copolymers,</b> and both of the maps for the CP/P(VP-[co]-VAc) and CP/P(VP-[co]-MMA) systems comprised a "miscibility window" associated with the respective copolymer compositions at high DSs of > 2. 65. The present work was made to interpret the expansion of the miscible markings for the CP/copolymer systems in comparison with the cases using CA and CB, in terms of a Krigbaum–Wall interaction parameter (μ) obtained by solution viscometry for selective polymer pairs involved in the respective CE/copolymer blends. The results of μ measurements were in good accordance with the earlier miscibility estimations. The assessment of very small negative μ values (i. e., extremely weak repulsion) for CP/PVAc and CP/PMMA combinations and that of considerably larger negative μ values for PVP/PVAc and PVP/PMMA combinations enabled us to give a rational explanation for the CP systems. The strongly repellent character of the two different monomer units constituting the copolymers permits accession of the CP component (DS > 2. 65) to them, which would be responsible for the advent of the miscibility window. Further expansion of the window observed when cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) was adopted instead of CP as the CE component was also well explained on the basis of a μ data indicative of additional intramolecular repulsion in the CAP side...|$|R
