40|$|This article places media {{violence}} {{research into}} a broader context {{than the typical}} public debate about whether violent video games (or TV programs, or movies) are “the” cause of school shootings and other extreme acts of violence. We describe how scientists today decide whether one variable (e. g., exposure to violent media) increases the risks for, contributes to, or causes another (e. g., aggressive or violent behavior). We discuss the different research methods {{used to examine the}} relationship between exposure to <b>violent</b> media <b>and</b> aggressive <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> acts. We review research evidence on the link between exposure to <b>violent</b> media <b>and</b> aggressive behavior, <b>violent</b> behavior, <b>and</b> other undesirable behavior (e. g., less helping, less empathy and compassion for others). We conclude that although exposure to violent media is not “the” cause of aggressive <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> behavior, it is an important risk factor that can contribute to more aggressive <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> behaviors, <b>and</b> fewer prosocial behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the usefulness of targeting anger for the treatment of <b>violent</b> offenders <b>and</b> rapists. Four anger inventories were administered to 271 Canadian incarcerated male offenders comprised of four groups of offenders (<b>violent</b> vs. non-violent <b>and</b> rapists vs. nonrapists). These groups were compared according to their scores on the measures of anger. All comparisons were not significant. This study casts doubt on the use-fulness of targeting anger for the treatment of rapists <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> offenders <b>and</b> on the effect of these programs on reduction of recidivism. This {{study was designed}} to investigate the usefulness of targeting anger for the treat-ment of <b>violent</b> offenders <b>and</b> rapists. The relationship between anger and aggres-sive/assaultive behavior among criminal offenders has been controversial.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that there is a}} {{significant}} association between <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> criminal behavior. One potential explanation for this association is that genetically mediated processes contribute to both vio-lent victimization and criminal behavior. The current study uses data from the twin sample of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 2, 568) to examine whether genetic and/or environmental factors explain the correlation between <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> criminal behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Results from the bivariate genetic analyses reveal that genetic factors explain 39 % of the covariance between <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> delinquency in adolescence and 20 % of the correlation between <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> criminal behavior in early adulthood. The remaining covari-ance between <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> criminal behaviors is attributed to the same nonshared environmental factors operating on both. The implications of these findings in relation to the victimization literature are discussed. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on May 17, 2016 jiv. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R

40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{analyzes the}} relationships between <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> offending across a 2 -year period, using data for 5, 003 juveniles age 11 - 17 years {{who participated in the}} National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The bulletin looks at victimization and offending experiences in subgroups of juveniles classified by age, gender, race, and level of physical development. It also identifies risk and protective factors for victimization and offending. Key conclusions and policy implications include that violent victimization is a warning signal for future violent offending among juveniles, and protecting juveniles against violent victimization may reduce overall levels of juvenile violence; because some groups are at higher risk than others for <b>violent</b> victimization, policies <b>and</b> programs aimed at preventing victimization may be more effective if they are focused on these groups; <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> <b>violent</b> offending share many of the same risk factors (e. g., previous <b>violent</b> victimization <b>and</b> offending, drug and alcohol use, and depression), and many of these risk factors suggest opportunities for intervention.
