50|$|The EF86 is {{much less}} noisy than other pentodes, but {{slightly}} noisier than some triodes at about 2 µV equivalent input noise to 10 kHz. Although used in circuits such as tape recorder input stages and instrument amplifiers, microphony can be a problem, even when mounted in a vibration-reducing <b>valve</b> <b>holder.</b>|$|E
50|$|What was {{the goal}} {{to develop a}} {{reliable}} self-oscillating mixer? The reasons were to differ from the UK to America. The UK radio manufacturers had to pay a royalty of £1 per <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> to the British Valve Association to cover use of their members' patent rights. Further, they dictated that not more than one electrode structure could be contained in a single envelope (which would have evaded the royalty - at least in part). The Americans appeared {{to be driven by}} the desire to produce a low-cost 'every expense spared' design which was to lead to the All American Five. By making the mixer self-oscillate, the necessity of providing a separate oscillator valve is avoided. The All American Five was to use a pentagrid converter from when it first appeared in 1934, right up until valves became obsolete when transistors took over.|$|E
50|$|From 1976 onwards {{a series}} of {{modifications}} were made {{in order to improve}} the qualities and the performance of the pericardial xenograft. The selection and preparation of the bovine pericardium were standardised and rigorously controlled. For tissue fixation at zero pressure a solution of 0.5% purified glutaraldehyde was used. It contained an optimal proportion of monomers and polymers and an ideal cross-link density was obtained by controlling the concentration and the pH of the solution as well as its temperature and exposure time of the tissue to its action. The thickness and pliability of the pericardium were standardized and the direction of macroscopically visible fibres matched for each three cusps of a particular valve. The supporting stent was changed. The titanium was replaced with machined Delrin which is an acetyl homopolymer with low 'creep' properties due to a stable molecular memory. It is flexible and shock absorbent, essential qualities for a tissue heart valve support.This new stent contained a radio-opaque marker at its base for easy identification. The contour of the scalloped posts was modified and the height of the stent reduced. The entire Delrin structure was covered with seamless Dacron velour and at a later stage, the margins of the scalloped edges were covered with a thin layer of pericardium in an attempt to prevent or reduce the abrasion of the leaflets when in contact with this margin during valve closure. The sewing rim was bolstered for better and safer attachment to the heart annuli and its shape was anatomically contoured into two different configurations to better fit in the aortic and the atrio-ventricular positions. Two other additions were made: an integral <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> which prevents the touching of the valve's cusps, and a 'freeze-watch' indicator as a safe—guard against exposing the valves during transportation or storage at temperatures below 4 degrees Celsius.|$|E
30|$|The {{experiments}} of isothermal decomposition {{were conducted}} in an indigenously developed Sievert’s type apparatus at 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160  °C, with different samples of AB and ABNi. The catalyzed sample was prepared by mechanical milling technique using nano-nickel in 10  % quantity i.e., 2  mg of Ni for 20  mg of AB before each experiment. The volume of the evolved gas with respect to time and pressure is recorded. The fine mix turned into gray colour and is used to perform isothermal decomposition test at five different temperatures starting from 80  °C. Each sample was loaded in a crucible of cylindrical shape within the reactor. By using different <b>valves,</b> sample <b>holder</b> is connected at separate instants to vacuum pump, hydrogen gas cylinder, and the apparatus. In each set of experiment and monitoring, the sample holder was evacuated and filled with hydrogen gas before finally connecting to the measuring setup of apparatus. A thermocouple is placed {{very close to the}} sample holder to measure the accurate temperature to which the sample is subjected. The temperature and pressure are recorded digitally at intervals of 1  min using a data logger. The change in pressure of the apparatus was used to calculate the amount of hydrogen released in wt%. The FTIR analysis was performed before and after dehydrogenation for each of the catalyzed sample to study the bond structures of reaction products.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Hemodynamic {{performances}} of mechanical valve prostheses {{in patients with}} aortic valve stenosis and a small aortic annulus are crucial. We analyzed the in vitro hydrodynamics of 5 currently available bileaflet mechanical prostheses that fitted a 21 -mm-diameter <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> of a Sheffield pulse duplicator. METHODS: Three samples of 5 high-performance production-quality prostheses, including the sewing ring cuffs, were tested in the aortic chamber of a Sheffield pulse duplicator. Sizes of the prostheses fitting the 21 -mm <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> were as follows: 18 -mm ATS, 19 -mm SJM Regent, 19 -mm Sorin Bicarbon Slimline, 19 -mm On-X, and 21 -mm Carbomedics Top Hat. The tests were carried out at a fixed pulse rate (70 beats/min) and at increasing cardiac outputs of 2, 4, 5, and 7 L/min. Each valve was tested 10 times for each different cardiac output. This resulted {{in a total of}} 40 tests for each valve and 120 tests for each valve model. The aortic pressure was set at 120 / 80 mm Hg (mean pressure, 100 mm Hg) throughout the experiment for all cardiac outputs. Forward flow pressure decrease, total regurgitant volume, closing and leakage volumes, effective orifice area, and stroke work loss were recorded while the valve operated under each cardiac output. RESULTS: The SJM Regent valve and the Sorin Bicarbon Slimline prosthesis showed the lowest mean and peak gradients at increasing cardiac outputs. The closure volume was higher for the SJM Regent and Sorin Bicarbon Slimline prostheses, unlike with the ATS prosthesis at 7 L/min of cardiac output. The ATS and SJM Regent prostheses showed the largest regurgitant volume, whereas the Sorin Bicarbon Slimline prosthesis showed the lowest regurgitant volume. The calculated effective orifice area and stroke work loss were significantly better with the SJM Regent and Sorin Bicarbon Slimline prostheses. CONCLUSION: Assuming that the 21 -mm <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> in which all the tested prostheses were accommodated is comparable with a defined aortic valve size, this hydrodynamic evaluation model allowed us to compare the efficiency of currently available valve prostheses, and among these, the SJM Regent and the Sorin Bicarbon Slimline exhibited the best performances...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIn vivo {{comparison}} {{of the performance of}} heart valve prostheses is confounded by several factors, such as different nominal size, patients’ characteristics and hemodynamics, surgical techniques, and study design. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the in vitro hydrodynamic performances of 5 different tissue valves that would fit a 21 -mm-diameter <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> of the Sheffield pulse duplicator. MethodsThree samples of 5 supra-annular production-quality tissue valves, including the sewing ring cuffs, were tested in the aortic chamber of the Sheffield pulse duplicator. The prostheses fitting a 21 -mm <b>valve</b> <b>holder,</b> which is comparable with a 21 -mm aortic annulus, were as follows: 20 -mm Sorin Soprano, 21 -mm Carpentier-Edwards Magna, 21 -mm SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra, 21 -mm Medtronic Mosaic, and 23 -mm Mitroflow. The tests were carried out at a fixed pulse rate (70 beats/min) and at increasing cardiac outputs of 2, 4, 5, and 7 L/min. Each valve was tested 10 times for each different cardiac output. This resulted in a total of 40 tests for each valve and 120 tests for each valve model. Forward flow pressure decrease, effective orifice area, stroke work loss, and total regurgitant, closing, and leakage volumes were recorded while the valve operated under each cardiac output. ResultsPericardial valves showed significantly lower transvalvular gradients than porcine valves, unlike the SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra valve at 2 L/min of cardiac output. Although the Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve provided the best performance at 2 and 4 L/min, the Mitroflow valve exhibited the lowest mean and peak gradients at 5 to 7 L/min. Total regurgitant and leakage volumes were higher for the Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve and lower for the SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra and Mitroflow valves. Between 2 and 4 L/min, the calculated effective orifice area and stroke work loss were better for the Carpentier-Edwards Magna valve, whereas between 5 and 7 L/min, they were significantly superior with the Mitroflow prosthesis. Among the porcine bioprostheses, the SJM-Biocor-Epic-Supra valve showed significantly better results when compared with the Medtronic Mosaic valve at each cardiac output. ConclusionAssuming that the <b>valve</b> <b>holder</b> is comparable with a defined aortic annulus of 21 mm in which a spread of supra-annular tissue valves could be fitted, this hydrodynamic evaluation model allows {{comparison of}} the efficiency of currently available bioprostheses with a definite tissue annulus diameter. Pericardial valves exhibited the best performances, and the Mitroflow valve showed the lowest gradients and stroke work loss at increasing cardiac output...|$|E
