50|$|The cables {{offered by}} the Cavotec Group are divided in low and medium <b>voltage.</b> Low <b>voltage</b> <b>cables</b> are further divided into power or control cables as each single cable is {{designed}} to deal with specific applications. Medium <b>voltage</b> <b>cables</b> are power cables but the majority can be supplied with integrated fibre-optics as an option. Cavotec supplies any type of cable for specific application in either underground or open-pit mining applications. In addition, the Cavotec Group also supplies different types of hoses for the supply of water and air. These hoses are often used in mining and tunnelling operations where providing sufficient clean air and water is an absolute necessity.|$|R

High <b>voltage</b> <b>cables</b> are used for the transmission and distribution of electric power. XLPE insulation is widely used now a day.

Grading methods like capacitance grading and inter sheath grading are used for the linear stress distribution in the insulation and for other advantages. Finite element method is widely used method for the analysis of the electric stress and field inside the cable insulation.

40|$|Cross-linked {{polyethylene}} (XLPE) {{has replaced}} oil-paper insulated systems {{as the primary}} solution for medium and high <b>voltage</b> AC <b>cables</b> decades ago, since they enable marginally higher operating temperatures and can be produced with high throughput and well-controlled extrusion technology [1]. The base for this insulation is polyethylene (PE), which can be crosslinked either with peroxide cure (involving thermal decomposition), or by grafting silane onto the polymer chains, {{and the use of}} moisture-based cure [2]. Cross-linking is deemed necessary, since commercially available, branched low-density PE (LDPE) has more significant melting at temperatures around 100 °C and the material loses all of its mechanical stability. In contrast, linear high-density PE (HDPE) has a higher melting point and can achieve higher operating temperatures. But, although HDPE found some success in medium <b>voltage</b> <b>cables,</b> it has not managed to establish a foothold in the high <b>voltage</b> (HV) <b>cable</b> sector [3]. After decades of research, conventional XLPE is at the limit of its capabilities, as outlined below, and further development is bound to have diminishing returns. Further, the costs of large extrusion and catenary cross-linking manufacturing facilities and the costs and time of degassing larger cross-section HV and extrahigh <b>voltage</b> <b>cables</b> present significant sustainability issues for cable manufacturers...|$|R

The formation of defects in the interface XLPE insulation and the inner semiconductive shield reduced the residual breakdown strength of the cable system remarkable already after 3 month.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{fundamental}} investigations of partial discharge behaviour of typical defects of PE/XLPE-insulated medium <b>voltage</b> <b>cables</b> at test <b>voltages</b> with variable shape and frequency. The investigations were started {{because of the}} increasing use of alternative test voltages (e. g.

The possibility to compare PD measurement results from 50 / 60 Hz AC test voltage with the results from alternative test voltages is questioned in this work as well as the possibility to transfer the knowledge from 50 / 60 Hz AC test voltage measurements to the measurement results obtained from alternative test voltages.

The couplers mechanically fit onto those of the RABDe 12/12.|$|E
50|$|Up to now, it {{has been}} almost {{impossible}} to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of operation conditions and risk minimization. The availability of industrial distributed temperature sensing (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable {{is a first step}} in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a high <b>voltage</b> <b>cable</b> or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high <b>voltage</b> <b>cable</b> circuit in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum. Furthermore, it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions.|$|E
