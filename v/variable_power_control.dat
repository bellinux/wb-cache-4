30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a 10 -state FSMC model for the AMC scheme in mobile WiMAX, taking into account also the {{repetition}} coding gain in two different fading scenarios: correlated lognormal fading and composite Rayleigh-lognormal fading, also known as Suzuki fading. Because the main theme of our paper {{is the effect of}} repetition coding on the proposed 10 -state FSMC model for AMC control, but not on channel fading models, we will restrict ourselves, for simplicity and brevity, to the Rayleigh-distributed channel (voltage) gain and the corresponding exponentially distributed channel (power) gain rather than dealing with their respective generic distributions, i.e., Nakagami-m distribution and gamma-k distribution, respectively. One of the significant findings in this paper is that the channel fading correlation, while significantly degrading the BER performance, practically does not affect the proposed <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> algorithm and its resulting 10 -state FSMC model for mobile WiMAX. This is because repetition coding is applied only to the first three states, but the total power in these states is too small to affect the overall <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> scheme.|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanisms}} of PC can be largely classified into static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> and dynamic <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> A static <b>power</b> <b>control</b> allocation assigns <b>power</b> levels to the nodes {{that do not}} change frequently over time, unless there are drastic changes in the network topology.

The PD algorithm was tuned for expected maximum flow rates and could keep DT within 0. 1 C of its daytime (0800 – 1800 h) target value.

30|$|We {{have defined}} and {{successfully}} developed expressions for the coding gain of repetition diversity coding {{and the related}} 10 -state FSMC model for <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>control</b> for AMC used in modern wireless mobile networks operating under the two fading mechanisms: lognormal and composite Rayleigh-lognormal. It is found that the correlation between diversity fading channels, while significantly degrading the BER performance, practically {{does not affect the}} proposed power control algorithm and the resulting 10 -state FSMC model. By using the power conservation principle across the MRC combiner, an innovative technique is proposed for accurate matching of two MGFs which allows an accurate estimate of the PDF of the SNR at the combiner output. Next, by using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature approximation for integration, we have derived the most computationally fast expressions to date, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, for the calculation of BER of QPSK using MRC diversity reception in correlated fading channels and for the efficient computation of the 10 -state FSMC model for AMC in mobile WiMAX. The inclusion of repetition coding gain in the transmit power adaptation algorithm for different fading mechanisms and different fading depths has not been done before. From Figure  4, we can observe that the use of RC for QPSK modulation level alone extends the system operation range to almost 4 dB into very poor fading conditions. In addition, it is interesting to note that based on the same overall average SNR, the composite Suzuki fading model requires approximately 1.0 dB less power than the lognormal fading model to achieve the same instantaneous spectral efficiency. However, from Figure  5, because of the high probability of the received Suzuki-faded signal falling into the zero-power state, its average spectral efficiency becomes lower than that of the lognormal faded signal.|$|E

30|$|The idea {{to use the}} FxLMS {{algorithm}} {{started from}} the observation that analogy can be seen between the control structure in Fig.  3 and the LMS algorithm. Actually, the conventional algorithms {{can be seen as}} a special case of the FxLMS algorithm. The following modifications are needed from the MFxLMS structure in Fig.  2 to the CAPC structure in Fig.  3 : (1) First, the CAPC structure uses square-law detection instead of envelope detection used in the MFxLMS structure. These have shown to provide comparable performance but the former is usually easier to analyze [46] while the latter allows a larger dynamic range [47]. (2) The CAPC method uses averaging to remove noise. The LMS algorithms are in principle based on exponential averaging [1]. An additional averaging block could be used as well, but it does not provide additional performance gain for the algorithm [48]. It is better to use instantaneous gradient estimates as is used in our <b>power</b> <b>control</b> structure. (3) Companding, i.e., going first to decibel domain (compressing) and then back to linear domain (expanding), is used in the CAPC algorithm. Compressing is used to cover the large dynamic range in a fading channel. In the practical MFxLMS structure, companding focuses on the task of nonlinear quantization, i.e., to reduce the number of bits in the <b>power</b> <b>control</b> command. (4) One-bit quantization is used in the CAPC- 1 method to simplify feedback signaling. The MFxLMS method is using quantization as in Eqs. (25)–(26). <b>Power</b> <b>control</b> command needs to be more than 1  bit for <b>variable</b> step <b>power</b> <b>control.</b> That is true also for the variable step algorithms that are based on the structure shown in Fig.  3. (5) The CAPC- 1 method uses a fixed scaling factor ΔP whereas in the MFxLMS method, the step size scales based on the channel state. The similarities between the CAPC methods and the LMS method are so clear that the MFxLMS method {{can be seen as a}} generalization of inverse <b>power</b> <b>control</b> approaches.|$|R

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) are {{energy and}} resource constrained. Energy limitations make it advantageous to balance radio transmissions across multiple sensor nodes. Thus, load balanced routing is highly desirable and has motivated a significant volume of research. Multihop sensor network architecture {{can also provide}} greater coverage, but requires a highly reliable and adaptive routing scheme to accommodate frequent topology changes. Current reliability-oriented protocols degrade energy efficiency and increase network latency. This thesis develops and evaluates a novel solution to provide energy-efficient routing while enhancing packet delivery reliability. This solution, a reliable load-balancing routing (RLBR), makes four contributions {{in the area of}} reliability, resiliency and load balancing in support of the primary objective of network lifetime maximisation. The results are captured using real world testbeds as well as simulations. The first contribution uses sensor node emulation, at the instruction cycle level, to characterise the additional processing and computation overhead required by the routing scheme. The second contribution is based on real world testbeds which comprises two different TinyOS-enabled senor platforms under different scenarios. The third contribution extends and evaluates RLBR using large-scale simulations. It is shown that RLBR consumes less energy while reducing topology repair latency and supports various aggregation weights by redistributing packet relaying loads. It also shows a balanced energy usage and a significant lifetime gain. Finally, the forth contribution is a novel <b>variable</b> transmission <b>power</b> <b>control</b> scheme which is created based on the experience gained from prior practical and simulated studies.

This article presents an online adaptive pole-shift method for stabilization of a multi-machine power system. Considering the speed deviation of the generator to which the STATCOM is connected as the output and the magnitude of the converter voltage as the input, an adaptive linear plant model is estimated. The stabilizing control is derived from a variable pole-shift strategy which moves the poles of the identified model to the center of unit circle in z-domain. The controller performance has been tested for various disturbances from a number of simulation studies on a multi-machine power system.

In such systems, in fact, many users transmit {{over the same}} radio channel using the same frequency band and time slots so that the signal of an individual user becomes interference for the other users. Hence the transmission power levels need to be smartly manipulated so as to achieve an adequate quality of service for as many users as possible and, thus, an ecient network utilization. Conventional <b>power</b> <b>control</b> algorithms adopt the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) as controlled variable and neglect the important eects of the manipulated <b>control</b> <b>variables</b> (transmission <b>powers)</b> and of the retransmission mechanism on the queueing dynamics.
