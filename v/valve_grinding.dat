40|$|The {{project has}} been {{focussed}} on ceramic valves for piston engines. That prejudiced nearly all outer conditions, concerning materials, quality, production quantities and costs. Acceptable machining time of less than one minute per piece - as asked for mass production needs - are almost todays standard, when using last generation <b>valve</b> <b>grinding</b> centers, installed {{at some of the}} bigger valve producers now. But for small shops like VEPA, which cannot afford those huge investments, a grinding strategy was developed in interaction with german institutes, by what it is possible to reduce machining time from former three hours to thirty minutes for each valve, without reducing quality and strength standards of the parts. Additionally VEPA developed, designed and produced a fully ceramic sliding bearing by which an older, continuously used grinding machine out of the own machine pool could become improved amazingly.

The cutting fluid and the grinding wheel types adopted resulted in changes in all the parameters, due to the different lubricant abilities among the fluids and due to {{the differences in the}} mechanical and thermal properties among the abrasives tested. For grinding this steel, the CBN wheel is the best choice, mainly due to compressive residual stress results obtained for all cutting fluids tested. The cutting oil is the most adequate cutting fluid to be used, due to its higher lubricity and ability in keeping the wheel sharp for longer periods of time, reducing the overall grinding energy and the thermal damage...|$|R

Nesse artigo é apresentada uma pesquisa experimental sobre os danos térmicos que aparecem nas válvulas de admissão dos motores após passarem pelo processo de retificação. Foram utilizados, nessa experimentação, quatro tipos de fluidos de corte e dois rebolos (CBN e Al 2 O 3), sendo analisadas a tensão residual, a microdureza e a microestrutrura das peças fabricadas com esses materiais. Esses fluidos e rebolos resultaram em diferentes tipos de tensões residuais. O óleo de corte, por exemplo, induziu nas peças tensões residuais de compressão. Em relação ao rebolo de CBN, devido às melhores propriedades de seus grãos abrasivos, estes proporcionaram tensões de compressão para todos os fluidos testados. Em relação às alterações microestruturais, notou-se que nenhuma alteração térmica foi detectada nas peças, embora a inexistência de alterações microestruturais nem sempre sugerem que tensões residuais favoráveis foram obtidas...|$|R

The Franklin Service Station in Syracuse was thoroughly equipped and employed the most modern machinery and a corps of [...] "factory trained mechanics." [...] The company serviced fully 75 percent of the Franklin cars in the area and they carried a large stock of parts. They also had their own special machinery for such jobs as <b>grinding</b> <b>valves,</b> for searching out grounds and short circuits in the electrical system, and they were equipped for complete overhaul jobs as well as [...] "to effect repairs of every nature."
