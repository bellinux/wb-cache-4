40|$|This paper reports facile {{and cost}} {{effective}} methods for fabricating MoS 2 nanosheets and for assembling layered MoS 2 -graphene nanocomposites. The MoS 2 nanosheets {{were obtained by}} ultrasonicating commercial MoS 2 powder in N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP). The MoS 2 -graphene nanocomposites were assembled by the <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>filtration</b> of a mixture of the MoS 2 nanosheets and graphene nanosheets suspended in NMP and water, respectively. In the nanocomposites, the MoS 2 nanosheets are dispersed between the graphene nanosheets, and vice versa. When used as anodes for LIBs, the MoS 2 nanosheets greatly outperform the MoS 2 powder; however, they still suffer severe capacity deterioration due to the poor electric conductivity and the obvious structural failure. Excellent performances were observed in the MoS 2 -graphene nanocomposites. For the 60 Mo- 80 GN sample, the reversible capacities are held stably at ∼ 650, ∼ 550 and ∼ 500 mAh g− 1 at 500, 1000 and 20000 mA g− 1, respectively. It is concluded that for the MoS 2 -graphene nanocomposites, MoS 2 is the key component accommodating Li ions, and graphene improves the electric conductivity and maintains the structural stability for the MoS 2 nanosheets. These findings prove that ultrasonication combined with the <b>vacuum</b> assisted <b>filtration</b> is a scale-up approach to fabricate MoS 2 -graphene based layered nanocomposites with excellent Li storage capacity...|$|R

50|$|In crystallization, a solid (usually impure) is {{dissolved}} in a solvent at high temperature, {{taking advantage of}} the fact that most solids are more soluble at higher temperatures. As the solution cools, the solubility of the solute in the solvent will gradually become smaller. The resultant solution is described as supersaturated, meaning that there is more solute dissolved in the solution than would be predicted by its solubility at that temperature. Crystallization can then be induced from this supersaturated solution and the resultant pure crystals removed by such methods as <b>vacuum</b> <b>filtration</b> and centrifugal separators. The remaining solution, once the crystals have been filtered out, is known as the mother liquor, and will contain a portion of the original solute (as predicted by its solubility at that temperature) as well as any impurities that were not filtered out. Second and third crops of crystals can then be harvested from the mother liquor.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{filtration}} techniques {{depending on the}} desired outcome namely, hot, cold and <b>vacuum</b> <b>filtration.</b> Some of the major purposes of getting a desired outcome are, {{for the removal of}} impurities from a mixture or, for the isolation of solids from a mixture.Hot filtration method is mainly used to separate solids from a hot solution. This is done in order to prevent crystal formation in the filter funnel and other apparatuses that comes in contact with the solution. As a result, the apparatus and the solution used are heated in order to prevent the rapid decrease in temperature which in turn, would lead to the crystallization of the solids in the funnel and hinder the filtration process.One of the most important measure to prevent the formation of crystals in the funnel and to undergo effective hot filtration is the use stemless filter funnel. Due to the absence of stem in the filter funnel, there is a decrease in the surface area of contact between the solution and the stem of the filter funnel, hence preventing re-crystallization of solid in the funnel, adversely effecting filtration process.|$|E

By means of <b>vacuum</b> <b>filtration</b> transfer, the solutions containing NWs can be adequately diluted and be dispered as individual wires, so the prepared TCEs possess good conductivity. Meanwhile, some reagent can be filtered out, which is helpful to improve electrical conductivity of the TCEs. In this work, the glacial acetic acid solution containing CuNWs is diluted by deionized water and then filtered on a MCE filter membrane. During the process, the residual organic materials and copper oxides can be removed, which helps to improve electrical conductivity of the CuNW TCEs.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{filtration}}: First seen commercially in the 1920s in {{the form}} of the Newcombe Separator (later to become the Rexair Rainbow), a water <b>filtration</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner uses a water bath as a filter.

The water trap filtration and low speed may also allow the user to use the machine as a stand-alone air purifier and humidifier unit. The dirty water must be dumped out and the appliance must be cleaned after each use, to avoid growth of bacteria and mold, causing unpleasant odors.|$|R
40|$|Control of {{impurity}} {{elements in}} Al-based alloys is of increasing technological importance, both in {{primary and secondary}} alloy production. In primary alloy production, Ni and V concentrations in the coke are rising and this is increasing the level of impurities in the final products {{to the extent that}} they are out of specification. Impurity control is also of concern in recycling due to the pickup of elements such as Fe from contaminants in the scrap, which can detrimentally affect the alloy properties. Dissolved elemental impurities can be removed by a number of different processes including boron treatment for some of the transition metals. Other processes in the cast shop for removing impurities and inclusions from Al melts include fluxing, floatation, and <b>filtration.</b> Gas purging, <b>vacuum</b> treatment, <b>filtration,</b> the use of salts, and combinations of these presently find commercial applications.

3000|$|Many of the FE X-ray sources {{demonstrated}} {{have employed}} screen printed or vacuum filtrated CNT thin films [156, 169 – 171] (Figure  4 (d)). Here CNT solutions are deposited at the macro-scale and form highly disordered, nominally planar, spaghetti-like networks with {{but a few}} individual CNTs standing upright, at many unregistered angles relative to one another. In the case of <b>vacuum</b> [...] <b>filtration</b> the CNT ink is poured onto a porous mixed (nitro) cellulose ester membrane, which has a partial vacuum applied on its opposite side. Such porous membranes have controlled apertures, typically around 0.2  μm in diameter. The reduced pressure stimulates the solvent within the CNT ink {{to pass through the}} membrane, whilst the membrane stops the CNTs from passing. Once the ink reservoir is depleted the thin film is rinsed with de-ionised water to remove much of the deleterious surfactants, leaving a thin CNT film on the membrane. Note, however; that much of the surfactant still remains even after extensive rinsing using deionised water. The CNT thin film can then be transferred to an arbitrary acetone-resistant substrate by applying modest pressure (40  g/cm 2) and heat (ca. 70 °C) {{for an extended period of}} time (often of the order of 3  h). The membrane is then dissolved, by exposure to acetone or methanol, and the CNT thin film remains. The CNT film thickness, and hence sheet resistance and optical transparency, is controlled by adjusting the amount of CNT ink filtered through the membrane.|$|R
40|$|Filtration {{under an}} {{ultrasonic}} field {{is a technique}} that is gaining importance in the wastewater treatment research field, not only due to its ability as a cleaning mechanism, {{but also as a}} filtration intensifier. The main objective of this research was the study of the influence of ultrasonic waves on the filtration of theoilfield wastewater (known as produced water) in order to increase the operation performance and filter medium regenerative effectiveness. A 0. 016 m² hollow cylindrical porous ceramic filter was submitted to the filtration of produced water by two mechanisms: conventional <b>filtration</b> under <b>vacuum</b> and <b>filtration</b> under theinfluence of ultrasonic waves. Experiments were carried out using synthetic produced water by analyzing the variables oil and grease content (O&G) and total suspended solids (TSS) for each filtration run. Backwashing of the filter medium with distilled water was also performed to evaluate the regeneration efficiency. During conventional filtration, permeate flux decreased gradually, becoming stable around 0. 06 cm³. cm- 2. s- 1. Furthermore, in the filtration assisted by ultrasound, the permeate flux was around 0. 15 cm³. cm- 2. s- 1. Therefore, ultrasonic waves provided an increase of about 150 % in the permeate flux. Moreover, the sonication improved filter medium regeneration effectiveness, even under conditions of high TSS and O&G contents. Taking into consideration the very positive results associated with the application of ultrasonicwaves, this filtration technique is likely to become an important industrial process...|$|R
