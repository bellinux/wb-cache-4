30|$|This paper investigates mobile video {{delivery}} in a heterogeneous wireless network from a video server to a multi-homed client. Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) {{has proven to}} be an effective solution for video transmission over bandwidth-limited, error-prone wireless networks. However, one major problem with the existing JSCC approaches is that they consider the network between the server and the client as a single transport link. The situation becomes more complicated in the context of multiple available links because involving a low-bandwidth, highly lossy, or long-delay wireless network in the transmission will only degrade the video quality. To address the critical problem, we propose a novel flow rate allocation-based JSCC (FRA-JSCC) approach that includes three key phases: (1) forward error correction redundancy estimation under loss requirement, (2) source rate adaption under delay constraint, and (3) dynamic rate allocation to minimize end-to-end video distortion. We present a mathematical formulation of JSCC to optimize video quality over multiple wireless channels and provide comprehensive analysis for channel distortion. We evaluate the performance of FRA-JSCC through emulations in Exata and compare it with the existing schemes. Experimental results show that FRA-JSCC outperforms the competing models in improving the <b>video</b> peak <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> as well as in reducing the end-to-end delay.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Efficient {{bit stream}} {{adaptation}} and resilience to packet losses are two critical requirements in {{scalable video coding}} for transmission over packet-lossy networks. Various scalable layers have highly distinct importance, measured by their contribution to the overall video quality. This distinction is especially more significant in the scalable H. 264 /advanced video coding (AVC) video, due to the employed prediction hierarchy and the drift propagation when quality refinements are missing. Therefore, efficient bit stream adaptation and unequal protection of these layers are of special interest in the scalable H. 264 /AVC video. This paper proposes an algorithm to accurately estimate the overall distortion of decoder reconstructed frames due to enhancement layer truncation, drift/error propagation, and error concealment in the scalable H. 264 /AVC video. The method recursively computes the total decoder expected distortion at the picture-level for each layer in the prediction hierarchy. This ensures low computational cost since it bypasses highly complex pixel-level motion compensation operations. Simulation results show an accurate distortion estimation at various channel loss rates. The estimate is further integrated into a cross-layer optimization framework for optimized bit extraction and contentaware channel rate allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that precise distortion estimation enables our proposed transmission system to achieve a significantly higher average <b>video</b> peak <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> compared to a conventional content independent system.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a cross-layer design which {{combines}} Packet Forward Error Correction (P-FEC) at the application layer with a Symbol unequal FEC in the MAC layer (S-FEC). The {{aim is to}} minimize the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) and maximize the visual quality of video transmitted over a wireless network (WN). The proposed scheme {{is based on a}} FEC compatible with the semantics of the H. 264 /AVC video encoding. This mechanism relies on a rate distortion algorithm controlling the channel rates under global rate constraints given by the WN. Based on a data partitioning tool (DP), the proposed optimization mechanism takes into consideration both the packet type and packet length which leads to an unequal error protection (UEP). A Reed-Solomon S-FEC is adapted to unequal protected data. Indeed the unrecoverable S-FEC blocks can be balanced by a P-FEC in the application layer. Simulation experiments over random generated noise show that UEP scheme has a Bit Error Rate (BER) {{greater than or equal to}} BER at the output of the Equal Error Protection scheme (EEP) and demonstrate various Packet Loss Rate (PLRs) in terms of packet type. Contrary, the UEP scheme has a greater computational complexity than EEP.

The key technology to enable media communications in the context of SOA is the Service Oriented Communication. To exploit the advantage of SOA, we design and implement a web-based multimedia conferencing system that provides users with a hybrid orchestration of web and communication services. As the current SOA lacks effective QoS guarantee solutions for multimedia services, the user satisfaction is greatly challenged with QoS violations, e. g., low <b>video</b> PSNR (Peak <b>Signal-to-Noise</b> <b>Ratio)</b> and long playback delay. Motivated by addressing the critical problem, we firstly employ the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) service engine for the hybrid services orchestration and execution. Secondly, we propose a novel context-aware approach to quantify and leverage the causal relationships between QoS metrics and available contexts based on Bayesian networks (CABIN). This approach includes three phases: (1) information discretization, (2) causal relationship profiling, and (3) optimal context tuning. We implement CABIN in a real-life multimedia conferencing system and compare its performance with existing delay and throughput oriented schemes.

In this work, we propose MuVi, a Multicast Video delivery scheme in OFDMA-based 4 G wireless networks, to optimize multicast video traffic. MuVi differentiates video frames based on their importance in reconstructing the video and incorporates an efficient radio resource allocation algorithm to optimize the overall video quality across all users in the multicast group.

40|$|The massive {{proliferation}} of wireless infrastructures with complementary characteristics prompts the bandwidth aggregation for Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) over heterogeneous access networks. Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) {{is the standard}} transport-layer solution to enable CMT in multihomed communication environments. However, delivering high-quality streaming video with the existing CMT solutions still remains problematic due to the stringent QoS (Quality of Service) requirements and path asymmetry in heterogeneous wireless networks. In this paper, we advance {{the state of the}} art by introducing video distortion into the decision process of multipath data transfer. The proposed Distortion-Aware Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT-DA) solution includes three phases: 1) per-path status estimation and congestion control; 2) quality-optimal video flow rate allocation; 3) delay and loss controlled data retransmission. The term `flow rate allocation' indicates dynamically picking appropriate access networks and assigning the transmission rates.

In resource allocation for a D 2 D video transmission system in a block fading environment, the performance improvement by applying the exact symbol error rate (SER) is compared with the conventional signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) based SER evaluation method that uses a Gaussian approximation (GA) for the aggregated interference. An analytical SER expression for a D 2 D system using multicarrier bandlimited QAM is derived and then used in the resource allocation algorithm. Centralized resource allocation for the D 2 D system is considered, given knowledge of the channel state information and the rate distortion information of the video streams, and an iterative algorithm for subcarrier assignment and power allocation is proposed. Bit-level simulations for different numbers of D 2 D pairs demonstrate a considerable improvement on user capacity and <b>video</b> peak <b>signal-to-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> by incorporating the proposed SER expression compared to the GA. By invoking {{the conditions under which}} the central limit theorem holds, and comparing these conditions with the number of interferers and the power ratio of the dominant interferer in the simulated D 2 D system, the reason why the GA for the interference results in a pessimistic performance is also studied.

The co-channel interference between D 2 D pairs is analyzed, and a cross-layer algorithm with a subcarrier assignment outer loop and a power control inner loop, which aims to optimize the overall video quality, is proposed. Unlike the non-convexity in physical layer power control for maximizing the total throughput, the cross-layer power control problem is convex under certain conditions, so a high quality solution for power control can be efficiently found.
