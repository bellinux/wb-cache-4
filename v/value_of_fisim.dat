Thus being mentioned the specific allocation <b>of</b> <b>FISIM</b> both by economic activities and institutional sectors, which are the advantages of switching to a new method <b>of</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>FISIM</b> and which are the informational datasource of performing these calculations. The research methodology was based on traditional research methods and techniques – scientific abstraction, analogy, analysis and synthesis of data...|$|R
40|$|In the System of National Accounts (SNA), {{the output}} of {{financial}} intermedation services {{is the sum of}} directly and indirectly measured components. This paper considers the second, “financial intermediation services indirectly measured” (FISIM) component, analyzing FISIM in a series of rearrangements of a cash flow identity facing any enterprise with financial instruments on its balance sheet. Our framework encompasses essentially all versions of the SNA, the user cost of money approach to financial services pioneered by Diewert (1974), Barnett (1978, 1980), Donovan (1978), and Hancock (1985), and recent analyses by Basu, Inklaar, and Wang (2011) and Colangelo and Inklaar (2012). The paper argues that the SNA’s “reference rate of interest” for calculating FISIM output is the Modigliani-Miller (1958) cost of capital, that SNA FISIM then comprises three computable components—account servicing, asset management, and risk intermediation—and that allocating FISIM to institutional sectors and thus to its intermediate and final uses should follow a “funders pay the spread” principle similar in spirit to the 1953 version of the SNA. The paper characterizes the differing views on the SNA’s inclusion of maturity and risk premia in FISIM as taking different approaches to the treatment <b>of</b> <b>FISIM’s</b> risk intermediation component...|$|R

The paper was prepared as a first step towards the construction of an international database for productivity comparisons among Asian countries. Our observations are summed up as follows. First, although most countries are 1993 SNA compliant, the extent of compliance in terms of coverage still varies. The treatment <b>of</b> <b>FISIM</b> and software is far from standard in this country group, and methods to align GDP coverage need be considered for any cross-country comparisons. Second, employment data are more fragmented and countries {{are more likely to have}} a manufacturing census than a census on services. Third, most countries have detailed benchmark supply-use/input-output tables which can be used to supplement their national accounts. Our judgment is that GDP per worker as a labor productivity volume should be feasible for this country group, whereas GDP per hour worked will be more of a challenge due to data limitations. Industry comparative analysis of labor productivity should be feasible; but comparing total factor productivity performance, which requires capital stocks and services estimates, is feasible for only a handful of countries at the whole-economy level...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} evidence {{propagation operations}} on influence diagrams and a concept <b>of</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence, which measures the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> experimentation. Evidence propagation operations {{are critical for}} the computation <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence, general update and inference operations in normative expert systems {{which are based on}} the influence diagram (generalized Bayesian network) paradigm. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence allows us to compute directly an outcome sensitivity, a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information and a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> control which are used in decision analysis (the science of decision making under uncertainty). More specifically, the outcome sensitivity is the maximum difference among the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information is the expected <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence, and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> control is the optimal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{argue that}} the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{authenticity}} does not explain the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. There are a plurality of species of authenticity; {{in this paper we}} consider four species: avoiding pretense (§ 2), Frankfurtian wholeheartedness (§ 3), existential self-knowledge (§ 4), and spontaneity (§ 4). Our thesis is that, for each of these species, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> (that species of) authenticity does not (partially) explain the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. Moreover, when it comes to spontaneity, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> (that species of) authenticity conflicts with the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. A contemporary slogan, a favorite of self-help gurus, enjoins you to “be yourself,” implying the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> authenticity. The Delphic motto, a favorite of philosophers, enjoins you to “know thyself, ” implying the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge. What is the relationship between the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> authenticity and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> self-knowledge? Can the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> one explain the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the other? “Authenticity ” is ambiguous in a variety of ways: representations are said to be authentic when they are accurate, cuisines are said to be authentic when they resemble some paradigm, and people are said to be authentic when they are “true to themselves. ” It is this personal sense of “authentic ” with which we are concerned here.
