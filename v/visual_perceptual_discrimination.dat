40|$|Introduction: Recent {{investigations}} using field-potential recordings {{in visual}} and auditory cortices {{have shown that}} oscillatory activity in neuronal ensembles become entrained to the timing of rhythmically presented stimuli according to their modality and location (Lakatos, Chen et al. 2007; Lakatos, Karmos et al. 2008; Lakatos, O&#x 27;Connell et al. 2009). In spite of the evidence showing the role of brain oscillations on forming predictions about forthcoming sensory events (for a review (Engel, Fries et al. 2001), {{little is known about}} the role of such oscillations in the temporal orienting of attention (Nobre 2001; Coull and Nobre 2008). To test the effect of temporal orienting of attention on early perceptual processing, motor selection, and anticipatory low frequency oscillation (alpha waves), we analysed EEG data from healthy adults participants who were performing a <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> task of targets preceded by rhythmic spatio-temporal cues. |$|E
40|$|A recent {{proposal}} that {{structures of the}} medial temporal lobe support visual perception in addition to memory challenges the longstanding idea {{that the ability to}} acquire new memories is separable from other cognitive and perceptual functions. In four experiments, we have put this proposal to a rigorous test. Six memory-impaired patients with well characterized lesions of either the hippocampal region or the hippocampal region plus additional medial temporal lobe structures were assessed on difficult tests of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Across all four experiments, the patients performed as well as controls. The results show that visual perception is intact in memory-impaired patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe even when perception is assessed with challenging tasks. Furthermore, the results support the principle that the ability to acquire new memories is a distinct cerebral function, dissociable from other perceptual and cognitive functions.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{familiar}} empirical phenomena associated with face recognition is the cross-race (CR) recognition deficit whereby people have difficulty recognizing members of a race different from their own. Most researchers a sume that he CR deficit is caused by failure to generalize perceptual encoding expertise from same-race (SR) faces to CR faces. However, this explanation ignores critical differences in the social cognitions and feature coding priorities associated with SR and CR faces. On the basis of data from <b>visual</b> search and <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> tasks, {{it appears that the}} deficit occurs because people emphasize visual information specifying race at the expense of individuating information when recognizing CR faces. In particular, it is possible to observe aparadoxical improvement i both detection and <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> accuracy for CR faces that is limited to those who recognize them poorly. These findings support a new explanation for the CR recognition deficit based on feature coding differences between CR and SR faces, and appear incompatible with similarity-based models of face categories. In some cases, the simplest phenomena are the most mysterious. Perhaps this is because a correspondingly simple explanation is expected to suffice, and when it doesn't he problem become...|$|R

However, research on student perception also indicates considerable disagreement in student perceptions of teacher behavior. Therefore the present paper explores if individual students might differ in their <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination.</b> One variable theorized important in <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> is an individuals’ perceptual processing. Hence, the present study explores if cognitive impulsivity – a widely accepted measure of cognitive processing – explains variance in students’ <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination.</b> 299 students, age 11 - 14, in 13 different classes participated. The Questionnaire of Teacher Interaction (QTI) {{was used to measure}} students’ perceptions of teacher behavior. Per class four teachers were selected by their schools based on their presumed different teaching styles. Students’ <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> was divided in students’ <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> of teachers’ control and affiliation. The Matching Familiar Figures Test- 20 (MFFT- 20) was used to operationalize students’ cognitive impulsivity.

Cognitive impulsivity was positively associated with students’ discrimination in teachers’ control, but not in teachers’ affiliation. Implications of these results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} extent to which visual characteristics of orthographies affect learning to read within and across writing systems, with an eye toward the role of mapping principles – the manner in which graphemes map to linguistic units (e. g., phonemes, syllables, and morphemes) in this process. Study 1 explained visual orthographic variation by developing a measurement system to quantify complexity of graphemes in 131 orthographies. The results show that grapheme complexity varies across writing systems and that this variation is driven by grapheme inventory, a consequence of mapping principles. Next, we questioned how visual orthographic variation impacts individuals’ perceptual learning of graphemes – one of the initial stages of learning to read. Study 2 tested the degree to which mastering first-language (L 1) graphemes with different complexities affects <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> for individuals using different mapping principles (Online cross-writing-system experiment; eight participant groups: Hebrew, English, Russian, Arabic, Hindi, Telugu, Japanese, and Chinese, n = 60, respectively) and individuals using the same mapping principle (Lab within-writing-system experiment: simplified vs. traditional Chinese, n = 60, respectively). Consistent results from both experiments show that discrimination difficulty is a function of grapheme stimulus complexity itself as well as its relationship to the complexity of participants’ L 1, regardless of mapping principles. These results were confirmed in Study 3, in which we developed a universal orthographic neural network encoder focus on statistical properties of visual patterns to simulate human behaviors. We trained each of 131 identical encoders to learn the structure of a different orthography; a strong, positive association was found between grapheme complexity and network learning difficulty. Taken together, our results suggest that visual orthographic variation, encompassing both grapheme complexity and grapheme inventory required for orthographic mastery, affects visual discrimination processing of graphemes; these complexity effects are driven significantly, but not absolutely, by mapping principles across writing systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{models of}} {{short-term}} <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> memory invoke mechanisms that are closely allied to low-level <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> mechanisms. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the extent to which human <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> memory for spatial frequency is based upon multiple, spatially tuned channels similar to those found in the earliest stages of visual processing. To this end we measured how performance on a delayed spatial frequency discrimination paradigm was affected by the introduction of interfering or ‘memory masking’ stimuli of variable spatial frequency during the delay period. Masking stimuli were shown to induce shifts in the points of subjective equality (PSE) when their spatial frequencies were within a bandwidth of 1. 2 octaves of the reference spatial frequency. When mask spatial frequencies differed by more than this value, there was no change in the PSE from baseline levels. This selective pattern of masking was observed for different spatial frequencies and demonstrates the existence of multiple, spatially tuned mechanisms in <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> memory. Memory masking effects were also found to occur for horizontal separations of up to 6 deg between the masking and test stimuli and lacked any orientation selectivity. These findings add further support to the view that low-level sensory processing mechanisms form the basis for the retention of spatial frequency information in perceptual memory. However, the broad range of transfer of memory masking effects across spatial location and other dimensions indicates more long range, long duration interactions between spatial frequency channels that are likely to rely contributions from neural processes located in higher visual areas...|$|R
40|$|Well {{over half}} a century ago, Benjamin Lee Whorf [Carroll JB (1956) Language, Thought, and Reality: Selected Writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA) ] {{proposed}} that language affects perception and thought and is used to segment nature, a hypothesis that has since been tested by linguistic and behavioral studies. Although clear Whorfian effects have been found, {{it has not yet}} been demonstrated that language influences brain activity associated with perception and/or immediate postperceptual processes (referred hereafter as "perceptual decision"). Here, by using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that brain regions mediating language processes participate in neural networks activated by perceptual decision. When subjects performed a <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> task on easy-to-name and hard-to-name colored squares, largely overlapping cortical regions were identified, which included areas of the occipital cortex critical for color vision and regions in the bilateral frontal gyrus. Crucially, however, in comparison with hard-to-name colored squares, <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> of easy-to-name colors evoked stronger activation in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, two regions responsible for word-finding processes, as demonstrated by a localizer experiment that uses an explicit color patch naming task.

40|$|The recent {{focus on}} the perceptual deficits of {{children}} with learning disabilities has led edu-cators to ask whether an instructional program should be directed at a child's perceptual strengths or weaknesses. In this study, a sample of {{children with learning disabilities}} was divided into two groups, one with au-ditory perceptual strengths (audiles), the other with <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> strengths (visiles). The differences between the strong and weak per-ceptual skills within each group were statisti-cally significant. Other perceptual and language {{differences between the two groups}} were not significantly different. An experimental Word Form Configuration Training Program, which directed all teaching input through the visual modality, significantly modified the <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> behavior and reading achievement of the visile and not the audile children in the experimental groups. Verbal intelligence has been clearly delineated to relate to reading achievement for most populations of children, except for those with learning disabilities, who, by definition, have normal intelligence. Visual perception, one of the central information processing behaviors, has been reported to have a high positive relationship to academic achievement for learn-ing disabled children (Chalfant and Scheffelin, 1969). Visual perception is the ability to discriminate among the figural characteristics of form, which in reading means the physical properties of letters and words. Learning dis-ability was operationally defined as a year or more of perceptual deficit, normal verbal intel-ligence (IQ of 85 or above), and at least six months of academic achievement difficulty in one subject area. In this study, the subject area was limited to reading.

Particularly noteworthy is the finding that the amount of bias induced by a subtle, nonevaluative cue can far exceed the bias induced by overt and well-established evaluative cues. In addition, the effects these cues have on <b>perceptual</b> <b>discrimination</b> diverge from the effects they have on preference. (c) 2007 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{perception}} {{is an important}} cognitive ability with major influence on child development. To support the results of studies published previously the <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> abilities of children suffering from dyslexia, dyscalculia, and developmental coordination disorder as well as children that had a perinatal or early childhood stroke are compared. Different models of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> processing exist. The present work refers to Frostig´s three level model describing visual perception as an exceptional level between sensation and cognition. As the diagnosis <b>Visual</b> <b>Perceptual</b> Disorder is neither provided by the ICD- 10 nor by the DSM- 5 the guidelines of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften (AWMF) (German working committee of the scientific medical professional associations) are used {{within the framework of}} this dissertation. The scores of 241 children aged between 9 and 14 years on the German version of the Developmental Test of Visual Perception - Adolescent and Adult (DTVP-A) are compared. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis-H-Test was used for comparative analyses. Furthermore the percentage of children of the different groups who achieved clinical relevant scores and those children who have <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> disorders based on the guidelines of the AWMF are presented. Children with dyslexia achieve superior results compared to children from the other groups. Based on pairwise comparisons results of the main scale General Visual Perception Index tend to differ between the dyscalculia and the dyslexia group. No significant differences between groups are found in the subscale Motor-Reduced Visual Perception Index. In the subscale Visual-Motor Integration Index stroke and dyslexia group differ significantly in pairwise comparisons. Further significant differences are observed in the pairwise group comparisons of the scores in the subtests Form Constancy (dyslexia vs. dyscalculia), Copying (dyscalculia vs. coordination disorder) and Visual-Motor Speed (dyslexia vs. dyscalculia and dyslexia vs. stroke). 39 % of the children suffering from dyscalculia, 36 % of the children who suffered a stroke, 33 % of the children with coordination disorder and 11 % of those with dyslexia achieve clinical relevant scores (= scores at least 1. 5 SD below standardized average) on the General Visual Perception Index. Children within the stroke group remarkably often achieve clinical relevant scores in the Visual-Motor Integration Index (43 %) {{as well as in the}} subtests Visual Closure and Form Constancy (18 %, respectively). A large amount of children with dyslexia achieve clinical relevant results in the subtests Copying and Visual Closure (17 %, respectively). Within the dyscalculia group a large number of children perform 1. 5 SD below average in the subtests Visual Closure (23 %), Form Constancy, Copying and Visual-Motor Search (26 %, respectively). Children with coordination disorder most frequently achieve clinical relevant results in the subtests Copying (38 %), Form Constancy (24 %), Visual Closure (19 %), Figure-Ground and Visual-Motor Search (14 %, respectively). Interestingly, as compared to the other groups children with dyslexia show less overall <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> deficits. A <b>Visual</b> <b>Perceptual</b> Disorder according to the AWMF-criteria (total score 1. 5 SD below average on the DTVP-A and 1. 5 SD below the General IQ) can be diagnosed for 11 % of the children of the stroke group and for 3 % of the dyslexia as well as the dyscalculia group. When using the Verbal Comprehension Index as reference score instead of the General IQ this pattern changes: 21 % of the stroke, 3 % of the dyslexia and 13 % of the dyscalculia group preserve the diagnosis. Concluding, the results presented in this dissertation thesis show the high incidence of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> deficits in children with developmental problems. As deficits in <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> abilities differ between groups it seems important to use standardized <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> tests in develop-mental diagnostics and intervention design. Furthermore, the diagnosis <b>Visual</b> <b>Perceptual</b> Disorder has to be defined more precisely. Hence, further studies on the role of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> deficits in children with developmental disorders such as developmental coordination disorder, dyscalculia, dyslexia and childhood stroke seem necessary. The same holds for studies on the effectiveness of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> therapies...|$|R
40|$|Children with perinatally {{acquired}} parenchymal haemorrhage {{are thought}} to have better <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> skills than those with leukomalacia. We examined seven prematurely born children with parenchymal haemorrhage and 14 with grades 2 - 4 leukomalacia, at the age of 5 years. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging parameters were related to <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> performance assessed with the L 94, using performance age. Belonging to the leukomalacia group, the inability to walk, a diminished peritrigonal white matter, a high degree of gliosis and cortical damage were associated with poorer visuo-perceptual skills. Enlarged lateral ventricles, confirming the findings of Melhelm (Radiology 214 (2000) 199), were associated with both cognitive, perceptual and motor problems and probably reflect the considerable extent of the brain damage. Specific factors protecting against <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> impairment were a preserved volume of the right optical radiation and of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Children with leukomalacia are at considerable risk of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> impairment. Children with right-sided parenchymal haemorrhages also appear to be at risk although they function much better due to better motor and cognitive skills. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Perceptual {{learning}} in an intensively studied phenomenon which promises to provide insights into general neural learning. Developing a computational model which unifies the diverse literature on <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> learning {{is an important}} step towards a mature theory of perceptual learning. Here, we identify a promising nascent model of <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> learning and systematically test it against prominent experimental results in the <b>visual</b> <b>perceptual</b> learning literature. The results of these investigations reveal important strengths and weaknesses which will inspire future improvements to the model and provide insight into the nature of the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual learning.
