50|$|Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) {{membrane}} roofing is {{also known}} as vinyl roofing. Vinyl is derived from two simple ingredients: fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce ethylene dichloride (EDC), which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). In the next step, known as polymerization, the VCM molecule forms chains, converting the gas into a fine, white powder - <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> - which becomes the basis for the final process, compounding. In compounding, <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> may be blended with additives such as stabilizers for durability, plasticizers for flexibility and pigments for color.|$|R
40|$|Free radical cured {{thermosetting}} <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resins</b> have superior toughness {{and chemical}} resistance {{in comparison to}} unsaturated polyester. The use of vinyl ester composites reinforced with carbon fibers requires an improvement in the fiber-matrix adhesion levels.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 A {{liquid crystal}} thermographic {{technique}} {{was developed for}} application to several problems in clinical medicine and physiology. The procedure was inexpensive, rapid, simple, versatile and acceptable to patients. Investigators {{in the past have}} used cholesteric liquid crystals for thermography but their use was limited to research in the medical field because the methods involved called for the direct spraying of the skin surface with the liquid crystals over a black paint. The present research has been involved in the development and fabrication of a liquid crystal dispersion thin film with very high elastomeric properties which provides perfect contact with the skin surface of a body of any configuration. Different films were prepared using plasticized <b>vinyl</b> <b>resins</b> in which the liquid crystals are dispersed. The final film yields optimum optical, thermal and mechanical characteristics and a long shelf life. Liquid crystal dispersions in plasticized polyvinyl chloride or copolymers of vinyl chloride and vinyl acetate were fabricated. However, polyvinyl butyral was selected since it forms strong, highly resilient films and yields optimum optical characteristics. After the film was perfected, a clinical comparative study was conducted to evaluate the new system. In this study, seventy-five volunteer women were given a breast examination using three modalities: (1) Liquid crystal thermography using the thin film. (2) Liquid crystal thermography using the direct spraying of the liquid crystals over a pre-blackened coat (Trade name [...] Lix Kit). (3) Infrared thermography using AGA Thermovision model 680 infrared thermography system. All positively read thermograms were followed up by a xeroradiography examination, the most recent and widely spread method for breast cancer detection. Positive thermographic signs were defined and a new interpretation scheme was introduced intended to reduce the false positive rate and to free the thermographic interpretation from the dependency on the experience of the reader. The new interpretation method was applied to one thousand random cases of patients who had breast examinations using infrared thermography, xeroradiography and pathological tests. This interpretation scheme is based on a trinary point system which penalizes each positive symptom by 1 or 2 points according to its severity. The total number of points which are assigned to the thermogram would make it negative, positive or equivocal. As a result of this method, the false positive rate which constitutes a major disadvantage of infrared thermographic techniques was reduced from 57. 4...|$|E
40|$|Marine fouling, or {{the growth}} of marine organisms on fully or partly {{submerged}} structures, is an unwanted phenomenon in the marine industry. Bio fouling will increase the hydrodynamic drag of ships, causing an increased fuel consumption, promote the corrosion of the metallic structures and trigger undesired transport of invasive species (IMO and the environment 2009, 2009). The impact is economic as well as environmental. More fuel consumption is synonym for more CO 2 and other detrimental emissions, corrosion entails coating {{and the introduction of}} toxic substances in the sea and air and the transport of hitch-hikers: non-indigenous species towards locations without natural enemies will harm the local delights of the marine environment. In 2001 the IMO adopted the "International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships". This convention entered into force 17 September 2008 and prohibited the use of harmful organotins in anti-fouling paints used on ships. A mechanism was established to prevent the future use of other potential harmful substances in anti-fouling systems. The ban on organotins confronted the marine industry with a major challenge. TBT's (TriButylTin) {{have a negative impact on}} the marine biotope but till today no equally efficient, harmless, substance has been found. The search for an efficient, economic and ecological friendly novel anti-fouling paint is high on the agenda of IMO, governments, paint producers, ship owners and environmental organizations. All major marine coating producers bring to the market very similar products. Broadly speaking, the present hull anti-fouling systems focus on the following three generic types of AF-coating: firstly, hard coatings, usually biocide-free vinyl esters, reinforced with glass platelets. In actual fact this is not a real anti-fouling coating since fouling will appear over time but it resists mechanical cleaning, even with hard brushes, exceptionally well. Secondly, we have a whole range of soft/smooth paints, often based on silicones or fluoropolymers, rendering the hull surface so slippery that latching onto becomes difficult. Basically this type of coating cleans itself by means of the speed of the ship, the organisms with little adhesion will flush of easily. Finally, the most popular type of fouling protection, have a toxic additive incorporated in the topcoat. Predominantly these additives are copper based products reinforced with booster biocides. Three different techniques are being used to release these toxins in a more or less controlled way. The most primitive system, dating from the 50 's, consist out of a soluble matrix, in general colophony mixed with copper, arsenic, zinc, mercury or iron oxides. A few years later, the binder became non-soluble, acrylic resins, <b>vinyl</b> <b>resins</b> or chlorinated rubber polymers were being used together with copper and zinc oxides with or without organometallic compounds. Presently mainly self-polishing copolymers are being used whereby biocides are leached under a controlled manner. While sailing the paint abrades and constantly a new layer of coating, mixed with zinc- or copper oxides emerges. Each of the above described AF-coatings has a very specific and limited field of application. Selecting the correct coating for a specific ship is far from self-evident. Important differences do exist within each coating type, dependent on the manufacturer. Unfortunately, no real objective means of comparing these products exists, neither on performance nor on ecological impact. The aim of this project is to establish an impartial test-protocol and build a platform for testing AF-coatings in a statically and dynamically manner. With knowledge of type, composition and performance of the anti-fouling paints tested we can advise the ship owners in an objective way and evaluate the ecological impact of a paint through a well-founded life cycle analysis...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} fiber diameter, trigger {{geometry}} and section geometry on the crush response of pultruded glass {{fiber reinforced plastic}} tubes, made with either polyester or <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resin,</b> was determined at crush rates from 2. 1 x 10 - 4 m/s to &mdash; 15 m/s. The rate dependence of the specific energy for the polyester resin tubes was positive, whereas that for the <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> tubes could be either positive or negative, depending upon the par-ticular tube geometry. Increases in the specific energy absorption, previously observed in quasi-static loading, caused by changes in the crush trigger geometry, were found also for dynamic loading. Reductions in the fiber diameter by one half (nominal), for the same glass content, decreased the specific energy by up to &sim; 20 %. Differences in the resin affect the quasi-static crush resistance, the <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resin</b> tubes having a significantly higher specific energy {{than that of the}} polyester resin tubes. These differences tend to diminish for dynamic crush. Fiber delamination occurs more profusely under dynamic loading con-ditions, and it is suggested that a crush mode change occurs on passing from quasi-static to dynamic loading. A tendency to crush in an unstable manner was found for some square sections under dynamic loading, possibly due to the accumulation of crush debris in the tube interior...|$|R
