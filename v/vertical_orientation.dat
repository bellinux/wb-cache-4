5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are {{typically}} 7.5–9 by 7.5–9µm, spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and thin-walled. Under a microscope, the spores appear hyaline (translucent), and are amyloid—meaning they will turn bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia are 30.5–57 by 8–16µm, four-spored, and not clamped at the base. The margin {{cells of the}} gills are plentiful, spherical, club-shaped or swollen spherically at the tip, hyaline, and measure 13–58 by 8–33µm. The cap cuticle consists of a 130–220µm wide, strongly gelatinised suprapellis (upper layer) and a dense, non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap are made of abundant spherical, elliptic and club-shaped cells that are 21–119 by 14.5–115µm, intermixed with hyphae 4–9µm wide and pale umber in colour, and either arranged irregularly, or with a <b>vertical</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{flesh of}} the cap {{consists}} {{of a number of}} microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the pileipellis) is between 8–10µm thick, and is made of a loose textura intricata, a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in KOH, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a <b>vertical</b> <b>orientation.</b> This in turn is followed by a layer 520µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls.

40|$|Abstract. A {{bistable}} {{pattern is}} shown with {{white and black}} bars with horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> which produce an impression of thin slabs stacked up in depth either toward or away from the observer. It is postulated that the ambiguity is induced by the observer's assumption of {{the direction of the}} light source. In our efforts to study the roles that orientation and luminance polarity play in texture segregation (Gorea and Papathomas 1989, 1990; Papathomas and Gorea 1990; Papathomas et a 1 1990), we almost accidentally produced the images shown in figure 1, in which white and black bars with horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> form staircase patterns. These patterns produce vivid impressions of three-dimensional objects arranged in depth. One possible percept is that of thin slabs, stacked on top of each other. Another is that of 3 -D steps or stepped rows of seats. The arrangement of both the top and bottom halves of figure l a seems to have two possible stable interpretations: as we traverse the path shown by the arrow, the slabs are stacked up either toward or away from us.

Ankylosaurids tend to have horizontal rather than an obliquely <b>vertical</b> <b>orientation</b> of zygapophyseal articulations in the free caudal vertebrae of the tail. This arrangement is most effective for side-to-side rather than vertical mobility.

40|$|Cells in {{the animal}} early visual cortex are {{sensitive}} to contour orientations and form repeated structures known as orientation columns. At the behavioral level, there exist 2 well-known global biases in orientation perception (oblique effect and radial bias) in both animals and humans. However, their neural bases are still under debate. To unveil how these behavioral biases are achieved in the early visual cortex, we conducted high-resolution {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} experiments with a novel continuous and periodic stimulation paradigm. By inserting resting recovery periods between successive stimulation periods and introducing a pair of orthogonal stimulation conditions that differed by 90 ° con-tinuously, we focused on analyzing a blood oxygenation level-dependent response modulated by the change in stimulus orientation and reliably extracted orientation preferences of single voxels. We found that there are more voxels preferring horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations,</b> a physiological substrate underlying the oblique effect, and that these over-representations of horizontal and vertical orien-tations are prevalent in the cortical regions near the horizontal- and vertical-meridian representations, a phenomenon related to the radial bias. Behaviorally, we also confirmed that there exists perceptual superiority for horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> around horizontal and vertical meridians, respectively. Our results, thus, refined the neural mechanisms of these 2 global biases in orientation perception...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVisual {{ability for}} sine waves and other {{narrowband}} stimuli shows an oblique effect—worst performance at obliques, best at horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations.</b> Recently, {{we have shown}} that with broadband stimuli (either 1 /fα visual noise or natural scenes), performance for detecting oriented content is worst at horizontal, best at the obliques, and intermediate at <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> (a “horizontal effect”). This horizontal effect has been explained by a cortical contrast normalization model that is both local (over orientation and spatial frequency) and anisotropic (due to a numerical bias of neurons with different preferred orientations). Here, the bandwidth of content at which an oblique effect or horizontal effect occurs was assessed in two suprathreshold matching experiments conducted with 1 /fα noise stimuli filtered with a triangle increment function of varied bandwidth (16 levels of orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth). The results provided further support for the local anisotropic normalization model in that an oblique effect was observed when a fairly small range of orientations and high spatial frequencies were tested and the horizontal effect was observed for broadband increments ⩾ 20 ° orientation bandwidth and ⩾ 1 -octave in frequency. At intermediate spatial frequency and orientation increment bandwidths, a blend of the two anisotropies was observed...|$|R
40|$|In {{images of}} natural scenes, a {{consistent}} relationship exists between spectral power and spatial frequency. The power spectrum falls {{off with a}} form 1 /fp as spatial frequency f increases, with values of p approximately equal to 2.

The second statistical characteristic computed was the angular spread of the power spectrum. This metric is a means to verify whether the image categories investigated tend to display more power in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations,</b> akin to natural images. It was found that these image categories have primarily isotropic spectral signatures with a much reduced anisotropy as compared to natural images. Along similar lines, we introduce a new measure called the anisotropy index which compares the power in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> with power in oblique orientations. The statistics thus presented are for the ensemble power spectrum. We also construct 4 classifiers to distinguish between natural images and astronomical, microscale, and underwate...|$|R
25|$|The player {{character}} can only jump {{and move to}} the left or right, however several different gameplay mechanics are applied to the game depending on the level. For example, one level can be rotated 90 degrees in the direction the player is facing to alter the level's gravity and <b>vertical</b> <b>orientation.</b> A second mechanic involves the use of a rope to swing through a level. Players can wrap the rope around cogs to rotate them. Yet another gameplay mechanic used involves a timer in the upper-right hand corner of the screen. When the timer reaches zero time effectively rewinds backwards the amount of time originally on the clock. The player character is unaffected, however a second, ghost image of the character will follow the movements the player made until the clock expired. This process repeats until the player completes the level. Should the player touch another iteration of the player character they fail the level. Several other mechanics are used throughout the levels, such as objects that change Shuggy's size, and teleportation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine how}} {{differently}} oriented components {{contribute to the}} discrimination of motion direction along a horizontal axis. Stimuli were two-frame random-dot kinematograms that were narrowband filtered in spatial frequency. On each trial, subjects had to state whether motion was {{to the left or}} the right. For each stimulus condition, Dmax (the largest displacement supporting 80 % correct direction discrimination performance) was measured. In experiment 1, Dmax was measured for orientationally narrowband stimuli as a function of their mean orientation. Dmax was found to increase as the orientation of the stimuli became closer to the axis of motion. Experiment 2 used isotropic stimuli in which some orientation bands contained a coherent motion signal, and some contained only noise. When the noise band started at <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> and increased until only horizontal orientations contained a coherent motion signal, Dmax increased slightly. This suggests that near-vertical orientations interfere with motion perception at large displacements when they contain a coherent motion signal. When the noise band started at horizontal and increased until only <b>vertical</b> <b>orientations</b> contained the motion signal, Dmax decreased steadily. This implies that Dmax depends at least partly on the most horizontal motion signal in the stimulus. These results were contrasted with two models. In the first, the visual system utilises the most informative orientations (nearest horizontal). In the second, all available orientations are used equally. Results supported an intermediate interpretation, in which all orientations are used but more informative ones are weighted more heavily. ...|$|R
