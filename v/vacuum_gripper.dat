40|$|Summary. A robotic {{research}} {{stand with}} a <b>vacuum</b> <b>gripper</b> {{for analysis of}} the tomato packing process was presented. On {{the basis of the}} research for the applied vacuum cup, the following parameters of the process of moving tomatoes were determined: operational negative pres-sure, conditions for picking and releasing vegetables. Properties of tomatoes were determined in regard to the research and the impact of the selected packing method on their condition was assessed- they were checked in regard to damages. It was proved that using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>gripper</b> with a vacuum cup BX 52 P in the process of packing tomatoes is possible. It was found that operational negative pressure of the value 0. 2 bar ensures a correct realisation of the packing process and does not cause any damages to vegetables. It was determined that releasing tomatoes during packing should take place at the height which enables their free slip into a packaging under the influence of gravity...|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{to take advantage of}} geometrical similarity of parts within a family in the design of a robotic gripper set for the quick-gripper-changer. The group technology concept was used to define the part families. Four different coding and classification methods are used to analyze and define the sets of grippers. These methods include two different coding methods and two different classification methods. The coding methods include production flow analysis (PFA) based on a process routing and the Opitz system based on a part geometry. The classification methods include rank order cluster analysis (ROCA) and cluster analysis with similarity coefficients (CASA). The following four methods have been used in this study to group parts into families. (1) Production flow analysis/Rank order cluster analysis. (2) Production flow analysis/Cluster analysis with similarity coefficient. (3) Opitz/Rank order cluster analysis. (4) Opitz/Cluster analysis with similarity coefficient;Softwares for the four coding and classification methods were developed in this research. By means of the software, part families were defined.

40|$|Within this {{research}} an experimental {{set up to}} drape carbon fibres mechanically was established. The set up generated lower standard deviations than the manually draped fibres. Likewise the deviations between simulation and reality were much lower but still show errors due to incorrect draping. Also {{the evaluation of the}} comparison could further be developed and shows trends for a good comparison criterion. Knowing these circumstances a lot of improvement of the experimental setup can be done to prevent incorrect draping. Therefore the kinematic endeffector has to be further developed and also the strategy for the <b>vacuum</b> <b>grippers</b> has to be improved. The kinematic of the ribs should be changed by generating a non-consistent curvature along them. This would lead to a better fit of the endeffector to the tooling and therefore to a reduction of non-controllable draping behaviour by dropping the cut piece. By changing the force induced by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>grippers</b> the gliding of the cut piece could be more controllable. Also the realization of the seed-point from the draping simulation could be more precise. Another improvement could be achieved by changing the draping simulation and the resulting flattened cut piece. Since the simulation was production-oriented for manually draping the seed point and the fibre orientation could be changed to suit the kinematic endeffector better. The material itself could also be changed to fit the mechanically draped process better. The material was impregnated with a binder and therefore relatively stiff.

Water must be provided by an external device because they work in air, and capillary forces appear during the release because water does not evaporate completely. Then they have to be combined with other release strategies to detach manipulated objects. In addition, they must work with particular environmental conditions like low temperature and low humidity [9], [13]. The miniaturization of these grippers is limited by the release difficulties.

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{assembly}} of battery cells, handling of the single sheet electrodes is a critical task.

These systems are generally associated with huge investments. For certain manufacturing applications {{it is interesting}} to investigate alternatives to find simpler and less costly automation. One example of an automated system could be the use of a standard industrial robot to pick single prepreg plies from an automated cutting machine and stack them to form a plane laminate. This paper is based on a case illustrating a product from the aircraft manufacturing industry. The case will demonstrate a pick and place concept on a general level and illustrate challenges that must be solved. The challenge selected to be the main focus for this paper is an automated process for backing paper removal. A literature review of different gripping technologies reveals several interesting technologies, and the most promising are tested for backing paper removal.

The main focus of the prototype system was the design of an automated disassembly tool with the ability to remove the snap-fit cover and the batteries contained within. The design concept conceived to release the snap-fit and the batteries was a force sensing tool tip utilizing force sensing resistors (FSRs). The sensor feedback from the FSRs was used to control the movement of the tool during disassembly operations. A pneumatically actuated <b>vacuum</b> <b>gripper</b> and electromagnet system was developed for recovering the snap-fit cover and batteries once they were released by the disassembly tool. The disassembly module was mounted on the tool head of a three-axis translational motion robot. A Visual Basic GUI was developed to interface and control the robot with a Galil digital motion controller. The Visual Basic application was used to program an automated disassembly routine for the removal of the snap-fit cover and batteries. A model-based computer vision application was also developed in Visual C++ using a Kinect sensor and the OpenCV library to identify and localize the electronic device placed on the disassembly robot. The information gathered by the model-based computer vision application was used by the robot to load the necessary device parameters and compute the snap-fit and battery coordinates.
