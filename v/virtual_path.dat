There may exist, however, some <b>virtual</b> <b>paths</b> in an ATM network with low volumes of traffic on them. Balancing between efficient utilization of transmission resources en route and keeping intermediate switching to the minimum, lightly loaded <b>virtual</b> <b>paths</b> are decomposed into at most two logical hops, which require only one intermediate switching for an end-to-end traffic stream. The decomposition procedure and data structure for efficient implementation are described.

50|$|The leaky bucket as a meter {{can be used}} {{in either}} traffic shaping or traffic policing. For example, in ATM networks, {{in the form of the}} Generic Cell Rate Algorithm, it is used to compare the {{bandwidth}} and burstiness of traffic on a Virtual Channel (VC) or <b>Virtual</b> <b>Path</b> (VP) against the specified limits on the rate at which cells may arrive and the maximum jitter, or variation in inter-arrival intervals, for the VC or VP. In traffic policing, cells that do not conform to these limits (nonconforming cells) may be discarded (dropped) or may be reduced in priority (for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion). In traffic shaping, cells are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used in UPC/NPC to protect the network against excess or excessively bursty traffic, see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions exceeding the bandwidth or jitter limits and being discarded by traffic management functions in the network, see network scheduling and network scheduler.|$|E
