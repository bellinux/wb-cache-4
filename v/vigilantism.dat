5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting <b>vigilantism</b> also took its toll.|$|E
5|$|The {{end of the}} Johnson County War also {{marked the}} end of the open range in Wyoming. By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their {{monopoly}} and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as <b>vigilantism</b> and confiscation of cattle were finally stopped. Many prominent leaders of the Association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} vigilante {{justice and the}} Montana Vigilantes began in 1863 in what {{was at the time}} a remote part of eastern Idaho Territory. Vigilante {{activities}} continued, although somewhat sporadically, through the Montana Territorial period until the territory became the state of Montana on November 8, 1889. <b>Vigilantism</b> arose because territorial law enforcement and the courts had very little power in the remote mining camps during the territorial period.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed <b>vigilantism</b> would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{directed}} and scored the crime drama Mystic River (2003), a film dealing with themes of murder, <b>vigilantism</b> {{and sexual abuse}} and starring Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins. The film was praised by critics and won two Academy Awards – Best Actor for Penn and Best Supporting Actor for Robbins – with Eastwood garnering nominations for Best Director and Best Picture. The film grossed $90million domestically on a budget of $30million. In 2003 Eastwood was named Best Director of the Year by the National Society of Film Critics.|$|E
5|$|The episode, first {{aired on}} Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers {{and was very}} well {{received}} by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, where five children were killed. Its horror aspects are reminiscent of the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitization, violence as entertainment, <b>vigilantism,</b> the concept of justice and punishment, {{and the nature of}} reality.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, <b>vigilantism</b> and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|Much of Buckner's {{time was}} spent trying to curb {{violence}} {{in the eastern part}} of the state. Shortly after his inauguration, the Rowan County War escalated to <b>vigilantism,</b> when residents of the county organized a posse and killed several of the leaders of the feud. Though this essentially ended the feud, the violence had been so bad that Buckner's adjutant general recommended that the Kentucky General Assembly dissolve Rowan County, though this suggestion was not acted upon. In 1888, a posse from Kentucky entered West Virginia and killed a leader of the Hatfield clan in the Hatfield-McCoy feud. This caused a political conflict between Buckner and Governor Emanuel Willis Wilson of West Virginia, who complained that the raid was illegal. The matter was adjudicated in federal court, and Buckner was cleared of any connection to the raid. Later in Buckner's term, feuds broke out in Harlan, Letcher, Perry, Knott, and Breathitt counties.|$|E

25|$|The series explores <b>vigilantism,</b> {{government}} {{corruption and}} racism, and depicts an outlaw motorcycle club as an analogy for human transformation.

25|$|Mark Gruenwald {{became the}} writer of the series with issue #307 (July 1985) and wrote 137 issues for 10 {{consecutive}} years from until #443 (Sept. 1995), the most issues by any single author in the character's history. Gruenwald created several new foes, including Crossbones and the Serpent Society. Other Gruenwald characters included Diamondback, Super Patriot, and Demolition Man. Gruenwald explored numerous political and social themes as well, such as extreme idealism when Captain America fights the anti-nationalist terrorist Flag-Smasher; and <b>vigilantism</b> when he hunts the murderous Scourge of the Underworld.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco was {{the county}} seat of San Francisco County, one of state's 18 {{original}} counties since California's statehood in 1850. Until 1856, the city limits extended west to Divisadero Street and Castro Street, and south to 20th Street. In response to the lawlessness and <b>vigilantism</b> that escalated rapidly between 1855 and 1856, the California government decided to divide the county. A straight line was then drawn across {{the tip of the}} San Francisco Peninsula just north of San Bruno Mountain. Everything south of the line became San Mateo County while everything north of the line became the new consolidated City and County of San Francisco, to date the only consolidated city-county in California.|$|E
25|$|The Republicans {{refused to}} return to the Senate, and the House refused to {{continue}} communications with the Senate, effectively ending the legislative session. Despite all the fighting, Robertson was not seated. Gray dropped his attempt to be elected to the Senate, and the situation fueled the public's support of an amendment to make senators elected by popular vote. Gray only achieved three of his campaign goals while governor. He was able to have funds appropriated to begin construction of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument. He also successfully advocated the switch from a short ballot to a long ballot following several years of high voter fraud. He also successfully had the White Caps, a group involved in <b>vigilantism</b> {{in the southern part of}} the state, investigated and broken up.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} 1989 following an address by Yusuf {{to students at}} London's Kingston University, where {{he was asked about}} the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, author of the novel The Satanic Verses. Yusuf made a series of comments that appeared to show his support for the fatwa. He released a statement the following day denying that he supported <b>vigilantism,</b> and claiming that he had merely recounted the legal Islamic punishment for blasphemy. In a 2006 BBC interview, he displayed a newspaper clipping from that period, with quotes from his statement. Subsequent comments made by him in 1989 on a British television programme were also seen as being in support of the fatwa. In a statement in the FAQ section of one of his websites, Yusuf asserted that while he regretted the comments, he was joking and that the show was improperly edited. In the years since these comments, he has repeatedly denied ever calling for the death of Rushdie or supporting the fatwa.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Judge Lyman Munson's {{arrival in}} Helena, he convened a Grand Jury on August 12, 1865. [...] However, unlike Judge Hosmer in Alder Gulch, Munson made no remarks about <b>vigilantism</b> {{nor did he}} {{threaten}} vigilantes with prosecution if they continued their activities. The vigilantes showed little respect for Munson's court and proceeded to carry out at least 14 executions in the next eight months. [...] No member of Helena's vigilantes was ever indicted by Munson's grand jury for executions {{carried out by the}} Helena Committee of Safety. [...] The last execution by the Helena vigilantes occurred on April 27, 1870 when Joseph Wilson and Arthur Compton were hanged from the [...] "Old Hangman's Tree" [...] for the robbery and attempted murder of George Leonard. [...] The double hanging is significant because it was photographed at the time and the image, widely circulated, had the effect of seriously dampening public sentiment for <b>vigilantism.</b>|$|E
500|$|During the Golden Age, {{a female}} {{character}} was introduced as a love interest for Robin. Betty Kane as [...] "Bat-Girl" [...] was depicted as the niece of and Robin-like sidekick {{to the original}} Batwoman. In 1964, however, editor Julius Schwartz asserted that Bat-Girl and other characters in the Bat-Family should be removed considering the decline in sales and restored the Batman mythology to its original conception of heroic <b>vigilantism.</b> During the Crisis on Infinite Earths storyline, Betty Kane was retconned out of existence.|$|E
500|$|The Real IRA {{has also}} been {{involved}} in <b>vigilantism,</b> mainly against alleged drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it {{has been accused of}} extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs. In July 2012 it was reported that Republican Action Against Drugs (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA. As before, the group continues to refer to itself as [...] "the Irish Republican Army", but the new group has been referred as the [...] "New IRA" [...] in the press.|$|E
500|$|DC Comics {{abandoned}} {{these characters}} in 1964 when newly appointed Batman-editor Julius Schwartz judged them too silly and therefore inappropriate. Schwartz had asserted that these characters should be removed, considering the Batman related comic books had steadily declined in sales, and restored the Batman mythology {{to its original}} conception of heroic <b>vigilantism.</b> Bat-Girl, along with other characters in the Batman Family, were retconned out of existence following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, even though Bat-Girl {{did not exist in}} the post-Crisis continuity, {{a modified version of the}} character, Mary Elizabeth [...] "Bette" [...] Kane, introduced as the superhero Flamebird, continues to appear in DC Comics publications.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Frederick Allen, a {{journalist}} and historian, published A Decent and Orderly Lynching:The Montana Vigilantes reviewed as an up-to-day balanced account of Montana's vigilante history (1864–1870). Allen's book reinforces the motivations and methods [...] of the earliest vigilantes in Alder Gulch while commenting on the growing disdain for <b>vigilantism</b> in the late 1860s. [...] More generalist works on Montana history such as Merrill G. Burlingame's The Montana Frontier (1942) and Michael P. Malone's Montana-A History of Two Centuries (1991) adequately summarize the vigilante period largely based on earlier accounts by Dimsdale, Langford and Biedler. [...] Additionally, many topical histories of Montana, such as novelist and Montana historian Dan Cushman's Montana: The Gold Frontier (1973) cover the vigilante period.|$|E
500|$|As {{the gold}} fields of Alder Gulch and Grasshopper Creek {{declined}} in 1865, prospectors and fortune seekers migrated to newly discovered areas {{in and around}} Last Chance Gulch (now Helena, Montana). As lawlessness increased, vigilante justice continued there {{with the formation of}} the Committee of Safety in 1865. [...] During the period 1865–1870, at least 14 alleged criminals were executed by Helena's vigilantes. In 1884, ranchers in Central and Eastern Montana resorted to vigilante justice to deal with cattle rustlers and horse thieves. The best-known vigilante group in that area were [...] "Stuart's Stranglers", organized by Granville Stuart in the Musselshell region. [...] As formal law enforcement became more prevalent in the region, <b>vigilantism</b> fell into decline.|$|E
500|$|In the Detective Comics title, Batman {{recruits}} Batwoman to help run a [...] "boot camp" [...] {{for young}} heroes, consisting of Red Robin, Orphan, Spoiler and Clayface. [...] Batwoman is essentially Batman's co-lead {{in the first}} arc (#934-#940), which depicts the team fighting a group that mimics Batman's methods. [...] The next two issues {{are part of the}} crossover event Night of the Monster Men. [...] Issues 943-947 cover a group of [...] "collateral damage" [...] individuals called The Victim Syndicate, attempting {{to put an end to}} Batman's <b>vigilantism.</b> [...] Issues 948 and 949 are collectively called Batwoman Begins. [...] These two issues are a prologue for Batwoman getting her own title again.|$|E
500|$|<b>Vigilantism</b> in pre-{{territorial}} {{and territorial}} Montana {{has been written}} about, romanticized and chronicled in personal memoirs, biographies, documentary and scholarly works, film and fiction {{for well over a}} century. The first book published in Montana was Thomas J. Dimsdale's 1866 first edition of The Vigilantes of Montana, [...] which was compiled from a series of newspaper articles he wrote for the Montana Post in 1865. [...] Historical analysis of the period ranges from disrepute to heroism, with debates over whether the lack of any functioning justice system and the understanding of due process at the time meant the vigilantes acted in a way they thought was best for their communities or if modern standards of due process should govern analysis of their actions.|$|E
500|$|In Canada, {{following}} {{a meeting in}} Toronto on December 22, 2003 between Hastings and officials from the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Business Services, Manhunt became the first computer game in Ontario to be classified as a film and was restricted to adults on February 3, 2004. Apart from Ontario, however, Manhunt {{had little or no}} classification problems elsewhere in North America. The British Columbia Film Classification Office reviewed the game after the controversy in Ontario and deemed the Mature rating by the ESRB to be appropriate. In Germany, the Amtsgericht in Munich confiscated all versions of Manhunt on July 19, 2004 for violation of [...] ("representation of violence"). According to the court, the game portrays the killing of humans as fun. They also said it glorified <b>vigilantism,</b> which they considered harmful.|$|E

Erion and Zeccardi assert that Marge has [...] "virtuous personality traits" [...] which they compare to Aristotle, commenting: [...] "Whether breaking up a counterfeit jeans ring run out of her garage in [...] "The Springfield Connection", escaping a cult commune in [...] "The Joy of Sect", or standing up to a Poe-ssessed [...] "Treehouse of Horror". Marge is rarely short on courage." [...] They also note that [...] "Marge's crime-stopping <b>vigilantism</b> in [...] "The Springfield Connection" [...] and her dangerous escape from the Movementarian commune in [...] "The Joy of Sect" [...] demonstrate that she is genuinely brave, but not foolhardy." ...|$|E
500|$|Evans {{published}} {{instructions for}} local Klan leaders that detailed {{how to run}} meetings, recruit new members, and speak to local gatherings. He advised leaders to avoid [...] "raving hysterically" [...] in favor of [...] " [...] scientific ... presentation of facts". In addition, he urged them to forbid members from bringing their Klan regalia home from meetings and to perform background checks on applicants. He instructed Klan members to shun <b>vigilantism</b> but to assist police and attempted, with some success, to recruit police officers into the Klan. Emphasizing the difference between his organization and the more violent 19th-century Ku Klux Klan, Evans formed Klan-themed groups for children. As the Klan attempted to portray itself as a movement led by cultured, well-educated people, its leaders spoke about education in the U.S. Evans believed that public schools could create a homogeneous society and saw education advocacy as an effective form of public relations.|$|E
500|$|Historian Daniel Belgrad {{argues that}} in the 1880s {{centralized}} range management was emerging as {{the solution to the}} overgrazing that had depleted open ranges. Moreover, cattle prices at the time were low. Larger ranchers also were hurt by mavericking (taking lost, unbranded calves from other ranchers' herds), and responded by organizing cooperative roundups, blacklisting, and lobbying for stricter anti-maverick laws. These ranchers formed the WSGA and hired gunmen to hunt down rustlers, but local farmers resented the ranchers' collective political power. The farmers moved toward decentralization and the use of private winter pastures. Randy McFerrin and Douglas Wills argue that the confrontation represented opposing property rights systems. The result {{was the end of the}} open-range system and the ascendancy of large-scale stock ranching and farming. The popular image of the war, however, remains that of <b>vigilantism</b> by aggressive landed interests against small individual settlers defending their rights.|$|E
500|$|On June 8, 1865, John Keene and Harry Slater, {{two men who}} had an {{unresolved}} quarrel {{from their}} days in Salt Lake City, spotted each other in Sam Greer's saloon on Helena's Bridge Street. Keene shot Slater in the head, killing him instantly. [...] Keene surrendered himself to Helena sheriff George Wood and freely admitted his guilt in the shooting. [...] A two-day trial ensued where {{some members of the}} jury were known vigilantes from Alder Gulch. Since there was no official trial judge, Stephan Reynolds, a respected member of the Helena community, presided. [...] At the end of the trial, the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict and Keene was hanged from the lone pine tree just outside town. [...] The large tree, one of few that remained in proximity to Helena because most had been cut down for lumber, became known as the [...] "Old Hangman's Tree". [...] Although Keene's trial and execution was not considered <b>vigilantism,</b> the Helena community, similar to the Alder Gulch community in 1863, felt the need to establish a more reliable means of law and order.|$|E
500|$|Jon O'Brien of Metro and James Poniewozik of The New York Times {{identified}} <b>vigilantism</b> as {{a central}} concept in the story. Writing for Esquire, Corey Atad commented {{it is about the}} societal [...] "appetite for punishment", while Sam Parker of The Huffington Post and Andrew Liptak of The Verge considered it represents [...] "a cruel society's fantasy of 'real justice" [...] and a [...] "perverted justice" [...] respectively. More specifically, it deals with the remote punishment done via the anonymity of the Internet, according to some of TheWrap staff members and Page. While Sims stated there are parallels between Victoria's suffering and the crime she committed, Joyner considered these parallels to be central to the episode's critique. When her crime is revealed, Joyner wrote, [...] "the construction of the White Bear centre becomes apparent now, as a real-life karmic experience for the general public who wish to see biblical retribution". Mark Monahan of The Telegraph wrote that the episode [...] "mocked, above all, our insatiable, voyeuristic, neo-Medieval thirst for supposedly 'real-life' pain and humiliation repackaged as entertainment". Jeffery stated it depicted how society turns horror into entertainment, and Parker concluded, [...] "The fact Victoria was a murderer allows them to accept her suffering, but it's the mobile phones that allow them to enjoy it - after all, she's just a character on their screens." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} [...] "I'm Not Fooled By That Cheap Disguise", a 1991 essay {{deconstructing}} the Batman mythos, refer to Anarky {{as a challenge}} to Batman's social and political world view, and to the political position indirectly endorsed by the themes of a Batman adventure. As the Batman mythos is centered on themes of retribution and the protection of property rights, the invitation to readers to identify with Batman's <b>vigilantism</b> is an invitation to adopt political authoritarianism. The authors summarize that position as [...] "the inviolability of property relations and the justification of their defense by any means necessary (short of death)." [...] However, the authors contend that Anarky [...] "potentially redefines crime" [...] and invites the reader to identify with a new political position in favor of the disenfranchised, which Batman [...] "can not utterly condemn". The authors contend that the creation of Anarky and dialogue by other characters represented a shift towards [...] "self-conscious awareness of the Batman's hegemonic function, questioning the most central component of the Batman's identity—the nature of crime and his relation to it." [...] However, the authors remain skeptical of Anarky's commercial nature, pointing out Anarky could be [...] "incorporated as another marketing technique [...] The contradictions of capitalism would thus permit the commodification of criticisms as long as they resulted in profits." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Judge" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, finding its [...] "contrived" [...] plot to be [...] "barely a subtle premise", and noting that [...] "the script unfortunately elevates the lead villain to high camp". Shearman and Pearson felt that the subject of <b>vigilantism</b> was a suitable one for the series, {{and that it had}} [...] "been bubbling under the surface every since the concept of the Millennium Group ... was first mentioned"; however, they ultimately felt that the episode contained [...] "very little to engage the brain". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "The Judge" [...] 4 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "a fine, moody episode". However, Gibron felt that Marshall Bell's character may have been better suited to a recurring role, rather than being killed off during the episode. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B-, praising the acting of both Bell and John Hawkes. However, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "The Judge" [...] showed Millennium to be struggling with its own concept, growing [...] "staid" [...] as a result of only having [...] "the one color to play with".|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Chuck Dixon’s Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) {{led to the}} comic series Birds of Prey {{starring}} the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form {{the nucleus of the}} Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: [...] "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator {{and one of the most}} fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did wonderful things with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She’s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she’s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place." [...] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon’s origin with the miniseries [...] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to <b>vigilantism</b> in the previous origin myths.|$|E
500|$|Romantic {{notions of}} the 1920s as a more {{innocent}} period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In {{addition to being a}} Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong {{and the way in which}} powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. [...] " [...] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," [...] he said, [...] "It's happened even in recent years... so it was nice to comment [...] by going back to real events in 1928." [...] Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as [...] "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a [...] "golden age" [...] in the city. In Changeling, this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed [...] "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: [...] "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." [...] It compares police excess to the <b>vigilantism</b> of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s, as the department's [...] "Gun Squad" [...] carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.|$|E
