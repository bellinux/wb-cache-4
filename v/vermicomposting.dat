Solid waste is disposed of in a nearby dumping ground, which also houses the town's crematorium. Doorstep collection of garbage and segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste have been implemented since 2003. <b>Vermicomposting</b> of vegetable waste is carried out {{with the help of}} non-governmental organisations. In June 2009, in order to reduce waste, the municipality proposed a ban on plastic carrier bags and sachets in the town.|$|E

Las plantas se cultivaron en sustrato de turba (peat moss) adicionado con 0, 20, 40, 60 y 80 mM de NaCl y complementado con o sin 10 % (v/v) de <b>vermicompost.</b> Sin <b>vermicompost,</b> la sobrevivencia de las plantas fue de 20 %) en el tratamiento con 80 mM de NaCl, pero con <b>vermicompost</b> la sobrevivencia fue de 85 %o. Sin <b>vermicompost</b> el crecimiento de las plantas se redujo en dos veces a 20 mM de NaCl, pero con <b>vermicompost</b> no se encontró efecto inhibitorio. La fotosíntesis se redujo en las plantas en el tratamiento con 20 mM de NaCl, sin <b>vermicompost,</b> pero no se encontró inhibición cuando la turba fue adicionada con <b>vermicompost.</b> Se encontró que la <b>vermicompost</b> tiene un enorme potencial para limitar el efecto negativo de la salinidad sobre el crecimiento de las plantas de tamarindo. In {{the present}} study the effect of supplementing peat moss at {{different}} salinities with sheep manure <b>vermicompost</b> on survival, growth and photosynthesis of Tamarind plantlets (Tamarindus indica) was investigated in a greenhouse experiment.

Photosynthesis was reduced in the plantlets in the 20 mM NaCl treatment without <b>vermicompost,</b> but no inhibition was found when peat moss was added with <b>vermicompost.</b> It was found that <b>vermicompost</b> has a huge potential to limit negative effect of salinity on growth of tamarind plants...|$|R
30|$|In a field study, {{effect of}} <b>vermicompost</b> {{produced}} solely from an allelopathic weed parthenium {{has been investigated}} on germination, growth, yield, and quality of ladies finger (Abelmoschus esculentus). The effect of the <b>vermicompost</b> in inducing resistance in ladies finger against disease was also assessed. In general <b>vermicompost</b> application increased germination success, plant growth, and yield—the positive effect increased in prominence as the extent of <b>vermicompost</b> application was enhanced from 2.5 to 5  t/ha. Parthenium <b>vermicompost</b> also induced beneficial changes in the biochemical and mineral content of the ladies finger. Additionally, ipomoea <b>vermicompost</b> induced resistance in ladies finger towards disease and pest attacks. Overall, contrary to the toxic and allelopathic nature of parthenium, its <b>vermicompost</b> manifests the attributes of highly plant-friendly organic fertilizer that <b>vermicomposts</b> derived from animal manure are known to possess.|$|R
25|$|Small-scale <b>vermicomposting</b> is well-suited to turn {{kitchen waste}} into {{high-quality}} soil amendments, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that bin composting requires.|$|E
25|$|There are few food wastes that <b>vermicomposting</b> cannot compost, {{although}} meat {{waste and}} dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract vermin. Green waste should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin.|$|E
25|$|Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm humus or worm manure) is the {{end-product}} of {{the breakdown}} of organic matter by an earthworm.

40|$|Growth and {{survival}} performance of Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Macrobrachium rosenbergii were studied by using farm yard manure (FYM), sugarcane trash <b>vermicompost</b> (STVC) and wheat straw <b>vermicompost</b> (WSVC) in rearing pond. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) {{were observed in}} the production of plankton in response to pond treated with FYM, STVC and WSVC. The result have shown that wheat straw <b>vermicompost</b> is superior to farm yard manure and sugarcane trash <b>vermicompost</b> in respect to growth of C. catla and M. rosenbergii and Farm yard manure was superior to wheat straw <b>vermicompost</b> and sugarcane trash <b>vermicompost</b> in respect of growth of Labeo rohita. The average highest survival of 81 percent of L. rohita and C. catla was obtained with Wheat straw <b>vermicompost</b> followed by Sugarcane trash <b>vermicompost</b> (70 percent) and then by farmyard manure (69 percent). The manure and fertilizer used can be graded in the following order: WSVC, FYM and STVC. <b>Vermicompost</b> forms an abundant alternative natural resource for sustainable and biosecure aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vermicompost</b> is a bio-fertiliser that is {{obtained}} from the bio-conversion of organic waste using earthworms. However, this <b>vermicompost</b> exist in paste form thereby the need for granulation {{to make it easier}} to store and transport. <b>Vermicompost</b> was granulated using vermiwash as the binding agent. Vermiwash was chosen as an alternative over water due to the presence of fertiliser macro and micro nutrients in the vermiwash. The <b>vermicompost</b> nutritional composition was tested before and after granulation. The granulated <b>vermicompost</b> indicated a 48. 9 %, 55. 4 %, 75 % increase in nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) content upon granulating using vermiwash. The <b>vermicompost</b> ash content increased by 71. 2 % upon granulation whilst the moisture content decreased by 84 %. Granulation of <b>vermicompost</b> using vermiwash enhances the <b>vermicompost</b> NPK composition at the same time making large scale production easier...|$|R
30|$|However, an {{important}} observation made by us during our investigations {{is that the}} application of tendu leaf <b>vermicompost</b> {{at a level of}} 100  % N through <b>vermicompost</b> resulted in significantly (p ≤  0.05) decreased growth parameters as compared to the treatments that received tendu leaf <b>vermicompost</b> at a level of 75 or 50  % N through <b>vermicompost</b> alone. This is indicative of some detrimental effect of tendu leaf <b>vermicompost</b> application above certain threshold concentrations on the growth of French bean plant. These observations corroborate with the reports of Cristina et al. (2010) who stated that substitution of peat with higher dose <b>vermicompost</b> resulted in detrimental effect on Pine seedling growth, and beneficial effects were observed only at lower doses of <b>vermicompost</b> in potting media.|$|R
25|$|There may be {{differences}} in <b>vermicomposting</b> methods {{depending on the}} climate. It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high heat-retentive properties), as the feedstocks used can compost, heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.|$|E
25|$|The {{dark brown}} waste liquid, or leachate, that drains {{into the bottom}} of some <b>vermicomposting</b> systems as water-rich foods break down, is best applied back to the bin when added {{moisture}} is needed due to the possibility of phytotoxin content and organic acids that may be toxic to plants.|$|E
25|$|For <b>vermicomposting</b> at home, a large {{variety of}} bins are commercially available, or {{a variety of}} adapted {{containers}} may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, Styrofoam, or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.|$|E
30|$|The {{main problem}} that can arise from {{excessive}} <b>vermicompost</b> application is plant toxicity {{due to high}} salt content. With leaching, {{the negative effects of}} <b>vermicompost</b> related to high EC (Gutierrez-Miceli et al. 2007) decreased and continuous application of this material may be possible. The leachate <b>vermicompost,</b> vermiwash and <b>vermicompost</b> can be used as organic fertilizers for sustainable peppermint cultivation.|$|R
30|$|The study {{revealed}} that the seed germination, shoot and root length, shoot and root fresh weights, shoot and root dry weights, thousand grain weight and grain weight per plant increased significantly (p ≤  0.05) compared to control due to application of <b>vermicompost</b> when used at proper proportions. Thus, the growth and yield parameters were significantly (p ≤  0.05) greater in T 2 (75  % N through <b>vermicompost)</b> than in T 1 (100  % N through <b>vermicompost)</b> and T 3 (50  % N through <b>vermicompost).</b> Many growth parameters of T 1 were lower {{than those in the}} control indicating some deleterious effect of <b>vermicompost</b> at higher concentrations. The combined application of tendu leaf <b>vermicompost</b> and urea increased the growth and yield of Phaseolus vulgaris significantly (p ≤  0.05). The maximum grain yield was due to combined application of <b>vermicompost</b> at 25  % N through <b>vermicompost</b> plus 75  % N through urea.|$|R
30|$|The pH was {{slightly}} acidic in the <b>vermicompost,</b> {{followed by the}} raw material and the cow manure, i.e., 6.50, 6.50 and 6.20, respectively. The soluble salt concentrations (measured as electric conductivity) in the resulting <b>vermicompost,</b> raw material and cow manure were 3.71  mS/cm, 3.00  mS/cm and 5.72  mS/cm, respectively, indicating a slight decrease in salinity in the <b>vermicompost</b> compared to the cow manure. The total organic carbon was 18.53 %, 42.96 % and 21.02 % in the <b>vermicompost,</b> raw material and cow manure, respectively. The total nitrogen was 1.36 % in the <b>vermicompost</b> and 1.88 % in the raw material. The C/N ratio in the <b>vermicompost,</b> and cow manure was the same (13 : 1) but quite high (23 : 1) in the raw material. Total phosphorus was 0.58 %, 0.26 % and 0.78 % in the <b>vermicompost,</b> raw material and cow manure, respectively. The total potassium was 0.56 % in the <b>vermicompost,</b> 1.23 % in raw material and 0.86 % in cow manure, indicating {{a decrease in the}} <b>vermicompost,</b> compared to the cow manure and raw material. The total zinc, manganese, copper and iron concentrations are higher in the <b>vermicompost</b> than in the raw material, indicating an accumulation of these micro-elements in the <b>vermicompost,</b> but lower than in cow manure. <b>Vermicompost</b> contains essential micronutrients and the nutrient status is in line with that reported by earlier researchers (Ismail 1997; Ansari and Sukhraj 2010; Ansari et al. 2016).|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} worms used in {{composting}} systems, redworms (Eisenia foetida, Eisenia andrei, and Lumbricus rubellus) feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25°C (59-77°F). They can survive at 10°C (50°F). Temperatures above 30°C (86°F) may harm them. This temperature range means that indoor <b>vermicomposting</b> with redworms {{is possible in}} all but tropical climates. Other worms like Perionyx excavatus are suitable for warmer climates.

Large red chilli seeds purchased from the farm shop. Large red chilli seeds germinated in <b>vermicompost</b> mixed soil and covered with clear plastic. This study is an experiment with completely randomized design, four treatments and three replications.

30|$|These results {{indicate}} that addition of <b>vermicomposts</b> enhanced the growth and productivity of marigold plants. Atiyeh et al. (2000) have reported that after amendments of 10 – 20  % <b>vermicompost</b> in potting media, the tomato fruit yields increased significantly. Subler et al. (1998) reported that optimum plant growth responses occurred when 10 – 20  % <b>vermicompost</b> was amended with potting media which {{may be due to}} enhanced micronutrient availability, the presence of plant growth regulators, or the activity of beneficial microorganisms in the <b>vermicompost.</b> But when <b>vermicompost</b> concentration was > 40  % in the potting media then the number and diameter of the flowers reduced than control. These antagonistic effects at higher <b>vermicomposts</b> dosage may be due to reduction in aeration and porosity and increased salt concentrations (Tucker 2005). In the present study, potting media was amended up to 20  % with <b>vermicomposts</b> and no adverse effect of <b>vermicomposts</b> was recorded on any studied parameters.|$|R

30|$|Overall, {{there was}} a {{significant}} effect of compost type on the heavy metal concentrations in the <b>vermicomposts</b> (MANOVA, Pillai–Bartlett statistic[*]=[*] 1.95, p[*]<[*] 0.0001).

They were considerably higher in the steatite-enriched <b>vermicompost</b> than in the other composts. Although the concentrations of these metals were rather high, reflecting the high concentration of these elements present in the steatite (Table  1), only the Ni concentration (182.8  mg kg− 1) was higher than allowed under Brazilian legislation (Table  2). The Zn concentrations differed significantly among treatments (F 2, 15 [*]=[*] 2455.4; p[*]<[*] 0.001) and was higher in gneiss-enriched <b>vermicompost.</b> The Cu concentrations varied significantly with treatments (F 2, 15 [*]=[*] 9.5; p[*]=[*] 0.002); it did not differ between the steatite-enriched <b>vermicompost</b> and the unenriched <b>vermicompost,</b> but was lower in the <b>vermicompost</b> with gneiss (Table  3).

30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{examined}} growth of plants using <b>vermicompost</b> derived from different materials in green house conditions or in field studies (Atiyeh et al. 2000). All such studies indicated beneficial effects of <b>vermicompost</b> on plant growth. Recently, Manivannan et al. (2009) observed favorable effects of <b>vermicompost</b> on the growth and yield of beans and recommended the use of ptb (press mud, sugar cane thrash and fine bagasse) <b>vermicompost</b> alone or in combination with chemical fertilizer for improved productivity. Sutar (2009) reported increased growth and yield of Allium sativum L. (garlic) due to application of <b>vermicompost.</b> Chanda et al. (2011) studied the effect of <b>vermicompost</b> and other fertilizers on the growth of tomato plants and reported significant increase in growth parameters of the plants treated with <b>vermicompost</b> supplemented with chemical fertilizers. Cristina et al. (2010) studied influence of <b>vermicompost</b> on pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and reported significant inhibition of aerial and root biomass with high dose of solid <b>vermicompost.</b> Thus, despite large body of scientific evidence showing beneficial effect of plant growth and yield; there is also strong evidence that these effects are not general or constant (Cristina and Jorge 2011).|$|R
30|$|Application {{of three}} kinds of <b>vermicompost</b> {{significantly}} increased soil nutrient availability, nutrient uptake and crop yield {{as compared with the}} control (without <b>vermicompost</b> application) for four mustard cropping sequences. The application of <b>vermicompost</b> provided the highest availability of N and K in soils on the second soil sampling (after harvesting mustard 1). While the highest P nutrient availability was found on the first soil sampling (2  weeks after transplanting the first mustard cropping). Application of <b>vermicompost</b> directly affected nutrient uptake and mustard yield, where the highest was found in <b>vermicompost</b> with bedding derived from coconut husk with dose of 10 t ha− 1 but not significantly different with <b>vermicompost</b> using bedding of spent mushroom waste. The residual effect of <b>vermicompost</b> on the second mustard gave an increase in nutrient uptake and yield as compared with the direct effect, where the highest was found in <b>vermicompost</b> with bedding derived from the spent mushroom waste at rates of 10 – 15 t ha− 1 and sugarcane trash at a rate of 20 t ha− 1. <b>Vermicompost</b> with bedding sugarcane trash with a rate of 20 t ha− 1 provided the best residual effect on the third and fourth mustard sequential cropping. These results suggest that <b>vermicompost</b> application is required in organic farming systems to provide the best direct and residual effect on the availability of soil nutrient, plant nutrient uptake and crop yields.|$|R
