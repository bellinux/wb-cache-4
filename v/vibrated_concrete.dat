40|$|In {{reinforced}} concrete structures, understanding the bond mechanism {{is of great}} importance for the design (anchorage lengths, load bearing capacity, crack width, [...] .). Therefore this phenomenon has widely been studied for conventional <b>vibrated</b> <b>concrete.</b> For self-compacting concrete (SCC) however few test results are available and in practice the standards for conventional <b>vibrated</b> <b>concrete</b> (CVC) are applied to self-compacting concrete as well. To fill in this lack of knowledge and to develop adapted standards for predicting the bond of reinforcement in SCC, an experimental program has been set up. The bond strength of reinforcement bars with different diameters has been tested for 1 conventional <b>vibrated</b> <b>concrete</b> and 2 self-compacting concretes. The testing method, by means of "beam-test" specimen, was based on RILEM RC 6 part 1. During testing the free end slip of the bars and the applied load were recorded. The bar diameters ranged from 12 mm tot 40 mm. From the test results {{it can be seen}} that the maximum and characteristic bond strength of self-compacting concrete is as high as for conventional <b>vibrated</b> <b>concrete,</b> or even slightly higher. The bond strength decreases however for increasing bar diameters, and the decrease seems to be a little larger for specimen made of SCC.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} the type of mineral {{addition}} on the behavior of SCCs in sodium sulfate environments were studied. Three strength classes (30 MPa, 50 MPa and 70 MPa) and three different mineral additions were investigated: limestone filler, fly ash and natural pozzolan.

The results were consistent with those of XRD analysis. This study shows the benefic effect of the incorporation of a natural pozzolan as a mineral admixture in SCC on the resistance of these concretes in sodium sulfate medium.

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the influence of}} temperature {{on the evolution of}} compressive strength and on its correlations with the ultrasonic pulse velocity in concretes and eco-concretes, with a focus on the ages between 1 and 28 days. To that end, 9 concrete mixtures are studied, with parametric variations in the following components: (i) the type of aggregate, including several replacement ratios of recycled aggregate; (ii) water/cement ratio; (iii) cement content, as well as its partial replacement with biomass ashes. These 9 mixtures can be further divided in two major groups: 6 <b>vibrated</b> <b>concretes</b> and 3 self-compacting concretes. The 6 mixtures of <b>vibrated</b> <b>concretes</b> are: a mixture of reference, three mixtures with partial replacement of fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregates (8 %, 20 % and 31 % replacement), and two mixtures with partial replacement of cement with biomass ashes from the paper industry (15 % and 30 % replacement). The 3 remaining mixtures corresponding to self-compacting concretes are: one reference mixture of self-compacting concrete and two additional mixtures with partial replacement of fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregates from precast elements (20 % and 50 % replacement). The influence of temperature on the evolution of strength in each of the mixtures is determined for curing temperatures of 5 C, 20 C and 45 C. The study further includes the evaluation of the influence that temperature and mixture parameters (particularly those of eco-concretes) have on the relationship between compressive strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity.

The toughness of a material under compression can be quantified as the area under the stress-strain curve and is essential if the material is to be analyzed for impact, earthquakes, or fatigue loading. For high-strength concrete types it is known that failure occurs in a more brittle way, resulting in a steeper descending branch and a smaller area underneath it. Almost no test results are available describing the stress-strain behaviour of self-compacting concrete. Therefore different concrete types, self-compacting concretes as well as conventional <b>vibrated</b> <b>concretes</b> are investigated in this study. Uniaxial compressive tests to measure the stress-strain curve at different concrete ages (3, 7, 14, 28 days and 3 months) are performed.

Due to the difference in mix composition a different stress-strain behaviour is noticed for self-compacting concrete. The peak strain seems to increase as well as the toughness of the material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] - The use of {{recycled}} concrete aggregate {{is an important}} issue for preserving the natural resources, protecting the environment, saving of energy and for sustainable development. In this study, a unique simple mixture proportioning method was successfully adopted for developing SCC based on the absolute volume concept, starting with a volume of paste with maximum aggregate size of 20 mm. The method involved very few trials with different types of aggregate that can be advantageously used in field practice. The volume of paste chosen was 0. 38 to 0. 43 fraction of the total mix. Natural crushed angular granite and recycled demolished concrete waste were used as aggregate for making SCC with fly ash as filler. SCC and <b>vibrated</b> normal <b>concrete</b> mixes were made for varying cement contents of 300 kg/m 3 to 450 kg/m 3 and for a constant water content of 185 l/m 3. Cubes of 150 mm size were cast and tested for compressive strength at different ages of 7, 28 and 60 days. The results indicate that higher paste content not only makes the mix more cohesive with better lubrication of aggregates, but also increases the slump flow (reduces yield stress) and compressive strength. The 28 day compressive strength of SCC with both natural and recycled concrete aggregate showed higher compressive strength than <b>vibrated</b> normal <b>concrete</b> and significant increase at later age, possibly due to pozzolanic activity of the filler material (fly ash). However, the compressive strength of SCC mixes with recycled concrete aggregate has a lower value, when compared with SCC mixes of natural crushed angular granite aggregate at the same age. The study clearly shows the importance of paste in SCC and the advantage of using recycled concrete aggregate with better performance than the <b>vibrated</b> normal <b>concrete</b> with natural crushed aggregate and {{can go a long way}} in conserving the natural resources by the use {{of recycled}} concrete aggregate for sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the desired {{fluidity}} and stability characteristics in the fresh state, SCC composition is significantly different to that of conventional concretes (Chapter 1). This composition is characterized first of all by higher chemical admixture proportions (high range water reducing admixtures and viscosity enhancing admixtures). But SCCs also contain higher paste volumes than conventional concrete (CC). For economic reasons, the large paste volume is commonly achieved by adding supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) to the cement, particularly fillers. Furthermore, the granular skeleton in SCCs is markedly different to that of conventional concretes. The maximum grain diameter is often reduced relative to that of conventional concretes and the CA/S (coarse aggregate/sand) ratio is usually close to 1 while in conventional concretes it is generally greater than 1. 5. These particular composition details are likely to significantly modify the mechanical behavior of SCCs, particularly their high temperature behavior. This chapter presents {{state of the art}} understanding of high temperature SCC behavior. First, the physico-chemical changes which occur inside SCCs when a high temperature exposure is examined, from the perspective of knowledge acquired on high temperature behavior of conventional <b>vibrated</b> <b>concretes.</b> Next, the evoluation of physical properties, such as porosity and permeability, and mechanical properties (compressive and tensile strength, and elastic modulus) when a rise in temperature is studied and compared with data on conventional concretes.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} examine the mechanical and durability properties of SCC to gain insights for the design and implementation of SCC in structures. This thesis presents the mechanical and durability experiments used for characterization and acceptance of SCC. Because there are many normally <b>vibrated</b> <b>concretes</b> (NVC) used today for structural applications, comparisons between the mechanical and durability properties of SCC and an NVC typically used in New Mexico bridges are performed to evaluate the performance of SCC. Two sources of local aggregate in New Mexico were used to produce SCC and NVC mixes. Mechanical properties include compressive and flexural strength, and static and dynamic modulus of elasticity. Durability properties include chloride ion resistance, freeze-thaw durability, and potential for alkali-silica reaction (ASR). Experimental investigations show that SCC can have similar strength characteristics compared to NVC. Lowering the water to total cementitious materials ratio causes SCC to gain significant strength properties without compromising the requirements for plastic properties. Furthermore, results show that chloride ion resistivity in SCC is adequate, and in many cases exceeded that of NVC. It is recommended that air void systems of SCC are examined in the future due to discrepancies in freeze thaw durability results of SCC. Finally, it was found that SCC does not have higher potential to ASR compared with NVC in the presence of reactive aggregate even when high dosages of chemical admixtures are provided.
