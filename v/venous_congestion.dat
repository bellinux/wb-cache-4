40|$|SUMMARY Raising the hepatic venous {{pressure}} experimentally duplicates {{the type of}} hepatic congestion seen in many clinical situations including congestive heart failure. Venous pressure was controlled using a hepatic venous long circuit preparation and was raised by 6 cm blood (4. 7 mm Hg) or 10 cm (7. 8 mm Hg). Total splanchnic blood flow and oxygen uptake were reduced by these maneuvers but hepatic arterial flow was not altered nor was hepatic oxygen uptake. Blood flow in the portal vein decreased to 65 ± 12 % of control and gut oxygen uptake decreased to 60 ± 14 % of control. The data confirm that raised hepatic {{venous pressure}} does not produce hepatic edema in spite of massive prolonged fluid filtration across the liver into the peritoneum. In spite of a reduced (to 84 ± 3 % of control) hepatic oxygen delivery, the liver can maintain oxygen uptake (99 ± 7 % of control) by increasing oxygen extraction to appropriate levels. The hepatic artery in these cats was capable of myogenic vasoconstriction in response to altered arterial pressures, but in response to raised venous pressure no tendency for constriction was seen. This is {{in marked contrast to}} the vasoconstriction seen in isolated perfused livers where portal blood flow is held constant during the raised <b>venous</b> pressure. <b>CONGESTION</b> of the hepatic circulation leads to a number of serious clinical conditions.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Since the 1980 s, leeches {{have been}} ingeniously {{used in the}} {{management}} of <b>venous</b> flap <b>congestion.</b> The presence of anticoagulative substances in their saliva improves the blood drainage. Their digestive tract contains several bacterial species, the main ones being Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria, which contribute to the digestion of ingested blood. These bacteria can be the cause of infections. Case presentation We report two cases of septicemia related to Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria that presented after leeches had been applied to congested transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps for delayed mammary reconstructions. Patient number 1 was a 55 -year-old Caucasian woman who underwent a delayed breast reconstruction procedure. On the sixth postoperative day she showed a clinical presentation of septicemia. Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria was identified in the patient’s skin and blood bacteriological samples. Her fever ceased after 4 days of antibiotic treatment. Patient number 2 was a 56 -year-old Caucasian woman who underwent a delayed breast reconstruction procedure. On the seventh postoperative day we noticed that she showed a clinical presentation of septicemia. Aeromonas veronii biovar sobria was identified in the patient’s blood cultures and local bacteriological samples. An antibiogram showed resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Her fever ceased on the eleventh postoperative day after 4 days of antibiotic treatment. Conclusion The rate of infection after application of leeches is not negligible. The concentration of Aeromonas inside the digestive tracts of leeches largely decreases when the patient is under antibiotic therapy. These germs are sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. We recommend preventive treatment based on classical measures of asepsis and on oral antibioprophylaxy with a fluoroquinolone during the whole period of treatment by leeches. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mesenteric {{ischaemia}} comprises a broad, heterogeneous {{group of}} diseases characterised by inadequate blood {{supply to the}} small or large bowel. Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a surgical emergency, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Because the clinical presentation of mesenteric is-chaemia is variable and often nonspecific, a high index of clinical and radiologic suspicion is required for early diagno-sis. The severity of mesenteric ischaemia ranges from tran-sient, localised ischaemia to frank necrosis of the bowel. The most common causes of acute mesenteric ischaemia are em-bolic and thrombotic occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, whereas chronic mesenteric ischaemia is almost always associated with generalised atherosclerotic disease. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography is the preferred imaging test for acute and chronic mesenteric ischaemia. MDCT is useful in making a prompt, more precise diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia, as well as identifying the cause and potential complications, which are key to reducing patient morbidity and mortality. In this article, we review the clinical features and aetiologies of mesenteric ischaemia and illustrate the imaging manifestations on MDCT.

40|$|Nearly a {{third of}} {{patients}} with acute heart failure experience concomitant renal dysfunction. This condition {{is often associated with}} increased costs of care, length of hospitalisation and high mortality. Although the clinical impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been well established, the exact clinical significance of worsening renal function (WRF) during the acute and post-hospitalisation phases is not completely understood. Therefore, it is still unclear which of the common laboratory markers are able to identify WRF at an early stage. Recent studies comparing CKD with WRF showed contradictory results; this could depend on a different WRF definition, clinical characteristics, haemodynamic disorders and the presence of prior renal dysfunction in the population enrolled. The current definition of acute cardiorenal syndrome focuses on both the heart and kidney but it lacks precise laboratory marker cut-offs and a specific diagnostic approach. WRF and CKD could represent different pathophysiological mechanisms in the setting of acute heart failure; the traditional view includes reduced cardiac output with systemic and renal vasoconstriction. Nevertheless, it has become a mixed model that encompasses both forward and backward haemodynamic dysfunction. Increased central <b>venous</b> pressure, renal <b>congestion</b> with tubular obliteration, tubulo-glomerular feedback and increased abdominal pressure are all potential additional contributors. The impact of WRF on patients who experience preserved renal function and individuals affected with CKD is currently unknown. Therefore it is extremely important to understand the origins, the clinical significance and the prognostic impact of WRF on CKD...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of CRS can {{be attributed}} to two broad categories of [...] "hemodynamic factors" [...] such as low cardiac output, elevation of both intra-abdominal and central venous pressures, and non-hemodynamic factors or [...] "cardiorenal connectors" [...] such as neurohormonal and inflammatory activation. It was previously believed that low cardiac output in heart failure patients result in decreased blood flow to the kidneys which can lead to progressive deterioration of kidney function. As a result, diuresis of these patients will result in hypovolemia and pre-renal azotemia. However, several studies did not find an association between kidney dysfunction and cardiac output or other hemodynamic parameters. [...] In addition, CRS has been observed in patients with diastolic dysfunction who have normal left ventricular systolic function. Therefore, there must be additional mechanisms involved in the progression of CRS. Elevated intra-abdominal pressures resulting from ascites and abdominal wall edema may be associated with worsening kidney functions in heart failure patients. Several studies have shown {{that as a result of}} this increased intra-abdominal pressure there is increased central <b>venous</b> pressure and <b>congestion</b> of the kidneys' veins, which can lead to worsening kidney function. In addition, many neurohormonal and inflammatory agents are implicated in the progression of CRS. These include increased formation of reactive oxygen species, endothelin, arginine vasopressin, and excessive sympathetic activity which can result in myocardial hypertrophy and necrosis. Other cardiorenal connectors include renin-angiotensin-system activation, nitric oxide/reactive oxygen species imbalance, inflammatory factors and abnormal activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which can cause structural and functional abnormalities in both heart and/or the kidney. There is a close interaction within these cardiorenal connectors as well as between these factors and the hemodynamic factors which makes the study of CRS pathophysiology complicated.|$|R

In light diastolic dysfunction, the peak early mitral flow velocity E is reduced in proportion to the e, but if relaxation is so reduced that it causes increase in atrial pressure, E will increase again, while e, being less load dependent, remains low. Thus, the ratio E/e is related to the atrial pressure, and can show increased filling pressure, although with several reservations.
