5|$|Lin {{received}} little playing {{time during the}} season with two dominant ball-handling guards, Curry and Monta Ellis, starring for the Warriors. He initially competed with Charlie Bell and Reggie Williams, and later Acie Law, for playing time at backup point guard. Lin started the regular season on the Warriors' inactive list, but made his NBA debut the next game during the Warriors' Asian Heritage Night. He received a standing ovation {{when he entered the}} game in the final minutes. In the next game against the Los Angeles Lakers, Lin scored his first NBA basket, had three assists, and recorded four steals. He played 11 of his 16 minutes in the third quarter and committed five fouls but played a role in a 12–1 run by the Warriors in a 107–83 loss to the defending NBA champions. Lakers' guard Derek Fisher praised Lin for his energy and aggressiveness. At Toronto on November 8, the Raptors held Asian Heritage Night to coincide with Lin's <b>visit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Warriors. Over 20 members of Toronto's Chinese media covered the game. In an 89–117 road loss to the Lakers, Lin scored a (then) career-high 13 points in 18 minutes after scoring only seven total points in his first six games.|$|E

25|$|The Greek Catholic church, which {{functions}} in communion with the Latin Rite Catholicism, could have hoped {{to receive a}} better treatment in Poland, whose leadership, especially the endecja party, saw the Catholicism {{as one of the}} main tools to unify the nation where non-Polish minority comprised over one third of the citizenry. Nevertheless, the Poles saw the Greek Catholic Galicia Ukrainians as even less reliable and loyal as the Orthodox Volhynia Ukrainians. Also, despite the communion with Rome, the UGCC attained a strong Ukrainian national character of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and the Polish authorities sought to weaken it in various ways. In 1924, following a <b>visit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian Catholic believers in North America and western Europe, the head of the UGCC was initially denied reentry to Lviv until after a considerable delay. Polish priests led by their bishops began to undertake missionary work among Eastern Rite faithful, and the administrative restrictions were placed on the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|Luckner was a {{frequent}} visitor to the Heydrich house in Halle, where his stories of the adventures of Seeadler inspired a young Reinhard Heydrich to join the inter-war Reichsmarine. In 1937 and 1938, Luckner and his wife undertook a round-the-world voyage in his yacht Seeteufel, and they were welcomed in New Zealand and Australia, although some viewed him as an apologist for the Nazi regime. During their visit Queensland, Australia, the Luckners were feted by the press and public. The Brisbane office of the Commonwealth Investigation Branch (CIB), maintained a surveillance of the Luckners during their <b>visit,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inspector {{in charge of the}} CIB in Brisbane, Bob Wake, attending a gala function held in honour of the German couple. The gala menu was decorated with a swastika. The CIB kept detailed records of all of their contacts, and when Australia declared war on Germany many of these contacts were rounded up and interned.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to giving Jackson an ultimatum to pick between sports, Buccaneers management took Jackson on owner Hugh Culverhouse's private jet to <b>visit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> team during his senior baseball season. Jackson {{was told by}} the Buccaneers that the trip, which could have cost Jackson his remaining collegiate eligibility, had been cleared by the NCAA. Jackson was later told by his baseball coach at Auburn that the trip was considered to be a violation of NCAA rules and that he was immediately ruled ineligible to play the remainder of the baseball season. Jackson, upset that Culverhouse lied to him, insisted that he would never play for the Buccaneers and that they could draft him if he wanted to, but he would not sign if he was drafted. It was said that Jackson, who was having what he called his best year playing baseball in school, made the Buccaneers nervous and that by getting him somehow ruled ineligible to play baseball, he would be forced to focus on football.|$|E

The pilgrimage started on 11 May in Belgium, after a State <b>Visit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Belgian King, following which the King and his companions travelled by Royal Train through Belgium and France, using cars to tour the cemeteries from the towns where the train stopped. As described by Fox in the book about the pilgrimage, places visited included Zeebrugge (scene of the Zeebrugge Raid), Tyne Cot Cemetery, Brandhoek Military Cemetery, Ypres Town Cemetery (including a visit to the graves of the King's cousin, Prince Maurice of Battenberg, and the King's one-time equerry Lord Charles Mercer-Nairne and Major William George Sidney Cadogan, the equerry to the King's son, the Prince of Wales). While in and around Ypres, the touring party also visited the site of the planned Menin Gate memorial to the missing, and several other cemeteries associated with battles of the Ypres Salient.|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after the}} abbey {{had been allowed}} to fall into ruin, it began to attract the {{attention}} of artists and writers, and was a popular subject throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1755, the antiquarian Horace Walpole praised the ruins in his letters following a <b>visit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> poet Thomas Gray, claiming they were [...] "In short, not the ruins of Netley, but of Paradise". In 1764, George Keate wrote The Ruins of Netley Abbey, A poem, which showed a romantic appreciation of the ruins and evoked sympathy for the life formerly led there by the monks. He prefaced his poem with a heartfelt plea for the preservation of the remains.|$|E
500|$|Eusebius {{introduces}} {{his account}} of Philip's <b>visit</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> words κατέχει λόγος' (katechei logos). The precise meaning of these words in modern European languages has been contested. Ernst Stein, in an account challenging the veracity of Eusebius' narrative, translated the phrase as [...] "gerüchte", or [...] "rumor"; the scholar John Gregg translated it as [...] "the saying goes". Other renderings are possible, however; modern English translations of the Historia Ecclesiastica have [...] "it is recorded" [...] or [...] "it is reported", as in the translation quoted above. The historian Robin Lane Fox, who translates logos as [...] "story" [...] or [...] "rumor" [...] in scare quotes, emphasizes that Eusebius draws a distinction between his [...] "story" [...] about Philip and the other material in the passage.|$|E

500|$|Desiring to {{be closer}} to Russia as the {{emigrant}} community were becoming decreasingly influential, Lenin moved to Krakow in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a culturally Polish part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He liked the city, and used the library at Jagellonian University to conduct his ongoing research. From here, he was able to stay in close contact with the RSDLP operating in the Russian Empire, with members often visiting him, and he convinced the Bolshevik members of the Duma to split from their alliance with Menshevik members. In January 1913, Stalin– whom Lenin referred to as the [...] "wonderful Georgian"– came to <b>visit,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pair discussing the future of non-Russian ethnic groups in the Empire.

They sought to promote the crowning of Francisco de Paula, son of Charles IV of Spain, as regent of the United Provinces, but in the end he refused to act against the interests of the King of Spain. The diplomatic mission failed, but Belgrano learned of changes in ideology that had taken place in Europe since his previous <b>visit.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> influence of the French Revolution, there had been a great consensus for making republican governments. After the government of Napoleon I, monarchies were preferred again, but in the form of constitutional monarchies, such as in Britain.
