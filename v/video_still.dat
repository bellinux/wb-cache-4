25|$|As the Sixth Generation gained {{international}} exposure, many subsequent {{movies were}} joint ventures and projects with international backers, but remained quite resolutely low-key and low budget. Jia's Platform (2000) was funded {{in part by}} Takeshi Kitano's production house, while his Still Life was shot on HD <b>video.</b> <b>Still</b> Life was a surprise addition and Golden Lion winner of the 2006 Venice International Film Festival. Still Life, which concerns provincial workers around the Three Gorges region, sharply contrasts with the works of Fifth Generation Chinese directors like Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige who were at the time producing House of Flying Daggers (2004) and The Promise (2005). It featured no star of international renown and was acted mostly by non-professionals.|$|E
