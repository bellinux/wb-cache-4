5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host range of a virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
25|$|Entry {{into the}} host cell is {{achieved}} by attachment of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

To elucidate the mechanism of ERM protein incorporation, we investigated possible association of ERM proteins with viral components in rabies virus-infected BHK- 21 cells. Double immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the ERM proteins are concentrated in the microvilli, where the colocalized viral G protein was also seen. Viral G protein expressed in the G cDNA-transfected COS- 7 cells also displayed similar distributions to those seen in the virus-infected cells. Both the ERM and <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> were coprecipitated by anti-viral G antibody from lysates of the virus-infected cells, while the anti-ERM antibody coprecipitated viral G and ERM proteins.

ATL-associated antigens (ATLA) were detected by electron microscopy of cells incubated in cell suspension with sera from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients {{on the surface of}} virus particles and the plasma membrane, but not inside the virus and cells.

Here, we present a novel proteome-wide discovery strategy for O-glycosylation sites on <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> using herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) as a model. We identified 74 O-linked glycosylation sites on 8 out of the 12 HSV- 1 <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins.</b> Two of the identified glycosites found in glycoprotein B were previously implicated in virus attachment to immune cells. We show that HSV- 1 infection distorts the secretory pathway and that infected cells accumulate glycoproteins with truncated O-glycans, nonetheless retaining the ability to elongate most of the surface glycans. With the use of precise gene editing, we further demonstrate that elongated O-glycans are essential for HSV- 1 in human HaCaT keratinocytes, where HSV- 1 produced markedly lower viral titers in HaCaT with abrogated O-glycans compared to the isogenic counterpart with normal O-glycans. The roles of O-linked glycosylation for viral entry, formation, secretion, and immune recognition are poorly understood, and the O-glycoproteomics strategy presented here now opens for unbiased discovery on all enveloped viruses...|$|R

5000|$|The {{boundaries}} of the potential to add and eliminate PNGSs are naively explored by growing viral populations following each new infection. While the transmitting host has developed a neutralizing antibody response to gp120, the newly infected host lacks immune recognition of the virus. Sequence data shows that initial viral variants in an immunologically naïve host have few glycosylation sites and shorter exposed variable loops. This may facilitate viral ability to bind host cell receptors. As the host immune system develops antibodies against gp120, immune pressures seem to select for increased glycosylation, particularly on the exposed variable loops of gp120. [...] Consequently, insertions in env, which confer more PNGSs on gp120 may be more tolerated by the virus as higher glycan density promotes the viral ability to evade antibodies and thus promotes higher viral fitness. [...] In considering how much PNGS density could theoretically change, {{there may be an}} upper bound to PNGS number due to its inhibition of gp120 folding, but if the PNGS number decreases substantially, then the virus is too easily detected by neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, a stabilizing selection balance between low and high glycan densities is likely established. A lower number of bulky glycans improves viral replication efficiency and higher number on the exposed loops aids host immune evasion via disguise. The relationship between gp120 and neutralizing antibodies is an example of Red Queen evolutionary dynamics. Continuing evolutionary adaptation is required for the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>protein</b> to maintain fitness relative to the continuing evolutionary adaptations of the host immune neutralizing antibodies, and vice versa, forming a coevolving system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} several decades it has been noted, using a variety of {{different}} methods, that cells infected by a specific gammaretrovirus are resistant to infection by other retroviruses that employ the same receptor; a phenomenon termed receptor interference. Receptor masking is thought to provide an earlier means of blocking superinfection, whereas receptor down regulation is generally considered to occur in chronically infected cells. Results We used replication-competent GFP-expressing viruses containing either an amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) or the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope. We also constructed similar viruses containing fluorescence-labeled Gag proteins for the detection of viral particles. Using this repertoire of reagents together {{with a wide range of}} antibodies, we were able to determine the presence and availability of viral receptors, and detect <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> and particles presence on the cell surface of chronically infected cells. Conclusions A-MLV or GALV receptors remain on the surface of chronically infected cells and are detectable by respective antibodies, indicating that these receptors are not downregulated in these infected cells as previously proposed. We were also able to detect <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> on the infected cell surface and infected cells are unable to bind soluble A-MLV or GALV envelopes indicating that receptor binding sites are masked by endogenously expressed A-MLV or GALV <b>viral</b> <b>envelope.</b> However, receptor masking does not completely prevent A-MLV or GALV superinfection. </p...|$|R

Mink lung cells were chosen {{because they do}} not contain endogenous MMTV sequences. On the basis of our observation that simian virus 40 DNA efficiently transforms these cells, we isolated cell clones containing MMTV DNA by using transformation with simian virus 40 DNA as a selective marker in cotransfection experiments. Levels of the 9 -kilobase MMTV mRNA representing the entire viral genome and of the spliced 4. 4 -kilobase mRNA which codes for the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins</b> were glucocorticoid dependent in transformed cells. Expression of low levels of Pr 77 gag, the precursor of the group-specific viral core proteins, and of gPr 73 env, the precursor of the <b>viral</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>proteins,</b> was also hormone dependent. We conclude that these cloned MMTV DNAs contain all the information necessary for the synthesis of normal viral RNAs and proteins.
