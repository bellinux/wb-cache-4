The simple peeling and cutting jobs can be completed manually using a knife or other cutting tool.

To determine the effect of this knife on skill learning，I compared the degree of proficiency such as the cutting time as well as the number and thickness of cut pieces，using three different knives：a special kitchen knife designed by the author，a full-size kitchen knife available in the market，and a <b>peeling</b> <b>knife</b> which is similar to the ordinary kitchen knife for children in terms of size and weight．The comparison shows that children were able to cut objects thinner in a shorter time with the <b>peeling</b> <b>knife</b> as well as the special kitchen knife than with the full-size kitchen knife．A part from the cutting results，the movement of cutting when dealing with objects of differing degrees of hardness was also analyzed to compare and review respective knife movement. The results of the kitchen knife movement analysis shows that the individual differences of non－cutting time for the kitchen knife for children，which is an idling time from the moment of finishing cutting one piece to the moment of moving on to the next，were less varied compared to the <b>peeling</b> <b>knife.</b> From this result，it may be concluded that the kitchen knife specifically designed for children is effective in learning kitchen knife skill,especially for group lessons，because individual difference is less likely to occur...|$|R

Use of Garbage Enzyme is emerging as an effective method for treating greywater. When the treatment of synthetic greywater was done immediately after filtration of the Garbage Enzyme solution, the effluent standards were met after 27 days. The treatment time reduced to 5 days when it was treated 60 days after filtration of the enzyme solution. The enzyme solution is rich in organic content. The lower concentrations of 5 % and 10 % Garbage Enzymes were effective to treat synthetic greywater. Results showed that ammonia nitrogen and phosphates could be completely removed by using Garbage Enzyme solution. Further tests are required to study the removal mechanisms...|$|R

Includes bibliographical references (page 61 - 68). The requirement of an alternative clean energy source is increasing with the elevating energy demand of modern age. Microbial production of bioethanol can replace the conventional fossil fuel with green energy. In this study, local yeast isolates {{were used for the}} production of bioethanol using cellulosic vegetable wastes as substrate. This project were designed for the efficient bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol by microbial action. Wild-type yeast isolated form sugarcane juice (SC 1) and date juice (DJ 1) were used as ethanol producing organism. After proper isolation, identification and characterization of stress tolerance (thermo-, ethanol-, pH-, osmo- & sugar tolerance), detailed characterization and optimization of physiochemical parameters for ethanol production the strain is treating to be dubbed as an industrial strain. Very inexpensive and easily available raw materials (<b>vegetable</b> <b>peel</b> kitchen wastes) are used as fermentation media. The overall objective of this project is to meet the demand for an inexpensive and highly efficient integrated anaerobic Saccharomyces spp. fermentation process to produce ethanol as an energy source directly from insoluble lignocellulosic substrate (kitchen-waste). Fermentation was optimized with respect to temperature, reducing sugar concentration and pH. Analysis of fermentation characteristics under different substrate and environmental conditions, it was observed that temperature of 30 °C and pH 6. 0 were optimum for fermentation with maximum yield of ethanol. Influence of Bacillus subtilis increased the alcohol production rate from the fermentation of cellulosic materials. The cellulolytic activity of this cellulose degrading bacteria converts cellulose into smaller sugars which will be easier to be fermented by yeast. Maximum ethanol production by yeast was 17. 39 % using <b>vegetable</b> <b>peels</b> as substrate at 48 hours (30 °C and substrate was treated with Bacillus subtilis) under shaking condition.
