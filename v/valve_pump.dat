5000|$|The {{steel housing}} {{of the seat}} <b>valve</b> <b>pump</b> {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and discharge valves are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the efficiency of}} hydraulic systems by eliminating valve throttling losses, a direct displacement open circuit is proposed to control a single rod hydraulic actuator. The circuit provides three control inputs, including the displacement of a variable displacement pump, the opening area of a proportional valve, and {{the position of a}} directional <b>valve.</b> <b>Pump</b> control has a low bandwidth, but the efficiency is high {{due to the lack of}} throttling losses. Valve control has a high bandwidth, but the throttling loss is high. A novel approach has been proposed to distribute the control efforts between the pump and the proportional valve considering both control bandwidth balancing and throttling loss reduction. The proportional valve will follow a high frequency opening profile, while the nominal valve opening is large, and the pump output flow will follow a low frequency demand. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the concept}} of micro total {{analysis}} systems (µ-TAS) has been advocated, various kinds of micro/nano devices have been developed by researchers in many fields, such as in chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electric engineering, biology, and medicine, among others.

30|$|Design {{principles}} and pipe rehabilitation strategies in WDNs are generally based upon {{assessment of the}} vulnerability (or hydraulic reliability) of a network to specific hazards. The risk assessment is based on probabilistic measures {{of the consequences of}} failure events on the level of service of customers (Ostfeld and Shamir 1993; Xu and Goulter 1999; Deuerlein et al. 2009; Shuang et al. 2014; Diao et al. 2016). Due to the unpredictable nature (and causes) of disruptive events (Gao et al. 2016; Hosseini et al. 2016) and lack of universally accepted probabilistic approach to component (e.g. pipe, <b>valve,</b> <b>pump)</b> failures (Andreou et al. 1987; Goulter and Bouchart 1990), failure predictions in WDNs are highly uncertain. More robust measures for network design and rehabilitation strategies are based on network resilience, i.e. the ability of networks to anticipate, absorb, adapt to and/or rapidly recover from a disruptive event (Laprie 2005; Strigini 2012; Gao et al. 2016).|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, there has been {{significant}} development {{in the field of}} applications for piezoelectric materials. This thesis focuses on using these materials in a piezohydraulic pump system. Piezopump systems typically operate by pushing fluid through check valves to produce positive fluid flow. The accompanying hydraulic system utilizes a control valve, hydraulic accumulator, and hydraulic actuator. The function of the piezopump is to convert the very small displacements of the piezoelectric stack actuators into useful work. This paper details the design, construction, and testing of four such possible pumping systems. 	The first system was a thin diaphragm piezo pump which utilized conventional check valves to rectify the flow. This pump was the next generation system in a series of piezopumps designed at Georgia Tech. Its peak performance with a driving voltage of 150 V was a flowrate of 140 cc/min with a blocked pressure of 1. 38 MPa (200 psi.). The key features of this system were its aluminum construction and ease of assembly. 	A new technology was developed which used a resonant fluid cavity to build usable pressure for a pumping system. Two half wave resonators were build to operate at frequencies of 20 kHz and 1 kHz. These systems produced good pressure during resonance, but attempts to rectify these high frequency pulses were unsuccessful. Rectification methods such as reed valves, vortex fluid diodes, and nozzle/ diffuser arrangements were discussed. A reed valve system was developed and tested. A fourth piezoelectric system was developed which used the driving elements and the reed valves originally designed for the resonant systems. This non resonant reed <b>valve</b> <b>pump</b> produced good results. This pump systems produced 338 cc/min at a frequency of 400 Hz. It also produced a blocked pressure of 250 psi. There are many applications for these miniature high flow pumping systems. The technology in the reed <b>valve</b> <b>pump</b> is scalable, and the size of this particular system may be reduced dramatically to offer even more space saving potential. M. S.

40|$|Microfluidics is {{a highly}} {{interdisciplinary}} science which is {{to deal with the}} behavior, control and manipulation of fluids that are constrained to sub-milimeter scale. It incorporates the knowledge and technique intersecting physics, chemistry, mechanics, nanoscience and biotechnology, with practical applications to the design of systems in which small volumes of fluids will be used In this thesis, we started our research from GER fluid synthesis which then is applied to designing different functions of microfluidic devices, <b>valve,</b> <b>pump,</b> and mixer. We built a way to correlate mechanical signal with electric signal by soft matter. The mechanical devices based GER fluid had good operating stability and mechanical performance. We studied how to improve the performance of GER fluid by increasing the yield stress while avoiding the sendimentation of nanoparticles in GER suspension. The meaning of this work is to enhance the stability and mechanical strength of GER fluid when it is applyed to the microfluidc channels. We tried different oils and studied the particle size for the GER effect. The largest yield stress which amounts to 300 kPa is achievable compared to previous GER fluid with 100 kPa. Microfluidic reactor, directing the flow of microliter volumes along microscale channels, offers the advantages of precise control of reagent loading, fast mixing and an enhanced reaction rate, cessation of the reaction at specific stages, and more. Basically, there are two microfluidic flow regimes, continuous flow and segmented flow (suspended droplets, channel-spanning slug, and wall-wetting films). Both flow regimes offer chemical reaction applications, e. g., continuous flow formation of polymer nanospheres and inorganic nanoparticles, size- and shape-control synthesis by segmented flow, and precipitate-forming reactions in droplets, wherein the segmented flow has gained more popularity in that area. The compartmentalization of segmented flow offers advantages to chemical reactions. Here, we report the microfluidic fabrication of magnetically responsive microsphere, macroporous polymer microspheres and hollow titania microspheres. To prepare magnetically responsive microsphere, we introduced magnetic particles into liquid shell and drug into liquid core. After cross-linking reaction of the shell, we studied the magnetic contraction and extention behavior which induced the drug release efficiency. To prepare porous polymer, the H 2 O 2 solution was encapsulated in polymer precursor, after which we investigated its decomposition under UV irradiation, which simultaneously induces the polymerization of the encapsulating shell. Because the H 2 O 2 decomposition leads to the release of oxygen, porous microspheres were obtained from a combined H 2 O 2 -decomposition/polymer precursor polymerization reaction. To prepare hollow titanium gel microspheres, water droplets were first formed by the flow focusing geometry in microfluidic chip and used as a soft template. Then hydrolysis and gelation of titanium alkoxide on the droplet’s surface were induced in following serpentine channels, controlled by interface water diffusion. The water diffusion process can be controlled by the amount of the “dewetting” reagent butanol, by which the surface morphology of the titania microspheres can be tuned...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} simple method for {{fabricating}} chemically-inert Teflon microfluidic <b>valves</b> and <b>pumps</b> in glass microfluidic devices. These structures are modeled after monolithic membrane <b>valves</b> and <b>pumps</b> that utilize a featureless polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane bonded between two etched glass wafers.
