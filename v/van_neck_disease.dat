40|$|Objective: Olfactory {{neuroblastoma}} and {{the management}} of <b>neck</b> <b>disease</b> has posed considerable challenges to the treating physician. The aims {{of the study were}} to determine the incidence and factors influencing <b>neck</b> <b>disease</b> and to identify at-risk patients with cervical node–negative disease at presentation. Study: Design Multicenter case series with retrospective chart review. Setting and Subjects: In sum, 113 patients with a histopathologic diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma across 6 tertiary hospitals in Australia and the United States. Methods: Treatment modalities for the primary site and neck included surgery, radiotherapy, and combined therapy. Treatment outcomes were measured in relation to date of primary treatment, and long-term follow-up was recorded. Disease-free survival was calculated as time for patients to develop delayed <b>neck</b> <b>disease</b> following primary treatment. Results: A total of 113 patients (46 females, 49. 7 ± 13. 2 years) were identified with a median follow-up of 41. 5 months (interquartile range, 58. 2); 7. 1 % of patients presented with primary <b>neck</b> <b>disease,</b> while 8. 8 % of patients presented with delayed <b>neck</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Neck</b> <b>disease</b> was present in patients with Hyams grade II (22. 2 %), III (55. 6 %), and IV (22. 2 %) lesions (χ 2 = 5. 66, P =. 13). Histologic grade was higher in patients with primary <b>neck</b> <b>disease</b> (χ 2 = 16. 22, P =. 001). Positive surgical margins were associated with a higher risk of delayed <b>neck</b> <b>disease</b> as compared with clear surgical margin (17. 9 % vs 5 %, P =. 034). Conclusion: Neck metastasis is an important clinical consideration for olfactory neuroblastoma at presentation and in surveillance. Primary treatment of the neck could be considered in select patients. Long-term surveillance of the neck and primary site is essential. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The density matrix {{renormalization}} group (DMRG) has {{an underlying}} variational ansatz, the matrix product state (MPS). The accuracy of this ansatz {{is controlled by}} its virtual dimension. In most applications for quantum chemistry this parameter is very large, and the high-accuracy or FCI regime is studied. With a good orbital choice and ordering, and by exploiting the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, DMRG then allows to retrieve highly accurate results in active spaces {{beyond the reach of}} FCI [1, 2]. However, DMRG can also be of use with smaller virtual dimensions. I will discuss how fundamental ideas from Hartree-Fock (HF) theory are transferable to DMRG. Both methods have a variational ansatz. The time-independent variational principle leads for HF and DMRG to a self-consistent mean-field theory in the particles and lattice sites, respectively. The time-dependent variational principle results in the random-phase approximation (RPA). RPA reveals the elementary excitations: particle and site excitations for HF and DMRG, respectively. Exponentiation of these excitations provides a nonredundant parameterization of the ansatz manifold, formulated by Thouless’ theorem. A Taylor expansion in the nonredundant parameters leads to the configuration interaction expansion [3, 4]. References [1] S. Wouters, W. Poelmans, P. W.

40|$|Introduction. Optimal {{therapy for}} {{patients}} with metastatic <b>neck</b> <b>disease</b> remains controversial. <b>Neck</b> dissection following radiotherapy has traditionally been used to improve locoregional control. Methods. A retrospective review of 28 patients with node-positive head and neck malignancy treated with planned neck dissection following radiotherapy between January 2002 and December 2005 was performed to assess treatment outcomes. Results. Median interval to neck dissection was 9. 6 weeks with a median number of 21 + 9 lymph nodes per specimen. Ten of 31 (32 %) neck dissection specimens demonstrated evidence of residual carcinoma. Overall survival at two years was 85 %; five-year overall survival was 65 %. Concurrent chemotherapy did not impact the presence of residual <b>neck</b> <b>disease.</b> Conclusion. Based on the frequency of residual malignancy in the neck of patients treated with primary radiotherapy, a planned, postradiotherapy neck dissection should be strongly advocated for all patients with advanced-stage <b>neck</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
