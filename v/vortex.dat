5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge <b>vortex.</b> Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a <b>vortex</b> over each wing. This bound <b>vortex</b> then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting <b>vortex</b> for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Vamei {{developed}} in a <b>vortex</b> that appears every winter along the northwest coast of Borneo and is maintained by the interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography. Often, the <b>vortex</b> remains near the coastline, and {{in an analysis of}} 51winters, only six reported the <b>vortex</b> as being over the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665km (415mi) wide, a <b>vortex</b> needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days, which is needed to enhance the <b>vortex,</b> is present, on average, nine days each winter. The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10–30percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100–400years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. If {{deviating}} {{from the}} optimal operation conditions, flow separation will {{occur on the}} blade of the runner in a low specific speed turbine. At this time, the turbulent flow of flow field in the blade duct {{will be in a}} strong non-equilibrium state, and thus the blade duct <b>vortexes</b> will be generated. To further study the mechanism of blade duct <b>vortexes</b> and to control the generation of these <b>vortexes,</b> Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) model was used to numerically simulate and calculate the internal flow in the low specific speed turbine runner under low load conditions. The blade duct <b>vortexes</b> in the turbine runner were accurately predicted. The effect of short blade in eliminating and reducing the <b>vortexes</b> in the low specific speed turbine runner was analyzed and compared. 1...|$|R
50|$|Under these {{perpendicular}} wind conditions, mainly at {{the street}} level, {{at each end of}} the canyon, horizontally rotating corner/end <b>vortexes</b> are made. The horizontal extent of these corner <b>vortexes</b> are different at each end of a canyon and this leads complex surface level wind patterns at intersections. Field experiments have further shown that corner <b>vortexes</b> can extend in the whole depth of canyon but with changing horizontal extent with height.|$|R

5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed <b>Vortex,</b> Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} {{that he would have to}} defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. <b>Vortex</b> made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that <b>Vortex</b> owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} found that optimum recovery of Chlamydia trachomatis in microdilution plate culture required multiple blind passages. However, others {{have found this}} {{not to be the}} case for culture in vials. In the present study, the effect on recovery of the use of vials (as opposed to microdilution plates) and the effect of <b>vortexing,</b> sonication, or both were compared. Three different passage techniques were also evaluated. <b>Vortexing</b> or sonication resulted in equivalent recoveries. However, compared with <b>vortexing</b> alone, a combination of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication increased recovery from 95 (78 %) to 114 (94 %) of 121 positive specimens (P = 0. 002). In multiple-passage experiments, the combination of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication, compared with <b>vortexing</b> only, increased the proportion of isolates recovered with no more than a single passage from 81 to 96 %. Substitution of vials for microdilution plates increased recovery with only a single passage to greater than 96 %, irrespective of whether sonication was employed. The most sensitive technique for single-passage technique was one using blunt scraping of cell monolayers with passage of two monolayers to one. The sensitivity of cell culture for C. trachomatis is highly dependent on the technique(s) employed. However, the combination of sonication and <b>vortexing</b> of clinical specimens enhanced recovery in microdilution plates, and a single blind passage did so in both microdilution plates and vials. Consideration should be given to their use for routine clinical cultures...|$|R

5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a <b>vortex</b> formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this <b>vortex</b> held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, the <b>vortex</b> dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>vortex</b> on Venus was {{discovered}} {{at the north}} pole by the Pioneer Venus mission in 1978. A discovery of the second large 'double-eyed' <b>vortex</b> {{at the south pole}} of Venus was made in the summer of 2006 by Venus Express, which came with no surprise.|$|E
5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger <b>vortex</b> will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller <b>vortex</b> will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

5|$|As Crash gathers the {{remaining}} crystals, he is attacked by several mutated animals dispatched by Brio, including the demented kangaroo Ripper Roo, the scimitar-wielding Komodo Brothers Moe and Joe, and the musclebound Tiny Tiger. During Crash's progression, Coco occasionally hacks into his holograph projector and warns Crash of her uncertainty of Cortex's true intentions. It is not until Crash has gathered the crystals that Coco {{is able to}} reveal Cortex's ultimate plan: with the energy harnessed from the planetary alignment, Cortex will power the gigantic Cortex <b>Vortex</b> built onto his space station and brainwash everyone on Earth into serving his army. Crash manages to defeat Cortex before the crystals can be used, but leaves the Cortex <b>Vortex</b> drifting aimlessly into space. Crash redeems himself by collecting the world's gems for Brio, who reveals that the gems can harness planetary energy as well and invites him to the completion of his laser device; Crash activates the laser and destroys the Cortex <b>Vortex,</b> breaking the space station apart.|$|E
5|$|David Boswell was amongst {{those in}} the 1980s who made the jump from the fanzine world when he began self-{{publishing}} Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman in 1980. From {{out of the same}} scene, Bill Marks started publishing the anthology <b>Vortex</b> in Toronto in 1982. Marks' <b>Vortex</b> Comics expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for Mister X, which employed the talents of Dean Motter, Gilberto and Jaime Hernandez and, later, Torontonians Seth and Jeffrey Morgan. Most notably, Marks picked up Chester Brown's Yummy Fur, a taboo-breaking series which started in 1983 as a self-published, photocopied minicomic. It had generated some buzz, and <b>Vortex</b> started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986. Yummy Furs stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal Ed the Happy Clown, straight adaptations of the Gospels, and revealing, bare-all autobiographical stories. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics.|$|E

Despite Brio's warnings, Cortex subjects Crash to the untested Cortex <b>Vortex</b> in an attempt to control him. The <b>Vortex</b> rejects Crash, allowing him to escape. After Crash leaps out a window and falls to the ocean below, Cortex prepares a female bandicoot named Tawna for experimentation.|$|E
40|$|Bacteria such as staphylococci {{commonly}} {{encountered in}} orthopaedic infections form biofilms and adhere to bone implants and cements. Various methods {{to disrupt the}} biofilm and enhance bacterial detection have been reported. We will describe the effectiveness of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication to improve the detection of biofilm-formative bacteria from polymethylmethacrylate by conventional quantitative bacterial culture and real-time quantitative PCR. We used a single biofilm-formative Staphylococcus aureus strain and 20 polymethylmethacrylate coupons as an in vitro biofilm model; four coupons were used for each of two control groups or three experimental sonication times (1, 5, and 30 minutes). <b>Vortexing</b> the cement without sonication increased the yield of adherent bacteria to a considerable extent. The combination of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication further enhanced the yield regardless of the duration of sonication. Quantitative conventional cultures correlated with quantitative PCR assay. The combination of <b>vortexing</b> and sonication to disrupt the bacterial biofilm followed by quantitative PCR and/or culture {{seems to be a}} sensitive method for detecting bacteria adherent to bone cement...|$|R
40|$|Four swab {{materials}} were evaluated for their efficiency in recovery of Bacillus anthracis spores from steel coupons. Cotton, macrofoam, polyester, and rayon swabs {{were used to}} sample coupons inoculated with a spore suspension of known concentration. Three methods of processing {{for the removal of}} spores from the swabs (<b>vortexing,</b> sonication, or minimal agitation) and two swab preparations (premoistened and dry) were evaluated. Results indicated that premoistened swabs were more efficient at recovering spores than dry swabs (14. 3 % vs. 4. 4 %). <b>Vortexing</b> swabs for 2 min during processing resulted in superior extraction of spores when compared to sonicating them for 12 min or subjecting them to minimal agitation. Premoistened macrofoam and cotton swabs that were <b>vortexed</b> during processing recovered the greatest proportions of spores with a mean recovery of 43. 6 % (standard deviation [SD] 11. 1 %) and 41. 7 % (SD 14. 6 %), respectively.

40|$|The flow {{characteristics}} of lid-driven cavity are simulated using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). For achieving the best numerical stability, {{this problem is}} solved using two-dimensional nine directional lattice model (D 2 Q 9). Single Relaxation Time-BGK approximation is used for collision of particles. The effect of various Reynolds numbers (100, 1000, 2000 and 5000) and aspect ratios (1, 2 and 4) in the {{flow characteristics}} is studied. In this problem two cases of boundary conditions are considered, in the first case, {{the top and bottom}} walls move in the same direction towards right side with uniform velocity (u =  0. 1) and in the second case, the walls move in opposite direction with same velocity. For validation, velocities and the locations of primary, secondary, ternary <b>vortexes</b> obtained from the simulation are compared with existing literatures and found to be in good agreement. The results show that at higher Reynolds number (Re), there is a formation of secondary and ternary <b>vortexes.</b> The shape and size of the <b>vortexes</b> changes with increase in aspect ratio (K). For lower Re, primary <b>vortexes</b> only were observed. However, at low Re with increase in K, there is a formation of secondary <b>vortexes.</b> The pressure contours are also presented...|$|R
