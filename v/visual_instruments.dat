50|$|The focal lengths {{are made}} equal for the lines C and F. In the {{neighborhood}} of 550 nm the tangent to the curve {{is parallel to the}} axis of wavelengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of color, therefore in this neighborhood the color union is at its best. Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making , is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for <b>visual</b> <b>instruments</b> (optical achromatism,). In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united. This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography (pure actinic achromatism). For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects. On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the actinic correction or freedom from chemical focus).|$|E

The contrast sensitivity measurements were performed using rotationally symmetric, variable contrast difference-of-gaussians (DOG) targets, viewed through specially designed telescopes that presented various amounts of monochromatic aberrations. Then the contrast sensitivity ratios were correlated with the image quality metrics of the telescopes. The results show that an appropriately defined integral of the instrument-observer MTF (called MTFa) correlates well with subjective performance in most cases and predicts the optimum focus best; the radius that encircles 84 % of the energy of the point spread function (called Rg 4) gives good correlation in some cases including the DOG experimen...|$|E

A suprathreshold method is employed in psychophysical discrimination experiments.

For the target orientation that is most affected by the aberrations, we find that MTFa and R 84 give good correlation with subjective result, while the Strehl ratio and the variance do not.

The second example concems the extraction of accurate spectroscopic information from pushbroom imaging spectrometers. It is shown how the user requirements for calibration translate into spectral and spatial uniformity of response, and further to the complete absence of spectral and spatial distortion, {{as well as to the}} minimization of the variation of the LSF width in both directions, spatial and spectral. Techniques for accomplishing this in practice, both in terms of merit function and in terms of fabrication and assembly, are also discussed...|$|E
