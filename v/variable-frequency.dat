It only attacks those PLC systems with <b>variable-frequency</b> drives from two specific vendors: Vacon based in Finland and Fararo Paya based in Iran. Furthermore, it monitors the frequency of the attached motors, and only attacks systems that spin between 807Hz and 1,210Hz. The industrial applications of motors with these parameters are diverse, and may include pumps or gas centrifuges.|$|E

25|$|Today, some {{locomotives}} in {{this system}} use a transformer and rectifier to provide low-voltage pulsating direct current to motors. Speed is controlled by switching winding taps on the transformer. More sophisticated locomotives use thyristor or IGBT circuitry to generate chopped or even <b>variable-frequency</b> alternating current (AC) that is then supplied to the AC induction traction motors.|$|E
25|$|The large {{capacitance}} of {{electrolytic capacitors}} makes them particularly suitable for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals {{up to some}} mega-hertz and for storing large amounts of energy. They are widely used for decoupling or noise filtering in power supplies and DC link circuits for <b>variable-frequency</b> drives, for coupling signals between amplifier stages, and storing energy as in a flashlamp.|$|E
25|$|An insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) is a three-terminal {{power semiconductor device}} primarily used as an electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It switches electric power in many applications: <b>variable-frequency</b> drives (VFDs), electric cars, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with switching amplifiers. The IGBT is a semiconductor device with four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure without regenerative action.|$|E
25|$|Bleed {{air systems}} have been in use for several decades in {{passenger}} jets. Recent improvements in solid-state electronics have enabled pneumatic power systems {{to be replaced by}} electric power systems. In a bleedless aircraft such as the Boeing 787, each engine has two <b>variable-frequency</b> electrical generators to compensate for not providing compressed air to external systems. Eliminating bleed air and replacing it with extra electric generation is believed to provide a net improvement in engine efficiency, lower weight, and ease of maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the basic}} {{indicator}} system in either an analog or digital meter responds to DC only, a multimeter includes an AC to DC conversion circuit for making alternating current measurements. Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated root mean square (RMS) value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution. User guides for some such meters give correction factors for some simple non-sinusoidal waveforms, to allow the correct root mean square (RMS) equivalent value to be calculated. More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid. RMS sensing is necessary for measurements on non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, such as found in audio signals and <b>variable-frequency</b> drives.|$|E

2500|$|The SD70MAC (colloquially {{known as}} a [...] "Mac" [...] or a [...] "70 Mac") {{is very similar to}} the SD70M and SD70I; the main {{difference}} being that the SD70MAC uses AC traction motors. Production of the model commenced in 1993, competing against GE's AC4400CW. AC motors, while simpler and more reliable than DC motors, require expensive inverters to generate a <b>variable-frequency</b> AC signal, raising the locomotive's purchase cost substantially. The majority of SD70MAC models were produced with the [...] EMD 710 prime mover while later units are rated at [...] and feature EMD SD45-style flared radiators.
