25|$|The reserve {{requirement}} (or cash reserve ratio) {{is a central}} bank regulation employed by most, but not all, of the world's central banks, that sets the minimum amount of reserves that must be held by a commercial bank.

The commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (<b>vault</b> <b>cash),</b> plus the amount of the commercial bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank.|$|E

50|$|Financial Institutions {{are obligated}} {{by law to}} {{maintain}} certain levels of reserves, either as reserves with the Fed or as <b>vault</b> <b>cash.</b> The level of these reserves {{is determined by the}} outstanding assets and liabilities of each depository institution, {{as well as by the}} Fed itself, but is typically 10% of the total value of the bank's demand accounts (depending on bank size). In the range of $9.3 million to $43.9 million, for transaction deposits (checking accounts, NOWs, and other deposits that can be used to make payments) the reserve requirement in 2007-2008 was 3 percent of the end-of-the-day daily average amount held over a two-week period. Transaction deposits over $43.9 million held at the same depository institution carried a 10 percent reserve requirement.|$|E
5000|$|The {{multiplier}} effect {{is relevant to}} considering monetary and fiscal policies, as well how the banking system works. For example, the deposit, the monetary amount a customer deposits at a bank, {{is used by the}} bank to loan out to others, thereby generating the money supply. Most banks are FDIC insured (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), so that customers are assured that their savings, up to a certain amount, is insured by the federal government. Banks are required to reserve a certain ratio of the customer's deposits in reserve, either in the form of <b>vault</b> <b>cash</b> or of a deposit maintained by a Federal Reserve Bank.http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm#table1 [...] Therefore, if the Federal Reserve Bank (and hence its monetary policy) requires a higher percentage of reserve, then it lowers the bank's financial ability to loan.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, bank {{reserves}} for {{a commercial}} bank are held in part as a credit balance in an account for the commercial bank at the applicable Federal Reserve bank (FRB). This credit balance is not separated into separate [...] "minimum reserves" [...] and [...] "excess reserves" [...] accounts. The total amount of FRB credits held in all FRB accounts for all commercial banks, together with all currency and <b>vault</b> <b>cash,</b> form the M0 monetary base. Holding excess reserves has an opportunity cost if higher risk-adjusted interest can be earned by putting the funds elsewhere. For banks in the U.S. Federal Reserve System, this earning process is accomplished by a given bank by making short-term (usually overnight) loans on the federal funds market to another bank that may be short of its reserve requirements. Other banks may instead choose, however, to hold their excess reserves to facilitate upcoming transactions or to meet contractual clearing balance requirements.|$|E

Indeed, most depository institutions can now meet reserve requirements by holding <b>vault</b> <b>cash</b> rather than by maintaining balances at the Federal Reserve.

The ceiling was designed at 11 ft in height so the space would not feel oppressive. A freestanding structure for files occupies the center in the building, so that the office floor would be open and uncluttered. The colorful counters where tellers worked were equipped with removable plastic hoods when traffic demanded additional counters. A small elevator and spiral staircase gave tellers secure access to the <b>cash</b> <b>vault</b> below and two steel and glass vestibules connect the glass pavilion to the three-story office annex, where customers could transact business privately.|$|R
