50|$|Some reviewers {{discovered}} that the AMD Radeon RX 480 violates the PCI Express power draw specifications, which allows a maximum of 75 watts being drawn from the motherboard's PCI Express slot. Chris Angelini of Tom's Hardware noticed that in a stress test it can draw up {{to an average of}} 90 watts from the slot and 86 watts in a typical gaming load. The peak usage can be up to 162 watts and 300 watts altogether with the power supply in a gaming load. TechPowerUp corroborated these results by noting it can also draw up to 166 watts from the power supply, past the limit of 75 watts for a 6-pin PCI Express power connector. Ryan Shrout of PC Perspective did a follow-up test after other reports and found out his review sample takes 80-84 watts from the motherboard at stock speed, and that the other PCI Express slots' 12 volt power supply pins were supplying only 11.5 volts during load on his Asus ROG Rampage V Extreme motherboard. He was not concerned about the <b>voltage</b> <b>droop</b> due to the specification's 8% voltage tolerance, but did note of possible problems in systems where multiple overclocked RX 480 cards are running in quad CrossFire, or in motherboards that are not designed to withstand high currents, such as budget and older models.|$|E

In the proposed approach, an OPF algorithm is executed {{at the secondary level}} to find optimal reference of DC voltages and active powers of all voltage-regulating converters. Then, the <b>voltage</b> <b>droop</b> characteristics of voltage-regulating converters, at the primary level, are tuned based on the OPF results such that the operating point of the MTDC grid lies on the <b>voltage</b> <b>droop</b> characteristics.
