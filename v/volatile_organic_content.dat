The presence of oxygen, level of unsaturation and the carbon chain length of respective molecules influence the combustion chemistry.

No conclusive evidence exists as to whether occupational exposure to these fumes is associated with acute and chronic pulmonary effects and symptoms of respiratory diseases. Objective: To quantify the exposure levels and evaluate possible chronic and acute pulmonary effects associated with exposure to cooking fumes. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 60 kitchen workers exposed to cooking fumes and 60 unexposed employees were investigated. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms among these groups was determined through completion of a standard questionnaire. Pulmonary function parameters were also measured before and after participants' work shift.

40|$|Organic {{matter in}} peat {{deposits}} undergoes slow microbial decomposition, which causes permanent material change, including reduction in volume of solids, {{and is a}} significant factor in the development of creep settlements for such deposits. Microorganisms accountable for decomposition are readily available in peat, although generally less populous compared with other soils on account of the unfavourable environment. This paper presents a novel experimental laboratory study that stimulates the growth of microorganisms in a fibrous peat and hence its decomposition rate. The carbon/nitrogen ratio and pH value of the peat were adjusted within optimum ranges for microbial activity to occur by blending sufficient amounts of pulverised fuel ash and urea with the wet peat. This process did not adversely affect indigenous microbial populations within the peat. Blended material was incubated aerobically and anaerobically at 30 ?C over periods of up to 126 days. Microbial populations increased by approximately 3500 - and 1800 -fold under aerobic and anaerobic incubation, respectively, which was an indicator of increased decomposition rate.

40|$|Nanoscale ionic {{materials}} (NIMs) are organic-inorganic hybrids prepared from ionically functionalized nanoparticles (NP) neutralized by oligomeric polymer counterions. NIMs {{are designed}} to behave as liquids under ambient conditions {{in the absence of}} solvent and have no <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>content,</b> making them useful for a number of applications. We have used nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation and pulsed-field gradient NMR to probe local and collective canopy dynamics in NIMs based on 18 -nm silica NPs with a covalently bound anionic corona, neutralized by amine-terminated ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers. The NMR relaxation studies show that the nanosecond-scale canopy dynamics depend on the degree of neutralization, the canopy radius of gyration, and crowding at the ionically modified NP surface. Two canopy populations are observed in the diffusion experiments, demonstrating that one fraction of the canopy is bound to the NP surface on the time scale (milliseconds) of the diffusion experiment and is surrounded by a more mobile layer of canopy that is unable to access the surface due to molecular crowding. The introduction of electrolyte ions (Na+ or Mg 2 +) screens the canopy-corona electrostatic interactions, resulting in a reduced bulk viscosity and faster canopy exchange. The magnitude of the screening effect depends upon ion concentration and valence, providing a simple route for tuning the macroscopic properties of NIMs. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E

Benchmarking of calcium {{magnesium acetate}} with a suite of five other carboxylic salts (calcium magnesium acetate, calcium propionate, calcium acetate, calcium benzoate, magnesium acetate, and calcium formate) has been performed. NOx reduction involves the <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> of the carboxylic salt being released at temperatures of > 1000 °C, where the reaction of CHi radicals with NO under fuel-rich conditions can result {{in some of the}} NO forming N 2 in a “reburning” process.

In addition, the rate of weight losses were studied to investigate the influence of the organic decomposition on NOx reduction by reburning. In-furnace reductions of SO 2 and HCl are aided by the highly porous, particulate residue, which results from the in situ drying, pyrolysis, and calcination processes. Simultaneous reduction of all three pollutants was obtained, and a synergy between SO 2 and HCl capture was identified. A mechanism for this inter-relationship has been proposed.

The other novel emulsion was prepared by ·emulsification of a mixture of a silicone fluid and an alkylalkoxysilane in water with an amine soap as surfactant.

40|$|A {{number of}} polymer {{products}} are traditionally made using a solution polymerization technique. However, with increased environmental awareness and thus, {{concerns over the}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> (VOC) associated with various polymer processes, there is an ongoing effort to find alternatives to traditional solvents. In an effort to use cleaner technologies, fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) {{was used for the}} first time as a polymerization solvent. Biodiesel or FAME has garnered much attention in recent years as an alternative to diesel fuel. It is environmentally benign and has a low volatility. Because biodiesel is a high boiling solvent, its use can increase productivity by enabling polymerizations at elevated temperatures. This would result in faster reaction rates and thus, shorter reaction times. In the first part of this study, solution polymerizations of four commercially important monomers (i. e., methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene, butyl acrylate (BA) and vinyl acetate (VAc)) were studied at 60 °C using FAME produced from canola oil as a solvent. Reactions were carried out at different solvent concentrations to verify the effect of the FAME on the polymerizations. Chain transfer to solvent rate parameters were obtained using the Mayo method. In addition, the effect of solvent on solution polymerizations of each monomer was investigated. This was suspected to contribute to a change in the lumped kinetic parameter (kp/kt 1 / 2). The collected kinetic experimental data were modeled using a polymerization simulator. In the second part of this thesis, canola-based FAME was used as a high boiling solvent in the solution polymerization of the aforementioned monomers at 120 °C. Chain transfer to solvent rate constants were calculated and were employed in a polymerization simulator to predict the polymerization rates and the cumulative average molecular weights of the polymer product. As in the study at 60 °C, changes in the lumped kinetic parameter with solvent concentration were incorporated into the free radical polymerization simulator; these changes considerably improved the model predictions. In the third part of the thesis, the effect of FAME produced from different oil feedstocks on polymerization kinetics was investigated for styrene homopolymerizations at 60 °C. Soybean oil, and 50 % yellow grease- 50 % canola oil were the feedstocks employed in this study. Experimental results were compared to the runs using canola-based FAME at 60 °C. Chain transfer to solvent constants were estimated for each solvent using the Mayo method and no significant difference between the values obtained from polymerization in different FAME was found. On the other hand, dissimilar effects on the rate of polymerization were observed. These were shown to relate to the degree of unsaturation of each FAME type. Model predictions of reaction rates and molecular weights for the investigated systems are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{maritime}} environment is strongly aggressive, coatings {{needed to protect}} steel can be classifi ed as ‘heavy duty coatings’. In most maritime applications because of maintenance diffi culties a long service life is generally required. This, together with safety and environmental issues, demands high requisites in performance and reliability. On top of performance and reliability requirements for long-term protection, there are often also conflicting interests between the desire of a ship owner or operator for a well-built, long-lasting structure with minimal operating cost (long-term fi nancial interest) and the short delivery time or shipyard’s production line. Depending on the ship building market demand {{at the time of}} contract, the owner may have to accept a compromise against his better technical judgement and operating know-how. The extra cost for the desired system may be exorbitant, seen from the owner’s or operator’s point of view, and the standard guarantee for a ship is only one year from delivery, so the yard will rarely face a claim for coating failure if the coating application is reasonably well done. While this may recoup some financial gain in terms of the time-to-delivery of a new structure, there might be a more significant negative impact to the owner or operator in terms of cost of early and on-going maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the structure. The relative costs of coating systems are minor compared to replacement of steel during operational life. However, costs for staging and steel preparation needed to apply those coatings rise swiftly with increasing surface area. Correct selection of coating materials and their specification at the design stage may yield fi nancial benefi ts in the longer term. Although there are coatings available on the market that perform satisfactorily, and provide long-term protection against corrosion, their reliability is dependent on a strict control of the application, type and thickness of the coating as well as operating conditions. Furthermore, the past 10 to 15 years have shown significant changes in the coating industry. Because of the awareness for the consequences for human health and for the environment, nowadays many regulations and restrictions have been decreed concerning the application, content and removal (waste) of coatings. Many traditional anticorrosive coatings are now no longer acceptable due to their potentially toxic and carcinogenic nature, e. g. red lead, coal-tar pitch, and more. In addition, requirements to reduce emissions to the atmosphere of potential ozone-depleting materials have resulted in a reduction in <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> (VOC) of paints and coatings. Novel coatings should also keep their properties and fl exibility during harsh sea conditions and elevated temperatures at which ships may operate.

Refinement usually takes place in land-based systems where the oysters are fed with relatively high concentrations of microalgae. In this study the impact of feeding Skeletonema costatum and Rhodomonas baltica on the biochemical composition and sensory characteristics of Pacific cupped oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from the Eastern Scheldt during land-based refinement was studied.

These differences were also reflected in the fatty acid profile of the oysters fed with the corresponding algae diets. Furthermore, general linear model and principal component analysis showed marked differences in free amino acids and <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound <b>content</b> between Skeletonema, Rhodomonas fed oysters and reference oysters.

Also, cost savings resulting from blending 25 percent PCCP with 75 percent virgin polymer are insignificant compared to the total cost of a recoating job using other VOCcompliant systems. Therefore, the blends investigated here probably will not have significant commercial usefulness, and they are not recommended for corrosion protection of steel structures...|$|R

40|$|The paint {{industry}} is currently facing legislative pressure to reduce <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound (VOC) <b>content</b> {{and the use}} of other harmful chemicals in coating products. There is also increasing consumer demand for paints with superior coating and finish quality as well as ease of use. This thesis reports on the development of novel coatings from renewable feedstocks through the use of well controlled olefin metathesis. The coating industry, like many others that rely on crude oil derivatives, also has to cope with increasing costs of crude oil derived materials. To overcome this, as well as to meet increasing pressures to utilize sustainable technologies, the development of improved alkyd paints for the market was proposed. Alkyd paints are partly based on vegetable oils and are thus relatively cheap and “green” to produce. Their loss in market share {{over the past two decades}} is partly due to the improvements in competing types of paints, their high VOC (<b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound) <b>content</b> (introduced via formulation) and their inferior ageing properties. A collaborative project between Monash University and DuluxGroup has resulted in the development of an efficient curing methodology to generate alkyd coatings through olefin metathesis. Metathesis-induced curing of films generates coatings which possess a lower propensity for yellowing and embrittlement compared to conventional alkyds. Industrially available solvents were investigated for their compatibility with the curing system. Ethyl acetate (containing traces of acetic acid) was found to be a suitable solvent for both olefin metathesis and dilution of alkyd resins. Alkyds based on natural vegetable oils and vegetable oils modified by prior metathesis with 2 -butene, were then cooked (i. e. triglycerides were heated with a polyol and phthalic anhydride in the presence of minimal amounts of an azeotroping solvent). The conventional scale (3 - 5 kg) of the cooks was prohibitive and preparation of alkyd resins on a smaller scale was devised. Initially this was done using microwave technology, then a conventional small scale method (< 1 kg) was established. This allowed rapid evaluation of resultant resins. Characterisation of the resins was carried out using Acid Value measurements and GPC, and evaluation of metathesis curing was carried out by touch tests on microscope slides. The curing rate was also investigated by headspace MS monitoring of released 2 -butene throughout curing of a butenolysed resin. Novel, modified second generation Hoveyda-Grubbs’ type catalysts were also assessed. It was anticipated that modified resins would perform better as the evaporation of 2 -butene from the film would drive the cross-metathesis curing reaction to completion. Significantly, the research also developed processes for preparing acceptable films from unmodified alkyds. The potential to use unmodified alkyds makes this technology more attractive as it would be easier and cheaper to apply. Potential economic benefits stem from the replacement of imported petrochemical feedstocks with Australian agricultural products in the coating and materials industries, and the development of high performance products with the potential for export...|$|R

Additionally, significant geographical variation in cancer rates among smoky coal users has been observed, suggesting heterogeneity in fuel source composition and/or combustion characteristics. Research thus far has indicated that smoky coal emits high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and contains high concentrations of fine grained crystalline quartz, however, much of this research is limited in terms of sample size and geographic scope. In order to more fully characterise geochemical and elemental compositions of smoky and smokeless coal use in Xuanwei and Fuyuan, we carried out a large exposure assessment study in households in this region. Methods: Fuel samples representing smoky and "smokeless" (anthracite, the major alternative coal type in the region) coals were collected from 137 homes in Xuanwei and Fuyuan. Rock-Eval, Leco-CS, XRF analysis and electron microscopy were used to establish hydrocarbon <b>content</b> (to represent <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds), major and trace element composition and mineral composition respectively. Heterogeneity in coal characteristics between and within coal types was assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: 145 coal samples (116 smoky and 29 smokeless coals) were analysed. Statistically significant differences between smoky and smokeless coals with regard to hydrocarbon content, sulfur, trace elements and mineral composition were observed. Of note, smoky coal contained between 5 and 15 times the amount of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> matter and twice the amount of quartz (including respirable quartz) than smokeless coal. Smoky coal generally had lower levels of trace elements (plus aluminium) than smokeless coal. Significant variation was also observed between smoky coal samples from different geographical areas with regard to hydrocarbon content and elemental composition (including aluminium and silicon). Discussion: This paper has identified compositional differences between and within smoky and smokeless coals sourced from Xuanwei and Fuyuan counties. A decreased ratio of aluminium to silicon in smoky coal suggests elevated free silica, a finding consistent with observed higher levels of quartz. Elevated <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> matter <b>content</b> in smoky coal (when compared to smokeless coal) is consistent with the geochemical expectations for smoky and smokeless coals. These findings also reflect previous observations of elevated volatile compound emissions (notably PAHs) from smoky coal in the area. The observed heterogeneity in coal composition between and within coal types may provide leads to the observed heterogeneity in cancer risk observed in this area. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Solvent-borne {{thermally}} cured coil-coating resins contain {{large amounts}} of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> solvents {{in order to obtain}} suitable flow for film application. This work describes how the expensive and environmental hazardous <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> solvent <b>content</b> of a solvent-borne thermally cured polyester/melamine coil-coating system can be reduced by introduction of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) as reactive diluents and modification of the polyester binder resin. The evaluated reactive diluents, two rape seed methyl esters (RMEs), two linseed oil methyl esters (LMEs), and a tall oil methyl ester (TOME) have been evaluated both in a fully formulated clear-coat system and via model studies. Viscosity measurements of wet paint mixtures showed that formulations with hyperbranched polyester binder hold lower viscosity than conventional polyester binder resins and that FAME works as a diluent. Fully formulated clear-coats were cured under simulated industrial coil-coating cure conditions and in a convection oven at lower temperatures respectively. FAME increases the mobility of the system enhancing the film formation process. Free-standing clear-coat films were analyzed with Raman, carbon- 14 dating, extraction, dynamic mechanical analysis, and visual observation. Incorporation of FAME could not be confirmed by Raman analysis. However, carbon- 14 dating indicated the presence of FAME that could not be extracted from the films. The mechanical properties of the films were also affected by the addition of FAMEs, oven temperature, choice of co-solvent, and flash-off period. Conventional film characterization tests on substrate supported coatings indicated that binder resin structure and cure conditions affect the final film properties. Model studies were performed to clarify how FAME can chemically react through transesterification with the hydroxyl-groups of the polyester. The transesterification reaction between different FAMEs and primary alcohols with and without tertiary hydrogen was monitored with 1 H-NMR and real time IR. Evaporation and side reactions, e. g. alkene reactions, are competing factors to the transesterification reaction. The study showed that fatty acid structure, reaction time, and temperature affect the transesterification conversion, degree of side reactions, and choice of catalyst. A pigmented fully formulated polyester/melamine formulation with a reactive diluent was cured at full scale in an industrial coil-coating production facility. Evaluation of the final film properties showed that the coating fulfills the specification of conventional polyester/melamine coil-coating systems. QC 2010081...|$|R
40|$|<b>Volatile</b> <b>organic</b> {{compounds}} {{emissions from}} building materials {{can be a}} major pollution source in low-occupant-density spaces. Composite-style indoor air quality references, which reflect the combined effects of multiple <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds, {{can be used to}} determine ventilation rate requirements based on building material emissions. The lowest concentration of interest concept was adopted to implement the idea. Twenty-eight building materials selected from the National Research Council of Canada database were subjected to emission modelling, resulting in 101 <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds as a starting <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound pool. A method was proposed to generate a <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound priority list that determines ventilation rate requirements while considering ozone-initiated reactions. Three priority lists were obtained based on three lowest concentration of interest schemes, i. e., AFSSET, AgBB and EU-LCI, with each consisting of 172 ̆ 01321 <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds that were most likely to attribute to large ventilation rate requirements. Also, analyses of selected <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds showed that the changes in the composition of the priority lists due to ozone-initiated reactions could be ignored at a typical indoor ozone concentration level. The application of priority lists was discussed for source control and air cleaning device testing. This paper provides a method to prioritize the chemicals based on ventilation rate requirements with a goal of developing <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound control strategies at building design stage.

40|$|AIMS [...] To analyse {{the breath}} of {{patients}} with schizophrenia {{for the presence of}} abnormal <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds. METHODS [...] A case comparison study was performed in two community hospitals in Staten Island, New York. Twenty five patients with schizophrenia, 26 patients with other psychiatric disorders, and 38 normal controls were studied. Alveolar breath samples were collected from all participants, and <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds in the breath were assayed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy. Differences in the distribution of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds between the three groups were compared by computerised pattern recognition analysis. RESULTS [...] Forty eight different <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds were observed in the breath samples. Three separate pattern recognition methods indicated an increased differentiation capability between the patients with schizophrenia and the other subjects. Pattern recognition category classification models using 11 of these <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds identified the patients with schizophrenia with a sensitivity of 80. 0 % and a specificity of 61. 9 %. <b>Volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds in breath were not significantly affected by drug therapy, age, sex, smoking, diet, or race. CONCLUSIONS [...] Microanalysis of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds in breath combined with pattern recognition analysis of data may provide a new approach to the diagnosis and understanding of schizophrenia.

30|$|The {{characteristics}} of dye wastewater from the textile industry include high color, <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> (Shelley et al. 1976; Tezcanli-Guyer and Ince 2003; Trifi et al. 2011), <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds, {{biological oxygen demand}} (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS) (World Bank Group, United Nations Environment Programme, and United Nations Industrial Development Organization 1999). Wastewater from the industry is generally produced during dyeing. In many cases, wastewater is then a consortium of various dyes that did not affix to the fabrics during the dyeing processes (Joshi et al. 2004). If untreated, discharge from textile plants into surface waters alters the dynamics within the stream, producing unwanted pollution, increased toxicity, and eutrophication (Trifi et al. 2011).|$|R

40|$|Earth accretes 30 million kg/yr of {{extraterrestrial}} material, {{mostly in}} the form of large micrometeorites (diameter ~ 200 µm). Entry velocities of these particles range from 11. 2 km/s to 70 km/s. Micrometeorites are small enough to ensure that they are completely melted and partially evaporated during atmospheric entry. Such strong heating has typically been inferred to cause complete destruction of the <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> of the particles in this size range. Earlier work by Kress et al. (2002) showed that <b>volatile</b> <b>organics,</b> including CH 4 and small-functionalized polycyclic aromatics, are evolved from flash-heated micrometeorite-analogs. Contribution of ablated organics to atmospheric chemistry depends in part on the rate of compound degradation due to solar Lyman-alpha (lambda = 121. 5 nm). The rate of degradation {{is a function of the}} total amount of planetary atmosphere an organic compound is released under. Results show <b>volatile</b> <b>organics</b> are released between 86 - 122 km for particles entering at an 80 deg angle of entry and initial velocity of 12 km/s.
