The GenV AWD coupling, now distributed by BorgWarner TorqTransfer Systems, features a new design aimed at reducing vehicle complexity and simplifying integration into the drivetrain. A new electro-hydraulic clutch actuator uses a centrifugal overflow valve design aimed at accurately distributing power between {{the front and rear}} axles, and eliminating the need for an accumulator, solenoid <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter.</b> It also employs an integrated electronic control unit.|$|E
40|$|There is much {{interest}} {{in the use of}} holding chambers with an attached facemask to deliver aerosols from metered dose inhalers to infants. In order to study the influence of various design factors on the dose inhaled at different tidal volumes, a model was constructed in which a Starling ventilator was used to generate an inspiratory/expiratory cycle across a filter. Sodium cromoglycate was administered via a Nebuhaler and mask, Aerochamber and mask, and a coffee cup using tidal volumes of 25, 50, and 150 ml and the dose deposited upon the filter after six breaths was assayed using an ultraviolet spectrophotometric method. At the lowest tidal volume the high aerosol concentration in the smaller chamber enhanced drug delivery while at the highest tidal volume delivery was greatest from the larger chamber reflecting the larger dose available. Multiple breaths ensured that the dose inhaled per kilogram from each chamber was relatively large and also permitted significant drug delivery despite the introduction of a relatively large dead space between <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter.</b> The dose delivered was increased by increasing the dose introduced into the chamber though not proportionately. These devices appear likely to deliver significant quantities of aerosol to infants, though drug delivery may be enhanced by the use of an appropriate valve...|$|E

50|$|Water {{treatment}} filters {{that can}} be backwashed include rapid sand <b>filters,</b> pressure <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Diatomaceous earth filters are backwashed according to the proprietary arrangement of pumps, <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>filters</b> associated with the filtration system. Slow sand <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> self-cleaning screen <b>filters</b> employ mechanisms other than backwashing to remove trapped particles.

The purpose, was of course, to sniff out lopsided electrons and “glow-in-thedark” debris from the Soviet nuclear bomb testing program.|$|R
50|$|High {{levels of}} total {{dissolved}} solids do not correlate to hard water, as water softeners do not reduce TDS. Water softeners remove magnesium and calcium ions, which cause hard water, but these ions are replaced with an equal charge of sodium or potassium ions, e.g. Ca2+ ⇌ 2 Na+. This leaves overall TDS unchanged, or even increased. Hard water can cause scale buildup in pipes, <b>valves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>filters,</b> reducing performance <b>and</b> adding to system maintenance costs. These effects {{can be seen in}} aquariums, spas, swimming pools, and reverse osmosis water treatment systems. Typically, in these applications, {{total dissolved solids}} are tested frequently, and filtration membranes are checked in order to prevent adverse effects.|$|R

40|$|Marine {{biofouling}} generally {{refers to}} the undesirable accumulation of biological organisms on surfaces in contact with seawater. This natural phenomenon represents a major economic concern for marine industries, e. g. for ships and vessels, oil and wind-turbine sea-platforms, pipelines, water <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>filters,</b> as it limits the performance of devices, materials and underwater structures and increases the costs related to transport delays, hull maintenance and repair, cleaning and desalination units, corrosion and structure break-down. In the last few decades, many efforts have been spent into developing efficient antifouling (AF) surfaces (coatings) combining advances in materials science and recent knowledge of marine chemistry and biology. However, the extensive use of toxic and harmful compounds in the formulations raised increasing health and environmental concerns leading to stricter regulations which pushed marine industries to search for new AF strategies. This review presents the recent research progress made in green strategies for AF coatings using non-toxic, non-biocide-release based principles for marine applications. The two main approaches, detachment of biofoulants or preventing biofoulants attachment, are reviewed in detail and new promising routes based on amphiphilic, (super) hydrophilic, and topographic (structured) surfaces are highlighted. The chemical and physical aspects of the AF mechanisms behind the AF strategies reviewed are emphasized, with {{special attention to the}} early stages of biofoulant adhesion, keeping the focus on the materials' molecular structure and properties which allow obtaining the final desired antifouling behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the foregut structure and the digestive function of the decapods Litopenaeus vannamei, Sesarma rectum and Callichirus major larvae and post larvae were examined. The protozoeal foregut of L. vannamei is simple, lacking a cardiopyloric <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> bearing a rudimentary filter press. In mysis, the filter press is more developed. In the juvenile stage, grooves and a small lateral tooth arise. In S. rectum, the foregut has a functional cardiopyloric <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> a <b>filter</b> press. The megalopal and juvenile stages of this species have a gastric mill {{similar to those in}} adult crabs. In C. major, the foregut of the zoeae is specialized, with the appearance of some rigid structures, but no gastric mill was found. Calcified structures are observed in the megalopae and they become more developed in the juvenile stage.

40|$|Particle {{emissions}} f rom {{clean room}} gas-handling components were measured by following a test method developed recently by SEMATECH. Three types of tests, namely, the static, the dynamic, {{and the impact}} tests were conducted to determine particle emissions f rom the components tested. Particles emitted by the components such as <b>valves,</b> point-of-use <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> inline pressure regulators were measured using a condensation nucleus particle counter. The number of particles emitted by the valve {{was influenced by the}} actuator pressure used to open and close the test valve.

40|$|Feeding is an {{important}} factor for the successful rearing of larvae of the crab species. Further information on the morphological features of the foregut may to reveal larval feeding behaviour and or/whether there is a lecithotrophy in some or even in all stages of the larval cycle. In the present study, the structural development of the foregut and their digestive functions were examined in larvae of two brachyurans, Uca vocator and Panopeus occidentalis, reared in the laboratory. During larval development, the foreguts of the larvae in the first and last zoeal stages and in the megalopa stage were microscopically examined, described and illustrated. The zoeal foreguts of both species were well developed, showing specialization with a functional cardiopyloric <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> a <b>filter</b> press. The megalopa stage had a complex and specialized gastric mill similar to that found in adult crabs with the appearance of rigidly calcified structures. These results support the hypothesis that the feeding behaviour of each larval stage {{is directly related to the}} morphological structure of the foregut. Such facts strongly indicate that all larval stages of both U. vocator and P. occidentalis need an external food source before completing the larval development in a planktonic environment...|$|R

40|$|The {{reasons for}} the high oxygen {{mixtures}} delivered by the Bird Mark 7 ventilator were investigated by measuring the flow of gases through {{various parts of the}} ventilator. The major causes were the constant flow of 100 per cent oxygen from the nebulizer, the decrease and eventual cessation of flow through the venturi as the airway pressure rose, and the decrease in the proportion of entrained air at low flow settings. When the Bird Mark 7 automatic ventilator is driven by a source of compressed oxygen, an "air-mix " control permits the administration of either 100 per cent oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and air. This oxygen-air mixture is obtained when the oxygen passes through an injector, entraining air through a filter (fig. 1). The mixture then passes through a spring-loaded one-way valve into the righthand chamber of the ventilator and on to the patient via a length of wide-bore tubing. Before reaching the patient the mixture also passes through a humidifier and through a nebulizer to FIG. 1 Simplified diagram of the Bird Mark 7 ventilator.

Sample systems are used to condition or adjust the sample conditions (pressure, amount of particulate allowed, temperature and flow) to a level suitable for use with an analytical device (analyzer) such as a gas chromatograph, an oxygen analyzer or an infra red spectrometer. Despite the simple explanation just given, modern sampling systems can be quite large, complex, and expensive.

After the pressure is increased by the oil circulating pump, the emulsified oil is heated by the heater and the temperature gradually increases.

This mist can prevent the rise of oil bubbles in the vacuum separation chamber and can avoid the injection of the vacuum pump of oil during the operation. Thus, antifoaming is automatically prevented. After atomization, the oil reenters the efficient separation tower, in which an oil film is again formed. The developed area of the oil film significantly increases. The water in the oil rapidly transforms from liquid into vapor.
