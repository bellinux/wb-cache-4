40|$|The {{standard}} method for {{the determination of}} airborne carbonyls is to collect carbonyls onto 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) coated solid sorbent followed by solvent extraction of the solid sorbent {{and analysis of the}} derivatives using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). A newly developed approach uses in-injection port thermal desorption (TD) as a sample introduction technique followed by analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The principle of this method is to collect carbonyls in air onto sampling tubes packed with Tenax particles, which are pre-coated with pentafluorophenylhydrazine (PFPH). The carbonyls in the form of their PFPH derivatives are desorbed onto a gas chromatography column by heat, finally detected by mass spectrometer. In previous practice, the coating of solid sorbents with the derivatization agent is achieved by applying solutions followed by drying. This practice inevitably introduces carbonyl impurities in the solvent to the sampling sorbent. In this thesis work, a <b>vapour</b> <b>coating</b> technique has been developed and demonstrated to be superior to the solvent coating approach. The <b>vapour</b> <b>coating</b> technique eliminates the use of solvents during the coating step; thereby reduces background carbonyl contaminants. This technique has a good reproducibility in the amount of PFPH coated in each sampling tube. Lower minimum detection limits were made possible by using this improved coating method. This newly developed technique has been applied to measure ambient carbonyls in an urban location in Guangzhou, China. A total of 22 carbonyls were positively identified and quantified. An additional 14 carbonyls were tentatively identified {{on the basis of their}} mass spectra and relative retention times to known carbonyl compounds. Cooking exhaust, vehicle emission and secondary products were identified to be the main sources. It was found that the two smallest aldehydes, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, only accounted for less than 40 % of OH removal by all the measured carbonyls. This finding indicates the importance of measuring all the significant carbonyls...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{project has been}} focused on the preparation and characterization of Mg(b 1 -xCx) 2 powder and bulk samples using chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>coated</b> boron and silica coated boron by sol-gel method. The chemical vapour deposition of carbon on boron powder was achieved by reacting ethylene gas on high purity nano-sized boron particles (20 - 100 nm diameter) with varying deposition temperatures and partial pressures. Undoped and carbon doped boron was then reacted with magnesium rod to produce both Mg(b 1 -xCx) 2 powder and bulk samples. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the chemical vapour deposition achieved a uniformly thick carbon-rich layer on each particle, regardless of particle size. In addition, the analusis of the diffraction peaks and the characterization of the magnetisation has evidenced the coexistence of phases with different levels of carbon resulting in multiple current paths within the Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 samples. The study of the preparation process for bulk Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 samples has evidenced that reducing the difference between the time constant of reaction and the time constant of diffusion is crucial to opbtain well-sintered samples devoid of cracks. Doping with carbon has shown significant improvements in the field dependence of K for the MG(B 1 -xCx) 2 bulk samples reaching values com[parable with the best literature-reported data for bulk samples. However, the K values of the MG(B 1 -xCx) 2 bulk samples were observed to be noticeably lower when compared with the beszt liter 4 arture-reported data for wires and tapes, owing to the greater density achievable in the latter. In contrast to the carbon doping, the coating with silica via sol-gel process was found to impair the in-field Jc properties of Mg(B 1 -xCx) 2 bulk samples, presumably due to the huge amount of silica loaded onto the boron powder and to the formation of carbonate and silicate impuritis within their reacted microstructure. <br/...|$|R

We develop a <b>vapour</b> phase <b>coating</b> strategy which is readily applicable to any porous solid to provide a uniform cellular distribution. Plasma polymerized allyl amine (ppAAm) is used to form a thin nitrogen-containing coating throughout porous three-dimensional (3 -D) poly(D,L. -lactic acid) scaffolds. Subsequent controlled deposition of a hydrocarbon plasma polymerized hexane (ppHex) allows control of the fibroblast penetration into these porous 3 -D objects. In order to optimize the coating conditions, a planar pinhole model of plasma penetration into pores is developed to rapidly measure deposit penetration using picolitre water contact angle measurement. Sufficiently good control over the plasma deposition within the porous scaffold is achieved using this approach to superimpose a relatively cell-repellent ppHex coating at the scaffold periphery onto the ppAAm-coated core, with a chemical gradient between the two.

The multilayer coating was composed by a first Ti interlayer to grant adhesion, followed by a second 18. 4 at% C TiC layer with a cF 8 NaCl type unit cell, then a 41. 9 at% N TiN layer and finally an outermost 32. 3 at% C TiC layer with the same cF 8 NaCl type unit cell. The multilayer coating showed a gentle transition of elastic-plastic properties assessed by the H/E* and the H 3 /E* 2 ratios and the elastic recovery {{as a function of the}} distance from the surface of the specimen. The adhesion of the multilayered coating to the substrate was greater in the case of the duplex coated specimen as compared to the non duplex treated H 13 steel...|$|R
40|$|Laser induced Chemical Vapour Deposition of a {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} has been studied extensively at reduced pressures. However, for this technique to be economically and industrially applicable, processes at atmospheric pressure are preferred. A model study was made on the substrate-coating system molybdenum-titaniumnitride focussing on the feasibility to deposit TiN films locally at atmospheric pressure. The results of this study turned out to be very promising. A Nd-YAG laser beam ([MATH] = 1064 nm), directed perpendicular to the substrate, is used to locally heat the substrate (pyrolytic atmospheric pressure Laser induced Chemical Vapour Deposition). The reactive atmosphere consists of TiCl 4, N 2 and H 2. The Laser Chemical <b>Vapour</b> Deposited nitride <b>coating</b> is characterized by SEM, EDAX, XRD, XPS, SAM and microhardness tests. The results show that the coatings are pure, polycrystalline, stoichiometric TiN with a hardness in the range 1900 to 2300 HV. The influence of laser irradiation parameters on the temperature distribution induced in molybdenum and on the deposit shape, spatial distribution and microstructure of TiN films has been studied. A fast laser spot pyrometer was built for the in-situ temperature measurements. Depending on the deposition conditions, different types of profiles, microstructures and distribution widths are observed. Two examples of atmospheric pressure Laser CVD deposited TiN films on 3 D-objects are given...|$|R
40|$|High-rate {{evaporation}} {{in combination}} with plasma processes is a promising approach to obtain new types of steel sheet coating with improved corrosion resistance and application properties. To estimate {{the potential for the}} application of PVD-coatings (physical <b>vapour</b> deposition) different <b>coating</b> systems for steel sheet as well as for hot-dip or elect ro-galvanized steel sheet were designed, The samples were produced on a laboratory scale using PVD processes with very high deposition rates (in the order of 1 mum s(- 1)) as well as high-power plasma processes for the pre-treatment. The relationship between the composition, microstructure and properties of the coating systems, in particular concerning corrosion protection, abrasion during forming, phosphating and paint adhesion, were studied. It was found that the corrosion resistance of galvanized steel sheets can be considerably improved by vapour deposition of metal or inorganic films with a thickness of several hundred nanometers. Investigations on vapour deposition of titanium and stainless steel coatings on steel sheets, for applications in a severely corrosive environment, showed that the corrosion resistance in relation to the coating thickness can be significantly enhanced by means of plasma activation during the vapour deposition process, Finally, an outlook on possible industrial applications including an estimation of the process costs will be presented. For certain coating systems the results look promising, Consequently, these particular coating systems will be investigated in more detail by means of using a large-scale in-line deposition plant for metallic strips and sheets...|$|R
40|$|The {{permeation}} {{of water}} <b>vapour</b> through a <b>coated</b> polymer {{gas barrier film}} {{is controlled by the}} defects in the coating. By modelling these defects as a combination of macro-defects (in which the activation energy of permeation is that of the underlying polymer substrate) and nano-defects (in which the activation energy of permeation is something greater than that of the polymer substrate), we are able to understand the mechanisms of permeation in high gas barrier layers. Permeation is controlled by the amounts of such defects, with the observed overall activation energy informing us of the relative permeation through macro- and nano-defects. Three examples of aluminium oxide (AlOx) -coated polymers are given to illustrate this: a comparison of poly(ethylene naphthalate) and polypropylene (OPP) substrates, the role of sputter power in AlOx/OPP films and the role of oxide thickness in AlOx/OPP films. When the amount of permeation through macro-defects is quite low, and hence nano-defect permeation is a significant proportion of the overall water vapour transport, control of each of the two defect types becomes important. Contrary to what has been previously assumed, the activation energy can be observed as greater in some cases in which the overall permeation is also greater, and this can be explained by an increase in the proportion of permeation taking place through nanodefects. This model is evidenced by reference to microstructural and other characterisation, and hence gives rise to understanding of the relationship between process properties, microstructure and permeation...|$|R
