40|$|Summary Threshold, supra-threshold, and {{physiological}} measures of visual performance are compared. Present physiological measures are {{of little use}} in visual performance research, but threshold and supra-threshold measures can be usefully used. The effects of illuminance, disability and discomfort glare, luminance distribution and colour on visual performance are then reviewed. Illuminance has the most important effect. The only other important variable is that of <b>veiling</b> <b>reflections.</b> The effect of the operational variables of subjects’ age, visual capability and the work characteristics are examined and indicate that human factors {{are more important than}} physical factors in their effect on visual performance. In the final section the synthesis of existing knowledge of visual performance, presented in CIE Report No. 19, is explained and suggestions made for extending and examining its validity and application. Some general pointers for the direction in which future research might progress are given. ...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reviews the}} role of {{illumination}} in shaping the indoor environment of the elderly person. The approach is that lighting has a twofold impact on the individual. One is {{as a source of}} information about the environment, i. e., visual, and the other is photobiologi-cal through the skin or photoreceptor. The visually lighted environment is reviewed, discussing first the physiological changes that occur during the aging process, then the effect of aging on visual performance, and finally the importance of qualitative factors in assessing the adequacy of an illuminated environment for the elderly. Special attention is given to application problems in lighting for the elderly, i. e., excessive brightness differences, discomfort glare, <b>veiling</b> <b>reflections,</b> and the importance of color and the spectral power distribution of the light source. The advantages of a full-spectrum light source which simulates natural sunlight for indoor illumination is discussed in light of recent research. The biologically lighted environment is reviewed in terms of the potential role that indoor illumination can play in regulating important biochemical processes in the elderly popula-tion, i. e., neuroendocrine control, vitamin Da synthesis, immunologic mechanisms, and cardiovascular regulation...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{excitement}} over the idea of "going green" when it comes to buildings because it is associated with energy savings and a reduced environmental footprint. Daylighting, or lighting interior spaces via natural light, is one such strategy already receiving attention from designers, but without a fuller understanding and sounder implementation strategies daylighting might not be optimized and worse, may pose a hindrance to occupants. This study puts the spotlight on the occupant as it examines the usefulness of daylighting and investigates the impact daylighting has on occupant comfort, satisfaction, and perceived performance. It also investigates what features of a specific daylighting design strategy have the greatest impacts. The methodology for this study includes the creation and usage of a daylighting design evaluation toolkit comprised of an occupant visual environment survey, lumen meter, fisheye lens camera, and glare-identifying computer software. Seventy-five occupants from a university laboratory building participated. Results showed that occupants in daylit spaces are more satisfied with their work environment, although conclusions regarding perceived performance could not be made. Exterior horizontal shading was found to have the strongest association to higher comfort and satisfaction ratings. Small scale fixed exterior vertical shading was actually found to have a negative correlation to occupant comfort and satisfaction, although {{this may be due to}} the specific vertical shading design. Further exploration with the data revealed that occupants who had glare in their workspace glare did not report dissatisfaction with it, but those with <b>veiling</b> <b>reflections</b> from electric light sources did report significant dissatisfaction. Additionally, occupants with controls over their electric lights showed greater satisfaction with the amount of light at their workstations...|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{a subject}} {{that has not been}} examined in Polish Film Studies yet, namely the specifics of the classic animated film from the People’s Republic of China (1957 - 1989) through the prism of the life and work of Te Wei, a doyen of Chinese animation. The author aims to define a category of the "Shanghai School of Animation" and to coin the term "minzu style" which refers both to aesthetics and the ideological assumptions of Chinese animation art. As early as in the 1930 s Te Wei was engaged in propaganda activities on behalf of the Communist Party of China realizing patriotic manhua. In 1949, he led the animation department at Changchun Film Studio and from 1957 he {{was the head of the}} Shanghai Animation Film Studio (SAFS). In 1957, Te Wei called animators to undertake the challenge of constructing a specifically Chinese style of animation and to use Western medium (cinematograph) in order to transmit Chinese "essence" through new techniques (e. g. ink-wash animation) and references to traditional symbolics (among others, Peking Opera). In this way, animated film production was adapted to the paradigm of Maoist propaganda that glorified Chinese cultural supremacy. For Chinese authors, <b>veiled</b> philosophical <b>reflection</b> of the relations between man and nature became the only available way of smuggling "artistic contraband" under totalitarian censorship, the possibility of expression that was fully exploited in the last film of the Chinese master (Feelings from Mountains and Water, 1988), completed in a period of modernization...|$|R
40|$|Display {{systems are}} key {{components}} of the digital radiology department. Current display systems for medical imaging are based on cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) or active-matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCDs). The CRT is a cathodoluminescent display: Light is generated by exciting a luminescent material with energetic electrons. AMLCDs are light-modulating devices that form the image in the screen by controlling the transparency of individual display pixels. Many image quality aspects of CRTs {{are determined by the}} way the pixel luminance is generated in the cathodoluminescent screen. The resolution properties of AMLCDs are much better than those of CRTs. In CRT devices, phosphor granularity and raster scanning patterns are the main components of spatial noise. In AMLCDs, the most notable feature of the noise characteristic is the subpixel structure of complex pixel designs used in medical displays. The small-spot contrast of CRTs is dominated mainly by <b>veiling</b> glare and <b>reflections</b> of ambient illumination. In addition to display reflectance, the contrast of medical AMLCDs is affected by crosstalk and by variations of the luminance at off-normal viewing angles.

60|$|As the echoing {{footsteps}} paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps {{that sound}} so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this, Plattner perceived about {{him a great}} multitude of dim faces gathering together {{out of the darkness}} and watching the two people in the room. Never before had he seen so many of the Watchers of the Living. A multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room, another multitude, in infinite anguish, watched the woman as she hunted with greedy eyes for something she could not find. They crowded about Plattner, they came across his sight and buffeted his face, the noise of their unavailing regrets was all about him. He saw clearly only now and then. At other times the picture quivered dimly, through the <b>veil</b> of green <b>reflections</b> upon their movements. In the room it must have been very still, and Plattner says the candle flame streamed up into a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each footfall and its echoes beat like a clap of thunder. And the faces! Two, more particularly near the woman's: one a woman's also, white and clear-featured, a face which might have once been cold and hard, but which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth. The other might have been the woman's father. Both were evidently absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness, so it seemed, which they could no longer guard against and prevent. Behind were others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill, friends whose influence had failed. And over the man, too--a multitude, but none that seemed to be parents or teachers! Faces that might once have been coarse, now purged to strength by sorrow! And in the forefront one face, a girlish one, neither angry nor remorseful, but merely patient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner, waiting for relief. His powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude of ghastly countenances. They gathered on the stroke of the bell. He saw them all {{in the space of a}} second. It would seem that he was so worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it before him. But he does not remember that.|$|R
