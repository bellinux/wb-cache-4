This paper describes a real-time evaluation LabVIEW system for an SoC algorithm, that calculates the SoC in [%] {{and also the}} remaining run-time available under the <b>valid</b> <b>discharge</b> conditions. With the described system {{the accuracy of the}} SoC algorithm and its validity can be determined. The final goal of the SoC algorithm is to predict the remaining capacity of the battery and the remaining run-time with an accuracy of 1 minute or better under all realistic user conditions, including a wide variety of load currents and a wide temperature range. The basis of the SoC algorithm is current measurement and integration during charge and discharge state and voltage measurement during equilibrium state. Experimental results show the testing ability of the real-time evaluation system and the effectiveness of the novel approach for improving the accuracy of the SoC indication...|$|E
40|$|Background: Emergency {{hospital}} admission with adversity-related injury (ie, self-inflicted, drug-related or alcohol-related, {{or violent}} injury) affects 4 % of 10 – 19 -year-olds. Their {{risk of death}} in the decade after hospital discharge is twice as high as that of adolescents admitted to hospitals for accident-related injury. We established how cause of death varied between these groups. Methods: We did a retrospective, nationwide, cohort study comparing risks of death in five causal groups (suicide, drug-related or alcohol-related, homicide, accidental, and other causes of death) up to 10 years after hospital discharge following adversity-related (self-inflicted, drug-related or alcohol-related, or violent injury) or accident-related (for which there was no recorded adversity) injury. We included adolescents (aged 10 – 19 years) who were admitted as an emergency for adversity-related or accident-related injury between April 1, 1997, and March 31, 2012. We excluded adolescents who did not have their sex recorded, died during the index admission, had no <b>valid</b> <b>discharge</b> date, or were admitted with injury related to neither adversity nor accidents. We identified admissions for adversity-related or accident-related injury to the National Health Service in England with the International Classification of Diseases- 10 codes in Hospital Episode Statistics data, linked to the Office for National Statistics mortality data for England, to establish cause-specific risks of death between the first day and 10 years after discharge, and to compare risks between adversity-related and accident-related index injury after adjustment for age group, socioeconomic status, and chronic conditions. Findings: We identified 1 080 368 adolescents (388 937 [36 · 0 %] girls, 690 546 [63 · 9 %] boys, and 885 [0 · 1 %] adolescents who did not have their sex recorded). Of these adolescents, we excluded 40 549 (10 · 4 %) girls, 56 107 (8 · 1 %) boys, and all 885 without their sex recorded. Of the 333 009 (30 · 8 %) adolescents admitted with adversity-related injury (181 926 [54 · 6 %] girls and 151 083 [45 · 4 %] boys) and 649 818 (60 · 2 %) admitted with accident-related injury (166 462 [25 · 6 %] girls and 483 356 [74 · 4 %] boys), 4782 (0 · 5 %) died in the 10 years after discharge (1312 [27 · 4 %] girls and 3470 [72 · 6 %] boys). Adolescents discharged after adversity-related injury had higher risks of suicide (adjusted subhazard ratio 4 · 54 [95 % CI 3 · 25 – 6 · 36] for girls, and 3 · 15 [2 · 73 – 3 · 63] for boys) and of drug-related or alcohol-related death (4 · 71 [3 · 28 – 6 · 76] for girls, and 3 · 53 [3 · 04 – 4 · 09] for boys) in the next decade than they did after accident-related injury. Although we included homicides in our estimates of 10 -year risks of adversity-related deaths, we did not explicitly present these risks because of small numbers and risks of statistical disclosure. There was insufficient evidence that girls discharged after adversity-related injury had increased risks of accidental deaths compared with those discharged after accident-related injury (adjusted subhazard ratio 1 · 21 [95 % CI 0 · 90 – 1 · 63]), but there was evidence that this risk was increased for boys (1 · 26 [1 · 09 – 1 · 47]). There was evidence of decreased risks of other causes of death in girls (0 · 64 [0 · 53 – 0 · 77]), but not in boys (0 · 99 [0 · 84 – 1 · 17]). Risks of suicide were increased following self-inflicted injury (adjusted subhazard ratio 5 · 11 [95 % CI 3 · 61 – 7 · 23] for girls, and 6 · 20 [5 · 27 – 7 · 30] for boys), drug-related or alcohol-related injury (4 · 55 [3 · 23 – 6 · 39] for girls, and 4 · 51 [3 · 89 – 5 · 24] for boys), and violent injury in boys (1 · 43 [1 · 15 – 1 · 78]) versus accident-related injury. However, the increased risk of suicide in girls following violent injury versus accident-related injury was not significantly increased (adjusted subhazard ratio 1 · 48 [95 % CI 0 · 73 – 2 · 98]). Following each type of index injury, risks of suicide and risks of drug-related or alcohol-related death were increased by similar magnitudes. Interpretation: Risks of suicide were significantly increased after all types of adversity-related injury except for girls who had violent injury. Risks of drug-related or alcohol-related death increased by a similar magnitude. Current practice to reduce risks of harm after self-inflicted injury should be extended to drug-related or alcohol-related and violent injury in adolescence. Prevention should address the substantial risks of drug-related or alcohol-related death alongside risks of suicide. Funding: UK Department of Health...|$|E
40|$|This Article is {{concerned}} with one key aspect {{of the law of}} the military jihad: the Islamic concept of martyrdom [shahada or istishhad]. This Article will demonstrate that the current Islamist financing and systematic organization and direction of self-annihilatory acts of violence is only weakly supported, if at all, by the classical sources on martyrdom in Islamic law and jurisprudence. The Article will show that current justifications for self-annihilatory violence are instead the result of a major reinterpretation of the theology and religious law on martyrdom and the military jihad advanced by Shi 2 ̆ 7 ite theologians and jurists in Iraq and Iran between the mid- 1960 s and the late- 1970 s. The Article is divided into seven parts. Part I defines key terminology and introduces the reader to the issue of martyrdom, contrasting Islamic with Christian and Jewish views. Part II reviews the essentials of the Islamic law of war. Part III identifies the Sunni and Shi 2 ̆ 7 a theological and jurisprudential sources on martyrdom and argues that, while there are great similarities between the Sunni and Shi 2 ̆ 7 a approaches to the regulation of behavior in war, the Shi 2 ̆ 7 a approach to martyrdom is significantly {{different from that of the}} Sunnis. Part III spends some time describing Husayn 2 ̆ 7 s example, with its emphasis on extreme self-sacrifice and militancy as a weapon against tyranny and injustice, and shows that his example has always been among the most important paradigms in Shi 2 ̆ 7 a theology, although the “Twelvers,” the majority Shi 2 ̆ 7 a sect, did not emphasize its militant aspects for over a thousand years. Part IV will show that, beginning with the advent of European colonialism in the eighteenth century, the paradigm of Husayn 2 ̆ 7 s martyrdom began to take an increased importance as a normative reference point for anti-colonial activities among the Shi 2 ̆ 7 a. Although the paradigm of the normative example of Husayn ebbed and flowed as a political rallying point for over two hundred years, it ultimately reached a zenith when an important group of Shi 2 ̆ 7 a ulama came together in the Iraqi city of Najaf in the 1960 s. This group began to robustly revive and reinterpret the paradigm in a way that eventually led to self-annihilatory violent behavior by Shi 2 ̆ 7 a military jihadists, fundamentally altering the Shi 2 ̆ 7 a conception of the religious law of martyrdom. Part IV will also show that this new Shi 2 ̆ 7 a discourse on jihad and martyrdom emerging from Najaf [...] led by Imam Ruhollah Khomeini and a brilliant Iraqi jurist named Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, and later by Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, spiritual mentor of Hizbu 2 ̆ 7 llah in Lebanon [...] rapidly proliferated throughout the Muslim world. It became an important factor in the achievement of several practical successes, particularly the Iranian Islamic Revolution and, some time later, the ejection of Israeli, French, and American forces from Lebanon. The author will argue that while Sunni Islamists also worked a similar reinterpretive revival of the Sunni sources on the military jihad during this same time in Egypt and elsewhere, they never advocated self-annihilation and they did not achieve the kinds of spectacular successes accomplished by the Shi 2 ̆ 7 a jihadists. The Shi 2 ̆ 7 a reinterpretation of the theology and law on jihad and martyrdom, first articulated by Khomeini and the ulama in Najaf, and later elaborated by Fadlallah in Lebanon, went much further than the Sunni reinterpretation and has profoundly influenced the behavior of all subsequent military jihadists throughout the Islamic world. Part V of the Article will demonstrate that this revived Shi 2 ̆ 7 a approach to martyrdom now dominates all Muslim conceptions of the military jihad, whether Sunni or Shi 2 ̆ 7 a. The author will argue that this transformation of religious doctrine, championed by the Shi 2 ̆ 7 a ulama and emulated first by Hizbu 2 ̆ 7 llah, then by the Palestinians and later by Al Qaeda, resulted in the appearance of a new norm of jihadist battlefield behavior [...] self-annihilation [...] a norm that is now accepted as a <b>valid</b> <b>discharge</b> of religious obligation under the law of the military jihad by a great many Muslim jurists, Sunni and Shi 2 ̆ 7 a. This conclusion effectively debunks the conventional wisdom, popular in many quarters, that self-annihilatory violence by the Palestinians and by operatives of Al Qaeda flows from either a nihilistic sense of despair growing out of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza or from adherence to Wahhabism. The author will argue that Wahhabism actually has very little do with the current jihadist use of self-annihilatory violence, and that Arab and Muslim despair, while an important factor, cannot provide a satisfactory explanation for such violence. Rather, it is the Shi 2 ̆ 7 a theology that provides the linchpin for such behavior. Part VI offers some tentative observations on the normative implications of the development of this new jihadist view of martyrdom for Islamic law generally. The Article concludes in Part VII that the development of this new norm is a profoundly significant development with major implications for Islamic jurisprudence generally and for the nature of juridical relations between Sunni and Shi 2 ̆ 7 ite Islam...|$|E

We can use to derive the <b>discharge</b> <b>valid</b> rating curve or the method of calculating velocity with certain values of roughness coefficients, which are influenced by natural flow conditions and its surroundings.

40|$|Lightning mapping or {{lightning}} locating {{systems are}} based on several working principles such as the Time of Arrival and the Directional Finder. The country wide lightning locating system (LLS) operated by Tenaga Nasional Berhad Malaysia is able to determine the coordinate of the cloud-to-ground lightning strike with an uncertainty of about 500 m. The LLS is made of high performance sensors positioned throughout the country together with a central processing unit. An alternative method known as the localised lightning locating system (LLLS) is proposed to determine the coordinate of any cloud-to-ground lightning strike within a certain local region. The LLLS {{is based on the}} measurement of induced voltages due to lightning strikes in the vicinity of an existing overhead twisted telephone lines. The system consists of twisted pair overhead lines, induced voltage signal transducers, signal transmission cables, and a user friendly processing unit. The overhead lines have been constructed and laid in such a way to form a cartesian system suitable for lightning strike coordinate calculation with a total coverage area of 210 m x 270 m. The processing software which has been programmed in LabView is able to detect and plot the strike locations. Calibration results on the LLLS performance for one axis (y-axis) show less than 1 % error of coordinate position. The field measurements in the month of August 2008 showed a significant result of lightning strike activities. Comparing the lightning density detected by the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) and the LLLS for the same day, the LLLS has detected more lightning strikes than NLDN. This {{may be due to the}} inability of the LLLS to differentiate between <b>valid</b> cloud-ground <b>discharges</b> and other types of discharges. The developed LLLS can be used as an alternative measuring system to determine a lightning strike location within a small area with a better accuracy due to the small coverage area...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of plasma temperatures (gas temperature and electron excitation temperature) and electron density in a pulsed-dc excited atmospheric helium plasma jet are studied by relative and absolute optical emission spectroscopy (OES). High-resolution OES is performed for the helium and hydrogen lines for {{the determination of}} electron density through the Stark broadening mechanism. A superposition fitting method composed of two component profiles corresponding to two different electron densities is developed to fit the investigated lines. Electron densities of the orders of magnitude of 10 (21) and 10 (20) m(- 3) are characterized for the center and edge regions in the jet discharge when the applied voltage is higher than 13. 0 kV. The atomic state distribution function (ASDF) of helium demonstrates that the discharge deviates from the Boltzmann-Saha equilibrium state, especially for the helium lower levels, which are significantly overpopulated. Local electron excitation temperatures T- 13 and T-spec corresponding to the lower and upper parts of the helium ASDF are defined and found to range from 1. 2 eV to 1. 4 eV and 0. 2 eV to 0. 3 eV, respectively. A comparative analysis shows that the Saha balance is <b>valid</b> in the <b>discharge</b> for helium atoms at high excited states...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 109 - 115). Modeling battery performance under arbitrary load has gained importance {{in recent years}} with the increasing demand on batteries in various fields from automotive industry to consumer electronic devices. Due to numerous application areas of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, researchers have tried to predict the battery performance and the voltage using extensive calculations. Unfortunately, {{in order to achieve}} high levels of accuracy, the model has to be algebraically and computationally complex. Models with decreased computational and algebraic complexity suffer from loss of accuracy. In this thesis, we offer a new modeling approach to predict the voltage responses of batteries and supercapacitors which is both algebraically straightforward and yielding more accurate results. Our approach is <b>valid</b> using any <b>discharge</b> profile including published by regulatory bodies such as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our method is based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements done on the system to be predicted and slow DC discharge. EIS data is used directly to predict the fast moving portion of the voltage response to the profiles. The EIS data is used as is, namely, in frequency domain without any modeling. The slow DC discharge data provides DC response and is added in through a straightforward lookup table. This widely applicable approach can predict the voltage with less than 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{fundamentals}} and first applications of spatially-resolved Langmuir probe diagnostics in dusty plasmas {{with respect to}} laboratory and microgravity experiments. The basics of dusty plasmas and the subtleties of Langmuir probe theory in low density plasmas with weak collisionality are described. The investigations address the following topics: the design of an rf compensated miniature Langmuir probe with two-axis drive, which matches the constraints for experiments under microgravity the evaluation and adaption of available probe theories {{for the analysis of}} probe data under typical discharge conditions used for complex plasma experiments the quantification of possible feedback of the probe on the plasma and verification of the developed Langmuir probe system the investigation of effects of the probe on the surrounding particle distribution the demonstration of first probe diagnostics applications in dusty and dust-free plasmas The major results can be summarized as follows: An automatic fitting algorithm for the Langmuir probe data based on the ABR-Model was developed that includes corrections for ion-neutral collisions. The competing OML-model was found to be not <b>valid</b> in given <b>discharge</b> regime. The random sampling technique to obtain probe characteristics was optimized to avoid dust contamination of the probe. An important discovery was the observation of ``anti-voids'' around probes and their explanation by quantitative modeling of the acting ion drag and electric field forces on dust particles in the presheath regime. From the understanding of this mechanism the formation of dust layering and its relationship to the gradients of exerted forces could be explained by direct comparison between model and experimental observations. The marking of the equilibrium point by dust tracers was introduced as a novel technique to visualize the sheath boundaries. The quantitative comparison of probe diagnostics with SIGLO plasma simulations shows now a reasonable agreement, which is an important prerequisite for future applications of the Langmuir probe in the IMPF experiments aboard the International Space Station...|$|R
