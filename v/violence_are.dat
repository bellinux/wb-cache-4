5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world.

5|$|Shaoguan {{authorities}} {{moved the}} Uyghur workers to temporary accommodation, {{and the workers}} were transferred on 7 July to another facility belonging to Early Light, 30km away in Baitu town. The Baitu factory is now reported to be an Uyghur enclave, with, sporting facilities, canteen serving Xinjiang food, a round-the-clock staff clinic, and plain-clothed police officers in their midst. According to the South China Morning Post, the Kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix with colleagues in their previous location because of the language barrier – a local shop worker estimated that less than one in three spoke Mandarin. Two months on, the South China Morning Post found few {{willing to talk about}} the events of the fateful night. The authorities' claims that 50 Uyghur workers were granted their repatriation requests following the <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> contested by Uyghur workers.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Sexual {{violence}} and conflict {{go hand in}} hand. In ancient warfare, sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> a common procedure, perceived as an inevitable consequence of war. Soldiers needed to 'release' after heavy fighting; sexual distraction would reward, motivate and relax them. In other words, sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> seen as 'collateral damage' and was therefore never prosecuted as a crime. This practice started to change after the Second World War. In fact, {{at the moment the}} existence of sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> internationally acknowledged, women's rights gained recognition and several forms of sexual <b>violence</b> <b>were</b> classified. Finally, sexual <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> labeled as a 'weapon of war'...|$|R

25|$|Aboriginals {{are also}} more likely to be the victims of crime. This is {{particularly}} true in the younger population (aged 15–34), where acts of <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> two and a half times more likely to occur than in the older population. Domestic violence and sexual abuse against children is more prevalent in the Aboriginal population with sexual abuse affecting 25–50% of Aboriginal female children versus 20–25% of female children in the general population. Children who come from homes with a history of <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> at a greater risk of becoming the perpetrators of violence later in life. This is especially true of males.|$|E

25|$|Early {{intervention}} programs, such as school-based {{programs to}} prevent dating <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> also effective.

5000|$|Expressive <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> a {{spontaneous}} attack typically {{carried out by}} women. [...] In this tactic, the attacker lashes out suddenly due to intense feelings of danger, fear, anger or resentment, resulting in the sudden jump into action. It can be concluded that expressive <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> a more responsive attack that occurs when the perpetrator feels provoked or threatened, whereas instrumental <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> carefully planned out and driven by vengeance.|$|R

This includes violence against religious institutions, people, objects, or events when the <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> motivated to some degree by some religious aspect of the target or by the precepts of the attacker. Religious violence does not refer exclusively to acts committed by religious groups, but includes acts committed by secular groups against religious groups.|$|R

25|$|Pacifism may {{be based}} on moral {{principles}} (a deontological view) or pragmatism (a consequentialist view).

Pacifists generally reject theories of Just War.|$|E
25|$|Drug-facilitated {{sexual assault}} (DFSA), {{also known as}} {{predator}} rape, is a sexual assault carried out after the victim has become incapacitated due to having consumed alcoholic beverages or other drugs. Alcohol {{has been shown to}} play a disinhibiting role in certain types of sexual assault, as have some other drugs, notably cocaine. Alcohol has a psychopharmacological effect of reducing inhibitions, clouding judgements and impairing the ability to interpret cues. The biological links between alcohol and <b>violence</b> <b>are,</b> however, complex. Research on the social anthropology of alcohol consumption suggests that connections between violence, drinking and drunkenness are socially learnt rather than universal. Some researchers have noted that alcohol may act as a cultural break time, providing the opportunity for antisocial behavior. Thus {{people are more likely to}} act violently when drunk because they do not consider that they will be held accountable for their behavior. Some forms of group sexual <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> also associated with drinking. In these settings, consuming alcohol is an act of group bonding, where inhibitions are collectively reduced and individual judgement ceded in favor of the group.|$|E
25|$|Homeless women, {{both those}} with {{children}} and without, experience higher rates of physical illness than men. They {{are also more likely}} to be hyper-vigilant and have high levels of stress. Women seeking refuge from domestic <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> not always able to find rooms in shelters. Some women have been turned away from homeless shelters because shelter staff believe that turning women away will stop people from having sex inside the shelter.|$|E
5000|$|In war journalism, <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} {{presented as}} only its own cause, ignoring {{the possibility of}} structural or psychological causes. Since <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> assumed to have no cause or explanation (such as the deprived needs of parties), conventional conflict reporting may leave viewers {{to conclude that the}} only [...] "natural" [...] or reasonable response to <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> more <b>violence.</b> [...] That [...] "more violence—‘the only language they understand'—is an appropriate remedy", and that non-violent responses are irrelevant or 'unrealistic'.|$|R
40|$|<b>Violence</b> <b>is</b> {{the use of}} force. Where <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> used in administration, {{a special}} {{category}} of administrative <b>violence</b> can <b>be</b> identified.

Many leaders have found the avoidance of <b>violence</b> to <b>be</b> more effective, economical and productive of lasting solutions.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{domestic}} <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> well researched and documented. Feminist researchers and academics have thoroughly examined the issue, {{laws have been}} changed, a national community education program is being launched today. Yet somehow, despite law reform, research and academic discourse, {{we live in a}} society which collectively condones violence in the home, a society where 20 per cent of people think <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> justified in some circumstances, and 33 per cent of people consider domestic violence should remain a private matter (Office of the Status of Women 1988). That domestic <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> on the agenda of a conference about alcohol is no surprise. An estimated 80 per cent of all Australians believe alcohol to be a major cause of domestic violence (Office of the Status of Women 1988). That domestic <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> on the agenda of a conference about crime is an encouraging sign, because few people give domestic violence criminal status. This paper shall argue that domestic <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> a crime and must be responded to as a crime if social change is to occur; that domestic <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not caused by alcohol; and finally...|$|R
25|$|Bruises, broken bones, head injuries, lacerations, and {{internal}} bleeding {{are some of}} the acute effects of a domestic violence incident that require medical attention and hospitalization.

Victims who are pregnant during a domestic violence relationship experience greater risk of miscarriage, pre-term labor, and injury to or death of the fetus.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2010–11 Tunisian Revolution, a Constituent Assembly {{worked for}} 2.5 years to {{written a new}} Constitution, {{approved}} in January 2014, contained a provision in Article 6 granting freedom of conscience. It also stipulates that 'ccusations of apostasy and incitement to <b>violence</b> <b>are</b> prohibited'. With it, Tunisia became the first Arab-majority country to protect its citizens from prosecution for renouncing Islam. Critics have pointed out alleged flaws of this formulation, namely that it violates the freedom of expression.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{occupational}} safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry. Construction workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of drowning.
