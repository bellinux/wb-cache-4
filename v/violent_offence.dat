60|$|As the King's ruin {{had begun}} in a favourite, so it seemed likely to end in one. He was too poor a {{creature}} to rely at all upon himself; and his new favourite was one HUGH LE DESPENSER, {{the son of a}} gentleman of ancient family. Hugh was handsome and brave, but he was the favourite of a weak King, whom no man cared a rush for, and that was a dangerous place to hold. The Nobles leagued against him, because the King liked him; and they lay in wait, both for his ruin and his father's. Now, the King had married him to the daughter of the late Earl of Gloucester, and had given both him and his father great possessions in Wales. In their endeavours to extend these, they gave <b>violent</b> <b>offence</b> to an angry Welsh gentleman, named JOHN DE MOWBRAY, and to divers other angry Welsh gentlemen, who resorted to arms, took their castles, and seized their estates. The Earl of Lancaster had first placed the favourite (who was a poor relation of his own) at Court, and he considered his own dignity offended by the preference he received and the honours he acquired; so he, and the Barons who were his friends, joined the Welshmen, marched on London, and sent a message to the King demanding to have the favourite and his father banished. At first, the King unaccountably took it into his head to be spirited, and to send them a bold reply; but when they quartered themselves around Holborn and Clerkenwell, and went down, armed, to the Parliament at Westminster, he gave way, and complied with their demands.|$|E

Participants and procedure Latent class analysis was used to identify homogeneous subgroups of prisoners based on their responses to the 10 questions reflecting criminal intent. Participants were 309 male recidivistic prisoners incarcerated in a maximum security prison. Multinomial logistic regression was used to interpret the nature of the latent classes, or groups, by estimating the association between recidivism and latent classes of criminal intent while controlling for <b>offence</b> type (robbery, <b>violent</b> <b>offences,</b> murder, and multiple offences), number of arrests, and age. Results The best fitting latent class model was a three-class solution: ‘High criminal intent’ (49. 3 %), ‘Intermediate criminal intent’ (41. 3 %), and ‘Low criminal intent’ (9. 4 %). The latent classes were differentially related to the external variables (recidivism, <b>violent</b> <b>offences,</b> and age). Conclusions Criminal intent is best explained by three homogeneous classes that appear to represent an underlying continuum. Future work is needed to identify whether these distinct classes of criminal intent may predict engagement in various types of criminal behaviour...|$|R

[...] Preventive detention has a minimum non-parole period of five years in prison, but the sentencing judge can extend this if they believe that the prisoner's history warrants it.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore the {{political}} climate and its relationship with attitudes to punishment and perception of what actually constitutes punishment. It s a comment piece asking for a critical review of sentencing practice- particularly in relation to short sentences for non <b>violent</b> <b>offences.</b> The article suggests that courts need be mindful that when considering a custodial sentence there is a bar of consideration that the offence must be 'so serious' as so warrant a custodial sentence. Given that 84 % of women and 71 % of men are serving relatively short sentences for non <b>violent</b> <b>offences</b> - this suggests this mindfulness is often absent.

50|$|The {{populations and}} {{demographics}} {{of male and}} female inmate populations in the US are very different from one another. These differences factor heavily into theories on prisoner social organization. The most significant difference is in the relative size {{of male and female}} populations; in 2014 there were approximately 1,440,000 male and 112,000 female prisoners in the United States. The much larger size of the male prison population causes major differences in the institutions in which male and female inmates serve their time. Another significant factor in prisoner social structure is the differences in arrest factors for male and female prison populations; higher proportion of female inmates are incarcerated due to a property or drug charge than are their male counterparts, a higher proportion of whom have been arrested for a <b>violent</b> <b>offence.</b>|$|E
50|$|Assault occasioning actual {{bodily harm}} is a {{specified}} offence {{for the purposes}} of chapter 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 because it is a specified <b>violent</b> <b>offence.</b> It is not a serious offence {{for the purposes of}} that Chapter because it is not, apart from section 225, punishable {{in the case of a}} person aged 18 or over by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for a determinate period of ten years or more. This means that sections 227 and 228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (which relate to extended sentences) apply where a person is convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, committed after the commencement of section 227 or 228 (as the case may be) and the court considers that there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by the offender of further specified offences.|$|E
40|$|Overview Aims: To determine: (1) the {{long-term}} risk that someone {{charged with a}} <b>violent</b> <b>offence</b> will commit another <b>violent</b> <b>offence</b> (2) what factors influence the likelihood of desistance {{and the length of}} time to the next <b>violent</b> <b>offence</b> for those who do re-offend. Method: All 26, 472 offenders who were born between 1986 and 1990 (inclusive) and who had at least one <b>violent</b> <b>offence</b> proved against them in New South Wales (NSW) before December 31 st, 2014 were followed up to December 31 st, 2015. An offence was counted as proved if at the index contact it resulted in a caution, a youth justice conference or proven court appearance. The mean follow-up time for offenders in the study was 6. 35 years (range = 21. 3 years; interquartile range = 4. 7 years). Bivariate correlates of time to re-offend were identified using log-rank tests. Multivariate analysis of survival time was undertaken using a cure fraction model with a loglogistic distribution of survival time. Results: In the median case, after 20 years, an estimated 23 per cent of violent offenders committed a further <b>violent</b> <b>offence.</b> However the risk of violent re-offending varies greatly across different offender groups, being much higher for Indigenous offenders, those who were aged 17 and under {{at the time of their}} index contact and those whose first contact with the criminal justice system occurred when they were 12 years of age or younger. There is little evidence of specialisation among violent offenders in the sample. Most have committed a wide variety of different offences prior to their conviction for a <b>violent</b> <b>offence</b> and those who do re-offend commit a wide variety of offences. Conclusion: Authorities charged with responsibility for making bail, sentencing and parole decisions in relation to violent offenders need to pay close attention to the characteristics of the violent offenders they are dealing with. Evaluations of violent offender programs should include both short-term and long-term follow up. Prison is not a very effective instrument through which to reduce violent offending...|$|E

40|$|Description and {{explanation}} {{of the relationship between}} economic downturn and crime have to date been limited by the narrow scope of criminal activity characteristically selected as a focus by pertinent criminological scholarship. Efforts to examine the relationship have overwhelmingly approached it through the prism of common property and <b>violent</b> <b>offences,</b> or, and to a lesser degree, white-collar crime. As a consequence, appreciation has been impeded of the existence and heightened political significance of diverse and complex connections between a wider array of forms of criminality during times of economic downturn.
