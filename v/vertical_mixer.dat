40|$|The {{flexibility}} of distillers grains {{has made it}} a major substitute for corn in beef feed rations. However, producers are having issues with feeding wet distillers grains. This study addresses three major mixing conditions: ingredient addition order, mixing time, and mixer design. The addition orders considered were hay-corn-protein-DWG and hay-DWG-protein-corn. Horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>mixers</b> were tested at mix times of 3, 5, and 7 min mixing a beef finishing ration containing wet distillers grains. Test results were obtained using total mixed ration and Pennsylvania State University Particle Separator analyses. Results showed that the 3 -min mixing time is sufficient, thus when adding distillers grains, longer mix times are not needed. The hay- corn-protein- DWG ingredient addition order is recommended for both mixers when using liquid additives in the ration {{in order to avoid}} unwanted bundle formation.

This style of mixer cleans well between batches, and is favoured for coloured concrete, smaller batches (typically [...] ), and multiple discharge points.

40|$|<b>Vertical</b> axis <b>mixers,</b> such as {{high shear}} granulators and {{agitated}} filter dryers (AFDs), are commonly used in the processing of particulate materials. For example, AFDs are regularly used in the pharmaceutical industry to dry the wet active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles. During the drying process, an impeller blade agitates the bed to increase the drying rate and enhance drying uniformity. Unfortunately, the needle-shaped API particles tend to flow poorly, are frequently damaged, and can sometimes form undesirable agglomerates, causing manufacturing inefficiencies, flow stoppages, and unpredictable product quality. Therefore, {{it is important to}} gain an improved understanding of the system 2 ̆ 7 s particle behavior to aid in the design and optimization of unit operations. Previous work in <b>vertical</b> axis <b>mixers,</b> especially prior computational work, has assumed spherical particles. This thesis focuses on modeling and analysis of dynamics and stresses of elongated particles processed in <b>vertical</b> axis <b>mixers.</b> Elongated particles are of particular interest in the operation of pharmaceutical AFDs since the particles processed in such devices are often needle-shaped. ^ A discrete element method (DEM) model is used to examine the velocity, solid fraction, and particle orientation fields of non-cohesive, sphero-cylindrical particles agitated in a <b>vertical</b> axis <b>mixer</b> for a range of particle aspect ratios and bed depths. The model is validated against experimental measurements of the rotating shaft torque and bed surface velocity field. The particle trajectories within the bed are similar to those that have been reported previously for spheres, with a vortex circulating in the direction opposite of the blade rotation on horizontal planes of the bed. Increasing the particle aspect ratio generally decreases the particle velocities relative to the blade, implying reduced mixing. The solid fraction is largest just upstream of the blades and toward the base of the container. The former finding is different than what has been observed for spheres, but the latter is consistent with prior observations. The smallest solid fractions are located in the wake region and at the bed 2 ̆ 7 s free surface, which is similar to the patterns for spheres. In general, larger particle aspect ratios decrease the overall bed solid fraction as well as the solid fraction uniformity. Particles with an aspect ratio larger than one have major axes that are offset between 10 – 20 degrees from the flow streamlines. The degree of alignment between particles increases near boundary regions. In addition to the strong correlation between the particle principal orientation and velocity vectors, regions of larger velocity gradient magnitude result in smaller solid fractions and smaller degrees of three-dimensional alignment between particles. ^ In addition, the DEM model is used to predict the internal load and moment distribution within sphero-cylindrical particles in a low-speed, <b>vertical</b> axis <b>mixer.</b> The internal loads and moments are combined with small deformation beam bending theory to determine the internal stress distributions. Parametric studies using the model examined the influence of particle aspect ratio, blade rotational speed, and material properties. The spatial distributions of loads and moments, averaged over all particles and time steps, are symmetric about the particle center-plane with a maximum at the particle center-plane. In addition, the largest average maximum principal stress or Mises stress is observed to occur along the particle circumference at the center-plane of the particle. These results indicate that particle failure is not only most likely to occur at the center-plane of the particle, but the failure will occur at the particle 2 ̆ 7 s circumference. The largest average values of loads and moments increase with particle aspect ratio. The largest average maximum principal stress and Mises stress both increase with increasing particle aspect ratio. The trend of largest average maximum principal stress or Mises stress appears to have a positive curvature, which follows the trend of largest average bending moment most closely. The frequency distributions of maximum principal stress at high stress range can be fit to a Weibull distribution. Increasing blade speed, bed height and particle-particle friction coefficient generally leads to an increase in internal loads, moments and stresses, i. e. more particle breakage. ...|$|R

40|$|Anaerobic digesters {{continue}} to be a focus for processing wastewater solids to produce a renewable fuel source, digester gas. Effective mixing of the digester contents is important for process stability, maximizing gas production, minimizing scum and foam formation, and preventing solids deposition in the digester.

40|$|Systems of {{particles}} can be modeled {{in a number}} of ways. The discrete element method (DEM) is among the most detailed of all possible approaches. When using DEM, the trajectory of each and every particle is computed. Naturally, this comes at a high computational cost. At a more abstract, vessel scale level, population balance (PB) modeling is also used. In this approach a system of partial differential equations is written (similar to the conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy) which describes the evolution of the distribution of particle properties (e. g., size, composition, and age). Unfortunately PB cannot directly account for the motion of material in a vessel in a computationally efficient manner. ^ In this work, a novel multi-scale modeling approach is presented in which DEM and PB models are combined via a compartment model (CM) to account for flow heterogeneity in a particle mixer-coater. Using this approach, the mixer is decomposed into bed and spray regions, and particle trajectories taken from the DEM model are used to generate an intermediate sub-CM that matches the residence time distributions {{of particles}} in these regions. A system of PB models is then generated from the CM. The CM presents a simplified, but still accurate description of the particle residence times in the regions of the mixer. A case study of a simple top spray coating system shows the method is 80 % faster than using DEM alone with 13 % of the error of using PB alone. Approaches to estimating the minimum DEM simulation time are also presented. Parametric studies are performed which demonstrate that as operating parameters of the mixer are varied, the CM structure remains and only the CM parameters change. This fact allows generation of a single CM structure for a given system. The method is applied to three mixer geometries: a dual-axis paddle mixer, a horizontal axis rotating drum, and a <b>vertical</b> axis <b>mixer.</b> ^ The approach is limited to systems in which the residence time in a region is statistically independent of the residence time in any other region. Also, a region’s residence time distribution must be able to be modeled in terms of a network of ideal compartments. The mixer flow must also have reached a steady state so that each region’s residence time distributions does not vary with time. Within these constraints, the multi-scale modeling approach developed in this thesis is capable of drastically reducing computational time and increasing total process understand via the reduction of a full DEM simulation to a simple CM. ...|$|R

The description of a mixing process {{where one of the}} factors is the randomness of particle motion causes additional difficulties. In the article, the authors make an attempt to describe the mixing process of a nine-element system which is a collection of grains of different characterization, among others, the size of grains, densities, or the shape of the mixed elements. In order to describe the process, the cluster analysis is used and thanks to this, homogeneous subpopulations are distinguished out of items originating in heterogeneous population.

40|$|Abstract. A <b>vertical</b> {{livestock}} feed <b>mixer</b> with spring-controlled packaging unit was designed, constructed and tested. This design had in focus a weighing and gauging mechanism which made possible a semi-automatic packaging {{in conjunction with}} feed mixing and discharge operations. The main components of the machine included a double-wall cylindrical mixing chamber consisting of recycling gate, discharge gate, evacuating gate, window and a screw conveyor inside an inner cylinder. The packaging mechanism {{is attached to the}} discharge gate and the base of the frame with the frame serving as the structural support for the machine and its contents. The main design parameters included screw conveyor features such as helix angle, fill ratio, normal pressure due to bulk load on screw shaft, axial force per pitch, total screw torque, capacity and power requirements of the screw conveyor. The design concept of the packaging mechanism involved determination of free length of spring, total active length, pitch of spring, spring index, stiffness of spring, maximum shear stress and total spring rate. In a hitch-free operation, the machine was designed to package 25 kg of mixed feed ingredients at a time. In operation, the feed ingredients are scooped and moved upward by the rotary movement of the screw conveyor and then sprayed back into the smaller cylinder without passing through the internal tube. A preliminary testing was carried out on the machine to determine the actual discharge rate and hence the performance of the packaging mechanism. Results revealed that an average discharge rate of 0. 356 kg/s was obtained. Powered by a 2 hp single phase electric motor, the machine has a mixing capacity of 4. 124 m 3 /h with a production cost of $ 470. Nomenclatur...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of the project was}} the {{development}} of a plug flow reactor for the reduction of heavy metals (Cu 2 +) from industrial waste streams. Potential application of the reduction process inside The Netherlands lies in the IC and galvanic industry, where small waste streams containing aqueous copper exist. Outside The Netherlands, the process could be applicable in the mining industry,e. g. in Chili or South Africa. The copper is reduced in the form of particles by soluble carbohydrates, which provide the electrons for the precipitation. The carbohydrates may originate from another waste stream, which {{can be found in the}} food or wood industry. After hydrolysis, these carbohydrates can be applied as reductor. Furthermore, the carbohydrates are degraded, which lowers their carbon oxygen demand and cleans the waste streams biologically. This way, the two waste streams are cleaned simultaneously and a valuable end product in the form of copper particles is recovered. The main focus of this thesis is on the application of the Kenics static mixer in a pipe reactor, in order to achieve plug ow conditions in such a reactor. The static mixer is used to control the residence time of the particles, and to mix the chemical species in the reactor. The key question is under which conditions the application of the static mixer leads to a (more) narrow particle size distribution. A narrow size distribution of the particles is an important aspect, since it enhances the economical value of the end product. To answer this question, the Kenics static mixer is studied in detail both numerically and experimentally. The flow in the Kenics static mixer has been investigated both numerically and experimentally in the range of Re= 100 1000. It was found that at Re= 300 the ow becomes unsteady. Two numerical methods, the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method and the Finite Volume method (FLUENT) were compared and used to simulate the flow. The LB method proved to be a relatively fast and cheap (in terms of memory) alternative for the simulation of the transient flow in the Kenics static mixer at Re> 300. Furthermore, the flow field and dynamic behaviour were validated by means of LDA experiments. The transient behaviour observed was explained by studying the dynamics of the vortices in the flow. The transition to unsteady flow takes place, when the vortices start stretching out over an entire mixing element and start creating a disturbance in the flow entering the next mixing element, which subsequently triggers the unsteady behaviour. To investigate the behaviour of particles in the static mixer, a Particle Tracking (PT) code is developed and linked to and embedded into the LB code. The particle tracking code is based upon the equation of Maxey and Riley (1983) to which the modified lift force (Saffman (1965, 1968)) is added. Furthermore, a growth model for the particles is added to the PT code. The particle growth is based upon the diffusion of Cu 2 + to the surface of the particle. The Cu 2 + concentration is solved with a standard finite volume code, which solves the convection-diffusion equation with a sink term. The sink term is directly linked to the growth of the particles present in the finite volume cell. The chemical parameters due to Van der Weijden et al. (2002 a) are used as input for the growth model, where it is assumed that the diffusion of Cu 2 + is the rate limiting factor. The results indicate that two important design parameters for the Kenics static mixer reactor are the Reynolds number, which is a measure of the flow regime, and the St/Fr ratio, which is a measure of the settling rate of the particles. The two numbers determine to a large extent the mixing, settling and residence time of the particles. Ideally, the particles are uniformly distributed and have an uniform residence time distribution (plug flow). It was found that these conditions were best matched at a low St/Fr ratio (St/Fr 200). In a horizontal reactor, settling of the particles poses a problem that is directly related to the St/Fr ratio. It was found that in order to keep the majority of the particles in suspension the St/Fr ratio should be small and the Reynolds number high (St/Fr 500). Alternatively, the reactor can be placed vertical. If the flow direction is downward in such a reactor, no problems regarding the settling of particles occur, which removes the limit on the St/Fr ratio. However, there remains a limit regarding the mixing of the particles. When the St/Fr ratio is high (> 1), particles collide with the mixing element, which leads to accumulation of the particles near the mixing elements. It was investigated what the in uence of this ill-mixing of the particles was on the particle size distribution. For that purpose, simulations were carried out of growing copper particles in a <b>vertical</b> KenicsTM static <b>mixer</b> reactor. It was found that the particle size distribution is wide, when the particles are not mixed effectively. Therefore, a vertical reactor is also limited by the St/Fr ratio (St/Fr < 1), when a high quality end product is required, i. e. particles with a narrow size distribution. The results of the chemical (autoclave) investigations are combined with the numerical results, to propose a design for a continuous (plug flow) reactor. A one-dimensional model is used to predict the reduction of Cu 2 + in three reactor configurations (batch, horizontal plug flow reactor and vertical plug flow reactor). Experiments in a glass-lined autoclave were used to test the model and to obtain the model parameters. The model is used to predict the (mechanical) energy consumption per kg recovered copper. Furthermore, the total energy demand of the process (heating + pumping/stirring) was evaluated for different reactor types and compared to electro-winning being the conventional method of copper recovery. It was found that heating the liquid towards the set temperature is the main energy consumer. Based upon its energy demands, the applicability of the reactor is assessed for industrial waste treatment and the mining industry. It was found that the vertical plug flow reactor can be an attractive alternative for electrolysis, when the stream has a high Cu 2 + concentration or when the stream is contaminated with organic material. It should be noted that the vertical reactor was explicitly designed for the treatment of small waste streams that exist in the Netherlands. For processing the large streams that exist in the mining industry, the throughput of the vertical reactor is too low. This limitation can be overcome by placing different vertical reactors in parallel to accommodate a large throughput. However, the use of another type of static mixer might extend the feasibility of the vertical reactor towards a higher throughput. The design of such a 'large' vertical reactor can be an interesting topic for future investigations. Applied Science...|$|R

However, it is becoming clear that a single species can perform different roles in different habitats. Austrohelice crassa, a burrow-building mud crab shifts its primary bioturbational role {{to that of a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>mixer</b> in non-cohesive sediments as frequent burrow collapse greatly enhances sediment reworking. We conducted in situ crab density manipulations in two sediment environments (a non-cohesive sand and a cohesive muddy-sand) to examine if the contextspecific functional roles were linked to changes in solute fluxes across the sediment–water interface. Across both habitats, we show that A. crassa regulated nutrient cycling, creating strong density driven effects on solute exchanges. Increasing crab density increased sediment O₂ demand and the flux of NH₄⁺ from the sediment, indicating much of the response was physiologically driven. Clear interactions between A. crassa and microphytobenthos were also detected in both habitats. Despite lowering microphyte standing stock through deposit feeding, A. crassa increased benthic primary production per unit of chlorophyll a. Our experiment also revealed important context-specific differences, most notably for NH₄⁺ fluxes, which were higher where burrows and their associated microbial communities were most stable (muddy-sand).

40|$|Background and Aim: Avian {{influenza}} (AI) is a {{viral disease}} {{that caused the}} largest animal disease outbreak in the history of US agriculture. There are several disposal methods of AI infected poultry carcasses available in the US, which include on-site burial, landfill, incineration, rendering, and composting. Of these methods, composting is the most environmentally friendly and poses a low risk for biosecurity. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has developed a comprehensive plan for composting AI infected carcasses. The current protocols have the potential for areas of anaerobic pockets within the windrow due to inadequate mixing and the large carcass size of whole birds. This could lead to ineffective virus neutralization or prolonged composting times and higher resource costs. The purpose of this project was to determine if using a horizontal mixer (HM) wagon to mix composting ingredients or a <b>vertical</b> <b>mixer</b> (VM) wagon to mix and cut up the compositing ingredients is an economical and timely means to accelerate the tissue break-down and obtain optimal temperatures for poultry carcass composting during an AI outbreak. Materials and Methods: A replicated trial with three treatments, HM, conventional layering (CL) and VM, and three replications was initiated at the Compost Research and Education Center part of the University of Maine Forest and Agricultural Experimental Station called High Moor Farm. Daily temperatures and screened core sample weights (screen weights) on day 0, 16, and 30 were recorded for each of the compost piles. The time to build each replication was recorded and used to help calculate the cost of each method. Data on equipment, carbon material and labor costs were collected from private contractors from the 2014 to 2016 highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) outbreak and used to compare costs between methods. Results: All treatment methods reached USDA protocol temperatures to neutralize the HPAI virus. Screen weights for both the VM and HM treatments were lower than the CL treatment. Screen weights decreased significantly from day 0 to day 16 for the VM and HM treatments with no significant change from day 16 to day 30. When comparing costs, the mixer wagon methods were the more cost effective than the CL method when using high volume equipment. Conclusion: The data from this study support the use of a mixer wagon to reduce particle size and mix ingredients for more timely and effective composting of poultry carcasses...|$|E
