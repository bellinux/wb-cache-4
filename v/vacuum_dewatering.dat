40|$|Control of the {{solids content}} after <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> {{is vital for}} {{efficient}} control and energy use of the paper machine. Dewatering is a complex function of many parameters such as fibre and pulp properties as well as settings on the paper machine and a predictive model for dewatering will require extensive and detailed studies of the occurring physical phenomena. The hypothesis investigated {{in the present study}} is that fibre width and fibre length density measured for fibres suspended in water can be used for estimating the achievable dryness in <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering.</b> The hypothesis was tested by comparing model predictions to experimental data for 11 different pulps. The results show that the dryness after <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> can be estimated from the fibre length density and the fibre width for the fresh pulps using an elliptical fibre cross-section model with a ratio of 0. 48 between the short and long axes. For the dried pulps a lower value was needed to reach a good agreement...|$|E

The ceramic filter uses a sintered alumina disc to dewater slurry under low <b>vacuum.</b> The <b>dewatering</b> occurs by drawing water from the slurry by capillary action. This ensures that no air or particles are drawn into the filter medium to cause blockage. However, if too much wash water is applied then it can cascade down the cake and into the feed trough, where it merely dilutes the slurry.|$|R

However, there is little research on the calculation method of unsaturated seepage under the effect of vacuum pressure which is generated by the vacuum well. In view of this, the one-dimensional (1 D) steady seepage law of unsaturated soil in vacuum field has been analyzed based on Darcy’s law, basic equations, and finite difference method. First, the gravity drainage ability is analyzed. The analysis presents that much unsaturated water can not be drained off only by gravity effect because of surface tension. Second, the unsaturated vacuum seepage equations are built up in conditions of flux boundary and waterhead boundary. Finally, two examples are analyzed based on the relationship of matric suction and permeability coefficient after boundary conditions are determined. The results show that vacuum pressure will significantly enhance the drainage ability of unsaturated water by improving the hydraulic gradient of unsaturated water...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} faced by the oil sand industry is the dewatering of mature fine oil sands tailings (MFT) due to the low permeability. Vacuum pressure or electrokinetic (EK) dewatering is effective to meet this objective. This research {{was focused on the}} experimental study and analytical modelling to explore the influence of combined vacuum and EK treatment on MFT. In this study, systematical experiments on MFT recovered from the northern Alberta were carried out. At first, the characterization and EK cell tests were conducted to measure the basic properties and the coefficient of electroosmotic permeability (ke) of MFT. Secondly, dewatering experiments were carried out with three conditions, i. e. EK <b>dewatering,</b> <b>vacuum</b> pressure <b>dewatering</b> and surcharge preloading dewatering. In this phase of the research, experiments on dewatering by EK combined vacuum pressure treatment and EK combined surcharge preloading treatment were performed in an EK-vacuum cell designed and fabricated for this research. The results of dewatering treatment were assessed with the final water content, undrained shear strength and power consumption etc. Moreover，the theoretical analysis was carried out to examine the feasibility of one dimensional consolidation of MFT based on small strain theory under specific testing conditions. An analytical solution was derived, with variables including the surcharge pressure, vacuum pressure and voltage. The result of the experiments showed the positive effect of dewatering of MFT by EK combined vacuum pressure treatment. After the treatment, the undrained shear strength of MFT ` ii reached 5 kPa along with significant reduction in water content, which can be as low as 27. 7 %. The theoretical model based on the small strain theory simulates the consolidate rate well; yet it is not able to accurately predict the final settlements. A further study incorporating the large strain consolidation theory is needed...|$|R
40|$|Water removal {{in paper}} {{manufacturing}} is an energy-intensive process. The dewatering process generally {{consists of four}} stages of which the first three stages include mechanical water removal through gravity filtration, <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> and wet pressing. In the fourth stage, water is removed thermally, {{which is the most}} expensive stage in terms of energy use. In order to analyse water removal during a <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> process, a numerical model was created by using a Level-Set method. Various different 2 D structures of the paper model were created in MATLAB code with randomly positioned circular fibres with identical orientation. The model considers the influence of the forming fabric which supports the paper sheet during the dewatering process, by using volume forces to represent flow resistance in the momentum equation. The models were used to estimate the dry content of the porous structure for various dwell times. The relation between dry content and dwell time was compared to laboratory data for paper sheets with basis weights of 20 and 50  g/m 2 exposed to vacuum levels between 20  kPa and 60  kPa. The comparison showed reasonable results for dewatering and air flow rates. The random positioning of the fibres influences the dewatering rate slightly. In order to achieve more accurate comparisons, the random orientation of the fibres needs to be considered, as well as the deformation and displacement of the fibres during the dewatering process...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in population, industrial and construction boom especially in the urban as well as coastal regions of many countries have considerably intensified the inevitable need for infrastructure development on problematic soils including soft compressible clays, deposits with low bearing capacities, soils prone to erosion and collapse upon wetting, highly fractured and jointed rock mass among other geological deposits. Good quality geologic materials for construction are also becoming scarce, exacerbated by numerous environmental constraints in various countries. Due to these reasons and environmental restrictions on certain public works, ground improvement has now become an integrated and essential component of infrastructure development. Consequently, civil engineers are forced to utilize even the softest and weakest of natural deposits for foundations, and therefore, the application of ground improvement techniques including preloading and consolidation, static and dynamic compaction, grouting and chemical treatment, subsurface drainage and <b>dewatering,</b> <b>vacuum</b> consolidation, among other methods have now become common practice in heavy construction...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the current {{difficulties}} in processing fine coal {{and the potential for}} a significant increase in fines due to more demanding quality specifications, the U. S. Department of Energy's Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) has been involved in the reconstitution of the fine clean coal resulting from advanced fine coal cleaning technologies. FETC has invented and developed a new strategy that combines fine-coal dewatering and reconstitution into one step. The process reduces the moisture content of the clean coal, and alleviates handling problems related to dustiness, stickiness, flowability, and freezing. This process has been named the GranuFlow Process. Early work successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the process for laboratory-scale <b>vacuum</b> filtration <b>dewatering</b> using asphalt emulsion. Further tests focused on the application of the process to a screen-bowl centrifuge via batch mode tests at 300 lb/hr. These tests produced roughly the same results as the laboratory filtration tests did, and they included some testing using Orimulsion, a bitumen emulsion. The Orimulsion seemed to offer greater potential for moisture reduction and was less affected by colder slurry temperatures. Most recently, FETC has conducted several series of tests in its Coal Preparation Process Research Facility. These tests dramatically showed the visible difference in the dewatered product by applying the GranuFlow Process, turning it from a clumpy, wet, sticky material into a granular, dry free-flowing product. In addition, it verified previous results with improvements in moisture content, dustiness, stickiness, and freezing. Orimulsion showed a significant benefit over asphalt emulsion in moisture reduction at additions more than 5 %. The overall goal of this project was to successfully apply FETC'S GranuFlow Process to improve coal slurry pipeline operations. Williams Technologies, Inc. (WTI), a leader in pipeline technology, has an interest in reducing the moisture content of the coal {{at the end of a}} coal slurry pipeline beyond what is being achieved with conventional mechanical dewatering technology. In addition, they would like to improve the handling characteristics of the dewatered coal. The GranuFlow Process has the potential of assisting in both of these areas, and its degree of applicability needed to be explored. A formal Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between FETC and WTI was signed in November 1996. This CRADA consisted of 6 tasks progressing from preliminary scoping tests to a commercial field test. Task 1 was completed in February 1997, and it provided sufficient information about the applicability of the GranuFlow Process to coal slurry pipelines that further testing was not needed at the present time. Thus the CRADA was terminated...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} an overview of the paper machine with focus on the forming section. The forming section is the first part in the paper machine where the paper pulp is injected through a head box. The paper pulp contains about 99. 5 % of water and 0. 5 % fiber. The water as content is reduced by vacuum and gravity. The problem to be studied in this project is related to external rewetting. This is water going back to the paper web from the forming fabric after the dewatering zone. The dewatering is based on vacuum slots under the forming fabric. The vacuum slots absorb water from the soaked paper pulp through the forming fabric. External rewetting causes problem, hence the paper will have a higher dry content when leaving the forming section. The paper should have as low dry content as possible in the end of the forming section. Three different forming fabrics from Albany International were chosen for the project. The structures of the forming fabrics were two different double layers and one plain weave. The performance of the fabrics was studied by 4 different methods. The methods used were 2 different wicking tests, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> trial and one foulard test. Also micro tomography was done to understand the structure of each design. The main test was a foulard test where the aim was to see in what way the rewetting got affected by different pores sizes.

40|$|The {{advanced}} fine-coal cleaning {{techniques such}} as column flotation, recovers a low-ash ultra-fine size clean-coal product. However, economical dewatering of the clean coal product to less than 20 percent moisture using conventional technology is difficult. This research program objective is to evaluate a novel coal surface modification technique developed at the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research in conjunction with conventional and advanced dewatering technique at a pilot scale. The study which is in progress is being conducted at the Powell Mountain Coal Company`s Mayflower preparation plant located in St. Charles, VA. During this quarter laboratory dewatering studies were conducted using a 4 -in diameter laboratory chemical centrifuge. The baseline data provided a filter cake with about 32 % moisture. Addition of 0. 3 kg/t of a cationic surfactant lowered the moisture to 29 %. Addition of anionic and non-ionic surfactant was not effective in reducing the filter cake moisture content. In the pilot scale studies, a comparison was conducted between the high pressure and <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> techniques. The base line data with high pressure and vacuum filtration provided filter cakes with 23. 6 % and 27. 8 % moisture, respectively. Addition of 20 g/t of cationic flocculent provided 21 % filter cake moisture using the high pressure filter. A 15 % moisture filter cake was obtained using 1. 5 kg/t of non-ionic surfactant.

40|$|Water removal on {{a tissue}} machine becomes {{progressively}} {{more difficult and}} expensive in each successive zone. Since {{a big part of}} the cost is allocated to the drying section, improved water removal in the wet end may lead to huge savings in the manufacturing process. This can be accomplished by selecting proper raw materials and optimizing the treatment of the fibres in the furnish. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to investigate the influence of three particular furnish properties on dewatering of low grammage papers in the forming and press section; fibre species, beating and additives. The focus was to evaluate how the solids content varies as these furnish properties are changed, but also how the quality of the end product is affected. Water removal during suction is affected by the choice of pulp which can be explained by structural differences in the networks caused by differences in the morphology of the fibres. The total area of straight pores between the fibres is much higher for softwood pulps compared to hardwood pulps which will facilitate transport of both water and air through the sheet. Beating has a negative effect on the solids content reached in <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> which can be coupled to internal and external fibrillation of the fibres. Water removal during pressing is affected by the choice of pulp controlled by the pore structure of the fibres and the ability to sorb water. More available water before pressing lead to that more water can be removed. Beating mainly delaminates macropores with small effects on micropores. Both water between the fibres and water in macropores is removed during wet pressing.    The dryness after wet pressing is increased by addition of a wet strength agent (PAE) to the stock, probably due to crosslinking in the fibre wall. PAE-resins decrease the volume of both micro- and macropores which will leave less water deposited in the fibre wall. Tensile strength is increased with a wet strength agent and further increased by addition of a flocculant and a micropolymer to the stock. A lower absorption capacity is achieved with addition of PAE-resins due to formation of covalent bonds in the fibre wall...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{asbestos}} fibres in construction products has been banned in European countries for about two decades due to its effect on human health. At present, many developing countries use asbestos cement board {{as one of the}} most important construction products for roofing, cladding and partition walls. The Hatschek process is the most commonly used method to produce asbestos Fibre Cement Board (FCB). There are two major problems for the asbestos FCB manufacturers in replacing their products with non-asbestos FCB. The first one is finding materials and fibres that are available and competitive in price compared to asbestos fibres, and the second is providing inexpensive machines and equipment to produce non-asbestos FCB. In this research, an effort has been made to solve these two major problems. After the initial laboratory investigations on several natural and synthetic fibres some of the fibres with potential use in FCB were chosen for the further investigations. A slurry <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> process was then designed and made for the laboratory use. The performance of material selections and mix designs selected from the laboratory studies were subsequently verified with factory Hatschek process in a factory site trial. Many specimens with natural and synthetic fibres incorporating silica fume and limestone powder were made and tested in the laboratory. Silica fume and limestone powder were used for enhancing flexural strength and suppression of alkalinity to reduce breakdown of the cellulose fibres. The results of mechanical, physical and II durability tests were analysed. The microstructure of the fibres and composites was also studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). At some stages, mix design optimization was carried out to gain the highest flexural strength. The most suitable mixes were chosen for the factory site trials. A number of full-scale non-asbestos trial boards were made successfully in an asbestos FCB factory and tested in accordance with the current national and international standards. The results indicated that the trial boards fulfilled the requirements of the relevant standards. Based on the outcome of this research, a combination of acrylic fibres and waste cardboard in a mix incorporating silica fume and limestone powder in addition to Portland cement can be used to replace asbestos fibres. Although broadly compatible with the asbestos cement production process, this formulation change will necessitate some changes to the existing production lines in asbestos cement factories to produce non-asbestos FCB...|$|E
40|$|With the {{advancement}} in fine coal cleaning technology, recovery of fine coal (minus 28 mesh) {{has become an}} attractive route for the U. S. coal industry. The clean coal recovered using the advanced flotation technology i. e. column flotation, contains on average 20 % solids and 80 % water, with an average particle size of 35 microns. Fine coal slurry is usually dewatered using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering</b> technique, providing a material with about 25 to 30 percent moisture. The process developed in this project will improve dewatering of fine (0. 6 mm) coal slurry to less than 20 percent moisture. Thus, thermal drying of dewatered wet coal will be eliminated. This will provide significant energy savings for the coal industry along with some environmental benefits. A 1 % increase in recovery of coal and producing a filter cake material of less than 20 % moisture will amount to energy savings of 1900 trillion Btu/yr/unit. In terms {{of the amount of}} coal it will be about 0. 8 % of the total coal being used in the USA for electric power generation. It is difficult to dewater the fine clean coal slurry to about 20 % moisture level using the conventional dewatering techniques. The finer the particle, the larger the surface area and thus, it retains large amounts of moisture on the surface. The coal industry has shown some reluctance in using the advanced coal recovery techniques, because of unavailability of an economical dewatering technique which can provide a product containing less than 20 % moisture. The U. S. DOE and Industry has identified the dewatering of coal fines as a high priority problem. The goal of the proposed program is to develop and evaluate a novel two stage dewatering process developed at the University of Kentucky, which involves utilization of two forces, namely, vacuum and pressure for dewatering of fine coal slurries. It has been observed that a fine coal filter cake formed under vacuum has a porous structure with water trapped in the capillaries. When this porous cake is subjected to pressure for a short time, the free water present is released from the filter cake. Laboratory studies have shown that depending on the coal type a filter cake containing about 15 % moisture could be obtained using the two-stage filtration technique. It was also noted that applying intermittent breaks in vacuum force during cake formation, which disturbed the cake structure, helped in removing moisture from the filter cakes. In this project a novel approach of cleaning coal using column flotation was also developed. With this approach the feed capacity of the column is increased significantly, and the column was also able to recover coarser size coal which usually gets lost in the process. The outcome of the research benefits the coal industry, utility industry, and indirectly the general public. The benefits can be counted in terms of clean energy, cleaner environment, and lower cost power...|$|E
40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the forming section of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the forming section allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum suction boxes? How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the forming section? Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum suction boxes were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the suction boxes. The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the suction boxes closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of <b>vacuum</b> <b>dewatering,</b> and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the forming section.   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the forming section, and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum suction boxes occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.
