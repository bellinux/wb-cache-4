5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> they {{play a central role}} in imagining. Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.|$|E

5|$|Director Reeves {{featured}} many {{scenes of}} intense onscreen torture and <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> were considered unusually sadistic at the time. Upon its theatrical release throughout {{the spring and}} summer of 1968, the movie's gruesome content was met with disgust by several film critics in the UK, despite having been extensively censored by the British Board of Film Censors. In the US, the film was shown virtually intact and was a box office success, but it was almost completely ignored by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to 2008, {{there was no}} organised dissent against Mugabe within ZANU-PF. The party elite decided to avoid the <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> had marred 2008's election {{so as not to}} undermine its credibility, particularly {{in the eyes of the}} SADC, thus allowing Zimbabwe's government to consolidate its rule without interference. Mugabe called upon supporters to avoid violence, and attended far fewer rallies than in past elections, in part because of his advanced age and in part to ensure that those rallies he did attend were larger. The ZANU-PF offered gifts, including food and clothing, to many members of the electorate to encourage them to vote for the party.|$|E

5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E

The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E

A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E
5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> occurs within them.

The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's negligence toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E

Dodge left a detachment at the fort for a time but after the June 20 attack the fort was never again a target during the Black Hawk War.

5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the constitutional name {{in order to}} join NATO.

The elections were marred by <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> was criticized by NATO members. Ethnic tensions have persisted in Macedonia, and NATO has called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance.

5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: {{to increase}} his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential canvass, Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> one man was left dead.|$|E
5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of <b>violence</b> <b>that</b> Chicago police had created, {{journalist}} Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, {{had served in}} 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
