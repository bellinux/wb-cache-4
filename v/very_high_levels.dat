5|$|A large 2010 {{survey of}} healthy and CCD-affected colonies also {{revealed}} {{elevated levels of}} pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations {{have led to the}} hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression.|$|E
5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels,</b> capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} to a Telugu Naidu Family, Karthik began playing cricket {{at the age of}} 10, after a two-year stint living in Kuwait, where his father Krishna Kumar worked. He studied in Fahaheel Al- Watanieh Indian Private School while in Kuwait. Karthik was taught by his father, a first-division cricketer from Chennai. Disappointed that his own career was {{hindered}} when he was forced by his family to put his education first, Karthik's father did not want his son to suffer the same way, and trained him hard from an early age. Karthik honed his reflexes at this young age by having his father throw hard leather balls at him at high speed.
