5000|$|Student {{involvement}} {{has been}} credited with marked increased attention to and participation in politics {{as well as a}} redistribution of power on campus, however this was not always the case. A slowly changing system, students were met with a number of setbacks. [...] "Some reforms... reduced student and professorial authority, giving it instead to administrators or even to the State". In the case of Colombian students, the example of Argentina was nontransferable. [...] "Unable to unify themselves, overly concerned with broad political issues, and the 'unholy alliance' of foreign imperialists and local oligarchs, Colombian students never won access to legitimate and effective means of influencing university policy." [...] The struggle for control of power within higher education has continued, however a number of reforms have attempted to address the problems. Examples of reforms in Colombia included following the North American Land Grant model, administrative reforms designed to target spending and asset waste, and employing more full-time professors. The university systems have been criticized for reflecting the culture in which they are set as opposed to strategically guiding culture through the pursuit of intellectual ideals and educational and <b>vocational</b> <b>advancement.</b> Having come through a period of reform trial and error, [...] "several Latin societies have already embarked on radical political paths and others exhibit willingness to explore novel alternatives." [...] Moving into the future, Latin America will continue to develop their higher education programs to increase academic and social success through increased availability to all people.|$|E

30|$|Fitzgerald et al. (1995) {{concluded}} that there is “dramatic evidence {{of the change in}} women’s life patterns, a change that has been called the most significant social phenomenon of the 20 th century” (p. 78). A classic example is the comprehensive study of 10 -year job histories of 498 women college graduates from the class of 1968 (Betz 1984). All but a few women worked outside the home, and 79 % combined both homemaking and working outside the home. 29 % showed no changes in occupation over the 10 -year period and were classified as “fixed careers.” Although women’s and men’s labor force participation rates are becoming more similar (European Commission 2001), women typically have more complex interactions with the labor market (Lee 1994; Super 1957). Since women carry the major responsibility for children, they more often work part-time and experience more interruptions in their career patterns due to motherhood. This, in return, may have a negative influence on <b>vocational</b> <b>advancement</b> (“upward mobility”) (Huang and Sverke 2007). Jacoby (1999) found that childless women and men have similar mobility patterns and SES-levels. Full-time working mothers also have similar SES levels and an upward trend over time. In contrast, part-time working mothers showed decreased occupational SES levels. Other findings are that the frequency and length of career interruptions were important factors related to current earnings and occupational levels (Stewart and Greenhalgh 1984). It can be assumed that activities such as homemaking roles, part-time work, and career breaks, may have unfavorable consequences for occupational career development. Women often change their employment status over the course of their life and have quite varying schedules for childbirth (Lee 1994). Regardless, however, how such variations may affect occupational career patterns is largely unknown.|$|E
