50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through a suction check valve into the pump chamber. When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through a discharge check valve into the cylinder. The suction <b>valve</b> <b>ball</b> is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the plunger. The discharge <b>valve</b> <b>ball</b> is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|Generic {{non-linear}} {{flow characteristics}} of the conventional ball valve limit the applications of flow modulation in fluid processes. This work presents the flow characteristics of fluid flowing through the conventional and modified ball valves for feasibility of a “linear” ball valve. Theoretical studies are discussed for determining explicit and implicit factors on the valve coefficient, which modulates the flow rate of fluid when the ball valve is operated in flow control processes. In experiment, the cross- sectional opening area at various opening degrees, the shape, {{and the location of}} the hole passage in <b>valve</b> <b>ball</b> are examined for complicated relations dependent to the flow rate of fluid. It can be concluded that those factors cause the modulation of flow rate when the ball is turned at different opening degree. In extended design of flow characteristics for linearity, they are to be taken into account...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 49 A {{case history}} is {{presented}} pertaining to piping vibrations {{in a medium}} consistency paper pulp pumping system at a large North American integrated pulp and paper mill that ultimately resulted in pipe rupture. The system was designed to transfer pulp at 12 percent oven-dry consistency (12 percent fiber- 88 percent water by mass) from a washer stage to a storage tower through nearly 700 ft of 20 in diameter pipe. Testing and analyses were performed on the system to diagnose the problem and develop a solution to reduce the piping vibrations and prevent further failures. Initial tests on the system indicated the piping had pressure pulsations of between 50 psi and 100 psi peak-to-peak which were exerting a shaking force of approximately 15, 000 lb to 30, 000 lb peak-to-peak at each seventeen 90 degree elbows in the piping system. The frequencies of the major pressure pulsations were at 1. 3 Hz and 3. 8 Hz, which corresponds to the one-quarter and three-quarter (closed-open piping system) standing pressure waves in the piping system. These forces produced by the pulsation caused the piping system to respond at the natural frequencies of the pipe and support structure at each section of the pipe system. Attempts to reduce the amplitudes at the standing wave frequencies with attenuators (valve or shear plates) {{at the end of}} the pipeline were not successful due to the natures of the pulp and flow pulsation problems. Some success was achieved by changing the standing wave (acoustic) frequency with the addition of gas to the pulp in order to change the bulk density, but this was deemed an impractical solution. The problem was diagnosed as an interaction between the control system and the piping system. The source of the pulsation energy was traced to the control valve location immediately downstream of the centrifugal pump. Strouhal vortex shedding frequencies were generated at the exit of the control <b>valve</b> <b>ball</b> which excited acoustic standing waves in this particular piping system and amplified the pressure pulsations. Evidence is presented that shows that the pulsation amplitude was dependent upon the <b>valve</b> <b>ball</b> position and motion; therefore, the valve was removed and an alternate method of system control with a different mechanism was used that eliminated the source of the harmful pulsations. The authors present application guidelines intended to assist the reader in evaluating pipe system designs for potential of standing wave excitation. The Strouhal vortex energy from the control valve is discussed. Also, the calculation of acoustic velocity is covered including the effects of temperature, entrained air, and pulp consistency...|$|E

50|$|During the {{suction stroke}} of the {{delivery}} piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction <b>ball</b> <b>valve.</b> At {{the same time}} the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves).
