5|$|Despite {{the decline}} in burials from an already low level, rising land values in the post war years meant that the LNC was a {{valuable}} and successful company.

The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for return tickets for same-day travel from London to Brookwood and back. By this time most <b>visitors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cemetery were travelling by road.
