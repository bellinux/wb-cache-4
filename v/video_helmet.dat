5000|$|Another early {{innovator}} of <b>video</b> <b>helmet</b> camera {{technology was}} Mark Schulze, who created {{a system for}} use while producing The Great Mountain Biking Video in 1987. [...] "Schulze stripped-down a red motorcycle helmet and jury-rigged a mounting for the first consumer color video chip camera. A cable ran from the camera to a padded backpack that contained a Panasonic VHS portable video recorder and a DC-lead-acid battery for power, which made the rig heavy, unwieldy, and hot.|$|E
2500|$|Pucci used {{a series}} of {{nautical}} themes for crew uniforms. For the hostesses, Pucci used [...] "space age" [...] themes, including plastic Space Helmets and Bolas (as dubbed by Pucci). These clear plastic bubbles, which resembled Captain <b>Video</b> <b>helmets</b> and which Braniff termed [...] "RainDome", were to be worn between the terminal and the plane to prevent hairstyles from being disturbed by outside elements. [...] "RainDomes" [...] were dropped after about a month because the helmets cracked easily, {{there was no place}} to store them on the aircraft, and jetways at many airports made them unnecessary. For the footwear, Beth Levine created plastic boots and designed two-tone calfskin boots and shoes. Later uniforms and accessories were composed of interchangeable parts, which could be removed and added as needed.|$|R
5000|$|Archives {{containing}} {{photos of}} helmet cameras have surfaced {{over the last}} decade. One shows Denver Broncos backup quarterback Jacky Lee wearing a helmet camera at football practice in 1965. Another early <b>helmet</b> <b>video</b> camera was a 1977 head-mounted camera designed to convert images into tactile sensations for the blind, ...|$|R
50|$|As a filmmaker, Hartman {{has written}} and {{directed}} Happy Hour (1993, Best Short Film Award Berlin Intl. Film Festival), made documentaries for MSNBC's Edgewise (1997, opening night selection of Rotterdam Intl. Film Festival), co-produced Kelly Reichardt's indie hit feature River Of Grass, and has co-directed music <b>videos</b> for <b>Helmet,</b> Christmas, and his own bands. As an actor, Hartman has been in Larry Fessenden's vampire film Habit, his brother Phil Hartman's Eerie and No Picnic, and as the protagonist Severin in Joel Schlemowitz's Venus In Furs. He is now also a consultant and filmmaker for the musician's resource Musician.com.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{technologies}} emerging from this decade {{that can be}} used to help the law enforcement community protect the public as well as public and private facilities against ever increasing threats to this country and its resources. These technologies include sensors, closed circuit television (CCTV), access control, contraband detection, communications, control and display, barriers, and various component and system modeling techniques. This paper will introduce some of the various technologies that have been examined for the Department of Energy that could be applied to various law enforcement applications. They include: (1) scannerless laser radar; (2) next generation security systems; (3) response force <b>video</b> information <b>helmet</b> system; (4) access delay technologies; (5) rapidly deployable intrusion detection systems; and (6) cost risk benefit analysis...|$|R
500|$|In {{their more}} visible Discovery years, Daft Punk {{appeared}} wearing robotic headgear and metallic gloves for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music <b>videos.</b> The <b>helmets</b> were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors Alex and Martin, the duo who also designed them. With engineering by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., {{they are capable}} of various LED effects. Wigs were originally attached to both helmets, but the duo removed them just before the outfits were publicly unveiled in 2001. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers in an advertisement during a special presentation of the music videos from the Discovery album during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Bangalter once stated, [...] "We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09am on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{opens in}} a 2010 firefight in a palm grove in the Diyala Province of Iraq. Three Marines {{discover}} an underground cavern {{and start to}} scream as their <b>helmet</b> <b>video</b> feed goes black. In The Bronx in 2013, veteran NYPD officer Ralph Sarchie (Eric Bana) stands over the corpse of an infant in a darkened alley. He and his partner Butler (Joel McHale) resume their nocturnal patrol for the 46th Precinct. A domestic disturbance call comes in over the radio. Sarchie probes the dispatcher {{for more information and}} finds out that the male at the address is a former Marine. He tells Butler that his [...] "radar" [...] is going off because maybe the former Marine still thinks he is fighting in the war.|$|R
50|$|After Sharp {{was given}} {{additional}} oxygen and {{attempts were made}} to revive him and get him walking again, he was reportedly videotaped mumbling his name, that he was from Asian Trekking, and that he just wanted to sleep. The <b>video</b> from the <b>helmet</b> camera of Sharp and the climbers attempting to help him has not been released, reportedly as requested by Sharp's family who wanted him to be remembered as an astute mountaineer and not as an incapacitated incoherent person {{at the end of his}} life. There is apparently no video of Sharp from the Discovery Channel videographer, Mark Whetu, who was with that Himex group videotaping Inglis' climb, as it was reported that the camera he was using became unusable due to the extremely low temperatures that day.|$|R
5000|$|... "Unsung" [...] was Helmet's {{first single}} to be released, {{and was also}} the lead single to their second album Meantime. The song helped Helmet attain {{breakthrough}} success and is their most commercially successful song to date. [...] "Unsung" [...] reached # 29 on the US Alternative Songs chart and #32 on the US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Unsung was also well received by music critics. Steve Huey from Allmusic reviewed the song positively by stating in his review [...] "Boasting a stuttering, grinding main riff and the wall-of-noise guitar work of Page Hamilton and Peter Mengede, 'Unsung' was the second <b>video</b> pulled from <b>Helmet's</b> second full-length album, Meantime, and quickly became the band's signature song and an MTV favorite during late 1992. All told, {{it was probably the}} single best moment for a band that often emphasized sound over songwriting. 'Unsung' was Helmet at their most focused, alternating between memorable verse and chorus melodies and concluding with a monolithic guitar workout featuring noisy, oddly harmonized chords repeatedly drilled into the listener's skull." ...|$|R
500|$|Machinima creators {{have used}} {{different}} methods to handle limited character expression. The most typical ways that amateur-style machinima gets around limitations of expression include {{taking advantage of}} speech bubbles seen above players' heads when speaking, relying on the visual matching between a character's voice and appearance, and finding methods available within the game itself. Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker include the ability to manipulate characters and objects in real-time, though the former relies on community addons {{to take advantage of}} certain engine features, and the latter renders scenes using non-real-time effects. In the Halo <b>video</b> game series, <b>helmets</b> completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use custom software. For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights. Similarly, Atussa Simon used a [...] "library of faces" [...] for characters in The Battle of Xerxes. In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for Unreal Tournament 2004 and Valve Corporation's Faceposer for Source games. Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film Berlin Assassins. It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film Not Just Another Love Story.|$|R
