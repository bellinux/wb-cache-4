40|$|In this work, {{a matrix}} model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> {{vibration}} <b>of</b> a piezoelectric motor is proposed. <b>The</b> stator <b>of</b> this motor {{is composed of}} a thin piezoelectric membrane and a steel <b>axle</b> fitted at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane. <b>The</b> rotor consists <b>of</b> a cylinder-shaped permanent magnet, pressed in contact with <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetic forces. A travelling wave is excited in the membrane by using four electrodes and four, properly delayed, driving signals.

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower spring seat) and <b>the</b> piston (<b>axle</b> box guide).

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{intended}} to give an increased understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress state in an axle, which is assembled in one of Atlas Copco’s mountain drilling rigs. The main problems investigated were how <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> is affected when the bearing is worn, when the pretension is varied, and how to dimension <b>the</b> <b>axle.</b> Answers to these questions were found by using hand calculations, practical testing and with Finite Element analyzes. <b>The</b> dimensioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> is currently based on the bending stress, but the author’s opinion is that <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> should be dimensioned considering the equivalent stress. Wear and pretension had large influence on the strain along <b>the</b> <b>axle,</b> but almost no influence on the shear stress and on the equivalent stress. Maximum equivalent stress occurs {{in the same place}} on <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> independently on wear and pretension, except for one case. This particular case is, however, not likely to occur.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} an {{estimation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residual fatigue lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axles.</b> <b>The</b> railway <b>axles</b> can include some cracks either from manufacturing process or from previous loading operation. Because of cyclic loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axles</b> {{there is a}} risk of fatigue failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axles</b> with unacceptable consequences. Based on this fact, for conservative establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residual fatigue lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axle</b> is necessary to consider an existing crack in <b>the</b> railway <b>axle</b> during design process. The fatigue lifetime estimation of railway axles is very sensitive to used crack propagation rate description (e. g. v-K curve). Typical bending of this curve (knee) can be found in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> threshold value in fatigue crack propagation rate dependence (typically v-K curve expressed in log-log coordinates). For accurate estimation of residual fatigue lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axle</b> is necessary to use approximation of v-K curve that takes into account existence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee close to <b>the</b> threshold value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stress intensity factor. The paper shows important differences between different crack propagation rate descriptions on the residual fatigue lifetime estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axles.</b> Results obtained can be used for safer design and operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway <b>axles...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bolt-on Portals (or drop boxes) are {{a housing}} {{with a set}} of gears which bolts onto <b>the</b> final flange <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> tube. This {{approach}} allows existing vehicles to be converted to portals without modifying <b>the</b> <b>axles</b> (Volvo C303 or Unimog 404).|$|R
5000|$|This {{may seem}} odd. After all, if <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> were {{shifting}} in a horizontal groove, the friction {{on one end}} that acts {{to speed up the}} rotation would be canceled by the friction at the other end, operating in the opposite direction. The difference is that a torque is being applied, so one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> is pushing against one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groove, while the other end is pushing against the other side. Likewise, it does not matter in which direction the torque is applied. If the torque is reversed, each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> will then be pressing against <b>the</b> opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groove, but <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> precession is also reversed. The only restriction is that <b>the</b> relative speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> and <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groove due to precession, , must exceed the relative speed due to <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinning mass, [...] The minimum torque required to meet this condition is , where I is <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> inertia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spinning mass, and ω is its angular velocity.|$|R

50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{features}} which distinguishes this axle {{from other}} high-performance or heavy-duty domestic solid axles is that unlike other axle designs, {{access to the}} differential gears is not through the rear center cover; rather, in the Ford 9 inch, the rear cover is welded to <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> housing, and access to internals is obtained by removing the center cover on the pinion (front) side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> through which <b>the</b> driveshaft yoke connects, with the differential assembly coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> as a unit attached to the cover.,, Although this requires disconnecting the driveshaft to access the internal gearset, it offers <b>the</b> advantage <b>of</b> being able to disassemble and reassemble the differential gears and adjust clearances conveniently on the benchtop, rather than with <b>the</b> restricted access <b>of</b> working within <b>the</b> <b>axle</b> housing under <b>the</b> car.|$|R
