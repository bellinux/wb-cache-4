5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include <b>verbosity,</b> abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
60|$|The mate cursed {{him in the}} darkness, and {{the next}} moment some missile struck the galley a sharp rap. There was more cursing, and a mocking laugh, and when all was quiet I stole outside and found a heavy knife {{imbedded}} over an inch in the solid wood. A few minutes later the mate came fumbling about in search of it, but I returned it privily to Leach next day. He grinned when I handed it over, yet it was a grin that contained more sincere thanks than a multitude of the <b>verbosities</b> of speech common {{to the members of}} my own class.|$|R
6000|$|Cut entirely out {{the words}} I have put in italics, and the {{sentence}} has a meaning (though {{not by any means}} an important one). But by its <b>verbosities</b> it is extended into pure nonsense; for [...] "facts" [...] are neither [...] "objective" [...] nor [...] "subjective"[125] religion; they are not religion at all. The belief of them, attended with certain feelings, is religion; and it must always be religion [...] "in us," [...] for in whom else should it be (unless in angels; which would not make it less [...] "subjective"). It is just as rational to call doctrines [...] "objective religion," [...] as to call entreaties [...] "objective compassion;" [...] and the only real fact of any notability deducible from the sentence is, that the writer desired earnestly to say something profound, and had nothing profound to say.|$|R
60|$|Curious joy she had of the lectures. It was {{a joy to}} {{hear the}} theory of education, there was such freedom and {{pleasure}} in ranging over the very stuff of knowledge, and seeing how it moved and lived and had its being. How happy Racine made her! She did not know why. But as the big lines of the drama unfolded themselves, so steady, so measured, she felt a thrill as {{of being in the}} realm of the reality. Of Latin, she was doing Livy and Horace. The curious, intimate, gossiping tone of the Latin class suited Horace. Yet she never cared for him, nor even Livy. There was an entire lack of sternness in the gossipy class-room. She tried hard to keep her old grasp of the Roman spirit. But gradually the Latin became mere gossip-stuff and artificiality to her, a question of manners and <b>verbosities.</b>|$|R
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided <b>verbosity,</b> restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|As an author, Soeman wrote stories which {{emphasized}} suspense and humour, {{drawing on}} Western detective and adventure fiction {{as well as}} classical Malay literature. His written Malay, with a vocabulary heavily influenced by his east Sumatran background, flowed readily and avoided excessive <b>verbosity.</b> Soeman's most popular work was his novel Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan (1932), whereas his short story collection Kawan Bergeloet (1941) has been considered his most interesting from a literary perspective. Though considered a minor author of the Poedjangga Baroe period, Soeman has been recognized with an eponymous library and his books have been taught at schools.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} {{communication}} patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and circumstantial speech, and marked <b>verbosity.</b> Although inflection and intonation {{may be less}} rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may {{convey a sense of}} incoherence; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|The Womb Artist’ and {{accompanying}} exegesis, are a creative, autoethnographical, and performative exposition of the pre-verbal and embodied trauma of Late Discovery Adoptees (LDAs), a little-researched {{subset of the}} closed record adoption system in Australia. Using the work of Brodzinsky (1987, 1990, 2005), Lifton (1977, 1992, 1994, 2002) and Verrier (1993, 1997, 2003) on adoption trauma, the recent research by Kenny, Higgins, Soloff 2 ̆ 6 Sweid, (2012) into Australian past adoption experiences, and the seminal work of Helen Riley (2008, 2012, 2013) and Catherine Lynch (2007) into LDAs, this thesis gives a visceral account, together with a critical examination, of the psychosocial consequences of Late Discovery across the life span (pre and post disclosure). This research, {{as an example of}} the interface between trauma and narrative (Caruth, 1995, 1996; Felman and Daub, 1992; Herman, 1992), evokes the embodiment of and provides translation for the LDA experience allowing an investigation of the pre-verbal/pre-disclosure body as an interactive and fluid body of knowledges (Bordo, 1997; Grosz, 1994, 1995). Based on the author’s own life, the novel depicts the protagonist’s relinquishment at birth, her manufactured ‘death’, and her subsequent adoption into the closed record system. Although her adoption status is not revealed until middle age, her pre-verbal body knowledges, incarcerated beneath consciousness in the cellular, muscle/marrow of traumatic memory (Howard 2 ̆ 6 Crandall, 2007; Lipton, 2005; Pert, 1987), communicate through unaddressed adoption psychopathologies such as PTSD (van der Kolk, 1988, 1994, 2002), agoraphobia, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and psychosomatic symptom (Brodzinsky, 2005; Verrier, 1993). The novel translates this body signage and becomes, as “shadow of the object” (Bollas, 1977, 1987), a performance and articulation of the relinquishment wound. The psychopathology, the clairvoyant pre-disclosure paintings, the post-coital glossolalia, the poetry, the journal entries, the long form prose of the novel, are the map to, and the evolution of, a reclaimed, reconstituted, and re-textualised self. This research uses the techniques and sensibilities of écriture féminine (Cixous, Irigaray, Kristeva) in a heavily poetic, metaphoric, choric, and amniotic style that mimics and translates the abyssal and traumatic pre-verbal experience of relinquishment into a reparative prose and provides compelling evidence of the organic, embodied, and ever present and insistent <b>verbosities</b> of the body (Braidotti, 2009; Grosz, 1994, 1995). The novel’s thinly veiled fiction, with its artistic and necessarily protective intent, highlights the schism and slip between fiction and reality as it relates to the relinquishment/adoption experience (Homans, 2006, 2007; Lifton 1977, 1992) and is discussed with reference to the fictionalised autobiographies of Jeanette Winterson (1985), Janet Frame (1957), and Sylvia Plath (1963). In archaeological exploration, creative execution, and theoretical framing, out of the silence of the LDA relinquishment/adoption experience, this thesis illuminates the trauma associated with adoption secrecy and reproductive practices, and makes a strong case in support of the theories of embodiment and the cultural and scholarly value of autoethnographical writing (Bochner, 2000; Grierson, 2009; Pelias, 2004, 2013) but also provides further information and impetus toward developing compassionate and considered approaches within the growing 21 st century reproductive psycho-socio-economic industries...|$|R
5|$|Harrison allowed Secretary of State-designate Daniel Webster to edit {{his inauguration}} speech, but he {{nevertheless}} spoke {{for an hour}} and 45 minutes, setting a record for <b>verbosity</b> that still stands. As the public was not excluded from the White House, there was no relief from the swarms of office seekers even after March 4, and relations with Clay broke down {{to such an extent that}} President Harrison banned him from the White House. Clay left town, never to see the President again. Harrison, despite the office seekers, liked to walk to the market each morning but on March 24 got caught in the rain and soon fell ill. The primitive treatment he received, possibly influenced by his own medical training a half-century old, did nothing to improve his condition, and he died in the early morning hours of April 4. Vice President Tyler had returned to his home in Virginia once the Senate adjourned, and Secretary of State Webster sent his son Fletcher to inform Tyler of Harrison's death.|$|E
25|$|According to Dirk Benedict, Robert Vaughn was {{actually}} {{added to the}} cast in season 5 because of his friendship with the notoriously prickly George Peppard. It was hoped that Vaughn would help ease worsening tensions between Peppard and Mr. T.

25|$|The most {{important}} work of Samuel, however, was in Bible exegesis. As early a writer as Abū al-Walīd (Kitāb al-Luma‘, p.15) {{called him a}} leading advocate of simple, temperate explanation ("peshaṭ"), and Abraham ibn Ezra, although finding fault with his <b>verbosity,</b> placed him in the front rank of Bible commentators of the geonic period (see Bacher, Abraham ibn Ezra's Einleitung zu Seinem Pentateuch-Commentar, etc., p.18). In modern times his significance as a Bible exegete has been given proper appreciation through Harkavy's studies of the manuscripts in the St. Petersburg Library (see Berliner's Magazin, v. 14 et seq., 57 et seq.; Harkavy, l.c. i., iii.; Steinschneider, Hebr. Bibl. xx. 132 et seq.).|$|E
25|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{is defined in}} the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) as a pervasive developmental disorder that is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Impairments must be significant, and must affect important areas of function, and the diagnosis is excluded if criteria are also met for autism. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided <b>verbosity,</b> restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|XML and its {{extensions}} have regularly {{been criticized}} for <b>verbosity</b> and complexity. Mapping the basic tree model of XML to type systems of programming languages or databases can be difficult, especially when XML is used for exchanging highly structured data between applications, which was not its primary design goal. However, XML data binding systems allow applications to access XML data directly from objects representing a data structure of the data in the programming language used, which ensures type safety, rather than using the DOM or SAX to retrieve data from a direct representation of the XML itself. This is accomplished by automatically creating a mapping between elements of the XML schema XSD of the document and members of a class to be represented in memory. Other criticisms attempt to refute the claim that XML is a self-describing language (though the XML specification itself makes no such claim). JSON, YAML, and S-Expressions are frequently proposed as simpler alternatives (see Comparison of data serialization formats); that focus on representing highly structured data rather than documents, which may contain both highly structured and relatively unstructured content. However, W3C standardized XML schema specifications offer {{a broader range of}} structured XSD data types compared to simpler serialization formats and offer modularity and reuse through XML namespace.|$|E
500|$|Soeman's diction in {{his short}} stories was {{strongly}} influenced by his east Sumatran background, with extensive Malay vocabulary and less Javanese influence than many contemporary writers. However, as with his fellow writers of the Poedjangga Baroe generation, he avoided frequently using classical Malay terms such as alkisah ('it is told') and maka ('thus'). He was critical of the extensive <b>verbosity</b> of earlier literature, instead attempting to use a more succinct and direct style and avoid embellishments. In a 1936 article, Alisjahbana wrote that, in Soeman's hands, [...] "the stiff and frozen, heavily formalised, Malay language becomes fluid again".|$|E
500|$|Many ancient authors mention stichometry. Galen {{complains}} about the <b>verbosity</b> {{of a rival}} and says he can offer a description in fewer lines. In the 1st century BCE, a philosopher criticized Zeno of Citium and cited particular passages by giving their line number to the nearest hundredth line. Diogenes Laertius probably draws on the Pinakes, the published catalogue of the Library of Alexandria, when he reports {{the total number of}} lines in the oeuvres of various authors. He says, for example, that Speusippus wrote 43,475, Aristotle wrote 445,270, and Theophrastus wrote 232,808 lines. The Cheltenham Canon lists line totals for books in the Christian Bible and concludes with an anonymous note apparently written by a book dealer in the 4th century CE when the practice of stichometry was perhaps becoming less familiar: ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have often}} speculated that Hamlets Polonius {{might have been}} {{inspired}} by William Cecil (Lord Burghley)—Lord High Treasurer and chief counsellor to Queen ElizabethI. E. K. Chambers suggested Polonius's advice to Laertes may have echoed Burghley's to his son Robert Cecil. John Dover Wilson thought it almost certain that the figure of Polonius caricatured Burghley. A. L. Rowse speculated that Polonius's tedious <b>verbosity</b> might have resembled Burghley's. Lilian Winstanley thought the name Corambis (in the First Quarto) did suggest Cecil and Burghley. Harold Jenkins considers the idea that Polonius might be a caricature of Burghley is a conjecture, and may be based on the similar role they each played at court, and also on the fact that Burghley addressed his Ten Precepts to his son, as in the play Polonius offers [...] "precepts" [...] to Laertes, his son. Jenkins suggests that any personal satire may be found in the name [...] "Polonius", which might point to a Polish or Polonian connection. G. R. Hibbard hypothesised that differences in names (Corambis/Polonius:Montano/Raynoldo) between the First Quarto and other editions might reflect a desire not to offend scholars at Oxford University.|$|E
500|$|Rogers is a {{video games}} {{journalist}} {{known for his}} <b>verbosity.</b> Danny Cowan of IndieGames.com described him as [...] "infamous" [...] in New Games Journalism, a style of subjective video game journalism in which authors emphasize their personal experiences {{in relation to the}} game world. The Guardian cited Rogers as one of the [...] "unmissable examples of New Games Journalism" [...] in 2005 for his Insert Credit piece on Metal Gear Solid 2, [...] "Dreaming in an empty room: a defense of Metal Gear Solid 2".

In 2006, Simon Carless of GameSetWatch remarked that online communities were fascinated with Rogers as an originator of New Games Journalism, which Carless found at odds with their mistreatment of him, citing a Something Awful mock review of Sonic Riders. The next year, the same author cited Rogers' 80,000-word article, [...] "the insertcredit.com fukubukuro 2006: GAME OF THE YEAR EDITION", in calling Rogers [...] "the Lester Bangs of video games" [...] for being the only person [...] "disruptive and iconoclastic enough" [...] for the title.

500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, <b>verbosity,</b> prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a way to ensure that the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E

2500|$|Differentiating between AS {{and other}} ASDs {{relies on the}} {{judgment}} of experienced clinicians. There is much overlap between AS and NLD: both have symptoms of precocious reading, <b>verbosity,</b> and clumsiness, but they differ in that children with AS have restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, and less-typical social interactions. Tourette syndrome (TS) should also be considered in differential diagnosis: [...] "It is in nonretarded, rigid individuals on the autistic spectrum, especially those with so-called Asperger syndrome, that differences with less severely affected individuals with TS and obsessive compulsive disorder may become blurred, or that both disorders may coexist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film script {{seems to}} aim at making this an epic film, a [...] "genre" [...] which {{typically}} requires a big budget provided by a major film studio. That Ed Wood filmed the story with minimal financial resources underlines one of the qualities of his work: His ideas tended to be too expensive to actually put on film, and yet the director attempted them anyway. As Rob Craig argues, Wood's failed attempts result in the peculiar charm of the film to audiences. Craig finds that the film has {{much in common with}} both epic theatre ("grand melodrama on a minuscule budget") and the Theatre of the Absurd (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense and <b>verbosity</b> in dialogue, dream-like and fantasy imagery, hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where continuity is consistently undermined).|$|E
2500|$|... "A terrible cry" [...] heralds the {{entrance}} of Lucky, a silent, baggage-burdened slave with a rope tied around his neck, and Pozzo, his arrogant and imperious master, who holds the other end and stops now to rest. Pozzo barks abusive orders at Lucky, which are always quietly followed, while acting civilly though tersely towards the other two. Pozzo enjoys a selfish snack of chicken and wine, before casting the bones to the ground, which Estragon gleefully claims. Having been in a dumbfounded state of silence ever since the arrival of Pozzo and Lucky, Vladimir finally finds his voice to shout criticisms at Pozzo for his mistreatment of Lucky. Pozzo ignores this and explains his intention to sell Lucky, who begins to cry. Estragon takes pity and tries to wipe away Lucky's tears, but, as he approaches, Lucky violently kicks him in the shin. Pozzo then rambles nostalgically but vaguely {{about his relationship with}} Lucky over the years, before offering Vladimir and Estragon some compensation for their company. Estragon begins to beg for money when Pozzo instead suggests that Lucky can [...] "dance" [...] and [...] "think" [...] for their entertainment. Lucky's dance, [...] "the Net", is clumsy and shuffling; Lucky's [...] "thinking" [...] is a long-winded and disjointed monologueit is the first and only time that Lucky speaks. The soliloquy begins as a relatively coherent and academic lecture on theology but quickly dissolves into mindless <b>verbosity,</b> escalating in both volume and speed, that agonises the others until Vladimir finally pulls off Lucky's hat, stopping him in mid-sentence. Pozzo then has Lucky pack up his bags, and they hastily leave.|$|E

Likewise, several fighting men, and a patriotic group of burglars sportively armed with life-preservers, proceeded (in barouches and very drunk) to the scene of action at their own expense; these children of nature having conceived a warm attachment to our honourable friend, and intending, in their artless manner, to testify it by knocking the voters in the opposite interest on the head.|$|E
