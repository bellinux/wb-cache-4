30|$|GaAs {{nanowires}} {{were grown}} on GaAs (111)B substrates by metal–organic <b>vapor</b> <b>phase</b> (MOVPE) <b>epitaxy</b> in an AIX 200 RF system with fully non-gaseous source configuration [19]. Monodisperse {{as well as}} polydisperse Au nanoparticles were deposited as growth seeds prior to growth. Monodisperse nanoparticles with a diameter of 150 nm were taken from a colloidal solution. Polydisperse metal seeds for VLS growth of the nanowires were formed by evaporation and subsequent annealing of a thin Au layer of nominally 2.5 nm thickness. The anneal step was carried out at 600 °C for 5 min under group-V overpressure and resulted in nanoparticles with diameters from 30 nm to some 100 nm. Nanowires were grown at a total pressure of 50 mbar, using Trimethylgallium (TMGa) and Tertiarybutylarsine (TBAs) as precursors with a constant V/III ratio of 2.5. The total gas flow of 3.4 l/min was provided by N 2 as carrier gas, while H 2 {{was used for the}} bubblers. After the growth start, initiated at 450 °C for 3 min, the final growth temperature was adjusted to 400 °C, to exclude almost completely additional VS growth on the nanowire side facets [20]. n-doping effect was investigated by an additional TESn (0.02 ≤ IV/III ≤ 0.16) or DitBuSi (IV/III ≤ 0.52) supply.|$|R

50|$|In 1986 Vandenberg {{turned her}} {{attention}} to the quality control of the crystal growth of InGaAsP multi-quantum well (MQW) layers, used as laser light sources and optical modulators designed to work in the 1.3 to 1.55 µm wavelength range. Advancing the design, performance and manufacturability of these devices had been the focus of all the leading optical component suppliers for decades. These devices are manufactured using organometallic <b>vapor</b> <b>phase</b> <b>epitaxy,</b> a complex process involving multiple sources subject to drift. Manufacture of early devices was based on unacceptably low (much less than 1%) end-to-end yields. Dramatic improvement was needed to produce the high performance components used to transport the massive amounts of data in today's Internet. In many cases mono-layer thickness control is required along with variations in bandgap less than 0.5%. This high level of quality control must be achieved using complex crystal growth machines which can fail in hundreds of ways. To insure that these multiple failure modes do not impact the final device, Vandenberg designed a one-room (later bench-top) non-destructive high-resolution X-ray diffractometer to provide immediate on-line feedback into the MQW growth process. She constructed robust algorithms linking X-ray features to layer thickness and strain information essential to crystal growth control and optoelectronic device performance. Her X-ray diffraction technique was successfully deployed in a manufacturing environment. All Internet lasers are now manufactured using her tool X-Ray Crystallography, and their operational lifetime exceeds 25 years.|$|E
