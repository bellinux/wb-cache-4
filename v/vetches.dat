Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk <b>vetches,</b> bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and <b>vetches</b> became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and <b>vetches</b> became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were once thought to have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E

40|$|Background: Vicia sativa (the common <b>vetch)</b> {{possesses}} a predominant zygomorphic flower and {{belongs to the}} subfamily Papilionoideae, which is related to Arabidopsis thaliana in the eurosid II clade of the core eudicots. Each <b>vetch</b> flower consists of 21 concentrically arranged organs: the outermost five sepals, then five petals and ten stamens, and a single carpel in the center. Methodology/Principal Findings: We explored the floral transcriptome to examine a genome-scale genetic model of the zygomorphic flower of <b>vetch.</b> mRNA was obtained from an equal mixture of six floral organs, leaves and roots. De novo assembly of the <b>vetch</b> transcriptome using Illumina paired-end technology produced 71, 553 unigenes with an average length of 511 bp. We then compared the expression changes in the 71, 553 unigenes in the eight independent organs through RNA-Seq Quantification analysis. We predominantly analyzed gene expression patterns specific to each floral organ and combinations of floral organs that corresponded to the traditional ABC model domains. Comparative analyses were performed in the floral transcriptomes of <b>vetch</b> and Arabidopsis, and genomes of <b>vetch</b> and Medicago truncatula. Conclusions/Significance: Our comparative analysis of <b>vetch</b> and Arabidopsis showed that the <b>vetch</b> flowers conform to a strict ABC model.
