5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscle</b> power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscle,</b> and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Tremor in {{peripheral}} neuropathy may {{occur when the}} nerves that supply the body’s muscles are traumatized by injury, disease, abnormality in the central nervous system, or {{as the result of}} systemic illnesses. Peripheral neuropathy can affect the whole body or certain areas, such as the hands, and may be progressive. Resulting sensory loss may be seen as a tremor or ataxia (inability to coordinate <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscle</b> movement) of the affected limbs and problems with gait and balance. Clinical characteristics may be similar to those seen in patients with essential tremor.|$|E

25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate. Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>muscle</b> control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid paresis. Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} and {{factors contributing to}} normal continence are multiple and inter-related. The puborectalis sling, forming the anorectal angle (see diagram), is responsible for gross continence of solid stool. The IAS is an involuntary muscle, contributing about 55% of the resting anal pressure. Together with the hemorrhoidal vascular cushions, the IAS maintains continence of flatus and liquid during rest. The EAS is a <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscle,</b> doubling the pressure in the anal canal during contraction, which is possible for a short time. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is an involuntary IAS relaxation in response to rectal distension, allowing some rectal contents to descend into the anal canal where it is brought into contact with specialized sensory mucosa to detect consistency. The rectoanal excitatory reflex (RAER) is an initial, semi-voluntary contraction of the EAS and puborectalis which in turn prevents incontinence following the RAIR. Other factors include the specialized anti-peristaltic function of {{the last part of}} the sigmoid colon, which keeps the rectum empty most of the time, sensation in the lining of the rectum and the anal canal to detect when there is stool present, its consistency and quantity, and the presence of normal rectoanal reflexes and defecation cycle which completely evacuates stool from the rectum and anal canal. Problems affecting any of these {{mechanisms and}} factors may be involved in the cause.|$|E

60|$|We here {{encounter}} a great difficulty. How can the contraction of the unstriped and involuntary arrectores pili have been co-ordinated {{with that of}} various <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscles</b> for the same special purpose? If we could believe that the arrectores primordially had been <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscles,</b> and had since lost their stripes and become involuntary, the case would be comparatively simple. I am not, however, aware {{that there is any}} evidence in favour of this view; although the reversed transition would not have presented any great difficulty, as the <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscles</b> are in an unstriped condition in the embryos of the higher animals, and in the larvae of some crustaceans. Moreover in the deeper layers of the skin of adult birds, the muscular network is, according to Leydig,[20] in a transitional condition; the fibres exhibiting only indications of transverse striation.|$|R

2500|$|Physiological tremor {{occurs in}} every normal {{individual}} {{and has no}} clinical significance. It is rarely visible and may be heightened by strong emotion (such as anxiety or fear), physical exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, heavy metal poisoning, stimulants, alcohol withdrawal or fever. It {{can be seen in}} all <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscle</b> groups and can be detected by extending the arms and placing a piece of paper on top of the hands. Enhanced physiological tremor is a strengthening of physiological tremor to more visible levels.

It is usually reversible once the cause is corrected. [...] This tremor classically has a frequency of about 10Hz ...|$|E
2500|$|SPS {{was first}} {{described}} by Moersch and Woltman in 1956. Their {{description of the}} disease was based on 14 cases that they had observed over 32 years. Using electromyography, they noted that motor-unit firing suggested that <b>voluntary</b> <b>muscle</b> contractions were occurring in their patients. Previously, cases of SPS had been dismissed as psychogenic problems. Moersch and Woltman initially called the condition [...] "stiff-man syndrome", but the first female patient was confirmed in 1958 and a young boy was confirmed to have it in 1960. Clinical diagnostic criteria were developed by Gordon et al. in 1967. They observed [...] "persistent tonic contraction reflected in constant firing, even at rest" [...] after providing patients with muscle relaxants and examining them with electromyography. In 1989, criteria for an SPS diagnosis were adopted that included episodic axial stiffness, progression of stiffness, lordosis, and triggered spasms. The name of the disease was shifted from [...] "stiff-man syndrome" [...] to the gender-neutral [...] "stiff-person syndrome" [...] in 1991.|$|E
6000|$|Section 99. Unstriated {{muscle is}} {{sometimes}} called involuntary, and striated, voluntary muscle; but there is really not the connexion with the will that these terms suggest. We have just mentioned that the heart-muscle is striated, but who can alter the beating of the heart by force of will? And the striated muscles of the limbs perform, endless involuntary acts. It would seem that unstriated muscle contracts slowly, and we find it especially among the viscera; in the intestine for instance, where it controls that [...] "peristaltic" [...] movement which pushes the food forward. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>muscle,</b> on the other hand, has a sharp contraction. The muscle of the slow-moving snails, slugs, and mussels is unstriated; all the muscle of the active insects and crustacea (crabs, lobsters, and crayfish) is striated. Still if the student bears {{the exception of the}} heart in mind, and considers muscles as [...] "voluntary" [...] that his will can reach, the terms voluntary and involuntary will serve to give him an idea of the distribution of these two types of muscle in his own body, and in that of the rabbit.|$|E
