[...] Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes {{to the extent that the}} subject cannot keep their eyes open, and a burning irritation of the nose, mouth and throat mucous membranes causing profuse coughing, mucous nasal discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. [...] CS gas is an aerosol of a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal. It was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in 1928, and the chemical's name is derived from the first letters of the scientists' surnames.|$|E

30|$|Aim: Radiopharmaceutical {{preparations}} for human purpose may contain residual solvents. Headspace Gas Chromatography (HS-GC) remains the standard method {{for the analysis}} of <b>volatile</b> <b>solvents,</b> according to the European Pharmacopeia. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylacetamide (DMA) are less <b>volatile</b> <b>solvents</b> that are widely used in carbon- 11 and fluorine- 18 labeling. However, in that case, HS-GC quantification takes too much time for the release of short half-lives radiopharmaceuticals. Therefore, we developed a fast and robust Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) method for the simultaneous quantification of those 3 solvents.|$|R

[...] Induced gene expression is tightly regulated and time-dependent. Immediately after insect attack, toxic monoterpenes are released. These provide a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> for the diterpene resins so that successive evaporation leaves a barrier that seals the wound site.|$|E

In this process the particulate core material, which is solid, is dispersed into the supporting air stream and these suspended particles are coated with polymers in a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> leaving {{a very thin}} layer of polymer on them. This process is repeated several hundred times until the required parameters such as coating thickness, etc., are achieved. The air stream which supports the particles also helps to dry them, {{and the rate of}} drying is directly proportional to the temperature of the air stream which can be modified to further affect the properties of the coating.|$|E
50|$|At high concentrations, {{the above}} formula is less precise due to nonideality of the solution.

In such cases, the mixture can sometimes have a boiling point that is lower than either of the pure components; a mixture with a minimum boiling point is a type of azeotrope.|$|E

[Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]The effect of occlusion on the in vitro percutaneous absorption of linoleic acid was investigated.

Such changes were not observed as consistently when ethanol was replaced with a less <b>volatile</b> organic <b>solvent</b> (cyclomethicone). These observations were attributed to the increase in the concentration gradient due to the unimpeded evaporation of <b>volatile</b> <b>solvents,</b> which provided a greater driving force and enhanced non-occluded delivery in these systems, compared with occluded systems. Conversely, the percutaneous absorption of a polar material (glycerol) from an aqueous solution did not yield any such differences.

50|$|The {{isolation}} of trimyristin from powdered nutmeg {{is a common}} introductory-level college organic chemistry experiment. It is an uncommonly simple natural product extraction because nutmeg oil generally consists of over eighty percent trimyristin. Trimyristin makes up between 20-25% of the overall mass of dried, ground nutmeg. Separation is generally carried out by steam distillation and purification uses extraction from ether followed by distillation or rotary evaporation to remove the <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent.</b> The extraction of trimyristin can also be done with diethyl ether at room temperature, due to its high solubility in the ether. The experiment is frequently included in curricula, both for its relative ease and to provide instruction in these techniques.|$|E

The combination of high <b>volatile</b> <b>solvents</b> with the less <b>volatile</b> host <b>solvent</b> indane allows for an increased fabrication speed due to a reduction of the overall drying time and provides films with good light absorption behavior and high polymer crystallinity. For the solvent mixture tolueneindane, solar cell performance is comparable to the o-dichlorobenzene reference device indicating this mixture as a suitable replacement for increased productivity without drawbacks in nanomorphology as investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD).

50|$|The {{continuous}} or floating-catalyst {{process was}} patented earlier by Koyama and Endo {{and was later}} modified by Hatano and coworkers. This process typically yields VGCF with sub-micrometre diameters and lengths of a few to 100 µm, which accords with the definition of carbon nanofibers. They utilized organometallic compounds dissolved in a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> like benzene that would yield a mixture of ultrafine catalyst particles (5-25 nm in diameter) in hydrocarbon gas as the temperature rose to 1100 °C. In the furnace, the fiber growth initiates {{on the surface of}} the catalyst particles and continues until catalyst poisoning occurs by impurities in the system. In the fiber growth mechanism described by Baker and coworkers, only the part of catalyst particle exposed to the gas mixture contributes to the fiber growth and the growth stops as soon as the exposed part is covered, i.e. the catalyst is poisoned. The catalyst particle remains buried in the growth tip of the fiber at a final concentration of about a few parts per million. At this stage, fiber thickening takes place.|$|E
50|$|The main {{problems}} associated with painted bilayers are residual solvent and limited lifetime. Some researchers believe that pockets of solvent trapped between the two bilayer leaflets can disrupt normal protein function. To overcome this limitation, Montal and Mueller developed a modified deposition technique that eliminates {{the use of a}} heavy non-volatile solvent. In this method, the aperture starts out above the water surface, completely separating the two fluid chambers. On the surface of each chamber, a monolayer is formed by applying lipids in a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> such as chloroform and waiting for the solvent to evaporate. The aperture is then lowered through the air-water interface and the two monolayers from the separate chambers are folded down against each other, forming a bilayer across the aperture. The stability issue has proven more difficult to solve. Typically, a black lipid membrane will survive for less than an hour, precluding long-term experiments. This lifetime can be extended by precisely structuring the supporting aperture, chemically crosslinking the lipids or gelling the surrounding solution to mechanically support the bilayer. Work is ongoing in this area and lifetimes of several hours will become feasible.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{important}} {{differences between the}} processing of small molecule organic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers. Small molecule semiconductors are quite often insoluble and typically require deposition via vacuum sublimation. While usually thin films of soluble conjugated polymers. Devices based on conductive polymers can be prepared by solution processing methods. Both solution processing and vacuum based methods produce amorphous and polycrystalline films with variable degree of disorder. [...] "Wet" [...] coating techniques require polymers to be dissolved in a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent,</b> filtered and deposited onto a substrate. Common examples of solvent-based coating techniques include drop casting, spin-coating, doctor-blading, inkjet printing and screen printing. Spin-coating is a widely used technique for small area thin film production. It {{may result in a}} high degree of material loss. The doctor-blade technique results in a minimal material loss and was primarily developed for large area thin film production. Vacuum based thermal deposition of small molecules requires evaporation of molecules from a hot source. The molecules are then transported through vacuum onto a substrate. The process of condensing these molecules on the substrate surface results in thin film formation. Wet coating techniques can in some cases be applied to small molecules depending on their solubility.|$|E
