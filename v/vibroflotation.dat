40|$|Loose {{granular}} sand deposits formed during the land reclamation process {{are vulnerable to}} liquefaction upon imparting seismic forces. These loose {{granular sand}} fills could encounter bearing failures or compress beyond tolerable limits under static and dynamic loads. In order to eliminate such failures, loose granular soils require densification to enhance their engineering properties. Deep compaction is the only means to improve these thick deposits of loose sandfill in many foreshore land reclamation projects. Muller Resonance Compaction (MRC) and <b>vibroflotation</b> are deep vibratory compaction techniques, which are suitable to densify thick layers of loose granular fills. This paper describes the applications of deep compaction vibratory techniques in a mega-land reclamation project in the Republic of Singapore where the efficacy of densification was verified by Cone Penetration Tests (CPT) undertaken in a Pilot Test Area. The top sand layer of about 1. 5 to 6. 0 meters is in the medium to dense state and dilates during shear. In the MRC technique, high vibrating energies are used, which results in the whole mass of soil being rearranged, but a weak point was found {{at the location of}} the probing point. In <b>vibroflotation,</b> the densified column of soil was found to form at and surrounding the probe point and the density of the granular soil reduced with distance from the probe point. The aging effect in <b>vibroflotation</b> was found to be significant. <b>vibroflotation</b> was found to have several advantages compared to the MRC technique. Due to the excess water in the pore spaces caused by the high pressure jetting in <b>vibroflotation,</b> the water pressure dissipation further enhances the densification due to the aging effect...|$|E
40|$|Loose {{granular}} soils placed {{during a}} land reclamation process require densification {{to enhance their}} engineering properties. In a mega-land reclamation project in the Republic of Singapore, techniques such as Müller resonance compaction (MRC), <b>vibroflotation,</b> and dynamic compaction were employed to densify the land reclamation sand fills. The efficacy of densification was subsequently verified by cone penetration tests (CPT). The MRC technique results in the sand mass being rearranged due to the application of high vibrating energies. The <b>vibroflotation</b> technique results in a densified column of soil forming at and surrounding the probe point. The dynamic compaction technique results in the centroid point being the most compacted point, provided the selected spacing is efficient. The aging effect in the <b>vibroflotation</b> technique {{was found to be}} significant, in contrast to the MRC and dynamic compaction techniques. The usage of these three deep compaction techniques was found to be effective for the densification of deep deposits of loose sand fills in this mega-land reclamation project...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{treatment}} by <b>vibroflotation</b> {{is a recent}} technique for improving soil with poor geo-mechanical properties. In addition, this treatment minimizes the risk of liquefaction and the instability of the caisson. This work allows us to establish a two-dimensional numerical simulation of a real <b>vibroflotation</b> test, based on our model and our hypothesis of modeling this mechanism in finite elements. On the other hand, the work consists in making a two-dimensional numerical study of {{the stability of the}} caisson carried out on the treated soil, in order to verify its influence on the stability of the structure. The calculation results will be compared with in-situ measurements to validate the numerical model...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of vibration of buildings and other structures induced by different sources of vibrations is well known. Some of these sources are vibrohammers used {{to press in}} sheet piling, pile drivers with hydraulic hammer to drive in reinforced concrete pre-cast piles and vibroflots suspended to mobile cranes which are used to strengthen subsoil by <b>vibroflotation</b> technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{densification}} {{phenomenon in}} dry or completely drained sands mainly occurs when these materials {{are subjected to}} dynamic loadings. This fact induces a reduction of voids volume and consequently the compaction of the soil. The Generalized Endochronic densification law, formulated in cylindrical coordinates, {{has been used in}} a finite element model for simulating <b>vibroflotation</b> soil improvement techniques. The effects of vibrations at a point inside the soil mass, like those applied in <b>vibroflotation</b> treatment, are reproduced with this code. Absorbing boundary conditions are established at those borders where spatial domain finishes, aiming to avoid spurious, artificial reflections of stress waves, which otherwise come into the domain, disturbing the computed results. A mean densification function is defined for each spatial domain, to evaluate the effect of this technique, and also employed to optimize the distance between vibration points. This is a new rational design approach, which represents a step forward development if it is compared with the usual empirical employed procedures...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} about {{identifying}} the liquefaction potential in Yamansaz Region (Antalya). The liquefaction potential is determined according to SPT-N {{values that are}} obtained from bore-hole data and laboratory experiment data. 45 boring wells were opened with each boring well depth of 15 m for the bore-hole data of the region. The study is conducted by using five liquefaction analyses which are: “Acceleration Threshold Criteria”, “Periodic Shear Stress Criteria”, “Liquefaction Index Criteria”, “Tokimatsu-Yoshimi Method” and “Seed-DeAlba Method”. Currently, {{these are the most}} used methods according to the literature. The liquefaction potential analysis is made in 16 boring wells in which SPT-N values are found to be low saturated sand, silty sand and clayey sand layers. According to the probability of an earthquake with magnitude of M= 5. 9, the region has a high potential of liquefaction that {{can be seen from the}} results obtained by using these five analysis techniques. In order to prevent the liquefaction in the region, methods such as stabilization with cement or lime, <b>vibroflotation</b> and etc. should be used before making any construction...|$|E
40|$|In India, {{ash content}} in coal is usually high and {{percentage}} utilization for construction is limited. As a result, about 90 to 95 {{percentage of the}} ash generated has to be deposited in ash pond. The present ash generation is about 75 million tonnes {{and it is likely}} to exceed I 00 million tonnes {{by the end of this}} century. During the last decade, several laboratory studies have been made on densification of deposited ash slurry by vibration, application of vacuum, electro osmosis, etc. In last few years, with assistance from Department of Science and Technology, field experiments have been carried out to densify the deposit by vtbro flotation technique and also by explosives. This paper describes brief literature review on the subject and- summary of compaction achieved in field by <b>vibroflotation</b> as well as explosives. Based on the study canied out so far, it appears that densification in ash pond is very effective for rehabilitation of the area for housing or other use.

40|$|Recently {{sand wall}} started {{to gain more}} {{attention}} as the sand is easy to compact by using <b>vibroflotation</b> technique. An advantage of sand wall is the availability of different additives that can be mixed with sand to increase the stiffness of the sand wall and hence to increase its performance. In this paper, the bearing capacity of circular foundation surrounded by sand wall stabilized with lime is evaluated through laboratory testing. The studied parameters include different sand-lime walls depth (H/D) ratio (wall depth to foundation diameter) ranged between (0. 0 - 3. 0). Effect of lime percentages on the bearing capacity of skirted foundation models is investigated too. From the results, significant change is occurred {{in the behavior of}} shallow foundations due to confinement of the soil. It has been found that (H/D) ratio of 2 gives substantial improvement in bearing capacity, and beyond (H/D) ratio of 2, there is no significant improvement in bearing capacity. The results show that the optimum lime content is 11 %, and the maximum increase in bearing capacity reaches approximately 52 % at (H/D) ratio of 2...|$|E
40|$|Densification of Hydraulic Sand Fill by Vibro Hammer and Quality Control by Cone Penetration Test Ground {{improvement}} {{techniques are}} widely adopted in Sri Lanka and {{are increasingly being}} used for a vast variety of projects with particular emphasis on infrastructure projects such as roads, ports and harbors. Ground improvement schemes work with the existing ground rather than bypassing it. They can be tailored to meet specific bearing capacity and/or settlement requirements and are generally much more cost-effective than other traditional methods such as piling. The process:  Reduces foundation settlement  Increases bearing capacity  Mitigates liquefaction potential  Provides slope stabilization  Prevents earthquake-induced lateral spreading Layer by layer compaction by means of roller or portable compactor is a widely used compaction method. However this method has limitations to undertake to a greater depths due to ground water problems that may be encountered. It is time consuming too. Under such circumstances the deep vibro compaction method is superior to the roller compaction methods. Vibro techniques consist of large depth vibrators, typically about 300 to 500 mm in diameters, which penetrate the ground to suitable depth. Vibrocompaction known also as <b>Vibroflotation</b> in some references and countries consist on the in-situ densification of loose granular soils, such as loose sand, gravel and hydraulic fills, using vibro compaction equipment but without the addition of granular material...|$|E
