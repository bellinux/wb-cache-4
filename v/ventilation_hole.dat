50|$|Roughwood has two owl holes {{built into}} farm {{outbuildings}} and {{the remains of}} a third. One is the standard design, but the other is triangular. These holes were constructed to permit access to barn owls which would also be provided with a nesting area within the building, the benefit to the farmer being that these birds would predate the rats and mice on the farm. Typically owl holes have an entry and a landing platform or perch in front.

Blind gun loops allowed a defender to fire a gun from within; however, the view through this design of gun loop was limited.

50|$|In 1926 the Adrian helmet was {{modified}} by being constructed of stronger steel and simplified {{by having the}} main part of the helmet stamped from one piece of metal, and therefore without the joining rim around the helmet that characterizes the M15. The large <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole</b> under the comb, which had been a weak point of the old design, was also replaced with a series of small holes. The M26 helmet continued in use with the French Army until after World War II, and was also used by the French police up to the 1970s. During the interwar period Belgium began to produce their own domestically made M26 Adrians and exported them around the globe. These helmets can be distinguished from their French counterparts, because they have a slightly different comb and a wider rim. In other countries the Adrian-type helmets were also in use with the fire-fighting units, railway guards or marine infantry (e.g. Japan's SNLF). Adrian helmets are still prized by collectors today.|$|E

Once oxygen purging began, drillers had begun the 30-inch Rescue Hole No. 1 at 6:45 p.m., Thursday, July 25, to intersect 1-Left section. It was located approximately 20 ft away from the 6.5 in <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole,</b> and was drilled to a 105 ft depth by 1:12 a.m., Friday, July 26, when the drill bit broke.

A special tool was needed to be fabricated in order to assist in retrieving the bit. Normally, such a job would be done in three or four days, but a 95-member machine shop in Big Run, Jefferson County, was able to build the tool in approximately three hours. A National Guard helicopter flew the tool in, and the bit was retrieved from Rescue Hole No. 1 at 4:09 p.m. on July 26.|$|E
50|$|On August 29, 1984, {{while on}} a {{reporting}} assignment for Reuters in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, Wright was detained and held hostage by the Palestinian splinter group led by Abu Nidal {{in a part of}} the Lebanon hostage crisis.

Wright spent about one week in a small room in a country house near the town of Barr Elias and was then moved to a large villa near the Chouf mountain town of Bhamdoun, above Beirut. In the early hours of September 16, 1984, Wright escaped from captivity by removing the plank of wood covering a <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole</b> and crawling through the hole, which was about 10 feet above floor level. He reached the hole by dismantling his metal bedstead and using the frame as a ladder. Once outside he walked along the Beirut-Damascus highway until he reached a checkpoint manned by the mainly Druze Muslim Progressive Socialist Party. The party militia held him incommunicado at Aley police station until September 19, when party leader Walid Jumblatt told his aides to drive him to the Reuters office in Beirut.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —A simple, {{inexpensive}} apparatus (embryo in-cubation unit [EIU]) {{was developed}} and {{used to assess the}} relationship between sediment cover (Kootenai River sedi-ments, 97 % by weight in the 0. 83 -mm- to 1. 0 -mm-diameter range) and survival of white sturgeon Acipenser trans-montanus embryos in the laboratory. An apparatus-testing trial assessed the effects of two sediment depths (5 and 20 mm), three EIU <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole</b> sizes (4. 8, 6. 8, and 9. 5 mm) providing three levels of intrasediment flow, and EIU location (upstream or downstream in laboratory troughs) on embryo survival at two above-substrate flow velocities (0. 05 and 0. 15 m/s).

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{methods have been}} used to estimate the flow patterns for vapor space inside the Saltstone Vault No. 4 under different operating scenarios. The purpose of this work is to examine the gas motions inside the vapor space under the current vault configurations. A CFD model took three-dimensional transient momentum-energy coupled approach for the vapor space domain of the vault. The modeling calculations were based on prototypic vault geometry and expected normal operating conditions as defined by Waste Solidification Engineering. The modeling analysis was focused on the air flow patterns near the ventilated corner zones of the vapor space inside the Saltstone vault. The turbulence behavior and natural convection mechanism used in the present model were benchmarked against the literature information and theoretical results. The verified model was applied to the Saltstone vault geometry for the transient assessment of the air flow patterns inside the vapor space of the vault region using the boundary conditions as provided by the customer. The present model considered two cases for the estimations of the flow patterns within the vapor space. One is the reference baseline case. The other is for the negative temperature gradient between the roof inner and top grout surface temperatures intended for the potential bounding condition. The flow patterns of the vapor space calculated by the CFD model demonstrate that the ambient air comes into the vapor space of the vault through the lower-end <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole,</b> and it gets heated up by the Benard-cell type circulation before leaving the vault via the higher-end <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole.</b> The calculated results are consistent with the literature information...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether the effectiveness of a passenger airbag can be increased by making the passenger airbag adaptive to crash conditions, such as severity and type of impact, belt use, and passenger size. Such an adaptive passenger airbag will better cover a wider range of crash situations than a conventional airbag system. In this study, mathematical modeling was performed for the optimization of an existing passenger airbag restraint system. The final solution can be used as reference for the design of an adaptive airbag system. The present study was divided into four steps: (1) a FEM airbag model was developed by using the MADYMO 3 D program based on an existing prototype of a passenger airbag; (2) the airbag model was validated against airbag static deployment tests, airbag drop tests, and sled tests; (3) the performance of passenger airbag systems of different volumes was evaluated in terms of injury criteria for front seat occupants of different sizes; (4) a parameter study with different impact conditions and varying levels of variables was carried out to find an optimized design of an adaptive passenger airbag restraint system. Three variables selected for passenger airbag optimization are the airbag volume, the bag pressure, and the size of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole.</b> Four input factors that varied in different crash conditions are the dummy size, belted/unbelted, impact speed, and rigid/deformable barrier. The HIC, chest acceleration, chest deflection, neck moment, and axial femur force were calculated in each simulation. The effectiveness of the passenger airbag models was evaluated in terms of the injury criteria of FMVSS 208 and other relevant injury parameters. The influence of the airbag variables on the dummy response was analyzed and discussed. The size of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>hole</b> was found to have the dominating influence on the performance of the airbag. The best effect of the passenger airbag system could be obtained either by using a small airbag with high initial pressure or by using a big airbag with low initial pressure. The findings in the present study indicate that a midsize volume (120 -liter) airbag with variable venthole can give front seat occupants of different sizes better protection over a range of crash severities than a conventional big (150 -liter) airbag with only one size of venthole. The results from this study can be used for the development of a future adaptive passenger airbag system...|$|E
