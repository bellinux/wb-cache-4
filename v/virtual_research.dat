While marketing research employs techniques like focus groups, surveys and observation to better understand consumer decision-making, <b>virtual</b> store <b>research</b> uses these standard research techniques within a simulated store setting, delivered via computer. <b>Virtual</b> store <b>research</b> utilizes 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional computer simulation technology to create retail contexts that are as close to the real shopping experience as possible. This allows test consumers within the virtual environment to interact with store merchandise and make purchase decisions in a way that closely resembles real in-store behavior.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{information}} systems research has studied {{various aspects of}} virtual teams. However, the foundations and theoretical development of <b>virtual</b> team <b>research</b> remain unclear. We propose that an important way to move forward is to accelerate the process of theorizing and theory appropriation. This article presents an in-depth analysis of {{the current state of}} the art of theory application and development in <b>virtual</b> team <b>research.</b> We identify the frequency, pattern of use, and ontological basis of 25 virtual team-relevant theories. A researcher’s tool kit is presented to promote future theory application and appropriation. The tool kit consists of a descriptive and analytical database of theories relevant for <b>virtual</b> team <b>research.</b> We also present a framework for appropriating virtual team theories based on seven criteria. A detailed example demonstrates the application of the theory appropriation framework. The article contributes to the literature by presenting the state of the art of theory use in <b>virtual</b> team <b>research</b> and by providing a framework for appropriating reference-discipline theories...|$|R

The primary benefit, by far, is quick case study results. A customary jury research session often takes weeks {{to organize and}} administer. But with <b>virtual</b> jury <b>research</b> which benefits from the availability online of literally millions of potential case study participants—research jurors can quickly be located and solicited to participate, which they can do so effortlessly via their home computers. As a result, online studies can be organized, conducted, concluded, and evaluated within a few hours. This quick turnaround can be invaluable for attorneys who must quickly strategize regarding sudden new cases that must quickly go to trial.|$|R
