40|$|Relativistic {{contributions}} to the dynamics of structure formation {{come in a variety}} of forms, and can potentially give corrections to the standard picture on typical scales of 100 Mpc. These corrections cannot be obtained by Newtonian numerical simulations, so it is important to accurately estimate the magnitude of these relativistic effects. Density fluctuations couple to produce a background of gravitational waves, which is larger than any primordial background. A similar interaction produces a much larger spectrum of <b>vector</b> <b>modes</b> which represent the frame-dragging rotation of spacetime. These can change the metric at the percent level in the concordance model at scales below the equality scale. <b>Vector</b> <b>modes</b> modify the lensing of background galaxies by large-scale structure. This gives in principle the exciting possibility of measuring relativistic frame dragging effects on cosmological scales. The effects of the non-linear tensor and <b>vector</b> <b>modes</b> on the cosmic convergence are computed and compared to first-order lensing contributions from density fluctuations, Doppler lensing, and smaller Sachs-Wolfe effects. The lensing from gravitational waves is negligible so we concentrate on the <b>vector</b> <b>modes.</b> We show the relative importance of this for future surveys such as Euclid and SKA. We find that these non-linear effects only marginally affect the overall weak lensing signal so they can safely be neglected in most analyses, though are still much larger than the linear Sachs-Wolfe terms. The second-order vector contribution can dominate the first-order Doppler lensing term at moderate redshifts and are actually more important for survey geometries like the SKA.

50|$|The APEXC is an {{incredibly}} simple machine.Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, {{for a total of}} 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.One oddity {{is that there is no}} program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each tape row had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 differentvalues).|$|E
40|$|A {{primordial}} <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> and {{its associated}} magnetic field generation are investigated.

40|$|The <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> of cosmological {{perturbation}} theory imprints characteristic signals on the weak lensing signals such as curl- and B-modes which are never imprinted by the scalar mode. However, the <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> is neglected {{in the standard}} first-order cosmological {{perturbation theory}} since it only has a decaying mode. This situation changes if the cosmological perturbation theory is expanded up to second order. The second-order vector and tensor modes are inevitably induced by {{the product of the}} first-order scalar modes. We study the effect of the second-order <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> on the weak lensing curl- and B-modes. We find that the curl-mode induced by the second-order <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> is comparable to that induced by the primordial gravitational waves with the tensor-to-scalar ratio r = 0. 1 at ℓ≈ 200. In this case, the curl-mode induced by the second-order <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> dominates at ℓ > 200. Furthermore, the B-mode cosmic shear induced by the second-order <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> dominates on almost all scales. However, we find that the observational signatures of the second-order vector and tensor modes cannot exceed the expected noise of ongoing and upcoming weak lensing measurements. We conclude that the curl- and B-modes induced by the second-order vector and tensor modes are unlikely to be detected in future experiments.

40|$|The B-mode {{polarization}} {{spectrum of}} the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) may be the smoking gun of not only the primordial tensor mode {{but also of the}} primordial <b>vector</b> <b>mode.</b> If there exist nonzero vector-mode metric perturbations in the early Universe, they are known to be supported by anisotropic stress fluctuations of free-streaming particles such as neutrinos, and to create characteristic signatures on both the CMB temperature, E-mode, and B-mode polarization anisotropies. We place constraints on the properties of the primordial <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> characterized by the vector-to-scalar ratio r_v and the spectral index n_v of the vector-shear power spectrum, from the Planck and BICEP 2 B-mode data. We find that, for scale-invariant initial spectra, the ΛCDM model including the <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> fits the data better than the model including the tensor mode. The difference in χ^ 2 between the vector and tensor models is Δχ^ 2 = 3. 294, because, on large scales the <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> generates smaller temperature fluctuations than the tensor mode, which is preferred for the data. In contrast, the tensor mode can fit the data set equally well if we allow a significantly blue-tilted spectrum. We find that the best-fitting tensor mode has a large blue tilt and leads to an indistinct reionization bump on larger angular scales. The slightly red-tilted <b>vector</b> <b>mode</b> supported by the current data set can also create O(10 ^- 22) -Gauss magnetic fields at cosmological recombination.

In this paper, it is proved that some of these anomalies could be explained in the framework of a modified concordance model, in which, there is an appropriate distribution of vector perturbations with very large spatial scales. <b>Vector</b> <b>modes</b> are associated with divergenceless (vortical) velocity fields. Here, the generation of these modes is not studied in detail (it can be done "a posteriori"); on the contrary, we directly look for the distributions of these <b>vector</b> <b>modes</b> which lead to both alignments of the second and third multipoles and a planar octopole. A general three-dimensional (3 D) superimposition of vector perturbations does not produce any alignment, but we have found rather general 2 D superimpositions leading to anomalies similar to the observed ones; in these 2 D cases, the angular velocity has the same direction at any point of an extended region and, moreover, this velocity has the same distribution in all the planes orthogonal to it. Differential rotations can be seen as particular cases, in which, the angular velocity only depends on the distance to a rotation axis.
