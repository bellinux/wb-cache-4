5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of <b>vector</b> <b>analysis</b> and quaternions. The result was the realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and <b>vector</b> <b>analysis</b> became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

Experimental results show that the proposed motion processing algorithm improves the visual quality of frames both spatially and temporally. 1...|$|R

500|$|The {{development}} of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. [...] The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook <b>Vector</b> <b>Analysis,</b> based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, {{did much to}} propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.|$|E
500|$|Gibbs's {{lecture notes}} on vector {{calculus}} were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 {{for the use}} of his students, and were later adapted by Edwin Bidwell Wilson into a textbook, <b>Vector</b> <b>Analysis,</b> published in 1901. [...] That book helped to popularize the [...] "del" [...] notation that is widely used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics. [...] In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the [...] "Gibbs phenomenon" [...] in the theory of Fourier series (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, Henry Wilbraham).|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, Josiah Willard Gibbs derived the same vector by <b>vector</b> <b>analysis.</b> [...] Gibbs' derivation was used as an example by Carle Runge in a popular German textbook on vectors, which was referenced by Wilhelm Lenz in his paper on the (old) quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom. [...] In 1926, the vector was used by Wolfgang Pauli to derive the spectrum of hydrogen using modern quantum mechanics, but not the Schrödinger equation; after Pauli's publication, it became known mainly as the Runge–Lenz vector.|$|E
40|$|The {{scattering}} parameters of embedded devices {{can be measured}} by means of contactless <b>vector</b> network <b>analysis.</b> To achieve accurate measurement results, the contactless measurement setup has to be calibrated. However, if the substrate material or the planar transmission lines on the substrate changes, a new calibration is necessary. In this paper a method will be examined, which reduces the number of calibration cycles by using a database. Analytical results show that by using this database method, errors occur which depend on the coupling coefficients and on the load impedances of the contactless probes. However, the measurement results show deviations smaller than 7 % {{in comparison to the}} conventional <b>vector</b> network <b>analysis,</b> which is sufficient for the most pratical applications...|$|R
30|$|Among the {{unsupervised}} change detection methods, change <b>vectors</b> <b>analysis</b> (CVA) {{techniques are}} widely used [3, 6, 13]. The technique firstly computes the difference image (DI), and the magnitudes of DI (MDI) are segmented into unchanged and changed classes. Like other unsupervised change detection methods, how to select a suitable threshold is an open problem for CVA techniques. Furthermore, even if a better threshold for a certain unsupervised change detection method is obtained, the region around the threshold is still difficult to judge the pixels’ class (change and unchange). This problem is partially due {{to the loss of}} information associated with the difference and magnitude operators, which do not allow to exploit all the information of the original feature space in the change detection process [4].|$|R
40|$|A radar wind {{analysis}} system (RWAS) {{has been}} developed for nowcast applications. By ingesting real-time wind observations from operational WSR- 88 D radars and surface mesonet, this system can produce and display real-time vector winds at each selected vertical level or on each conical surface of radar scans superimposed on radar reflectivity or radial-velocity images. An early version of the system has been evaluated and used to provide real-time winds to drive high-resolution emergency response dispersion models. This paper presents the detailed formulations of background error correlation functions used {{in each of the}} three steps of <b>vector</b> wind <b>analysis</b> performed in the RWAS and the method of solution used in each step of <b>vector</b> wind <b>analysis.</b> The performances of the RWAS are demonstrated by illustrative examples...|$|R
500|$|While he {{was working}} on <b>vector</b> <b>analysis</b> in the late 1870s, Gibbs {{discovered}} that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his [...] "multiple algebra". [...] Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. [...] To establish priority of Grassmann’s ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay [...] "Theorie der Ebbe und Flut" [...] on tides that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the University of Berlin, in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a vector space(linear space).|$|E

40|$|<b>Vector</b> field <b>analysis</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in many {{engineering}} applications, such as weather prediction, tsunami and hurricane study, and airplane and automotive design. Existing <b>vector</b> field <b>analysis</b> techniques focus on individual trajectories such as fixed points, periodic orbits and separatrices which are sensitive to noise and errors introduced by simulation and interpolation. This can make such <b>vector</b> field <b>analysis</b> unsuitable for rigorous interpretations. In this paper, we advocate the use of Morse decompositions, which are robust with respect to perturbations, to encode the topological structures of the vector field {{in the form of a}} directed graph, called a Morse decomposition connection graph (MCG). While an MCG exists for every vector field, it need not be unique. We develop the idea of a [tau] map, which decouples the MCG construction process and the configuration of the underlying mesh. This, in general, results in finer MCGs than mesh-dependent approaches. To compute MCGs effectively, we present an adaptive approach in constructing better approximations of the images of triangles in the meshes used for simulation. These techniques result in fast and efficient MCG construction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on various examples in planar fields and on surfaces including engine simulation data...|$|R
