25|$|Locals {{tell the}} story of the specters of three cursed virgins that live on the Schlößleinsbuck. Two of them are dressed {{completely}} in white, but the third one wears a black skirt. The three virgins appeared to a farm laborer, who tilled a field near the mountain. They begged him to follow them into the mountain to release them and that because he is of pure heart, he need not fear the evil forces of darkness. They told him that on the way into the mountain they would first meet six men who have beards to the floor and sit around a table. In the second room there would be sat a black dog with fervid eyes, holding a key in its mouth. The farm laborer should take this key, even if the dog is spitting fire. With this key would then be able to get into a chamber containing a great treasure, which would then belong to him. But the farm laborer became <b>very</b> <b>scared</b> and left the virgins unsaved. It is further told that the virgins still speak to brave men, who should follow them into the mountain in order to save them.|$|E
500|$|Doggett, Reyes, and Harrison {{camp out}} at the Conlon's house and soon stumble upon the monsters that Tommy sees: large, insect-like creatures that {{multiply}} when shot by bullets. The local sheriff (Steve Ryan) arrives, alerted by Scully, but a scuffle ensues. The sheriff draws a gun, and Doggett punches him, only to have his hand go completely through the man's stomach. Upon investigation, Reyes is unable to find any organs in the man's body. Tommy soon shows Reyes the pictures he has been drawing. They include the sheriff with a gun, insect creatures, and Reyes with an insect creature bursting through her stomach. [...] Reyes asks Tommy why he would imagine such things, and Tommy replies it is because he is <b>very</b> <b>scared.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract This chapter {{presents}} an end-to-end hierarchy of bitstreams repository for FPGA-based networked and partially reconfigurable systems. This approach tar-gets embbeded systems with <b>very</b> <b>scare</b> hardware resources {{taking advantage of}} dy-namic, specific and optimized architectures. The hierarchy is based on three specific levels: FPGA local repository, local network repository and wide network reposi-tory. It allows the download of partial bitstreams depending on FPGA embedded resources and gives access to local or remote servers when a complete portfolio of bitstreams is needed. Based on real implementations and measurements, {{results show that the}} proposal is functional, use a very little of hardware and software mem-ory, and exhibits a download and reconfiguration time faster than state of the art solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In Nigeria, pasture is {{routinely}} available {{such that it}} is abundant in the rainy season and <b>very</b> <b>scare</b> in the dry season. Browse trees are not seasonal {{and a number of}} the browse trees are acceptable by cattle, sheep and goats as supplements to the scanty pasture in the off-season. It is against this background that the present study was carried out to assess the nutritive value of some relatively unexploited browse plants including neem (Azadirachta indica), almond (Terminalia catappa), mango (Mangifera indica) and bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina). Chemical composition of the forages was determined for CP, NDF, ADF and ADL. Presence of secondary metabolites including tannin, saponin and steroids was determined qualitatively. Residue obtained from qualitatively determined secondary metabolites (extracted) and that of whole sample...|$|R

On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one.

[...] John, quite {{innocent}} of the note and its contents, for he that moment had entered the clubroom with Mr. Potts's supper, took the note to the Benbow, from which he presently returned to his master with a <b>very</b> <b>scared</b> countenance. He said the gent in the Benbow was a most harbitrary gent.

6000|$|... 'Let me {{tell you}} about Nutty first. I said that he had always been anxious that I should marry you. Something {{happened}} last night to increase his anxiety. I have often wondered how he managed to get enough money to enable him to spend three days in New York, and last night he told me. He came in just after I had got back to the house after leaving you and that girl, and he was <b>very</b> <b>scared.</b> It seems that when the letter from the London lawyer came telling him that he had been left a hundred dollars, he got the idea of raising money on the strength of it. You know Nutty by this time, so you won't be surprised at the way he went about it. He borrowed a hundred dollars from the man at the chemist's on the security of that letter, and then--I suppose it seemed so easy that it struck him as a pity to let the opportunity slip--he did the same thing with four other tradesmen. Nutty's so odd that I don't know even now whether it ever occurred to him that he was obtaining money under false pretences; but the poor tradesmen hadn't any doubt about it at all. They compared notes and found what had happened, and last night, while we were in the woods, one of them came here and called Nutty a good many names and threatened him with imprisonment.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of Osteoarthritis (OA) is gradually increasing worldwide due to two main reasons: longer life expectation and increased functional demand. Several treatment options {{have been proposed}} for this disease. Conservative treatment has the goal {{to improve the quality}} of life, reduce pain, and prevent the progression of the disease. Hyaluronate viscosupplementation is one of the most used infiltrative treatments for OA, but, despite its common use, clinical efficacy is still under question. Though adverse reactions for this medical option are actually rare, septic arthritis is a <b>very</b> <b>scaring</b> complication. We present a case report of a 59 -year-old man who has been submitted to only one knee hyaluronate injection and consequently reported a severe septic arthritis and systemic sepsis, which lead to the death of the patient. We recommend producing correct guidelines for a clean aseptic procedure of injection to obtain proper consensus from the patient and to pay attention to his clinical history and comorbidities before acting any kind of invasive treatment, including joint injection...|$|R

40|$|For cost, {{planning}} and organisational reasons, {{it is often}} decided to install large pre-built accelerators components and physics detectors. As a result surface exceptional transports are required from the construction to the installation sites. Such heavy transports have been numerous during the LHC installation phase. This paper will describe {{the different types of}} transport techniques used to fit the particularities of accelerators and detectors components (weight, height, acceleration, planarity) as well as the measurement techniques for monitoring and the logistical aspects (organisation with the police, obstacles on the roads, etc). As far as oversized equipment is concerned, the lowering into the pit is challenging, as well as the transport in tunnel galleries in a <b>very</b> <b>scare</b> space and without handling means attached to the structure like overhead travelling cranes. From the PS accelerator to the LHC, handling systems have been developed at CERN to fit with these particular working conditions.

40|$|Leaf {{epidermal}} {{features are}} very important in grass systematics for characterization of broad groups, within subfamilies and tribes. Numerous species belonging to sub-tribe Ischaemineae, tribe Andropogoneae, family Poaceae are endemic to the Indian subcontinent, but their micromorphological reports were <b>very</b> <b>scares.</b> Therefore, foliar micromorphological characters of subtribe Ischaemineae have been studied in detail for 16 taxa of subtribe Ischaemineae from Gujarat, India. All the epidermal peels were prepared after following routine scraping method, representative areas were photographed and presented here. Structural diversity as well as metric values for both the epidermises has been recorded. In general, intercostals zones and costal zones are uniform in nature in terms of sinuous papillate long cells, cross-dumbbell-nodular shaped silica cells and triangular-low domed shaped subsidiary cells on stomata. From all the studied micromorphological characters, papillae and microhairs {{are found to be}} most useful character to segregate species and genera in subtribe Ischaemineae. Additionally, intercostal silica bodies, hooks, prickles and bulliform cells are also found to be helpful for the same. An artificial key based on observed variable micromorphological features has been also prepared...|$|R

40|$|State of the Art: World-wide {{there is}} very little {{cultivar}} testing of stone fruit under organic conditions. Neither are there appropriate breading programs on-going. Thus, knowledge is <b>very</b> <b>scare.</b> Stone fruit as cherries, plums and apricots are very difficult to produce organically. A key disease is Monilia sp. Further problems to overcome are susceptibility to leaf spot disease, aphids, insects, cracking etc. Additionally organic stone fruit, too, has to achieve the high and significantly changed market expectations (bigger and crisper fruit). The project aim is to find cherry (sweet and sour) and plum cultivars suited for organic production. Methodology: Precision trials are planted at Stone-Fruit Center Breitenhof of Agroscope Wädenswil at CH-Wintersingen. 15 cultivars of sweet cherry, 8 of sour cherry and 12 plum cultivars; 4 replicates. Some advanced cherry and plum cultivars are also under On-Farm observation. Apricots are evaluated only under On-Farm conditions in commercial organic orchards in canton Vallais. Results & conclusion: Only few of 15 sweet cherry cultivars (new selections and old traditional varieties) show a potential for organic production (Julka and FAW 1075). Confirmation and On-Farm trials are going to be installed...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{transcription}} factor 7 ‑like 2 (TCF 7 L 2) {{is one of}} the genes that have been identified as possible determinants of diabetes which is associated with obesity. Data on the genetic causes of obesity in sub‑Saharan African populations are <b>very</b> <b>scares.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the association between the {{transcription factor}} 7 ‑like 2 (TCF 7 L 2) gene polymorphism (rs 12255372 G/T) and obesity and weight‑related traits in a Cameroonian population. Methods: A case–control study was conducted on 35 obese and 30 non‑obese Cameroonian adults. TCF 7 L 2 rs 12255372 genotypes were determined using PCR–RFLP and correlated with BMI and weight‑related traits. Results: No significant association was observed between the rs 12255372 T allele (χ 2 = 0. 0684, p = 0. 79) or the TT genotype (χ 2 = 0. 372, p = 0. 54) of the TCF 7 L 2 gene and obesity in the Cameroonian population. However, amongst the weight‑related traits, triglycerides were significantly associated with the T risk allele of the TCF 7 L 2 gene (p = 0. 012). Conclusion: This study on Cameroonian subjects replicates the absence of association between the TCF 7 L 2 rs 12255372 variant and obesity as observed in European and American populations...|$|R
