2500|$|As {{stated earlier}} in this article, a <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> {{schedule}} yields reinforcement after the emission of an unpredictable number of responses. [...] This schedule typically generates rapid, persistent responding. Slot machines pay off on a <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> schedule, and they produce just this sort of persistent lever-pulling behavior in gamblers. The <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> payoff from slot machines {{and other forms of}} gambling has often been cited as a factor underlying gambling addiction.|$|R

The local rates of responding were consistently higher on the <b>variable</b> <b>ratio,</b> even when there was overall preference for the variable interval. Matching on concurrent <b>variable</b> interval, <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> was shown to be incompatible with maximization of total reinforcement, given the observed local rates of responding and rates of alternation between the schedules. Furthermore, it was shown that the subjects were losing reinforcements {{at a rate of}} about 60 per hour by matching rather than maximizing...|$|R

40|$|These {{experiments}} {{examined the}} own-price and cross-price elasticities {{of a drug}} (ethanol mixed with 10 % sucrose) and a nondrug (10 % sucrose) reinforcer. Rats were presented with ethanol-sucrose and sucrose, both available on concurrent independent variable-ratio (VR) 8 schedules of reinforcement. In Experiment 1, the <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> for the ethanol mix was systematically raised to 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 30, while the <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> for sucrose remained at 8. Five of the 6 rats increased ethanol-reinforced responding {{at some of the}} increments and defended baseline levels of ethanol intake. However, the rats eventually ceased ethanol-reinforced responding at the highest <b>variable</b> <b>ratios.</b> Sucrose-reinforced responding was not systematically affected by the changes in <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> for ethanol mix. In Experiment 2, the <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> for sucrose was systematically increased while the ethanol-sucrose response requirement remained constant. The rats decreased sucrose-reinforced responding and increased ethanol-sucrose-reinforced responding, resulting in a two- to 10 -fold increase in ethanol intake. Experiment 3 examined the substitutability of qualitatively identical reinforcers: 10 % sucrose versus 10 % sucrose. Increases in variable-ratio requirements at the preferred lever resulted in a switch in lever preference. Experiment 4 examined whether 10 % ethanol mix substituted for 5 % ethanol mix, with increasing variable-ratio requirements of the 5 % ethanol. All rats eventually responded predominantly for the 10 % ethanol mix, but total amount of ethanol consumed per session did not systematically change. In Experiment 5, the variable-ratio requirements for both ethanol and sucrose were simultaneously raised to VR 120; 7 of 8 rats increased ethanol-reinforced responding while decreasing sucrose-reinforced responding. These data suggest that, within this ethanol-induction procedure and within certain parameters, demand for ethanol-sucrose was relatively inelastic, and sucrose consumption was independent of ethanol-sucrose consumption. Demand for sucrose, on the other hand, was relatively elastic, and ethanol-sucrose readily substituted for it. The results are discussed in terms of applying a behavioral economic approach to relationships between drug and nondrug reinforcers...|$|R

The paper also expands on and supports the conjecture of Mitchell, Selman, and Levesque [13] that hard randomly generated CNF formulas will be hard for any reasonable satisfiability algorithm. We report statistics for a much larger set of variables than have been previously reported; in particular, we show that for each clause to <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> less than 4. 2, the percentage of satisfiable formulas increases, and for each clause to <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than 4. 2, the percentage of satisfiable formulas decreases {{as a function of}} number of variables.

40|$|In this {{research}} work, comparative analysis of Oxalic acid produced from Rice husk and Paddy {{was carried out}} in order to ascertain which waste sample produced a better yield.

The <b>variable</b> <b>ratio</b> of 60 : 40 gave the maximum yield and at a maximum temperature of 75 oC. Rice husk sample gave a percentage yield of 53. 2, 64. 4, 81. 0, and 53. 3 at temperatures of 55 oC, 65 oC, 75 oC, and 85 oC respectively.
