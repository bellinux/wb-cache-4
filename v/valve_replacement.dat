40|$|Although the Starr-Edwards {{caged-ball valve}} remains a {{standard}} of comparison for more recently introduced prostheses, a substantial incidence of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications prompted our evaluation of the Hancock glutaraldehyde-fixed porcine xenograft. We have compared the results of 435 aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> using the Starr- Edwards valve (SE-AVR), 515 mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> (SE-MVR), and 121 double-valve replacements (SE-AVRMVR) with 251 aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> using the xenograft aortic valve (X-AVR), 338 mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> (X-MVR), and 88 double-valve replacements (X-AVR-MVR). The Starr- Edwards valves were used during the period 1963 through 1973 and the xenograft valves between 1971 and 1976. No significant differences in patient age, sex, or preoperative hemodynamic data were noted between comparable groups. All patients with Starr-Edwards valves received long-term anticoagulation while anticoagulants were used only for specific indications in patients with xenograft valves. Total follow up was 3944 patient years for the Starr-Edwards patients and 947 patient years for the xenograft patients. Hospital mortality was not significantly different for comparable groups: SE-AVR 6. 9 % vs. X-AVR 6. 4 %, SE-MVR 9. 7 % vs X-MVR 8. 6 %, and SE-AVR-MVR 7. 5 % vs. X-AVR-MVR 10. 2 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tissue {{engineering}} {{represents a}} promising approach {{for the development}} of living heart <b>valve</b> <b>replacements.</b> In vivo animal studies of tissue-engineered autologous heart valves have focused on pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>replacements,</b> leaving the challenge to tissue engineer heart valves suitable for systemic application using human cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissue-engineered human heart valves were analyzed up to 4 weeks and conditioning using bioreactors was compared with static culturing. Tissue formation and mechanical properties increased with time and when using conditioning. Organization of the tissue, in terms of anisotropic properties, increased when conditioning was dynamic in nature. Exposure of the valves to physiological aortic valve flow demonstrated proper opening motion. Closure dynamics were suboptimal, most likely caused by the lower degree of anisotropy when compared with native aortic valve leaflets. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents autologous tissue-engineered heart valves based on human saphenous vein cells and a rapid degrading synthetic scaffold. Tissue properties and mechanical behavior might allow for use as living aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacements...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 40 years, {{the study of}} aortic heart <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> has had {{its roots in the}} work of great clinicians, {{scientists}} and biomedical engineers who established the techniques for heart valve substitutes. Recently the research on the development of aortic heart <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> has shifted toward tissue engineering (TE), a multidisciplinary research that involves biological, biomaterial and bioengineering sciences. This book introduces current valve substitutes and their limitations and the futuristic tissue engineering of aortic heart valves (TEHV).

25|$|Aortic {{dissection}} {{may be a}} late sequela {{of cardiac}} surgery. About 18% of individuals who present with an acute aortic dissection {{have a history of}} open-heart surgery. Individuals who have undergone aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> for aortic insufficiency are at particularly high risk because aortic insufficiency causes increased blood flow in the ascending aorta. This can cause dilatation and weakening of the walls of the ascending aorta.|$|E
25|$|Many {{surgeons}} gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to {{rejection of}} the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system.

40|$|The authors report 8 {{cases of}} left heart rupture at the {{insertion}} of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve out of 693 mitral <b>valve</b> <b>replacements.</b> Special {{attention is paid to}} the anatomy of this area and to the technique of removal of annular calcifications, when present. In reviewing the literature, the authors analyze the cases reported up to now with particular reference to the age of patients, number of valves replaced, size and amount of calcifications, volume of the left ventricular cavity, type and size of the prosthesis employed, supra- or subannular insertion, time between valve application and rupture of the heart, techniques of repair with cardiopulmonary by-pass with a beating or arrested heart.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of severe valvular dysfunctions (e. g., stenosis and insufficiency) is increasing, leading to over 300, 000 valves implanted worldwide yearly. Clinically used heart <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> lack {{the capacity to}} grow, inherently requiring repetitive and high-risk surgical interventions during childhood. The aim of this review is to present how different tissue engineering strategies can overcome these limitations, providing innovative <b>valve</b> <b>replacements</b> {{that proved to be}} able to integrate and remodel in pre-clinical experiments and to have promising results in clinical studies. Upon description of the different types of heart valve tissue engineering (e. g., in vitro, in situ, in vivo, and the pre-seeding approach) we focus on the clinical translation of this technology. In particular, we will deepen the many technical, clinical, and regulatory aspects that need to be solved to endure the clinical adaptation and the commercialization of these promising regenerative valves...|$|R

25|$|Schwarzenegger {{was born}} with a {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement heart valve made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require heart <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available {{at the time of his}} surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.|$|E
25|$|Treating {{people who}} have strep throat with antibiotics, such as penicillin, {{decreases}} {{the risk of developing}} rheumatic fever. In order to avoid antibiotic misuse this often involves testing people with sore throats for the infection, which may not be available in the developing world. Other preventive measures include improved sanitation. In those with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease, prolonged periods of antibiotics are sometimes recommended. Gradual return to normal activities may occur following an attack. Once RHD develops, treatment is more difficult. Occasionally <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> surgery or valve repair is required. Otherwise complications are treated as per normal.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, 45% of the 250,000 <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> {{procedures}} performed annually {{involve a}} mechanical valve implant. The {{most widely used}} valve is a bileaflet disc heart valve, or St. Jude valve. The mechanics involve two semicircular discs moving back and forth, with both allowing {{the flow of blood}} as well as the ability to form a seal against backflow. The valve is coated with pyrolytic carbon, and secured to the surrounding tissue with a mesh of woven fabric called Dacron (du Pont's trade name for polyethylene terephthalate). The mesh allows for the body's tissue to grow while incorporating the valve.|$|E
25|$|Acute aortic {{insufficiency}} In acute AI, {{as may be}} seen with acute perforation of the aortic valve due to endocarditis, {{there will be a}} sudden increase in the volume of blood in the left ventricle. The ventricle is unable to deal with the sudden change in volume. The filling pressure of the left ventricle will increase. This causes pressure in the left atrium to rise, and the individual will develop pulmonary edema. Severe acute {{aortic insufficiency}} is considered a medical emergency. There is a high mortality rate if the individual does not undergo immediate surgery for aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement.</b>|$|E

25|$|Chronic aortic {{insufficiency}} If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left ventricular filling pressures will revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase.Some individuals enter this decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic <b>valve</b> <b>replacement</b> prior to this decompensation phase.|$|E
