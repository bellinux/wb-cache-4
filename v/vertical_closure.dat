The numerical experiments are performed at different locations in the Mediterranean for which the year 2004 is simulated.

The vertical mixing schemes tested {{in this study are}} a second-order statistical model (k-?) and the non-local K-profile parameterization (KPP). Both schemes yield similar results in terms of reproducing the water column dynamics.

Assessment of preference for balance (APB), based on the symmetry-axes framework suggested in Arnheim R, 1974 Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press), successfully matched subject balance ratings of images of geometrical shapes over unlimited viewing time. We now examine pictorial balance perception of Japanese calligraphy during first fixation, isolated from later cognitive processes, comparing APB measures with results from balance-rating and comparison tasks. Results show high between-task correlation, but low correlation with APB. We repeated the rating task, expanding the image set to include five rotations of each image, comparing balance perception of artist and novice participant groups. Rotation has no effect on APB balance computation but dramatically affects balance rating, especially for art experts. We analyze the variety of rotation effects and suggest that, rather than depending on element size and position relative to symmetry axes, first fixation balance processing derives from global processes such as grouping of lines and shapes, object recognition, preference for horizontal and <b>vertical</b> elements, <b>closure,</b> and completion, enhanced by vertical symmetry...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{much work}} has been done on factors which {{influence}} the patterning of species and species trait assemblages in a variety of groups such as plants, vertebrates and invertebrates, few studies have been realized at a broad geographic scale. We analyzed patterns of relationships between species, species trait distribution/assembly, and environmental variables from the west of Europe to Slovakia, Poland and Sweden. We created a database by compiling traits and occurrence data of European collembolan species, using literature and personal field studies embracing a large range of environmental gradients (<b>vertical</b> stratification, habitat <b>closure,</b> humus form, soil acidity and moisture, temperature, rainfall, altitude) over which Collembola are supposed to be distributed. Occurrences of the 58 best-documented species, environmental variables and species traits allowed us to (i) show which environmental variables impact the distribution of the 58 species at broad scale and (ii) document to what extent environmental variables and species trait assemblages are related and which trends could be found in trait/environment relationships. The impact of <b>vertical</b> stratification, habitat <b>closure,</b> humus form, soil acidity, soil moisture, temperature, {{and to a lesser extent}} rainfall and altitude on species distribution, firstly revealed by indirect gradient analysis (correspondence analysis, CA), was further shown to be significant by direct gradient analysis (canonical correspondence analysis, CCA). RLQ analyses were performed to find linear combination of variables of table R (environmental variables) and linear combinations of the variables of table Q (species traits) of maximum covariance weighted by species occurrence data contained in table L. RLQ followed by permutation tests showed that all tested environmental variables apparently contributed significantly to the assemblages of the twelve species traits studied. A convergence was observed between traits related to vertical stratification and those related to habitat closure/aperture. Well-developed locomotory organs (furcula, legs), presence of sensorial organs sensitive to air movements and light (e. g. trichobothria and eye spots), spherical body, large body size, pigmentation (UV protection and signaling) and sexual reproduction largely occur in epigeic and open habitats, while most of woodland and edaphic habitats are characterized by short locomotory appendages, small body size, high number of defense organs (pseudocelli), presence of post-antennal organs and parthenogenesis. Climate and especially temperature exert an effect on the assemblage of traits that are mostly present above-ground and in open habitats. The contribution of combinations of some environmental variables to the occurrence of each species trait was tested by linear, logistic or multinomial regression (Generalized Linear Models). Vertical stratification, followed by temperature, played a dominant role in the variation of the twelve studied traits. Relationships between traits and environment tested here shows that it is possible to use some traits as proxies to identify potential ecological preferences or tolerances of invertebrate species. However, a significant part of species distribution remained unexplained, probably partly because some traits, like ecophysiological ones, or traits involved in biotic interactions (e. g. competition) were unavailable. The present work is thus a first step towards the creation of models predicting changes in collembolan communities. Further studies are required to inform ecophysiological traits, in order to complete such models. Moreover the niche width of species will have to be determined...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional {{avalanche}} {{simulation software}} operating in three-dimensional terrain {{is widely used}} for hazard zoning and engineering to predict runout distances and impact pressures of snow avalanche events. Mountain forests are an effective biological protection measure against avalanches; however, the protective capacity of forests to decelerate or even to stop avalanches that start within forested areas or directly above the treeline is seldom considered in this context. In particular, runout distances of small- to medium-scale avalanches are strongly influenced by the structural conditions of forests in the avalanche path. We present an evaluation and operationalization of a novel detrainment function implemented in the avalanche simulation software RAMMS for avalanche simulation in forested terrain. The new approach accounts for the effect of forests in the avalanche path by detraining mass, {{which leads to a}} deceleration and runout shortening of avalanches. The relationship is parameterized by the detrainment coefficient K [kg m − 1 s − 2] accounting for differing forest characteristics. We varied K when simulating 40 well-documented small- to medium-scale avalanches, which were released in and ran through forests of the Swiss Alps. Analyzing and comparing observed and simulated runout distances statistically revealed values for K suitable to simulate the combined influence of four forest characteristics on avalanche runout: forest type, crown <b>closure,</b> <b>vertical</b> structure and surface cover, for example, values for K were higher for dense spruce and mixed spruce-beech forests compared to open larch forests at the upper treeline.

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESES: To {{investigate}} the interrater reliability of stroboscopy evaluations assessed using Poburka's Stroboscopy Evaluation Rating Form (SERF). STUDY DESIGN: Single-factor experiment with repeated measures {{on the same}} element. METHODS: Evaluations of nine experts pertaining to 68 stroboscopy recordings and 16 SERF variables were analyzed. For the 14 SERF variables possessing interval scale level, interrater reliability was investigated using the intraclass correlations for absolute agreement (ICC-a) and consistency (ICC-c). ICCs-c were computed for both original values and values standardized with respect to raters' {{means and standard deviations}} (ipsative values). For the two nominally scaled SERF variables, "vertical level" and "glottal closure" interrater reliability was investigated using kappa coefficients. RESULTS: For evaluations of single raters, ICCs-a ranged from 0. 32 to 0. 71, ICCs-c for original values from 0. 41 to 0. 72, and ICCs-c for ipsative values from 0. 43 to 0. 72. For mean evaluations of two raters, the corresponding values were 0. 48 to 0. 83 for ICCs-a, 0. 58 to 0. 84 for ICCs-c for original values, and 0. 60 to 0. 84 for ICCs-c for ipsative values. The interval scale variables with the lowest interrater reliabilities were phase closure, phase symmetry, and regularity. The kappa coefficients for vertical level and glottal closure were 0. 15 and 0. 38, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The interrater reliabilities for <b>vertical</b> level, glottal <b>closure,</b> phase closure, phase symmetry, and regularity are so low that these variables should not be assessed via stroboscopy. For the remaining variables, adequate reliability can be obtained by aggregating evaluations from at least two raters...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{suggest that}} the time- and zonal-mean state of the extratropical {{atmosphere}} adjusts itself such that the so-called “criticality parameter” (which relates the vertical stratification to the horizontal temperature gradient) is close to one. T. Schneider {{has argued that the}} criticality parameter is kept near one by a constraint on the zonal momentum budget in primitive equations. The constraint relies on a diffusive closure for the eddy flux of potential vorticity (PV) with an eddy diffusivity that is approximately constant in the <b>vertical.</b> The diffusive <b>closure</b> for the eddy PV flux, however, depends crucially on the definition of averages along isentropes that intersect the surface. It is argued that the definition favored by Schneider results in eddy PV fluxes whose physical interpretation is unclear and that do not satisfy the proposed closure in numerical simulations. An alternative definition, first proposed by T. -Y. Koh and R. A. Plumb, is preferred. A diffusive closure for the eddy PV flux under this definition is supported by analysis of the PV variance budget and can be used to close the near-surface zonal momentum budget in idealized numerical simulations. Following this approach, it is shown that O(1) criticalities are obtained if the eddy diffusivity decays from its surface value to about zero over the depth of the troposphere, which {{is likely to be the}} case in Earth’s atmosphere. Large criticality parameters, however, are possible if the eddy diffusivity decays only weakly in the vertical, consistent with results from quasigeostrophic models. This provides theoretical support for recent numerical studies that have found supercritical mean states in primitive equation models. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Award OCE- 0849233...|$|R

40|$|Angular {{momentum}} transport in accretion discs {{is often}} {{believed to be}} due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence mediated by the magnetorotational instability. Despite an abundant literature on the MRI, the parameters governing the saturation amplitude of the turbulence are poorly understood and the existence of an asymptotic behavior in the Ohmic diffusion regime is not clearly established. We investigate the properties of the turbulent state in the small magnetic Prandtl number limit. Since this is extremely computationally expensive, we also study the relevance and range of applicability of the most common subgrid scale models for this problem. Unstratified shearing boxes simulations are performed both in the compressible and incompressible limits, with a resolution up to 800 cells per disc scale height. The latter constitutes the largest resolution ever attained for a simulation of MRI turbulence. In the presence of a mean magnetic field threading the domain, angular momentum transport converges to a finite value in the small Pm limit. When the mean vertical field amplitude is such that β, the ratio between the thermal and magnetic pressure, equals 1000, we find α 0. 032 when Pm approaches zero. In the case of a mean toroidal field for which β= 100, we find α 0. 018 in the same limit. Both implicit LES and Chollet-Lesieur closure model reproduces these results for the α parameter and the power spectra. A reduction in computational cost of a factor at least 16 (and up to 256) is achieved when using such methods. MRI turbulence operates efficiently in the small Pm limit provided there is a mean magnetic field. Implicit LES offers a practical and efficient mean of investigation of this regime but should be used with care, particularly {{in the case of a}} <b>vertical</b> field.

40|$|MAED, Material {{library for}} Architecture and Design, is a {{material}} database with educational g, it is maneged by DIARC, University of Federico II of Naples. To design the website we have studied {{many of the}} existing material databases with similar purposes. We identified some databases that have similar goals like ArTec and we compared the different interfaces used. Some material database used TUI, Text-based User Interface, rather than GUI, Graphic User Interface, and no material library is linked with the application fields such as architecture and Design. MAED is a materials database with educational purposes, linked to the architecture and design, that uses an interface where the iconic code prevails over the verbal one. One of the priorities of the research was to define a front-end able to show the methodological criteria that guided {{the construction of the}} database. The interface is a metaphor to the discipline of knowledge to which it refers, the suitable metaphor to represent the architecture and design is the 3 D model or its simulacrum. The experimentation made for MAED arises in an intermediate position between the two opposite ends where are placed all the interfaces that have been implemented in recent decades, between the writing and the world, between the hypertext and the three-dimensional representation of the reality, between wikipedia and google street view. According to the educational purpose of the project MAED we chose an iconic, an user friendly interface, that have to facilitate the access to the website and to simplify the navigation inside. We access the database through three main query: MATERIAL (materials library), ARCHITECTURE (for Architecture) and DESIGN (and Design). We can select one of the works that are in the database using the query ARCHITECTURE Unit architectural. An interface with a high level iconic is the way to access to different types of information connected to the unit architectural selected. The information was organized into five different types: Info, Pictures, and Video Drawings, provide general information on the work, while the selection of 3 D Model provides access to an interactive PDF with 3 D PDF, that is a tool to understand the structure of MAED and to facilitate the navigation inside. The PDF format, universally readable, has been used to build an interactive interface, capable to link the 3 D model with the database MAED. The PDF becomes an additional tool to browse through the site, an user friendly interface, which, through links appropriately designed, allows us to navigate to another section of the same document or to return to the database. In particular, the home page of the PDF document is a kind of home page that allows us to explore 3 D Model that is inside the document or to go to MAED to query the system using queries such as Material, Element Technical, Architectural Unit, Unit Technology. The graphical interface, is a pictographic figure that represents information, in which we linked text to image, in this case the text is intended to further clarify the organization criteria of the database that reflects the classification of the technological system based on the current legislation. So the Window is linked to Technology Unit, in particular the Closing Vertical, that is still connected to the class of Technical Elements, Vertical Window, and even to Basic Materials, Glass and Steel, and so the Structural System allows us to explore the website from the structure of the auditorium of Ravello to Concrete. The interactive PDF document, readable with Acrobat Reader, contains 3 D models interactively explored, the 3 D function is activated by simply clicking on the image, as well as interactive exploration of the model were created by the user links to the text so to make the image dynamic. In the PDF document we set up some different possibility to interact with the 3 D model. Graphical interface, that is the Home Page of the PDF document, allows us to navigate in the document and to the database.

40|$|The {{area around}} Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces {{flooding}} and salt intrusion problems. Flooding problems {{are caused by}} intensive rainfall in the city, high river discharges and high tides on sea. Dr. Hoc, the vice-minister of MARD (Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development) proposed to construct a hydraulic structure downstream of HCMC. This will solve both the flooding and siltation problem. A possibility is to construct a dam between Vung Tau and Go Cong. This solution has been worked out into a preliminary design, which includes a design for the cross section and {{an investigation into the}} closure method. The hydraulic system where the project will be constructed consists of the Saigon - Dong Nai river system and the East Sea, and can be classified as an estuary with a (mainly semi-diurnal) mixed tide. Waves are moderate in the area. A dam will be constructed between Go Cong and the Dong Nai navigation channel. Over the Dong-Nai navigation channel to Vung Tau a bridge is planned, to minimise navigation delays and changes in tidal and salinity range in the Can Gio mangrove forest. To make a closed basin, Can Thanh will be connected with the dam near the Dong Nai navigation channel. Ship locks and discharge sluices will be constructed at the sides of the existing navigation channel in the Soi Rap. The final closure of the dam will take place in the Soi Rap navigation channel. A road on the dam will connect Vung Tau with Go Cong. Because there is no subsoil information available at the location of the dam, the soil layering and parameters are estimated based on information from locations {{in the vicinity of the}} dam. Three different soil profiles were drawn up. Measures have to be taken to increase the bearing capacity of the subsoil and decrease settlements during the lifetime of the dam. If thick layers of weak subsoil is present, drainage in combination with pre-loading will be the best solution. In case of a stronger subsoil partial replacement with sand is favourable. To build the dam, the use of local material is a cheap and easy solution. Near Vung Tau a number of areas are present where sand can be obtained. Rock can be found in mountains in the neighbourhood of Vung Tau. Since there is already a stone quarry in this area, it is assumed that the rock is of good quality. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis it was found that a building a dam with a sand core is the best solution in this project. Degradation or even failure of (elements of) the structure may occur as a result of loadings during the operational phase or in accidental situations. The principal failure mechanisms for the VT-GC dam are checked. Slope, crest and toe protections were designed to prevent failure. Two designs were made for the cross section of the dam: one with an outer slope revetment made of asphalt and one for an outer slope revetment made of rock. The biggest differences in these designs can be found in the crest height and layer thicknesses. The construction of the dam should start with the construction of the bridge and work islands. Next, the discharge sluices and navigation locks will be made in building pits. Then the dam will be constructed. This starts with the foundation and scour protection which will be constructed using barges. Waterborne equipment is preferred because of the easier logistics and larger capacities. The core material, filter layers, underlayer, toe and armour layer will be constructed layer by layer to be able to raise the relatively steep slopes. Where water depths are too low, cranes operating from pontoons or rolling equipment can be used. After completion of the core and revetment, the crest is constructed and the dam can be finished with the construction of the road. The closure of the final gap is a very important aspect within the construction of the dam. A storage area approach is used to determine the system behaviour during closure. High velocities in the final gap make it impossible to close the gap with sand. A bottom protection is necessary in the final gap to prevent a scour hole, caused by high velocities, from developing too close to the dam. The gap is closed with coarser material than sand. A combination of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>closure</b> will be used. First barges dump stones to a level of MSL - 5 m. When the water is too shallow, dumping will continue from the sides of the closure gap. The final dam profile in the closure gap will be similar to the regular dam sections. A general estimation of the cost for the total project, based on costs in reference projects, is 3. 1 billion US dollar. The Dong Thap Muoi region is a very important agricultural area for the production of rice. Due to the low river discharges and the large influence of the tide, the salt concentrations in the Vam Co rivers are high, causing problems for the farmers. An estimation of the salt intrusion length was made using a predictive steady-state salt intrusion model, according to Savenije. Unfortunately it was not possible to perform salinity measurements in the Vam Co River, so data from three fixed measurement stations was used. With this data, it was possible to fit the model roughly but more data is needed to make the model more accurate. Student report for a Master Project.

30|$|From Fig.  9, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} using large-diameter bolts in the roadway bolt support can produce larger working {{resistance}} while the same displacement is produced in the surrounding rocks. Similarly, with the same load, the displacement is much smaller when large-diameter bolts are used compared to smaller-diameter bolts. The measured data also confirm this trend. For example, the increasing rate <b>vertical</b> <b>closure</b> was 14.4  mm/MPa without support; that value decreases 33.3  % to 9.6  mm/MPa when bolts of 18  mm diameter were used, and the value decreased 66.7  % to 4.8  mm/MPa when bolts of 30  mm diameter were used. This suggests that the use of large-diameter bolts has a pronounced effect on the control of the deformation of the surrounding rock.|$|E

40|$|Pharyngocutaneous (PC) fistula is {{a common}} {{complication}} following laryngectomy. It leads to increased morbidity, delay in adjuvant treatment, prolonged hospitalization {{and an increase in}} treatment costs. Although a number of factors that result in PC fistula have been described, there is still no agreement on the most significant factors. We undertook a prospective study to critically analyze PC fistula and its association with various tumors, patient and treatment related factors. This was a prospective study that included 143 patients who underwent laryngeal surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and pyriform sinus. Use of pectoralis major myocutaneous flap to reconstruct the neopharynx, primary disease in pyriform and extensive soft tissue infiltration were significantly associated with PC fistula.

40|$|Objectives. A pharyngocutaneous fistula (PCF) {{following}} {{total laryngectomy}} {{is associated with}} increased morbidity and severe life threatening complications. We aimed to review our experience with the PCF following total laryngectomy and determine the impact of previously reported risk factors {{on the development of}} PCF in our patients. Methods. The medical records of 20 patients who had a total laryngectomy operation were retrospectively analyzed. The association between the proposed risk factors and the incidence of the PCF was investigated. Results. Comparison of the suture techniques used for the closure of the pharynx (either continuous Cushing type or interrupted) yielded that primary interrupted sutures had a significantly higher incidence of PCF formation (p 0. 05). No significant difference was observed between the PCF and non-PCF groups in terms of other proposed risk factors (p> 0. 05). [*][*]Conclusions. The main risk factor associated with PCF was found to be the type of pharyngeal closure technique. A <b>vertical</b> <b>closure</b> with a Cushing type continuous suture may be more successful than interrupted sutures in preventing a PCF...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Many {{young women}} are {{satisfied}} with their large breasts but suffer from sagging due to heaviness. In this article; we present a novel modification of vertical scar breast reduction based on a special indication. METHODS From January 2006 to May 2012, twenty five individual patients underwent operation using modified technique with superior pedicle and vertical scar. Young women between ages 25 - 35 years with voluminous breasts who requested mastopexy rather than reduction were selected for the surgery. RESULTS The mean patient age was 30 years and body mass index (BMI) was 27. 8 ± 1. 07 kg/m 2. Mean nipple transposition was 6. 5 cm. Mean weight for resected tissue was 415 g for left and 419 g for right breast. Mean operative time was 125 minutes. Patients were followed up for 9 - 22 months. No serious complications encountered in consecutive patient series. The only complication was permanent wrinkling probably due to <b>vertical</b> <b>closure</b> in 5 of 25 patients which did not resolve during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION We recommend that the Snowman design is {{a useful tool for}} superior pedicle breast reduction technique providing good projection and a short scar in selected patients...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of drift closure {{caused by}} the thermal load have been made {{routinely}} during the Spent Fuel Test in Climax granite since about six weeks after emplacement of the fuel. Horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>closure</b> was measured with a manually operated tape extensometer at various locations along the lengths of the drifts. Average closures ranged from 0 to 0. 6 mm, horizontal and vertical, out to about 2. 2 years {{since the start of}} the test. At the same time, displacements from the thermal loads were measured with rod extensometers emplaced to measure relative displacements between hole collars and anchor points in holes drilled from two parallel heater drifts. These data are compared with thermo-elastic finite element calculations which utilized measured properties of the Climax granite. The calculations show that more than half of the closures occur between fuel installation and the first closure measurement. The comparisons show that the results track each other, in that where closure followed by dilation is measured, the calculations also show this effect. The agreement is excellent, considering the averaged measured closures remain within 30 % of the total calculated drift closures and the extremely small magnitude of the relative displacements (0. 5 mm), measured or calculated...|$|E
