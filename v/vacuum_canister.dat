50|$|This was {{the only}} {{generation}} with covered headlights. In 1967 and 1968, they were deployed using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>canister</b> system that opened and closed the headlamp doors. For 1969 and 1970, a redesigned vacuum system kept the doors down when a vacuum condition existed in the lines, provided by the engine when it was running. If a loss of vacuum occurred, the doors would retract up so that the headlights were visible if the system should fail.|$|E
50|$|Reservoirs {{and devices}} {{connected}} to the engine through check valves allow pressure to reduce when the engine is generating a lot of vacuum, but do not allow air back in. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>canisters</b> only allow <b>vacuum</b> accessories to be operated for a very short time, and air will leak in after the engine turns off.|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} monitors on the M 0003 experiment {{consisted of}} passive sample collectors to measure molecular and particular deposition. The collectors {{were placed in}} the leading and trailing edge trays of M 0003. The objective was to quantify the contaminants and determine how contamination affected the other materials in the trays.

50|$|This {{generation}} was introduced with covered headlights {{on the top}} level LTD coupe, sedan and station wagon, which were deployed using a <b>vacuum</b> <b>canister</b> system that kept the doors down when a vacuum condition existed in the lines, provided by the engine when it was running. If a loss of vacuum occurred, the doors would retract up so that the headlights were visible if the system should fail. 1968s also included side marker lights and reflectors, and the parking lights now illuminated with the headlights. Front outboard shoulder belts were fitted to cars built effective January 1, 1968.|$|E
40|$|A calorimetric sensor {{with several}} novel design {{features}} has been developed. These sensors {{will provide an}} accurate sampling of thermal power density and energy deposition from proton beams incident on target components of accelerator-based systems, such as the Accelerator Production of Tritium Project (APT) and the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). A small, solid slug (volume = 0. 347 cc) of target material is suspended by kevlar fibers and surrounded by an adiabatic enclosure in an insulating <b>vacuum</b> <b>canister</b> of stainless steel construction. The slug is in thermal contact with a low-mass, calibrated, 100 -k{Omega} thermistor. Power deposition caused by the passage of radiation through the slug is calculated from the {{rate of temperature rise}} of the slug. The authors have chosen slugs composed of Pb, Al, and LiAl...|$|E
40|$|A multi-purpose, {{cylindrical}} {{thermal insulation}} test apparatus {{is used for}} testing insulation materials and systems of materials using a liquid boil-off calorimeter system for absolute measurement of the effective thermal conductivity (k-value) and heat flux of a specimen material at a fixed environmental condition (cold-side temperature, warm-side temperature, vacuum pressure level, and residual gas composition). An inner vessel receives liquid with a normal boiling point below ambient temperature, such as liquid nitrogen, enclosed within a vacuum chamber. A cold mass assembly, including upper and lower guard chambers and middle test vessel, is suspended from a lid of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>canister.</b> Each of the three chambers is filled and vented through a single feedthrough. All fluid and instrumentation feedthroughs are mounted and suspended from a top domed lid allowing easy removal of the cold mass. A lift mechanism allows manipulation of the cold mass assembly and insulation test article...|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} monitors on the M 0003 experiment {{consisted of}} passive sample collectors to measure molecular and particulate deposition. The collectors {{were placed in}} the leading and trailing edge trays of M 0003. The objective was to quantify the contaminants and determine how contamination affected the other materials in the trays. Duplicate collectors were placed inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>canisters</b> that provided protection from the launch, ascent, deployment, and recovery environments. Analyses of the samples show small quantities of molecular deposition on both the leading and trailing edge trays. Silicone deposits are negligible. The aluminized fused silica, second surface mirrors showed small changes in solar absorptances. This is consistent with the small quantities of molecular deposits deduced from the FTIR measurements. The results of particle deposition, light scatter, and a micrometeoroid (or debris) impact are presented...|$|R

50|$|In 1952, {{the company}} debuted the Electrolux Model LX, the first vacuum that would {{know when it}} is full and also the first vacuum to use a {{self-sealing}} bag. That same style bag is still in use {{on some of the}} new Aerus - Lux model <b>canister</b> <b>vacuums</b> today. This machine would lay the foundation for every other North American Electrolux vacuum produced.|$|R
40|$|An {{individual}} {{who had been}} diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and Schizoaffective Disorder requested assistance with improving his ability to manage symptoms. He had a history of long-term hospitalizations that impacted his placements in residential facilities. He was treated using exposure and response prevention procedures applied to specific rituals pertaining to compulsive bed making, organization, excessive emptying of <b>vacuum</b> <b>canister,</b> excessive hand washing and excessive laundering of clothing. A baseline was established for each ritual by the experimenter exposing the subject to the conditions that 2 ̆ 2 triggered 2 ̆ 2 the rituals. The latency was measured between the presentation of those conditions and the onset of the ritual. During treatment, the subject initiated the same conditions and then refrained from engaging in his rituals for a specific amount of time. Initially, the requested time was the average amount of time he was able to refrain from ritualizing in the baseline sessions. Then, the subject initiated exposure and refrained from the ritual for an increasing amount of time until he was able to refrain for 15 minutes or longer for three ritualistic behaviors. A multiple baseline analysis across rituals indicated that during the course of treatment, over a period of about 4 months, his ability to tolerate the triggers for his rituals was increased to the point that he did not engage in the rituals during the sessions...|$|E
40|$|The {{awareness}} of the possible presence of toxic chemical compounds at and around military compounds and other critical infra structures is crucial and normally monitored by point detectors. The disadvantage of these type of detectors is that large quantities (organized in a network) are needed when a large area is to be controlled. Secondly point detectors cannot be placed {{in areas that are}} not controlled by own forces. Therefore {{there is a need for}} a DIM capability that is able to scan larger areas and is able to measure in areas that cannot easily be reached. Such systems that can determine "out of the fence" of a compound or safe area will ensure additional early warning time to take the appropriate countermeasures for protection. Standoff detectors can be placed on the border of the safe area or effected area and monitor the surrounding. Passive standoff detectors can determine the presence of chemicals based on their IR spectrum. However the technique suffers from influences by weather conditions and other interferents. Moreover it is questionable whether reaching orders will be given guided by just one detection technique. Therefore there is a strong need for a second technique that is a capable to determine the chemical awareness on longer distance. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with DIM capabilities (CBRN-drone) could fill this gap. In a National Technology Project (NTP) the Dutch Ministry of Defence sponsored a joint project between small company Delft Dynamics, manufacturer of UAV's, and research organization TNO, to develop a prototype of a CBRN-drone. This presentation gives an overview on the Concept of Operation of such a CBRN-drone, the design and first experiments with integrated sensors and sampling systems. Given the limited payload of the drone (typically 1 - 2 kg) the UAV can only be equipped with small systems. Additionally the flight time of electrically driven systems is also limited. Taken this together the utility of a CBRN-drone is limited and restricted to a target directed use, rather than in a monitoring mode. The CBRN-drone, under construction, is equipped with a smart sampling system. The sampler itself consists of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>canister</b> or helium diffusion sampler that is activated manually or triggered by onboard generic detection systems. Crucial in that respect is the location of sampling and detection systems to avoid the interference by downwash caused by the rotor blades of the helicopter. Results of experiments showing the impact of downwash will be shown. A study-model of the CBRN-drone is shown at the TNO booth. Finally an outlook will be given on our thoughts on future developments for CERN-drones...|$|E
50|$|Portable vacuum {{cleaners}} {{working on the}} cyclonic separation principle became popular in the 1990s. This dirt separation principle was well known and often used in central vacuum systems. Cleveland's P.A. Geier Company had obtained a patent on a cyclonic vacuum cleaner as early as 1928, which was later sold to Health-Mor in 1939, introducing the Filter Queen cyclonic <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner.|$|R
40|$|An {{estimate}} of the design capacity for Spent Nuclear Fuel Project systems producing Multi-Canister Overpacks is developed based on completing fuel processing in a two year period. The design basis capacity for systems relates the desired annual processing rate to potential operating inefficiencies which may be actually experienced to project a design capacity for systems. The basis for estimating operating efficiency factors is described. Estimates of the design basis capacity were limited to systems actually producing the Multi-Canister Overpack. These systems include Fuel Retrieval, K Basin SNF <b>Vacuum</b> Drying, <b>Canister</b> Storage Building support for Staging and Storage, and Hot Vacuum conditioning. The capacity of other systems {{are assumed to be}} derived from these system capacities such that systems producing a Multi-Canister Overpack are not constrained...|$|R
5000|$|Although the company's {{technology}} {{has changed over}} a decade and is now based on electromechanical control, that eliminate latency and safety concerns, the first prototype's motion was supplied by homemade PVC pneumatic actuators and powered by a 4 horsepower <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner. The vacuum cleaner was capable of producing 2.0 PSI, this pressure coupled with a 3" [...] bore linear actuator produced approximately 20 pounds-force or around 90 newtons. The systems positioning was controlled {{by a series of}} solenoid based digital valves custom designed by William MacDonald.|$|R
5000|$|From 1935 {{through the}} 1980s, {{continuous}} improvements and refinements {{were made to}} the Kirby home care system. One of the popular selling points is that it can be easily configured into a <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum,</b> hand portable vacuum, air pump, floor polisher, and more. It can also be converted into a shampoo system for carpets and a sweeping, dusting, and mopping system for bare floors. [...] The characteristic chrome appearance is due to the bulk of the machine is assembled from aluminum, a tradition going back to the very early days of manufacture.|$|R
40|$|The NASA Long-Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), {{designed}} for the in situ testing of optical instrumentation in the space environment is described. The LDEF is basically a reusable structure which is three-axis gravity-gradient stabilized when flying free in space. The structure weighs about 8, 000 lbs. and accommodates experiment trays weighing about 10, 000 lbs. A <b>vacuum</b> exposure control <b>canister</b> is being {{designed for}} controlled exposure experiments. The LDEF will have an experiment power and data system and a shuttle bay environmental measurements system is being designed for measuring parameters such as acoustics, vibration, acceleration. The induced environment contamination monitor will evaluate the contamination levels of shuttle payloads. Experiments currently under development include the evaluation of active optical components {{and the study of}} fiber optic data transmission...|$|R
50|$|In 1968, {{parent company}} Scott & Fetzer {{acquired}} American-Lincoln, which also manufactured vacuum cleaners {{for commercial purposes}} called the Super Sweep with a 18 in brush roll. After the purchase, Kirby marketed the Janitronic, which was the Sanitronic without a removable carpet nozzle. In the 1980s, they also briefly offered a commercial model called the ComVac in three sizes, called the 1300, 1800 and the 2800. The commercial models were very basic and didn't come with the additional attachments or the shiny chrome appearance. When Scott & Fetzer sold American-Lincoln to McGraw-Edison in 1984, the commercial models were discontinued. In the 1920's, Kirby introduced their only <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner, called the Aer-Rotor. It was unsuccessful and was pulled from the market a few years later, but the ability to convert the Kirby into a canister is currently available due to its flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The company {{introduced}} <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{models in}} the 1930s. In the 1952, Regina introduced its more familiar stick model, the ElectrikBroom. During World War II, the company made bomb fuses. In the 1980s, CEO Donald D. Sheelen led a group of employees who purchased Regina for $38 Million in a leveraged buyout. Don Sheelen’s inventions cross the vacuum sphere from the basic vacuum cleaner to the steam cleaner. During the 90s, the Peanuts character Pig-Pen appeared in commercials. The “tools on board” idea, “cyclonic” vacuum technology, and the modern easy to use steam cleaner were all the brainchild of Don Sheelen. The Regina Company was eventually acquired by Philips Electronics in 1995. Oreck bought the company in 1997, and in 2000, it was sold to the Royal Corporation, which has sold the vacuums under the Home Depot brand ever since.|$|R
5000|$|Hardware Wars {{was written}} and {{directed}} by San Francisco native Ernie Fosselius and produced by Michael Wiese. It was structured as a mock movie trailer, and Fosselius even secured narration from veteran voice-over artist Paul Frees, who provided the voice work for the original Star Wars trailers. Fosselius capitalised on his budget limitations by using deliberately ridiculous household objects as props; spaceships were represented with such items as steam irons, toasters and cassette recorders, and the lightsaber of [...] "Fluke Starbucker" [...] was a flashlight. The characters, played by actors who were just as low-budget as the props, were also parodied in name and appearance; for example, Chewbacca the Wookiee was replaced by [...] "Chewchilla the Wookiee Monster," [...] an obvious Cookie Monster puppet, dyed brown, and Darth Vader's counterpart, [...] "Darph Nader," [...] wore a welding helmet that distorted his voice so much that no one could understand anything he said. Other notable characters include [...] "Ham Salad," [...] "Augie Ben Doggie," [...] "Princess Anne-Droid," [...] and the drones, [...] "" [...] (who resembles the Tin Woodman from The Wizard of Oz) and [...] "Arty Deco" [...] (an antique <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner).Upon completion, Scott Mathews vowed to never act in another film again, saying; [...] "I'm goin' out on top, baby!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{begins with}} the text [...] "Meanwhile [...] - [...] {{in another part of}} the galaxy [...] - [...] later that same day". A {{household}} steam iron flies through space, fleeing a toaster, which fires toast at it. Two robots named 4-Q-2 (who looks like the Tin Man from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz) and Arty-Deco (a <b>canister</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner), escape from the evil Empire. After launching from the ship (a cassette player) in an escape pod (a cassette tape), they land on a desert planet (a watermelon). They are found by young Fluke Starbucker (played by future multi-platinum award-winning music producer Scott Mathews) who finds a video message saved on Arty-Deco. It is a loop of Princess Anne-Droid saying [...] "Help me, Augie Ben Doggie, you're my only hope." [...] Upon meeting Augie [...] "Ben" [...] Doggie (of the venerable Red-Eye Knights), Fluke receives his father's lightsaber (a flashlight). After tricking the Imperial Steam Trooper guards (steam cabinets) to let them into the city, they reach a cantina, which Fluke describes as [...] "too weird". The cantina is a country-and-western bar, where they meet space renegade Ham Salad and Chewchilla the Wookiee Monster (a puppet that resembles Cookie Monster from Sesame Street). Meanwhile, the villainous Darph Nader is interrogating the Princess. When she refuses to talk (mainly because she can't understand him; his speech is muffled by his welder's mask), he destroys her peaceful home planet, Basketball.|$|R
