5|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>stars</b> have {{periodic}} or random {{changes in}} luminosity because of intrinsic or extrinsic properties. Of the intrinsically <b>variable</b> <b>stars,</b> the primary types can be subdivided into three principal groups.|$|E
5|$|Z And is the M-type {{prototype}} for its class of <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> It ranges in magnitude from {{a minimum of}} 12.4 {{to a maximum of}} 8.0. It is 2,720 light-years away.|$|E
5|$|During their stellar evolution, some stars {{pass through}} phases {{where they can}} become {{pulsating}} variables. Pulsating <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, {{depending on the size}} of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period variables such as Mira.|$|E

5|$|The final {{instrument}} was the HSP, {{designed and built}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a photometric accuracy of about 2% or better.|$|E
5|$|The {{globular}} cluster NGC 6584 lies near Theta Arae and is 45,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is an Oosterhoff type I cluster, and contains at least 69 <b>variable</b> <b>stars,</b> {{most of which}} are RR Lyrae variables. The planetary nebula IC 4699 is of 13th magnitude and lies midway between Alpha and Epsilon Telescopii.|$|E
5|$|Amateur astronomers {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy and {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.|$|E
5000|$|... 13 Boötis, {{also known}} by its <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> {{designation}} CF Boötis, is a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in the constellation Boötes. It is approximately 550 light-years from Earth, based on its parallax. 13 Boötis is a M-type red giant with a mean apparent magnitude of +5.26. It is classified as an irregular <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> and its brightness varies from magnitude +5.29 to +5.38.|$|R

50|$|U Orionis (abbreviated U Ori) is a Mira-type <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Orion. It is a classical long period <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> that has been well observed from the United Kingdom for over 120 years.|$|R
5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> {{are those}} that undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E
5|$|During {{a sabbatical}} year at Princeton University in 1960, Christy began an {{investigation}} of Cepheid variables and the smaller RR Lyrae variables, classes of luminous <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> At {{the time it was}} a mystery as to why they varied. He used the knowledge of the hydrodynamics of implosion gained at Los Alamos during the war to explain this phenomenon. This earned him the Royal Astronomical Society's Eddington Medal for contributions to theoretical astrophysics in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Many main {{sequence}} stars of spectral type A {{fall into a}} region of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram called the instability strip, which is occupied by pulsating <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> In 2003, photometric monitoring of the star revealed variations in brightness of around 1–2 millimagnitudes on frequencies between about 30 and 40 minutes. Radial velocity studies of Beta Pictoris also reveal variability: there are pulsations at two frequencies, one at 30.4 minutes and one at 36.9 minutes. As a result, the star is classified as a Delta Scuti variable.|$|E
5000|$|... 9 Andromedae (abbreviated 9 And) is a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Andromeda. 9 Andromedae is the Flamsteed designation. It also bears the <b>Variable</b> <b>star</b> designation AN Andromedae (AN And). Its apparent magnitude is 5.98.|$|R
5000|$|... σ CMa {{was noted}} as a likely <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in {{a list of}} bright {{southern}} stars studied at the Cape Observatory. The variability was confirmed in 1963, and it was formally catalogued as a <b>variable</b> <b>star.</b>|$|R
50|$|TX Camelopardalis (abbreviated TX Cam) is a Mira-type <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in the {{constellation}} Camelopardalis. It is a classical Long period <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> with pulsational period of 557.4 days. Water masers have been observed around the star.|$|R
5|$|When Robert Baker arrived he {{continued}} a photoelectric photometry program focusing on <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> He {{continued to use}} the 12-inch refractor until 1927 when a new photometer was constructed and attached it to the 30-inch reflector telescope in the Observatory annex. He supervised two graduate students who worked on this equipment in the early 1930s. On May 27, 1933 the star Arcturus provided light which fell onto a photo cell in the observatory's annex and sent a signal to open the Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects {{the upper part of}} the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars in this part of the instability strip that intersects {{the upper part of the}} main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.|$|E
50|$|After {{the star}} was {{discovered}} to be variable, it {{was assigned a}} <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> designation. As the 1809th <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> without a Bayer designation to be discovered in Cygnus, 68 Cygni was assigned the designation V1809 Cygni in 1984.|$|R

50|$|This star {{is a type}} M8V red dwarf. This star is {{also known}} for its very low luminosity, with an {{absolute}} magnitude of nearly 19, due to its very cool surface temperature of only 2600°K. It is a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> with the <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> catalog name V1298 Aquilae. This star is a UV Ceti type <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> also subject to flare events. It shares the large proper motion, along with the tendency to flare, with the primary star.|$|R
5|$|Capella {{has long}} been {{suspected}} to be slightly variable. Its amplitude of about 0.1 magnitudes means that it may at times be brighter or fainter than both Rigel and Vega, which are also slightly variable. The system has been classified as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a class of binary stars with active chromospheres that cause huge starspots, {{but it is still}} only listed as a suspected variable in the General Catalogue of <b>Variable</b> <b>Stars.</b> Unusually for RS CVn systems, the hotter star, Capella Ab, has the more active atmosphere because it is located in the Hertzsprung gap—a stage where it is changing its angular momentum and deepening its convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Located about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri, the {{prototype}} of a class of <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> called T Tauri stars. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between magnitude 9 to 13 {{over a period of}} weeks or months. This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a main sequence star. The surrounding reflection nebula NGC 1555 is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies Kappa Tauri, a visual double star consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Located {{mostly in}} Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud extends into Hydrus. The {{globular}} cluster NGC 1466 is an outlying {{component of the}} galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> It has a magnitude of 11.59 and {{is thought to be}} over 12 billion years old. Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. NGC 602 is composed of an emission nebula and a young, bright open cluster of stars that is an outlying component on {{the eastern edge of the}} Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.|$|E
25|$|R Draconis {{is a red}} Mira-type <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> with {{a period}} of about 8 months.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid <b>variable</b> <b>stars,</b> which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the Small Magellanic Cloud and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E
5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, the measure of {{the rate at which the}} universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Pavo {{contains}} several <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> of note. Lambda Pavonis is {{a bright}} irregular variable ranging between magnitudes 3.4 and 4.4; this variation can be observed with the unaided eye. Classed as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable or shell star, it is of spectral type B2II-IIIe and lies around 1430 light years distant from Earth. Kappa Pavonis is a W Virginis variable—a subclass of Type II Cepheid. It ranges from magnitude 3.91 to 4.78 over 9 days and is a yellow-white supergiant pulsating between spectral classes F5I-II and G5I-II. NU and V Pavonis are pulsating semiregular variable red giant stars. NU has a spectral type M6III and ranges from magnitude 4.9 to 5.3, while V Pavonis ranges from magnitude 6.3 to 8.2 over two periods of 225.4 and 3735 days concurrently. V is a carbon star of spectral type C6,4(Nb) with a prominent red hue.|$|E
50|$|V602 Car is a semiregular <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> with {{a maximum}} {{brightness}} range of magnitude 7.6 - 9.1 and a possible periods of 635 and 678 days. Despite the large amplitude of variation, it was only named as a <b>variable</b> <b>star</b> in 2006.|$|R
50|$|R Apodis is {{an orange}} K-type giant with an {{apparent}} magnitude of +5.38. It is approximately 370 light years from Earth.
