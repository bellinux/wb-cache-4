5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure</b> that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E
25|$|At Toyota’s Higashi-Fuji Technical Center, the Mirai {{has been}} {{subjected}} to extensive crash testing to evaluate a design specifically intended to address frontal, side and rear impacts and to provide excellent protection of vehicle occupants. A high level of collision safety has also been achieved to help protect the fuel cell stack and high-pressure tanks against body deformation. The high pressure hydrogen tanks have excellent hydrogen permeation prevention performance, strength, and durability. Hydrogen sensors provide warnings and can shut off tank main stop valves. The hydrogen tanks and other hydrogen-related parts are located outside the cabin to ensure that if hydrogen leaks, it will dissipate easily. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure</b> is enhanced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers from Toray and designed to disperse and absorb impact energy across multiple parts to ensure a high-impact safety performance that protects the Toyota FC Stack and high-pressure hydrogen tanks during frontal, side or rear impacts.|$|E

2500|$|On January 5, 2012, General Motors {{announced}} that it would offer a customer satisfaction program to provide modifications to the Chevrolet Volt to reduce the chance that the battery pack could catch fire days or weeks after a severe accident. General Motors explained the modifications will enhance the <b>vehicle</b> <b>structure</b> that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of the}} battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. On January 20, 2012, the NHTSA closed the Volt's safety defect investigation related to post-crash fire risk. The agency concluded that [...] "no discernible defect trend exists" [...] and also found that the modifications recently developed by General Motors are sufficient to reduce the potential for battery intrusion resulting from side impacts. The NHTSA also said that [...] "based on the available data, NHTSA does not believe that Chevy Volts or other electric vehicles pose a greater risk of fire than gasoline-powered vehicles." [...] The agency also announced it has developed interim guidance to increase awareness and identify appropriate safety measures regarding electric vehicles for the emergency response community, law enforcement officers, tow truck operators, storage facilities and consumers.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{difference}} between IIHS and NHTSA frontal crash testing, is the IIHS conducts an offset test where a smaller {{portion of the}} <b>vehicle's</b> <b>structure</b> absorbs {{the energy of the}} crash. This type of crash test is more demanding on the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>structure,</b> while the full frontal crash test is more demanding on the vehicle's restraint systems. Both IIHS and NHTSA frontal impact tests can only be compared among vehicles of similar weights.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevention}} of interactions of children or child restraints with other <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures</b> {{is critical to}} child passenger safety.

40|$|Abstract. Heave {{and pitch}} motions of road <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures</b> affect the comfort {{and the safety}} of passengers. Excitation of these {{vertical}} vibrations is due to road surface roughness. Road <b>vehicle</b> <b>structures</b> are modelled as mechanical systems characterized by their inertia, damping and stiffness, and represented as state equa-tions. This paper deals with the influence of random road profiles on the vertical dynamics of road vehicles characterized by stochastic processes. Switching from road profile displacement to road profile velocity results in white noise excitation facilitating mathematical analysis. Some fundamentals of power spectral density analysis and covariance analysis are reviewed. A quarter car model is used to show the advantages of the covariance analysis resulting immediately in standard varia-tions characterizing the vehicle’s performance...|$|R
