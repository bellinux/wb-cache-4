25|$|Those with {{damage to}} {{regions of the}} brain {{involved}} in visual processing, such as the occipital lobes, may develop amnesia.

When life events or episodic memories are encoded in the brain, they are in the form of pictures or <b>visual</b> <b>images.</b> They develop amnesia since they can no longer bring these <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> of the past to mind.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} GCC companies' use of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> to interplay modernity and globalism with tradition, Islam and local culture. The {{analysis}} aims to bring attention to the way that businesses in the GCC use <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> to engage with or influence debates in their societies concerning the tension between modernity, globalisation and traditional values in the Arab-Islamic world. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is critical and discursive and based on a close reading of the <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> reported in the 2005 annual reports of companies listed on GCC stock markets. Findings – The analysis suggests that GCC companies on many occasions used <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> to depict and represent {{the possibility of a}} successful profitable, modern and global business that is also sympathetic to tradition and operates within the framework of Islamic principles. Originality/value – While <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> are increasingly used in companies' annual reports they have been largely ignored in accounting research. Furthermore, when this research manifests, it has been concerned with investigating Anglo-American and Western contexts. This paper instead emphasises the significance of researching the use of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> in a variety of contexts and locations. It critically and contextually explores the use of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> in a largely unexplored, non-Western and a significantly Islamic context.

5|$|Dearly Stars {{is a life}} {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player assumes the role of one of three pop idols at a time: Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani or Ryō Akizuki. An idol's statistics are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and <b>visual</b> <b>image.</b> As these increase, an idol's overall image level will also increase. The game is largely divided into two modes: a story mode which encompasses normal gameplay, and a separate stage mode for performing songs outside of the story mode. At the start of every in-game week on Monday, the player is shown current popularity trends in vocal, dance and <b>visual</b> <b>image</b> ranked first, second and third in popularity. This gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity by augmenting an idol's statistics via the choice of song they will perform and what costumes they wear during an audition. Also on Monday, the player is first given the option to choose which costume and accessories to wear for performances, and to choose one of the available songs. Each costume, accessory and song have either a vocal, dance or visual attribute. The player can also modify the choreography and camera positioning used during performances at this time.|$|E

25|$|Even {{what we hear}} must be {{attached}} to a <b>visual</b> <b>image.</b> To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E

Phillips and McQuarrie (2004) categorize <b>visual</b> rhetorical <b>images</b> into two dimensions: meaning operation and visual structure.

40|$|AbstractIn the Malaysian {{education}} system, {{attention is}} highly paid on reading words. <b>Visual</b> <b>images</b> are often treated as “decoration”, or are dismissed altogether (Kress & Leeuwen, 1996). Many local researchers (Saedah 1990, Bahiyah et al., 2008) have only analysed written texts {{to see how}} social practices deemed negative such as gender biasness {{are reflected in the}} words (lexical items) and linguistic structures. Currently, no systematic research has been undertaken in Malaysia to analyse <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> in English language school textbooks to study how <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> can reflect gender biasness. This research project addresses gender biasness found in <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> in school textbooks, i. e., the treatment of one gender over the other especially of women and girls. The project adopts three widely used approaches for analyzing visual images; content, socio semiotic and ethno-methodology analyses. This paper will however highlight its preliminary analysis focusing on image analysis based on participation, gender and representational meanings. Its aim is to identify the types of images and the representation of gender biasness and stereotyping found in the textbook. The preliminary findings should expose the sexism and gender biasness in the <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> of a sampled textbook; i. e. an English school textbook that is abound with <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> that sometimes, more so than written texts, can articulate more forcefully social and cultural meanings...|$|R
25|$|Numan {{subsequently}} {{issued a}} series of albums and singles on his own record label, Numa. The first album released on Numa, 1984's Berserker was also notable for being Numan's first foray into music computers/samplers, {{in this case the}} PPG Wave. Berserker moved away from the fluid, fretless sound that characterised Numan's previous three albums, featuring instead harder-edged electric bass and drum sounds. The album was also accompanied by a new blue-and-white <b>visual</b> <b>image</b> (including Numan himself with blue hair), a tour, a live album/video/EP, and the title track reached the UK Top 40 when released as a single. Despite this, the album divided critics and fans and commercially it was Numan's least successful release to that point.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually navigate to a previously visited location. Visual memory {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a <b>visual</b> <b>image</b> after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.|$|E

We have analysed works that were produced by different authors in the 1970 and 1980 decades: Sérgio Buarque de Holanda, Antonio José Borges Hermida, Gilberto Cotrim and Álvaro Duarte Alencar. We acknowledge that as from the 1970 decade it was established new editorial patterns for the didactic History books, which altered the ways of presentation of written texts towards the <b>visual</b> <b>images.</b> The different procedures of reading the <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> established until then, constituted editorial and scholar knowledge that served as theorical and procedural basis {{for the development of}} proposes that emerged on the didactic works produced on the decades afterwards. We expect to contribute with this study for the construction of <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> reading practices that make possible the flow, the understanding and the contextualization of information that relate the usage of visual documents in the teaching of History. We look for the empowerment of the didactic procedures of reading that allows the construction, by teachers and students, of pluridimensional interpretations about the <b>visual</b> <b>images</b> as historical documents...|$|R
