Furthermore, his role as Principal Investigator of the Pioneer <b>Venus</b> Working <b>Group</b> on Structure and Circulation in the late 1970 's and early 1980 's was instrumental in the advancement of our understanding of Venus' atmosphere.

In addition, recent results on convectively generated internal gravity waves will be presented that combine his lifelong, interest in both large-scale and small-scale dynamics. It will be shown that small-scale internal gravity waves generated by convection within the clouds of Venus decelerate the westward superrotation below the clouds. Thus, mechanisms that support the Venus westward superrotation must overcome the influence of small-scale dynamics in the lower atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Probe Missions to the Giant Planets, Titan and VenusSixth International Planetary Probe WorkshopIntroduction: To assess the feasibility and potential technology needs of a future planned Venus Flagship class mission, NASA is funding a mission study in this fiscal year (FY 08). Such a mission was recommended in NASA's 2006 Solar System Exploration Roadmap [1] and in the NRC SSE Decadal Survey [2]. The final mission architecture is required to be in line with the primary science goals and objectives, as defined in the <b>Venus</b> Exploration Analysis <b>Group</b> (VEXAG) White Paper [3], and enabled by suitable extreme environments technologies [4]. In order to assist the Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) for this year's study, an initial assessment was performed at JPL during the summer of 2007 [5], evaluating 17 potential mission architectures. Science requirements focused the architectures to near surface in situ missions only. Consequently, the studied architectures were bound by a New Frontiers (medium) class short lived surface mission concept at one end, working towards a future large Flagship class Venus Surface Sample Return (VSSR) mission at the other end, and through a number of architectures at various levels of complexities and corresponding cost levels. In this paper we outline the findings of last summer's study, including the recommended 3 key mission architecture groups - i. e., landers, mobile platforms, and geophysical networks - and link them to the final mission architecture from this year's study.

Upper Paleolithic art {{can be divided into}} two broad categories: figurative art such as cave paintings that clearly depicts animals (or more rarely humans); and nonfigurative, which consists of shapes and symbols.

The anthropologist David Lewis-Williams has suggested that Paleolithic cave paintings were indications of shamanistic practices, because the paintings of half-human, half-animal paintings and the remoteness of the caves are reminiscent of modern hunter-gatherer shamanistic practices.

Yet, as amply demonstrated in the past – with, for example, fundamental revelations on the importance of the greenhouse effect and the terrestrial ozone hole – Venus has a lot to teach us about how planetary atmospheres, including the Earth, work and evolve. A primary hindrance to understanding the world next door is its perpetual veil of clouds that greatly obscures views of the deep atmosphere except over a small range of near-infrared wavelengths. In-situ techniques are invaluable tools in filling this observational gap, allowing accurate measurements of salient atmospheric parameters such as pressure, temperature, winds...|$|R

The Serb then saved two break points in the next game but Venus seized her chance when the a third opportunity arose breaking the Janković serve, pounding away a forehand. It was enough for Venus to level the match. The third set saw Janković take an early lead as she rallied to a 2-0 lead only for Venus to take the next 3 games. Janković then fought back and broke to level it at 3-3, only for Venus to reestablish the break. Venus served at 5-4 for the match.

40|$|Venus, {{as part of}} {{the inner}} triad with Earth and Mars, {{represents}} an important exploration target if we {{want to learn more about}} solar system formation and evolution. Comparative planetology could also elucidate the differences between the past, present, and future of these three planets, and can help with the characterization of potential habitable zones in our solar system and, by extension, extrasolar systems. A long lived in situ Venus mission concept, called the Venus Mobile Explorer, was prominently featured in NASA's 2006 SSE Roadmap and supported in the community White Paper by the <b>Venus</b> Exploration Analysis <b>Group</b> (VEXAG). Long-lived in situ missions are expected to belong to the largest (Flagship) mission class, which would require both enabling and enhancing technologies beside mission architecture options. Furthermore, extreme environment mitigation technologies for Venus are considered long lead development items and are expected to require technology development through a dedicated program. To better understand programmatic and technology needs and the motivating science behind them, in this fiscal year (FY 08) NASA is funding a Venus Flaghip class mission study, based on key science and technology drivers identified by a NASA appointed Venus Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT). These mission drivers are then assembled around a suitable mission architecture to further refine technology and cost elements.

40|$|Surprisingly {{little is}} known about Venus, our {{neighboring}} sister planet in the solar system, due to the challenges of operating in its extremely hot, corrosive, and dense environment. For example, after over two dozen missions to the planet, the longest-lived lander was the Soviet Venera 13, and it only survived two hours on the surface. Several conceptual Venus mission studies have been formulated {{in the past two decades}} proposing lander architectures that potentially extend lander lifetime. Most recently, the Venus Science and Technology Definition Team (STDT) was commissioned by NASA to study a Venus Flagship Mission potentially launching in the 2020 - 2025 time-frame; the reference lander of this study is designed to survive for only a few hours more than Venera 13 launched back in 1981 ! Since Cytherean mission planners lack a viable approach to a long-lived surface architecture, specific scientific objectives outlined in the National Science Foundation Decadal Survey and <b>Venus</b> Exploration Advisory <b>Group</b> final report cannot be completed. These include: mapping the mineralogy and composition of the surface on a planetary scale determining the age of various rock samples on Venus, searching for evidence of changes in interior dynamics (seismometry) and its impact on climate and many other key observations that benefit with time scales of at least a full Venus day (Le. daylight/night cycle). This report reviews those studies and recommends a hybrid lander architecture that can survive for at least one Venus day (243 Earth days) by incorporating selective Stirling multi-stage active cooling and hybrid thermoacoustic power...|$|R
