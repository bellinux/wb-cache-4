40|$|International audienceBackgroundData {{describing}} the epidemiology {{and management of}} <b>viral</b> acute diarrhea (<b>AD)</b> in adults are scant. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the incidence, clinical characteristics, management and risk factors of winter <b>viral</b> <b>AD</b> in adults. MethodsThe incidence of AD in adults during two consecutive winters (from December 2010 to April 2011 and from December 2011 to April 2012) was estimated from the French Sentinelles network. During these two winters, a subset of Sentinelles general practitioners (GPs) identified and included adult patients who presented with AD and who filled out a questionnaire and returned a stool specimen for virological examination. All stool specimens were tested for astrovirus, group A rotavirus, human enteric adenovirus, and norovirus of genogroup I and genogroup II. Age- and sex-matched controls were included to permit a case¿control analysis with the aim of identifying risk factors for <b>viral</b> <b>AD.</b> ResultsDuring the studied winters, the average incidence of AD in adults was estimated to be 3, 158 per 100, 000 French adults (95 % CI [2, 321 ¿ 3, 997]). The most reported clinical signs were abdominal pain (91. 1 %), watery diarrhea (88. 5 %), and nausea (83. 3 %). GPs prescribed a treatment in 95 % of the patients with AD, and 80 % of the working patients with AD could not go to work. Stool examinations were positive for at least one enteric virus in 65 % (95 % CI [57 ¿ 73]) of patients with AD with a predominance of noroviruses (49 %). Having been in contact with a person who has suffered from AD in the last 7  days, whether within or outside the household, and having a job (or being a student) were risk factors significantly associated with acquiring <b>viral</b> <b>AD.</b> ConclusionsDuring the winter, <b>AD</b> of <b>viral</b> origin is a frequent disease in adults, and noroviruses are most often the cause. No preventable risk factor was identified other than contact with a person with AD. Thus, at the present time, reinforcement of education related to hand hygiene remains the only way to reduce the burden of disease...|$|R

50|$|Reply {{marketing}} (or {{direct response}} marketing), {{is a form}} of viral marketing where an advertiser/marketer replies directly to an end-user with an advertisement or a personalized message. It is a means of marketing designed to generate an immediate response from consumers, where each consumer response can be measured, and later attributed to the corresponding advertising channel. Television, radio, social media, search engine marketing, print, phone, internet, and mail serve as the typical channels for this type of advertisement, with e-mail being the most effective form of direct response. It was first introduced in 2010 by Old Spice, with its well-known <b>viral</b> <b>ads</b> featuring actor Isaiah Mustafa. Mustafa, though, replied to numerous potential users simultaneously via an amusing video on YouTube. Recipients were persons who were commenting about various videos via Twitter.|$|E
5000|$|Viral {{advertising}} is personal and, while coming from an identified sponsor, {{it does not}} mean businesses pay for its distribution. Most of the well-known <b>viral</b> <b>ads</b> circulating online are ads paid by a sponsor company, launched either on their own platform (company webpage or social media profile) or on social media websites such as YouTube. Consumers receive the page link from a social media network or copy the entire ad from a website and pass it along through e-mail or posting it on a blog, webpage or social media profile. Viral marketing may take the form of video clips, interactive Flash games, advergames, ebooks, brandable software, images, text messages, email messages, or web pages. The most commonly utilized transmission vehicles for viral messages include: pass-along based, incentive based, trendy based, and undercover based. However, the creative nature of viral marketing enables an [...] "endless amount of potential forms and vehicles the messages can utilize for transmission", including mobile devices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} advertising {{images of}} fashion brands in {{vertical social network}} site (SNS) from the viewpoints of message strategies. Vertical social network sites are types of social curation systems applied to social networking, where information is selected, organized, and maintained. Fashion brands communicate with consumers by presenting images on vertical SNSs, anticipating improvements in brand image, popularity, and loyalty. Those images portray content for particular brands and seasonal concepts, thus creating paths for product sales information. Marketing via SNSs corresponds to relationship marketing, which refers to long-term interrelationship and value augmentation between the company and consumer, and viral advertising, which relies on word of mouth distribution via social network platforms. Taylor’s six-segment message strategy wheel, often used for analyzing <b>viral</b> <b>ads,</b> was applied to conduct a content analysis of the images. A total of 2, 656 images of fashion brands advertised on Instagram were selected and analyzed. Results indicated that brand values were somewhat related {{to the number of}} followers. Follower rankings and comment rankings were also correlated. In general, fashion brands projected sensory messages most often. Acute need and rational messages were less common than other messages. Sports brands and luxury brands presented sensory messages, whereas fast fashion brands projected routine images most often. Fashion brands promoted on vertical SNSs should portray advertising images that combine message strategies. ? ??? 2014 ? ????? ????? ???? ?????(201400000002535) ...|$|E

The video won a Grand Prix in both the cyber and film categories at Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in 2007. In Sketches, released in 2013, a sketch artist draws women based on self-descriptions and descriptions from other women to compare their distorted views of themselves with how others view them.

50|$|Due to the {{aberrant}} codon {{usage of}} C. albicans {{it is less}} feasible to use the common host organism (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for two-hybrid studies. To overcome this problem a Candida albicans two-hybrid (C2H) system was created. The strain SN152 that is auxotrophic for leucine, arginine and histidine was used to create this C2H system. It was adapted by integrating a HIS1 reporter gene preceded by five LexAOp sequences.In the C2H system the bait plasmid (pC2HB) contains the staphylococcus aureus LexA BD, while the prey plasmid (pC2HP) harbors the <b>viral</b> <b>AD</b> VP16. Both plasmids are integrative plasmids since episomal plasmids do not stay stable in C. albicans. The reporter gene used in the system is the HIS1 gene.

The empirical study showed that the ad did not go viral and did not include and display all the attributes proposed by the Model.

30|$|In essence, viral {{marketing}} {{is a process}} of influence diffusion over social networks. An effective {{viral marketing}} campaign requires that marketers identify individuals with high social networking potential. A general setting can be depicted as follows: a company would like to market a new product, in the hopes that it would be adopted by {{as many people as possible}} in a target social network. The company chooses a small number of influential individuals as the initial adopters/seeds by giving them free/discounted samples of the product and encourages them to recommend the product to their friends, hoping that their friends would be influenced to purchase the product, then influence their friends, and so on. As a result, the influence would propagate through the network and trigger widespread adoption in the end of the diffusion process. Viral marketing is termed to describe such a marketing technique that induces the users in a social network to pass on a marketing message (<b>viral</b> <b>ad)</b> to others so as to achieve the largest influence spread in terms of product sales or brand awareness.|$|R
