These included activated carbons produced from novel precursors, namely rapeseed, <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> and kenaf, and samples oxidised with nitric acid in liquid phase. The results {{have shown the}} significant potential of rapeseed, <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> and kenaf for the activated carbon production. The activated carbons produced by carbon dioxide activation were mainly microporous with BET apparent surface area up to 1224 m 2 g- 1 and pore volume 0. 5 cm 3 g- 1. The effects of concentration and pH were studied. The phenol adsorption isotherms at 25 ºC followed the Freundlich model with maximum adsorption capacities of approximately 80 mgg- 1 and 60 mgg- 1 for the pristine and oxidised activated carbons, respectively. The influence of pH on the phenol adsorption has two trends for pH smaller and bigger than 10. The maximum adsorption capacity of mercury adsorption onto activated carbon made from <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> reaches 1103 mgg- 1.

40|$|Every year {{thousands}} of tonnes of biomass {{waste in the}} form of pruned <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> are produced in the Spanish region of La Rioja. This study, {{the first of its kind}} to be conducted in the region, examines how this waste can be valorised, mainly as an energy source. Representative samples were taken from the different varieties and vineyards in the region. Each batch of samples was then chemically characterised to learn its moisture content, percentage of ash, composition in terms of elements and heating power. The influence of various factors on these chemical properties was analysed. Only two factors proved to be of statistically significant importance: variety and training method. The expected performance in combustion of <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> of the region's predominant variety, Tempranillo, was estimated. Undoubted advantages were found, such as a significantly higher heating value (16 900 kJ/kg), moderate quantities of ash, medium aerosol emission rates, no expected problems of corrosion due to S or Cl, and a very low heavy metal content. In actual collection conditions, thermal energy from <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> after chopping (to between 30 and 100 mm), with a moisture content of less than 20 %, would cost 2. 45 euro cents/kWh to produce.

25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the ripening process cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of the grapevine but also how the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that the grapevine can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, but too much leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as bunch rot and powdery mildew which can hamper the ripening process. A very vigorous vine with many clusters and <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> on the <b>vine</b> but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the ripening process.|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{agri-food}} industry {{has resulted in a}} strong increase in its sludge generation. This type of waste is often produced in high amounts, concentrated in certain areas, and shows characteristics similar to those of municipal sewage sludge (except for the absence of heavy metals). Composting has been widely studied as a viable alternative for the treatment and recycling of municipal sewage sludge, but little information is currently available concerning the composting of agri-food sludge. Thus, the aim of this work was to increase our knowledge of how the vegetable-derived sludge produced by the agri-food sector can be managed using different co-composting strategies. The work was concerned mainly with the characteristics of the bulking agents used (type and particle size) and their effects {{on the development of the}} process and on the potential added value of the composts obtained. For this, four composting piles were prepared using agri-food sludge and two bulking agents (<b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> prunings and pepper plant pruning waste) at two particle sizes (< 1 cm and < 3 cm). The evolution of the process and the final properties of the composts obtained were studied using classical analytical methods together with advanced instrumental methods (thermal analysis and excitation–emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy). In addition, their physical characteristics and potential suppression of phytopathogens (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis) were determined. The results showed differences according to the type and size of bulking agent, the mixtures with <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> prunings having a higher biodegradability, which was confirmed by thermogravimetry and EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. Melon plants grown in a mixture which included compost produced using vine pruning waste had a greater shoot weight than those grown on peat alone, while the mixture including compost derived from pepper pruning waste gave a shoot weight similar to that of peat-grown plants. Furthermore, the composts elaborated using <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> prunings had added value with respect to their use as growing media components for seedling production of melon, due to their suppression of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis. Therefore, this study has shown that the nature of the bulking agent used is of major importance not only for the development of the composting process, but also for the final properties and potential added value of the end-products obtained.

40|$|Biocomposites {{reinforced}} with lignocellulosic fillers is gaining {{more and more}} interest in different industries. The cheapest and most environmentally virtuous lignocellulosic fillers are those obtained from either agricultural, forestry or food industries wastes and by-products. It is now well-known that functional properties of composite materials are mainly related to the intrinsic properties each constituent, the filler content and the dispersion state and the properties at the filler/matrix interface. However, modify only one criterion often generates structural changes of either the matrix or the filler, resulting in a tricky understanding of reinforcing effects. To better understand structure/properties relationships in biocomposites the production of lignocellulosic fillers with controlled and contrasted characteristics is essential. Additionally, properties of fillers are generally system-dependant due to the variability of both structure and composition of lignocellulosic biomass (Montano et al., 2013; Berthet et al., 2015). Previous work {{has shown that the}} size and the surface hydrophobicity of wheat straw particles can be controlled by combining dry grinding and sorting processes (Montano et al., 2013).

50|$|Phototropism is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs.

Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called negative phototropism (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism, although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them.
