40|$|Detailed {{simulations}} of microwave limb sounding {{in the presence}} of ice clouds have been performed. It is clarified that, while particle absorption normally gives no significant change of the measured radiance for down-looking measurements, {{this is not the case}} for limb sounding. The particles were treated as horizontally aligned oblate spheroids and for this assumption on particle shape, and comparable situations, no significant degree of circular polarisation is generated. Differences between the brightness temperature of the ± 45 ° polarisation components up to 4 K were found, but this difference appears to be small as long as single scattering conditions apply. The cloud extinction is the smallest for the <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>component,</b> but it should be more beneficial to observe any of the ± 45 ° and circularly polarised components if ice water content is also a target of the retrievals. These latter pairs of orthogonal components also make it easier to combine information measured from different positions and with different polarisations. The results indicate that single scattering can be assumed for cloud optical thicknesses below about 0. 1, which is thus an important threshold with respect to the complexity and accuracy of retrievals. The representation of particle sizes during the retrieval is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Microwave limb {{sounding}} {{in the presence}} of ice clouds was studied by detailed simulations, where clouds and other atmospheric variables varied in three dimensions and the full polarisation state was considered. Scattering particles were assumed to be horizontally aligned oblate spheroids with a size distribution parameterized in terms of temperature and ice water content. A general finding was that particle absorption is significant for {{limb sounding}}, which is in contrast to the down-looking case, where it is usually insignificant. Another general finding was that single scattering can be assumed for cloud optical paths below about 0. 1, which is thus an important threshold with respect to the complexity and accuracy of retrieval algorithms. The representation of particle sizes during the retrieval is also discussed. Concerning polarisation, specific findings were as follows: Firstly, no significant degree of circular polarisation was found for the considered particle type. Secondly, for the +/- 45 degrees polarisation components, differences of up to 4 K in brightness temperature were found, but differences were much smaller when single scattering conditions applied. Thirdly, the <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>component</b> has the smallest cloud extinction. An important goal {{of the study was to}} derive recommendations for future limb sounding instruments, particularly concerning their polarisation setup. If ice water content is among the retrieval targets (and not just trace gas mixing ratios), then the simulations show that it should be best to observe any of the +/- 45 degrees and circularly polarised components. These pairs of orthogonal components also make it easier to combine information measured from different positions and with different polarisations...|$|E

Fast magnetoacoustic {{waves in}} curved coronal loops are {{investigated}} {{and the role}} of lateral leakage in wave damping, which includes the mechanism of wave tunneling, is explored. Methods. A coronal loop is modeled as a curved, magnetic slab in the zero plasma-β limit. In this model and for an arbitrary piece-wise continuous power law equilibrium density profile, the wave equation governing linear <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> fast magnetoacoustic waves is solved analytically. An associated dispersion relation is derived and the frequencies and eigenfunctions of the wave modes are characterised. Results. For some equilibria, the waves are shown to be all damped due to lateral leakage. It is demonstrated that waves either leak straight out into the external medium or have to overcome an evanescent barrier, which is linked to wave tunneling. The wave solutions consist of alternating <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> kink and sausage branches. Fast kink oscillations may have a non-zero density perturbation when averaged across the loop. The calculated damping rate of fast magnetoacoustic kink oscillations is shown to be consistent with related numerical simulations and show that lateral leakage may explain the observed damping of (<b>vertically</b> <b>polarised)</b> fast magnetoacoustic kink oscillations. ...|$|R

It is found that the application of pre-stress has a significant effect on the band structure, allowing stop bands to be controlled. The sensitivity of the choice of constitutive behaviour is studied and it is shown that the fundamental shear wave mode is largely unchanged for the class of strain energy functions considered here, whereas the compressional mode is considerably more sensitive to this choice...|$|R
