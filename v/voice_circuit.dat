5000|$|Each Combat Crew has a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> {{called the}} Hardened Voice Channel which links the five Combat Crews (LCCs) that {{comprise}} the squadron. There is also a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> called the EWO (Emergency War Order) which links the squadron command posts (one {{of which is the}} wing CP). These two voice circuits work like a party line with all LCCs connected simultaneously. Thus, it is not possible for any of the Combat Crews to have private conversations. The term [...] "EWO" [...] used here is {{not to be confused with}} an actual Emergency War Order message from the National Command Authority.

50|$|Manned missions, {{beginning}} with Project Mercury in 1958, demanded a real-time <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> {{in addition to}} data circuits, and improved reliability. Specifications for the Mercury Network were issued on May 21, 1959, establishing a baseline with a mission control center in Cape Canaveral (later Houston), data convergence at Goddard, and switching stations overseas to provide redundancy and trunking over expensive transoceanic cables. These decisions would shape NASCOM for years to follow.|$|E

50|$|Squawk Box is a {{business}} news television program that airs at breakfast time on the CNBC network. The program is currently co-hosted by Joe Kernen, Rebecca Quick, and Andrew Ross Sorkin. Since debuting in 1995, the show has spawned a number of versions across CNBC's international channels, many of which employ a similar format. The program title originates from a term used in investment banks and stock brokerages for a permanent <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> or intercom used to communicate stock deals or sales priorities; it also may refer to the squawk of a bird, like a peacock, which is the logo of CNBC.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1911, {{telephone}} networks used {{frequency-division multiplexing}} to carry several voice channels {{on a single}} physical circuit, beginning with the first Type C carrier in that year, which heterodyned three voice channels stacked {{on top of one}} <b>voice</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] L-carrier systems were loaded by multiplexing and supermultiplexing single sideband channels, using the long-standard 12 channel voice [...] "group" [...] produced by Type A channel banks, occupying a frequency spectrum between 60 and 108 kHz. This basic [...] "group" [...] was the entire line spectrum on previous long haul carrier systems, such as Types J and K. The first Type A-1 channel banks appeared for use on Type J open wire carrier in 1934. [...] It was the work of the aforementioned Espenschied and Herman Affel of Bell Labs who patented their piezoelectric crystal [...] "lattice" [...] filters to provide sharp bandpass cutoff that made all single-sideband carrier work developed at Bell Labs possible. Such [...] "lattice" [...] filters were the heart of all analog multiplex systems using single-sideband/carrier suppressed architecture until active IC-based filtering became available in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5000|$|On {{telecommunications}} circuits, disambiguation is {{a critical}} function of voice procedure. Due to any number of variables, including radio static, a busy or loud environment, or similarity in the phonetics of different words, a critical piece of information can be misheard or misunderstood; for instance, a pilot being ordered to eleven thousand as opposed to seven thousand. To reduce ambiguity, critical information may be broken down and read as separate letters and numbers. To avoid error or misunderstanding, pilots will often read back altitudes {{in the tens of}} thousands using both separate numbers and the single word (example: given a climb to 10,000 ft, the pilot replies [...] "Callsign climbing to One zero, Ten Thousand"). However, this is usually only used to differentiate between 10,000 and 11,000 ft since these are the most common altitude deviations. The runway number read visually as eighteen, when read over a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> as part of an instruction, becomes one eight. In some cases a spelling alphabet is used (also called a radio alphabet or a phonetic alphabet). Instead of the letters AB, the words Alpha Bravo are used. Main Street becomes Mike Alpha India November street, clearly separating it from Drain Street and Wayne Street. The numbers 5 and 9 are pronounced [...] "fife" [...] and [...] "niner" [...] respectively, since [...] "five" [...] and [...] "nine" [...] can sound the same over the radio. The use of 'niner' in place of 'nine' is due to German-speaking NATO allies for whom the spoken word 'nine' could be confused with the German word 'nein' or 'no'.|$|E

40|$|This paper makes a {{case for}} {{compiling}} {{a new set of}} industry statistics based upon MiTT [...] minutes of telecommunications traffic. For most countries, telecommunication flows are a statistical 'lack hole'. Annual reports are the rule; there is no common unit of account; and data on traffic flows is rarely disaggregated. To help remedy this situation it is proposed here that MiTT be adopted as a standard unit of account to log flows over circuits of common bandwidth. The regular compilation of MiTT statistics is viewed as having broad public and private benefits. They include the potential of MiTT to serve as a new economic indicator for tracking the general business cycle. A statistical analysis of year-on-year changes in public <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> MiTT from the UK, USA and Singapore is presented in support of this thesis. ...|$|E

40|$|On August 12, 1960, Echo I, a 100 -foot-diameter spherical balloon, {{was placed}} in orbit around the earth by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The {{objective}} was to demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance communication by microwave reflection from a satellite. A two-way coast-to-coast <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> was to be established between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) facility in California and a station provided by Bell Telephone Laboratories (STL) in New Jersey. Similar tests were also planned with the Naval Research Laboratory and other stations. This paper describes the general organization and operation of the Holmdel, New Jersey, station, and discusses {{the results of the}} experiments performed between the balloon launching and March 1, 1961. Successful voice communication was achieved through a variety of modulation methods including frequency modulation with feedback, amplitude modulation, single-sideband modulation, and narrow-band phase modulation.

40|$|Telephone calls routed via {{satellite}} involve long transmission paths which in rurn require significant trans-mission times {{even at the}} speed of light. This transmission time produces a delay in speech transmission of about 0. 3 seconds in each direction for a synchronous satellite. Although the delay itself is not usuaIIy noticed by the talkers, it significantly increases the disturbing effects of echo and mutilation of speech by the echo suppressors so that the overall quality of the circuit, as judged by the users, sufers. The advent of satellite telephoning has brought with it some interesting and challenging questions about the measurement of telephone transmission quality. The traditional measures of <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> quality of signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, dis-tortion, etc., are not adequate to fully evaluate this new type of circuit. Indeed it seems clear that satellite circuits will be quite satisfactory in all of these standard measures of circuit quality and yet a potential problem remains. The problem is tha...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1980 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaAn {{experimental}} Canadian UHF shipborne {{satellite communications}} terminal {{was designed to}} gather the necessary data and experience prior to the possible development by Canadian industry of an operational terminal {{for use by the}} Canadian Forces, Maritime Element. Such equipment would provide a UHF satellite communications capability onboard the destroyers and frigates of the Canadian Forces. Described in the paper are the experimental terminal developed at the Communications Research Centre as well as the experience obtained (to date) through its use. In the design of the prototype terminal, flexibility and interoperability with allied forces was of prime importance. The UHF equipment developed has been used with the FLTSATCOM satellite both with high data rate, TDM-formatted signals in a single 25 kHz FLTSATCOM channel as well as with low rate single teletype signals operating near the channel edges. The terminal has the capability of transmitting either MSK or PSK signals derived from a time division multiplex of several baseband data signals. This multiplexing is performed by a programmable microcomputer-based multiplexer/demultiplexer which can supply various mixes of clear voice, secure voice, data and teletype circuits.
