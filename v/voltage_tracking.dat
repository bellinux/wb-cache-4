40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an adaptive feedback linearizing controller {{design for a}} highorder model of a synchronous machine/infinite bus power system. The power system is modelled as an input-output nonlinear discrete-time system. Two neural networks are used to approximate this model. In this framework, a simple linear controller (which is itself not a neural network), is designed. The controller adaptively calculates an appropriate feedback linearizing control law at each sampling instant by utilizing plant parameter estimates provided by the neural system model; the control system adapts itself on-line by using the error between the plant output and the neural model output. This approach avoids the requirement for exact knowledge of the plant and full state measurement {{as well as other}} di#culties associated with implementing analytical input-output feedback linearizing control for a complex power system model. Two designs for power system control are presented. The first is an excitation controller for the synchronous machine which achieves the goal of good reference <b>voltage</b> <b>tracking</b> with bounded state. The second design implements a neural excitation controller/power system stabilizer which achieves the dual objective of good <b>voltage</b> <b>tracking</b> and stabilization of the machine rotor angle.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} {{investigation}} {{is the development}} of method for improving the stability of tonal track circuits that takes into account the actual insulation resistance (ballast resistance) of rail line. Methodology. To achieve the research purpose it was proposed to automatically determine the insulation resistance of rail line, and depending on this value to adjust the output <b>voltage</b> of <b>track</b> generator. Ballast resistance is determined by the value of input resistance the rail line, which at high frequencies practically is equal to the wave impedance. To implement the proposed method it is necessary to connect to the track circuit additional high-frequency generators, high-frequency filters, unit for finding the ballast resistance and adjusting the output <b>voltage</b> of <b>track</b> generator. Findings. As a result of research it was found that at low values (less than 2 Ohms*km) the change of ballast resistance causes significant change of <b>voltage</b> at the <b>track</b> receiver input, which may cause malfunction of the track circuit. Increasing the length of rail line leads to the reducing of its input resistance, raising the measuring frequency causes increasing the input resistance. In both cases, the input resistance tends to the value of the wave impedance. The measuring frequency should be chosen taking into account the length of rail line and the upper limit of ballast resistance, the value 5 Ohms*km can be taken as that limit. At higher values of ballast resistance its changes insignificantly influence the input <b>voltage</b> of <b>track</b> receiver. In this case, the adaptive adjustment of <b>voltage</b> at the <b>track</b> generator output is not performed. Originality.
