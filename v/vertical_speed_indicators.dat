50|$|A pilot {{aiming for}} a 500-foot per minute descent, for example, may find himself {{descending}} too rapidly. He begins to apply up elevator until the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> shows 500 feet per minute. However, because the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> lags the actual <b>vertical</b> <b>speed,</b> the pilot is actually descending at much less than 500 feet per minute. The pilot then begins applying down elevator until the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> reads 500 feet per minute, starting the cycle over. It's harder than it might seem to stabilize the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> because the airspeed also constantly changes.|$|R

40|$|Display {{evaluation}} {{has generally}} been performed using reaction time experiments or subjective evaluations to determine which display is better suited for a particular application.

50|$|A balloon may be {{outfitted}} {{with a variety of}} instruments to aid the pilot.

50|$|Another {{factor is}} the {{response}} rate of flight instruments {{in comparison to the}} response rate of the aircraft itself.

5000|$|A {{variometer}} - {{also known}} as a rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI), rate-of-climb <b>indicator,</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> (VSI), or <b>vertical</b> velocity indicator (VVI) - is one of the flight instruments in an aircraft used to inform the pilot of the rate of descent or climb.

50|$|The 767 {{was one of}} {{the first}} airliners to include an {{electronic}} flight instrument system, which operated on the electricity generated by the aircraft's jet engines. With both engines stopped, the system went dead, leaving only a few basic battery-powered emergency flight instruments. While these provided sufficient information with which to land the aircraft, a <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> that would indicate the rate at which the aircraft was descending and therefore how long it could glide unpowered was not among them.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{flight display}} is usually {{located in a}} {{prominent}} position, either centrally or {{on either side of}} the cockpit.

In many cases an indicator of the engaged and armed autoflight system modes will be present along with some form of indication of the selected values for altitude, <b>speed,</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> and heading. It may be pilot selectable to swap with the ND.|$|R
500|$|When the air {{has little}} {{moisture}} or when an inversion stops {{the warm air}} from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> called a variometer that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals {{can be found in}} the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is composed}} of a laminated-wood-sheathed pod containing an enclosed cabin, the engine and two lateral laminated-wood-sheathed boom joining the wing with the directional and diving rudder. The fuselage pod is hexagonal. The instrument panel is fitted with an airspeed <b>indicator,</b> altimeter and <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator,</b> a magnetic compass, turn indicator, ignition switch and fuel pump. The cabin also features an air throttle valve and decompressor, a fuel gauge and fuel valve. The motor glider is steered by a stick and rudder bar. The pilot's seat is made to accommodate a backpack parachute.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator,</b> usually {{next to the}} {{altitude}} indicator, indicates to the pilot how fast the aircraft is ascending or descending, or {{the rate at which}} {{the altitude}} changes. This is usually represented with numbers in [...] "thousands of feet per minute." [...] For example, a measurement of [...] "+2" [...] indicates an ascent of 2000 feet per minute, while a measurement of [...] "-1.5" [...] indicates a descent of 1500 feet per minute. There may also be a simulated needle showing the general direction and magnitude of vertical movement.|$|R
50|$|A blocked {{static port}} {{is a more}} serious {{situation}} because it affects all pitot-static instruments. One {{of the most common}} causes of a blocked static port is airframe icing. A blocked static port will cause the altimeter to freeze at a constant value, the altitude at which the static port became blocked. The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator</b> will become frozen at zero and will not change at all, even if <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> increases or decreases. The airspeed indicator will reverse the error that occurs with a clogged pitot tube and cause the airspeed to be read less than it actually is as the aircraft climbs. When the aircraft is descending, the airspeed will be over-reported. In most aircraft with unpressurized cabins, an alternative static source is available and can be selected from within the cockpit.|$|R

[...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive <b>vertical</b> <b>speed.</b> [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Even after shutdown, {{the engines}} were still {{windmilling}} (rotating {{due to the}} passage of the air through them). This gave the airplane some rudimentary and unreliable hydraulic control, but was better than having no power at all. Garcez commanded the lowering of the flaps, which only moved to position Two, (around 10 degrees) due to the failing hydraulic system. With the batteries discharged, there was no electrical power and the only four instruments working in the cockpit were the artificial horizon, the altimeter, the airspeed <b>indicator</b> and the <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator.</b> The only thing the crew could see on the horizon were faint light spots due to distant forest burnings, and at 21:06, local time, the plane crash-landed over treetops that extended over 50 m above ground.|$|R
5000|$|Thermals {{begin as}} bubbles of rising air that are formed {{on the ground}} through the warming of the surface by sunlight.

50|$|Much {{more than}} in other types of aviation, glider pilots depend on the variometer, {{which is a very}} {{sensitive}} <b>vertical</b> <b>speed</b> <b>indicator,</b> to measure the climb or sink rate of the plane. This enables the pilot to detect minute changes caused when the glider enters rising or sinking air masses. Both mechanical and electronic 'varios' are usually fitted to a glider. The electronic variometers produce a modulated sound of varying amplitude and frequency depending on the strength of the lift or sink, so that the pilot can concentrate on centering a thermal, watching for other traffic, on navigation, and weather conditions. Rising air is announced to the pilot as a rising tone, with increasing pitch as the lift increases. Conversely, descending air is announced with a lowering tone, which advises the pilot to escape the sink area as soon as possible. (Refer to the variometer article for more information).|$|R
