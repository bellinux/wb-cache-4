50|$|Some {{plasmids}} or microbial hosts {{include an}} addiction system or postsegregational killing system (PSK), {{such as the}} hok/sok (host killing/suppressor of killing) system of plasmid R1 in Escherichia coli. This variant produces both a long-lived poison and a short-lived antidote. Several types of plasmid addiction systems (toxin/ antitoxin, metabolism-based, ORT systems) were described in the literature and used in biotechnical (fermentation) or biomedical (<b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy)</b> applications. Daughter cells that retain {{a copy of the}} plasmid survive, while a daughter cell that fails to inherit the plasmid dies or suffers a reduced growth-rate because of the lingering poison from the parent cell. Finally, the overall productivity could be enhanced.|$|E
50|$|Viral {{vaccines}} usually work {{by preventing}} {{the spread of}} the virus. Similarly, cancer vaccines can be designed to target common antigens before cancer evolves if an individual has appropriate risk factors. Additional preventive applications include preventing the cancer from evolving further or undergoing metastasis and preventing relapse after remission. Therapeutic vaccines focus on killing existing tumors. While cancer vaccines have generally been demonstrated to be safe, their efficacy still needs improvement. One way to potentially improve <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> is by combining the vaccine with other types of immunotherapy aimed at stimulating the immune system. Since tumors often evolve mechanisms to suppress the immune system, immune checkpoint blockade has recently received a lot of attention as a potential treatment to be combined with vaccines. For therapeutic vaccines, combined therapies can be more aggressive, but greater care {{to ensure the safety of}} relatively healthy patients is needed for combinations involving preventive vaccines.|$|E

50|$|After {{education}} at Haileybury College, Douglas studied medicine at St Bartholomew’s Hospital and received there in 1896 M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (Lond.). He joined the Indian Medical Service on 28 January 1898 with {{the rank of}} second-lieutenant. All Indian Medical Service officers at that time were required to complete a course in pathology at Netley Hospital under Dr (later Sir) Almroth Wright. In 1899 Wright requested that Douglas accompany him to India for the investigative research of the first Plague Commission. On 31 March 1899 Douglas and H. J. Walton (at that time a lieutenant) were sent to investigate plague in the Garhwal District and {{other areas of the}} Kumaon Division of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Their investigation lasted about 5 months, during which Douglas suffered from recurring episodes of malaria. After completing this investigation, Douglas was sent in 1900 to China as part of the medical staff for the Gaselee Expedition in connection with the Boxer Rebellion. In China he was promoted to the rank of captain on 28 January 1901. However, in China he became infected with amoebic dysentery and developed a liver abscess. (From 1901 {{to the end of his}} life he suffered serious health problems.) He was given a medical discharge from the Indian Medical Service. Douglas returned to the UK and joined Almroth Wright at St Mary's Hospital to do research on <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy.</b> For a pension from the Indian Medical Service, Douglas was put on temporary half pay on 15 September 1905 and was put on permanent half pay on 15 September 1907.

He obtained his Ph.D. from Sapporo Medical College in 1976. He worked at The Scripps Research Institute under the supervision of Prof. RA Reisfeld and Prof S Ferrone, as a NIH post-doctoral research fellow 1978 to 1981. Upon returning to Japan, he obtained the post of lecturer at the Department of Internal Medicine (Division I) of Sapporo Medical University where he later promoted to an associate professor and to a professor in 1994. During the period, he had been to the United Kingdom to study under Professor César Milstein (Nobel Prize Laureate) at MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, the University of Cambridge in 1985. He was appointed to the 9th chairperson of Sapporo Medical University in 2004. Later on he was appointed to the first president of Sapporo Medical University which has been transformed from a prefectural university to a prefectural university corporation in accordance with the Local Independent Administrative Agency Act in 2007.

40|$|As, {{the outcome}} of <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> was {{extremely}} heterogeneous in both human and murine hepatitis B virus (HBV) -carriers, the experiments presented here were performed to find out a prognostic marker of <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> using an animal model of HBV-carrier state, HBV-transgenic mice (Tg). Neither the prevaccinated titres of viral markers, such as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) or HBV DNA, nor the function of lymphocytes prior to vaccination, had significant influence on {{the outcome of}} <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy.</b> Two independent, placebo-controlled, trials of <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> for 12 months, one in 17 HBV-Tg and the other in 26 HBV-Tg (total, n = 43) showed that the eight of 17 and 15 of 26 HBV-Tg that had potent dendritic cell (DC) function at the start of <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> became completely negative for HBsAg, HBeAg and reduced HBV DNA, whereas all 19 HBV-Tg that had poor DC function at the start of <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> became complete non-responders, although, the prevaccinated titres of HBsAg, and HBeAg were similar in all 43 HBV-Tg. Further study to find the mechanism underlying this revealed that there was up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD 86 antigens on DC and increased production of interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) by DC and of IL- 2, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in DC/T-cell cultures when vaccine containing HBsAg was injected in HBV-Tg with potent DC function but not in HBV-Tg with poor DC function. This is the first report on the prognostic importance of DC during an immune therapy. Degree of activation of DC following vaccination would possibly help to predict the outcome of <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> in human HBV-carriers. These data also provide the scientific and logical basis to up-regulate the function of the DC before an immune therapy...|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of using}} vaccine in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer (Pca) is to activate immune response against malignant cells by overcoming the tolerance triggered by the tumor. Vaccine therapies are effective by using the immune response against cancer. The first oncological <b>vaccine</b> <b>therapy</b> ever published in the literature belongs to Coley dating back to 1893. In that study, it has been demonstrated that inoperable soft tissue sarcomas were regressed by stimulating non-specific immune response with streptococcal toxins.
