40|$|N-l-leucyl-doxorubicin and vinblastine-isoleucinate can be {{considered}} as relatively non-toxic prodrugs from doxorubicin and vinblastine, respectively. A comparative analysis was carried out of the anti-tumour activity of the four compounds as well as <b>vintriptol</b> in four human ovarian cancer xenografts different in histology, growth rate and chemosensitivity. Injections were given i. v. weekly twice into mice bearing well-established s. c. tumours. At equitoxic doses, the amount of drug administered for N-l-leucyl-doxorubicin and vinblastine-isoleucinate was respectively 3 -fold and 2 -fold higher than the doses of the parent compound. N-l-leucyl-doxorubicin induced a growth inhibition > 50 % in three out of four human ovarian cancer lines. The anti-tumour effects obtained were significantly better (P 50 %. This prodrug appeared slightly less effective than vinblastine. Insignificant growth inhibition (< 50 %) was obtained by <b>vintriptol...</b>|$|E
