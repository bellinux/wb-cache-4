50|$|A <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> is {{when the}} vehicle is raised to {{increase}} the amount of clearance between the ground and the bottom of the body or frame of the vehicle. A lift will also help with tire clearance when going over large obstacles with only one or 2 wheels and allow the vehicles differential to flex without having the tires rub the fenders. There are several methods for <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift.</b> Some methods may be combined together to best fit the needs.|$|E
50|$|The F-shape and the Jersey-shape {{have the}} same slopes, but the {{distance}} from the ground to the slope break point of the F-shape is 255 mm, which is 75 mm lower than the Jersey-shape. This lower slope break point reduces <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift,</b> improving the barrier's performance.|$|E

50|$|A shackle lift is {{designed}} to lift the vehicle {{in order to provide}} more room to fit larger tires. This type of lift is accomplished by removing the stock shackles that the vehicle was equipped with and replacing them with longer ones. Lengthening the shackle moves one half of the leaf spring further away from the frame resulting in a taller suspension. Typically every two inches that a shackle is lengthened provides one inch of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The LCU has lift {{capacity}} {{for up to}} 216 personnel, including 160 fully equipped soldiers and 56 crew and 145 tonnes of military equipment. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> capacity is one 65 ton tank like the Arjun or two 45 ton tanks like the T-72/80, or four 13.5 ton BMP Infantry Fighting Vehicles. It is fitted with a hydraulic bow ramp which enables loading and unloading of combat equipment and vehicles on beaching. Ballast arrangement further ensures desired trim for smooth beaching operations.|$|E
5000|$|Hooper {{specialized}} {{in the very}} top tier of the market, building the most luxurious bodies possible without consideration of cost. The models were not sporty, as the company {{specialized in}} stately, elegant carriages. Coach customers included the Marquis of Londonderry and the Marquis of Crewe [...] Car body customers included the Kings of Spain, Norway, Portugal and Siam, the Shah of Persia and the Negus of Abyssinia. In 1911, Hooper built an extension onto their Kings Road works, due to increased customer demand. Their London showroom, opened 1896 (possibly earlier), was {{on the corner of}} St James' Street and Bennet Street. It included a <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> so that coaches and cars could be displayed at first floor. The alterations are likely to have been overseen by Francis Hooper, architect, son of the then owner.|$|E

5000|$|Anne {{is a young}} {{college student}} who arrives for her first job working the night shift at an all-night filling station near Haddonfield, Illinois (a {{reference}} to the setting of Carpenter's two Halloween films). The leaving worker, Bill, reminds her that a serial killer has broken out of a mental hospital, and cautions her not to leave the booth at the station without the keys because the door locks automatically. After Bill leaves, Anne is alone and the tension mounts as she deals with various late-night customers seeking to buy gas for a quick fill-up, purchase cigarettes or just use the restroom key, unsure whether any of them might be the escaped maniac. A homeless transient asks to use the restroom, and when a partying couple arrives, she asks the man {{to check on the}} bum. He says he's sleeping. She goes inside the men's restroom, only to find an elaborately grotesque drawing on a evil looking entity carrying beheaded people in the Restroom and then the dead body of the man sitting in a pickup truck on the lift in one of the garage bays. She makes a phone call for help which results in her realization that [...] "Bill", the attending worker she met earlier, is in fact the escaped killer, who has killed the real Bill and is killing numerous passers-by. She finds the real Bill's dead body in one of the lockers. Serial Killer [...] "Bill" [...] then reappears and attempts to kill Anne with a machete, breaking into the locked booth by smashing out the glass with a sledgehammer and then chasing her around the deserted garage. Just as he is about to kill her, a customer returns, having forgotten his credit card, and he wrestles the killer, giving Anne time to crush him under the <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Following a {{restricted}} availability at Yokosuka which commenced on 30 October, Westchester County made stops at Camranh Bay, Da Nang, Hong Kong, Okinawa, and Iwakuni before departing on 17 November for a <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> from Chinhae, South Korea to Okinawa. Westchester County {{spent the first}} half of December involved in landing rehearsals and gunnery exercises. She then transited to Singapore to enjoy a Christmas visit. The ship closed out the year en route to Subic Bay. During January 1971 Westchester County sailed between Hong Kong and Subic Bay. On 2 February she departed Subic Bay en route to the Gulf of Tonkin in support of [...] "Operation Lamson III", a Cambodian operation which lasted until 7 March. After restricted availability and training at Okinawa and Yokosuka, the ship returned to Vietnam on 21 June and continued operations. From 6 August through 1 September, Westchester County assumed the administrative duties as SOPA (senior officer present afloat) in Hong Kong. Following restricted availability at Yokosuka, the ship lifted personnel and equipment of a US Army security agency for transit to Pusan, and returned them to Okinawa on 6 December. During this period, she transported Marines from Japan to Okinawa, departing Okinawa on 24 November to spend Thanksgiving at Yokosuka. Following the off-load of Army personnel on 6 December, Westchester County returned to Yokosuka for the holiday season, arriving on 10 December. Westchester County completed {{a restricted}} availability on 17 January 1972 and set out for a lift to Subic Bay. The ship spent February at Subic Bay undergoing repairs and local operations. After SOPA duties at Hong Kong from 15 to 31 March, the ship resumed personnel and cargo transits to the Gulf of Tonkin until 30 August 1972. During this period, the ship underwent a seven-week restricted availability followed by refresher training at Yokosuka.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} nonlinear and adaptive estimators for reentry (e. g. space shuttle) navigation and model parameter estimation or identification are reported. Of particular interest is the identifcation of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> and drag characteristics in real time. Several nonlinear filters were developed and simulated. Adaptive filters for the real time identification of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> and drag characteristics, and unmodelable acceleration, were also developed and tested by simulation. The simulations feature an uncertain system environment with rather arbitrary model errors, thus providing a definitive test of estimator performance. It was found that nonlinear effects are indeed significant in reentry trajectory estimation and a nonlinear filter is demonstrated which successfully tracks through nonlinearities without degrading the information content of the data. Under the same conditions the usual extended Kalman filter diverges and is useless. The J-adaptive filter is shown to successfully track errors in the modeled <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> and drag characteristics. The same filter concept is also shown to track successfully through rather arbitrary model errors, including lift and drag errors, vehicle mass errors, atmospheric density errors, and wind gust errors...|$|E

In carrying this project, {{the objective is to}} compare the car stability for Proton Persona car with and without air dam. The whole process will involve designing, matching, simulation approach and comparison the data. Airflow around vehicle can affect many aspects of vehicle performance including vehicle drag, <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> and down force. <b>Vehicle</b> <b>lift</b> and down force can affect the vehicle stability and handling. This air dam was design to reduce lift force and improve the turbulent air flow underneath Proton Persona car. The design is refer to the market journal and market also. The dimension gets from the model vehicle scanning by 3 D Scanner. Than sketch the base line of air dam in Solidwork. Besides that, prepare the model vehicle in software environments for simulation process. This thesis focus on design of air dam and how it will affect to the underbody flow. The simulation is comparing the vehicle model with and without air dam base pressure distribution. The result will be compare on pressure distribution underbody. The air dam will affect the lift force on the front Proton Persona when moving in high speed.

40|$|The {{process is}} {{discussed}} of designing a nozzle for a hypersonic airbreathing vehicle which involves a complex {{study of the}} inter-relationship among many parameters: internal-external expansion, <b>vehicle</b> <b>lift,</b> drag, pitching moments, and structural and weight limitations. The source flow characteristic approach to the design process was extended and improved, and streamline interpolation procedure was incorporated. All characteristic and boundary calculations were made compatible with frozen, equilibrium and ideal gas thermodynamic options, while slip surface calculations (cowl interaction) were extended to underexpanded flow conditions. Since viscous forces can significantly influence vehicle forces, pitching moments and structural/weight considerations, a local integration via flat plate boundary layer skin friction and heat transfer coefficients was included. These effects are calculated using the Spalding and Chi method, and all force and moment calculations are performed via integration of the local forces acting on the specified vehicle wetted areas...|$|E
