5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (<b>vincristine).</b> Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{commonly}} used to treat some leukemias and Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as cancers of the bladder, breast, stomach, lung, ovaries, thyroid, soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and others. Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, <b>vincristine,</b> prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and <b>vincristine.</b> Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids <b>vincristine</b> and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found {{nowhere else in}} the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs vinblastine and <b>vincristine</b> are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids <b>vincristine</b> and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, <b>vincristine,</b> prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, <b>vincristine,</b> prednisone , <b>vincristine,</b> doxorubicin, prednisone, etoposide, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|Induction {{chemotherapy}} {{to bring}} about bone marrow remission. For adults, standard induction plans include prednisone, <b>vincristine,</b> and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or cyclophosphamide. For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and <b>vincristine)</b> for {{the first month of}} treatment.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} use of immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine because of their effectiveness. In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed, the off-label use of the vinca alkaloid and chemotherapy agent <b>vincristine</b> may be attempted. However, <b>vincristine</b> has significant side effects and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.|$|E
25|$|Nocodazole, <b>vincristine,</b> and {{colchicine}} {{have the}} opposite effect, blocking the polymerization of tubulin into microtubules.|$|E
25|$|If {{the tumor}} is {{determined}} to be platinum-resistant, <b>vincristine,</b> dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) {{or some combination of}} paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin may be used as a second-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|This {{approach}} {{was extended to}} the lymphomas in 1963 by Vincent T. DeVita and George Canellos at the NCI, who ultimately proved in the late 1960s that nitrogen mustard, <b>vincristine,</b> procarbazine and prednisone — known as the MOPP regimen — could cure patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone is {{also used}} as a direct {{chemotherapeutic}} agent in certain haematological malignancies, especially {{in the treatment of}} multiple myeloma, in which dexamethasone is given alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, including most commonly with thalidomide (Thal-dex), lenalidomide, bortezomib (Velcade, Vel-dex), or a combination of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and <b>vincristine</b> or bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|The Eli Lilly natural {{products}} group found that alkaloids of the Madagascar periwinkle (Vinca rosea), originally {{discovered in a}} screen for anti-diabetic drugs, blocked proliferation of tumour cells. The antitumour effect of the vinca alkaloids (e.g. <b>vincristine)</b> was later shown {{to be due to}} their ability to inhibit microtubule polymerization alkaloys, and therefore cell division.|$|E
25|$|Rosy ("Malagasy") periwinkle: In 1958, Eli Lilly began {{research}} of Malagasy rosy periwinkle, {{hoping to find}} it would help {{in the administration of}} insulin. This effort was unsuccessful, but additional research led to the discovery of the chemotherapy agents vinblastine and <b>vincristine,</b> the latter of which is credited with increasing the survival rate for childhood leukemia from 20 to 80 percent.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as <b>vincristine</b> and vinblastine, antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|Vinca {{alkaloids}} {{are derived}} from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (formerly known as Vinca rosea). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are natural products that include <b>vincristine</b> and vinblastine. Following {{the success of these}} drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: vinorelbine (used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer), vindesine, and vinflunine. These drugs are cell cycle-specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in S-phase and prevent proper microtubule formation required for M-phase.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, <b>vincristine,</b> and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated {{with a combination of}} prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis.|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and <b>Vincristine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rosy {{periwinkle}} case {{dates from}} the 1950s. The rosy periwinkle, while native to Madagascar, had been widely introduced into other tropical {{countries around the world}} well before the discovery of <b>vincristine.</b> This meant that researchers could obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The use of the plant as a cure for diabetes was the original stimulus for research. Effectiveness in the treatment of both Hodgkin's Disease and leukemia were discovered instead. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant. The Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapeutic drug vinblastine is derivable from the rosy periwinkle.|$|E
25|$|Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone {{secretion}} (SIADH) in turn can {{be caused}} by a number of problems. Some forms of cancer can cause SIADH, particularly small cell lung carcinoma but also a number of other tumors. A variety of diseases affecting the brain or the lung (infections, bleeding) can be the driver behind SIADH. A number of drugs has been associated with SIADH, such as certain antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants), the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, oxytocin (used to induce and stimulate labor), and the chemotherapy drug <b>vincristine.</b> It has also been associated with fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin). Finally, it can occur without a clear explanation. Hyponatremia can be treated pharmaceutically through the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Between 30 and 40 {{percent of}} {{patients}} undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids <b>vincristine</b> and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, {{is determined by the}} choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity – in some cases motor nerves are affected, and occasionally, also, the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, a major {{breakthrough}} in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a single agent, but by using different drugs concurrently {{it would be more}} difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), <b>vincristine</b> (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{anti-cancer}} {{drugs such}} as the mitotic inhibitors [...] vinblastine, <b>vincristine,</b> podophyllotoxin, griseofulvin, aurantiamine, oxaline, and neoxaline are produced by fungi.|$|E
500|$|Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very {{widespread}} in nature, and often toxic, {{found in many}} medicinal plants. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as Berberis and Mahonia), caffeine (Coffea), cocaine (Coca), ephedrine (Ephedra), morphine (opium poppy), [...] nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (Rauwolfia serpentina), quinidine and quinine (Cinchona), vincamine (Vinca minor), and <b>vincristine</b> (Catharanthus roseus).|$|E
2500|$|Surgery may be {{difficult}} due {{to the location of}} these tumors. Surgery alone often leads to recurrence. Chemotherapy is very effective for TVTs. The prognosis for complete remission with chemotherapy is excellent. The most common chemotherapy agents used are <b>vincristine,</b> vinblastine, and doxorubicin. [...] Radiotherapy may be required if chemotherapy does not work.|$|E
2500|$|Complete cure is rare with {{lymphoma}} {{and treatment}} {{tends to be}} palliative, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy. [...] With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months. [...] Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish. [...] Average survival is 9 to 12 months. [...] The most common treatment {{is a combination of}} cyclophosphamide, <b>vincristine,</b> prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. [...] Other chemotherapy drugs such as chlorambucil, lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and mitoxantrone are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs. [...] In most cases, appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis {{is through}} biopsy and x-rays. [...] There {{may also be}} an {{increased}} lymphocyte count. [...] Treatment includes surgery for solitary tumors, splenectomy (when the spleen is very large), and chemotherapy. [...] The most common protocol uses prednisone, <b>vincristine,</b> and cyclophosphamide. [...] Doxorubicin is used in some cases. [...] Chemotherapy in relatively healthy ferrets is tolerated very well, but possible side effects include loss of appetite, depression, weakness, vomiting, and loss of whiskers. [...] The {{white blood cell count}} must be monitored. [...] Prednisone used alone can work very well for weeks to months, but it may cause resistance to other chemotherapy agents. [...] Alternative treatments include vitamin C and Pau d'Arco (a bark extract).|$|E
2500|$|Schuldiner {{continued}} {{to work on his}} music, continuing his work with Control Denied. [...] About two years after his original diagnosis, in May 2001, the cancer returned and Schuldiner fell ill again. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness {{to go out and get}} insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the tumor pre-dated insurance being taken out. [...] Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner while he was in the hospital in their days as a local band. Schuldiner received chemotherapy with <b>vincristine.</b> [...] Like most drugs used in the treatment of cancer, the side effects were harsh and weakened him greatly. [...] In late October/early November, Schuldiner's condition worsened as he became ill with pneumonia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vincristine</b> (Liposomal): P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 Inducers may {{decrease}} the serum concentration of <b>vincristine.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2012 the FDA {{approved}} a liposomal formulation of <b>vincristine</b> branded as Marqibo.A nano-particle bound version of <b>vincristine</b> was under development as of 2014.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vincristine</b> works {{partly by}} binding to the tubulin protein, {{stopping}} the cell from separating its chromosomes during the metaphase; the cell then undergoes apoptosis. The <b>vincristine</b> molecule inhibits leukocyte production and maturation.|$|E
50|$|The {{overuse of}} <b>vincristine</b> may {{also lead to}} drug {{resistance}} by overexpression of the p-glycoprotein pump (Pgp). There {{is an attempt to}} overcome resistance by the addition of derivatives and substituents to the <b>vincristine</b> molecule.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vincristine</b> was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 1963 as Oncovin. The drug was initially discovered by a team led by Dr. J.G. Armstrong, then marketed by Eli Lilly and Company. Eli Lilly required lots of leaves of the periwinkle plant. They needed one ton of dried leaves to produce one ounce of <b>vincristine.</b> Periwinkle was grown on a ranch in Texas to produce <b>vincristine</b> for some time.|$|E
5000|$|Brentuximab vedotin is {{also being}} {{investigated}} {{as a substitute for}} <b>vincristine</b> (another mitotic inhibitor which prevents tubulin polymerization) in patients with being treated with CHOP (a combination of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, <b>vincristine,</b> prednisone or prednisolone) for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma.|$|E
50|$|The {{liposome}} encapsulation of <b>vincristine</b> {{enhances the}} efficacy of the <b>vincristine</b> drug while simultaneously decreasing the neurotoxicity associated with it. Liposome encapsulation increases vincristine's plasma concentration and circulation lifetime in the body, and allows the drug to enter cells more easily.|$|E
