40|$|We {{describe}} {{the data analysis}} procedures for an emerging interferometric technique for measuring motion across a two-dimensional image at a moment in time, i. e. a snapshot 2 d-VISAR. <b>Velocity</b> <b>interferometers</b> (VISAR) measuring target motion to high precision have been an important diagnostic in shockwave physics for many years Until recently, this diagnostic has been limited to measuring motion at points or lines across a target. We introduce an emerging interferometric technique for measuring motion across a two-dimensional image, which could be called a snapshot 2 d-VISAR. If a sufficiently fast movie camera technology existed, it could be placed behind a traditional VISAR optical system and record a 2 d image vs time. But since that technology is not yet available, we use a CCD detector to record a single 2 d image, with the pulsed nature of the illumination providing the time resolution. Consequently, since we are using pulsed illumination having a coherence length shorter than the VISAR interferometer delay ({approx} 0. 1 ns), we must use the white light velocimetry configuration to produce fringes with significant visibility. In this scheme, two interferometers (illuminating, detecting) having nearly identical delays are used in series, with one before the target and one after. This produces fringes with at most 50 % visibility, but otherwise has the same fringe shift per target motion of a traditional VISAR. The 2 d-VISAR observes a new world of information about shock behavior not readily accessible by traditional point or 1 d-VISARS, simultaneously providing both a velocity map and an 'ordinary' snapshot photograph of the target.

40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit industry builds {{integrated circuit}}s (IC’s) by placing {{many layers of}} semi conductive material {{on top of each}} other, the smallest details in such a layer are called features. Each layer has its own specific layout and will form together with the other layers three dimensional structures such as transistors, diodes or resistors. The final result is an integrated circuit which is called a chip of which a large number of them are fabricated all at once on a round silicon wafer. A position error between these two layers is called an overlay error, the final chip might not function correctly or not at all if this overlay error exceeds certain limits. It is important to minimize this error to obtain a high yield per wafer. As the features are getting smaller in size, the position of a ’new’ layer with respect to the layer below becomes more critical. High end position measurement equipment is required to minimize this overlay error. The lithography-machines involved with the production of these IC’s are expensive due their advanced technology and are therefore subject to high wafer throughput to reduce costs. These processes require thus a measurement tool which can measure with low measurement uncertainty to minimize the overlay error, while allowing for high target <b>velocity.</b> A laser <b>interferometer</b> is such a measurement tool which is able to measure accurate and fast enough to be used for these processes. The laser light required by interferometers to operate in current lithography-machines is guided along corners by mirrors, over meters long optical pathways. This method of light transport is sensitive for environmental disturbances and requires realignment once maintenance is carried out, this is a time consuming and thus costly process. The current interferometer systems also contain small periodic nonlinearities, this nonlinear error presence in the position measurements will become problematic for future systems which require increasingly smaller overlay errors. At the TU Delft a theoretical periodic error free type of interferometer has been build (see Figure 6), based upon spatial separation of optical measurement pathways. This system has shown to operate with sub-nm measurement uncertainty (see Appendices B. 1 and B. 2) using free-space source frequency delivery. Replacing the free-space beam delivery by fiber-coupled delivery allows for modular plug-and-play systems. No more sensitive to air turbulence, but the light transported by the fibers is unfortunately negatively affected by several phenomena and requires more in depth research. The Delft interferometer concept (Figure 6) knows multiple configurations, two of them have been build for this research: the Delft Corner Cube- and the Generalized Delft-configuration. Three measurement systems have been realized to research operation when the source frequencies are delivered by different types of fibers. The first system, System I, concerns the Generalized Delft configuration with free-space beam delivery with the purpose of reproduction of previous results (see Appendices B. 1 and B. 2). The obtained results serve as reference for the measurements obtained from the second system, System II. In this system the source frequencies are delivered by polarization maintaining single mode fibers (i. e. pmfibers) instead of mirrors. The second system was build study the sub-nm measurement uncertainty using these pm-fibers for beam delivery, instead of free-space beam delivery. The results obtained from this research are published in the first article of this report, Article I: Fiber-coupled displacement interferometry without periodic nonlinearity. The third measurement system, System III, was build to research the performance of graded index multimode fibers (i. e. mm-fibers) for source frequency delivery for the Delft Corner Cube configuration. These fibers allow for easier alignment and higher optical coupling efficiency compared to pm-fibers. However the ease in handling results in lower optical output quality: the fiber does not maintain polarization state, the initial optical wavefront will be deformed during transport and multiple optical modes will be present in its output. The results obtained with this system are published in the second chapter of this report, Article II: Displacement interferometry with fiber-coupled delivery. Conclusions from the research: Yes, it is possible to measure with sub-nm measurement uncertainty using pm-fiber delivered source frequencies for the Generalized Delft interferometer. We have shown that the periodic nonlinearity was not visible down to the noisefloor (40 pm). The same conclusion holds for mm-fiber delivered source frequencies using the Delft Corner Cube interferometer. Both fiber-coupled systems show phase broadening behavior in their measurement results, caused by the birefringent nature of the fibers. This behavior can be seen best in the results using mm-fibers. At first sight this fortunately does not affect the measurement uncertainty. Experimental results confirm that fiber induced phase shifts caused by fiber deformation, are canceled out due the configuration of the Delft interferometer and the differential measurement between the photodetectors. The time varying polarization orientation of the light delivered by mm-fibers in System III, results in interference fluctuations as expected. Nevertheless, the interference signal was not lost during measurements and the fiber coupled system can still measure with sub-nm measurement uncertainty. Building the two fiber coupled systems (System II & III) has shown that pm-fibers require much effort regarding alignment and obtaining a sufficiently high optical coupling efficiency. The finally achieved optical output was of high quality. Multi mode fibers behaved opposite, they were very easy in handling but resulted in a less high optical output quality. Using fiber delivery for the Delft interferometers opens the way towards the design of a modular fibercoupled sub-nm interferometer measurement system. The optical symmetry of the design has shown to be very robust towards phase disturbances, but more research is required regarding system robustness and applicability.

Collective x-ray Thomson scattering spectra show a well-resolved plasmon feature that is down-shifted in energy by 19 eV. In addition, Mbar shock pressures from laser-compressed aluminum foils using <b>velocity</b> <b>interferometer</b> system for any reflector have been measured. The combination of experiments fully demonstrates the possibility to perform warm dense matter studies at the LCLS with unprecedented accuracy and precision...|$|E

The Laser adhesion test developed for testing bond {{strength of a}} coating on its substrate requires a good knowledge of shock wave propagation in such media. Experiments carried out on plasma sprayed copper samples, about 14 % porous, with <b>velocity</b> <b>interferometer</b> system for any reflector measurements display the discrepancy of previously used models. Hence, a one-dimensional formulation of the compaction process, based on a simple P-α model, is proposed to improve the correlation between experimental and computed data signals obtained on a plasma sprayed copper under dynamic loading. Besides, this improvement allows the estimation of the bond strength of a plasma sprayed copper on aluminum substrate...|$|E
