60|$|I {{counted the}} days to Fanny's coming; and dressed myself for the {{occasion}} in the most expensive gold and blue afternoon gown I possessed. It must have been with a queer, mixed motive in my head. I sat waiting for her, while beyond the gloom-hung window raged a London thunderstorm, with dense torrents of rain. My little silver clock struck three, and she entered my room like a black swan, tossing from her small, <b>velveted</b> head, as she did so, a few beads of rain. From top to toe in deadest black. She must have noticed my glance of wonderment.|$|E
60|$|XIV. Finally, {{work may}} be wasted by being {{too good for}} its material, or too fine to bear exposure; and this, {{generally}} a characteristic of late, especially of renaissance, work, is perhaps the worst fault of all. I do not know anything more painful or pitiful than the kind of ivory carving with which the Certosa of Pavia, {{and part of the}} Colleone sepulchral chapel at Bergamo, and other such buildings, are incrusted, of which it is not possible so much as to think without exhaustion; and a heavy sense of the misery it would be, to be forced to look at it at all. And this is not from the quantity of it, nor because it is bad work--much of it is inventive and able; but because it looks as if it were only fit to be put in inlaid cabinets and <b>velveted</b> caskets, and as if it could not bear one drifting shower or gnawing frost. We are afraid for it, anxious about it, and tormented by it; and we feel that a massy shaft and a bold shadow would be worth it all. Nevertheless, even in cases like these, much depends on the accomplishment of the great ends of decoration. If the ornament does its duty--if it is ornament, and its points of shade and light tell in the general effect, we shall not be offended by finding that the sculptor in his fulness of fancy has chosen to give much more than these mere points of light, and has composed them of groups of figures. But if the ornament does not answer its purpose, if it have no distant, no truly decorative power; if generally seen it be a mere incrustation and meaningless roughness, we shall only be chagrined by finding when we look close, that the incrustation has cost years of labor and has millions of figures and histories in it and would be the better of being seen through a Stanhope lens. Hence the greatness of the northern Gothic as contrasted with the latest Italian. It reaches nearly the same extreme of detail; but it never loses sight of its architectural purpose, never fails in its decorative power; not a leaflet in it but speaks, and speaks far off, too; and so long as this be the case, there is no limit to the luxuriance in which such work may legitimately and nobly be bestowed.|$|E
40|$|A 2 -year-old male free-ranging {{white-tailed deer}} (Odocoileus virginianus) was {{diagnosed}} with bilateral expansile tumors of antler origin. The deer was found dead by a landowner in High Springs, Florida. Two roughly spherical, multilobular, broad-based, bony, velvet-covered masses originated from each antler pedicle. These masses replaced or displaced many of the bones and soft tissues of the skull and extended through the left cribriform plate and the right petrous temporal bone, compressing portions of the brain. Microscopically, the masses closely resembled normal-growing antler, containing all the elements thereof but with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage suggestive of ischemi or trauma. Tumorlike outgrowths termed antleromas have been described in free-ranging and captive cervids and typically are associated with disruptions in the seasonal {{rise and fall of}} circulating testos-terone necessary for normal antler growth, casting, and regeneration. Keywords antler, antleroma, cervid, neoplasia, white-tailed deer The term antleroma was first used by Richard Goss to describe tumorlike fibrocartilaginous outgrowths of skin from retained <b>velveted</b> antlers of castrated fallow deer (Dama dama). 4 Other terms have been used to describe similar lesions albeit in differ...|$|E

5000|$|Ciudad Ju√°rez, Mexico was {{a center}} of <b>velvet</b> {{painting}} in the 1970s. A displaced Georgia farmboy, Doyle Harden, was the pioneer who created an enormous factory, where <b>velvets</b> were turned out by the thousands by artists sitting in studios. One artist would paint one piece of the picture, then slide the <b>velvet</b> along to the next artist, who would add something else. <b>Velvet</b> paintings mass-produced by hand in this manner fueled the boom in <b>velvet</b> paintings in the 1970s in the United States.
