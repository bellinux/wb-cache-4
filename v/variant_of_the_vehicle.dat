40|$|We {{present a}} unified heuristic, which {{is able to}} solve five {{different}} <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem: <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), <b>the</b> capacitated <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (CVRP), <b>the</b> multi-depot <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (MDVRP), <b>the</b> site dependent <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (SDVRP) and <b>the</b> open <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (OVRP). All problem variants are transformed to a rich pickup and delivery model and solved using the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) framework presented in Ropke and Pisinger (2004). The ALNS framework is an extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Large Neighborhood Search framework by Shaw (1998) with an adaptive layer. This layer adaptively chooses {{among a number of}} insertion and removal heuristics, to intensify and diversify the search. The presented approach has a number of advantages: ALNS provides solutions of very high quality, the algorithm is robust, and to some extent self-calibrating. Moreover, the unified model allows the dispatcher to mix various <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> VRP problems for individual customers or vehicles. As we believe that the ALNS framework can be applied to a large number of tightly constrained optimization problems, a general description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> framework is given, and it is discussed how the various components can be designed in a particular setting. The paper is concluded with a computational study, in which <b>the</b> five different <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem are considered on standard benchmark tests from the literature. <b>The</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tests is promising as the algorithm is able to improve 183 best known solutions out of 486 benchmark tests.

40|$|Abstract. Recently proved {{successful}} for <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> routing problem (VRP) involving time windows, genetic algorithms {{have not yet}} shown to compete or challenge current best search techniques in solving the classical capacitated VRP. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm to address <b>the</b> capacitated <b>vehicle</b> routing problem is proposed. The basic scheme consists in concurrently evolving two populations of solutions to minimize total traveled distance using genetic operators combining variations of key concepts inspired from routing techniques and search strategies used for a time-variant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem to further provide search guidance while balancing intensification and diversification. Results from a computational experiment over common benchmark problems report the proposed approach to be very competitive with the best-known methods. ...|$|R
