5|$|The rapid {{social changes}} during this period, {{especially}} the 1920s, {{led to the}} reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan in the urban centers of Texas, with their strongest presence in Dallas. As in other states, the new Klan was not outwardly focused on suppression of black civil rights, but instead supported traditional morality including opposition to bootlegging, gambling, and other <b>vices</b> that had grown during the period. Bigotry, though, was never far from the group's agenda. During the Depression, anti-New Deal sentiments among some leaders, such as John Kirby, led to their becoming loosely associated with the Klan and its ideals.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, {{volunteering}} {{to stage a}} puppet show for the MTX members, she created a play with five puppets based loosely on the Petrushka folk character.

She presented a repeat performance before receiving an invitation to stage the play once more at the Café Pittoresque, a well-known cabaret. Having lost her jester-like puppet, she wrote two new plays and performed them with her husband. They were adaptations of Ivan Krylov's fables The Hermit and the Bear and Two Mice. She gave several other performances with her husband, at cafés, friends' homes and at the Hermitage Theatre between 1916 and 1918.|$|E

5|$|The {{number and}} names of hells, {{as well as}} the type of sinners sent to a {{particular}} hell, varies from text to text; however, many scriptures describe 28 hells. After death, messengers of Yama called Yamadutas bring all beings to the court of Yama, where he weighs the virtues and the <b>vices</b> of the being and passes a judgement, sending the virtuous to Svarga (heaven) and the sinners to one of the hells. The stay in Svarga or Naraka is generally described as temporary. After the quantum of punishment is over, the souls are reborn as lower or higher beings as per their merits. In a few texts, hell is described as a bottomless pit of darkness where souls are trapped for eternity and deprived of rebirth.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{uncertain}} what role the Ten Commandments played in early Christian worship, evidence suggests they were recited during some services and used in Christian education. For example, the Commandments are included {{in one of the}} earliest Christian writings, known as the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles or the Didache. Scholars contend that the Commandments were highly regarded by the early Church as a summary of God's law. The Protestant scholar Klaus Bockmuehl believes that the Church replaced the Commandments with lists of virtues and <b>vices,</b> such as the seven deadly sins, from 400–1200. Other scholars contend that throughout Church history the Commandments have been used as an examination of conscience and that many theologians have written about them. While evidence exists that the Commandments were part of catechesis in monasteries and other venues, there was no official Church position to promote specific methods of religious instruction during the Middle Ages. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) was the first attempt to remedy this problem. Surviving evidence reveals that some bishops' efforts to implement the Council's resolutions included special emphasis on teaching the Commandments in their respective dioceses. Centuries later, the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the Church by Protestant reformers.|$|E

Many times, corporate officers such as the CFO, COO, CIO, CTO, secretary, or treasurer will concurrently hold <b>vice</b> president titles, commonly EVP or SVP. <b>Vice</b> presidents in small companies are {{also referred to as}} chiefs of a certain division, such as <b>vice</b> president for finance, or <b>vice</b> president for administration.

In some cases <b>vice</b> presidents are given titles due to their specific responsibilities, for example: <b>Vice</b> President of Operations, Finance, etc. In some associations the first <b>vice</b> president can be interchangeable with executive <b>vice</b> president and the remaining <b>vice</b> presidents are ranked in order of their seniority.|$|R
5|$|In Matsya Purana, Shiva {{had created}} seven Matrikas {{to combat the}} demon Andhaka, who {{had the ability to}} {{duplicate}} from each drop of his blood that falls from him when he is wounded. The Matrikas drink up his blood and help Shiva defeat the demon. After the battle, the Matrikas begin a rampage of destruction by starting to devour other gods, demons and peoples of the world. Narasimha, Vishnu's man-lion incarnation, creates a host of thirty-two benign goddesses who calm down the terrible, fire-breathing Matrikas. Narasimha commanded the Matrikas to protect the world, instead of destroying it and thus be worshipped by mankind. At the end of the episode, Shiva's terrible form Bhairava is enshrined with the images of the Matrikas at the place where the battle took place. This story is retold in Vishnudharmottara Purana. Vishnudharmottara Purana further relates them with <b>vices</b> or inauspicious emotions like envy, pride, anger etc.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death.

Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what <b>vices</b> might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his <b>vices,</b> and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
