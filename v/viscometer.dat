40|$|This book {{is written}} for {{scientists}} {{involved in the}} calibration of <b>viscometers.</b> A detailed description for stepping up procedures to establish the viscosity scale and obtaining sets of master <b>viscometers</b> is given in the book. Uncertainty considerations for standard oils of known viscosity are presented. The modern <b>viscometers</b> based on principles of  tuning fork, ultrasonic, PZT, plate waves, Love waves, micro-cantilever and vibration of optical fiber are discussed to inspire the reader to further research and to generate improved versions. The primary standard for viscosity is pure water. Measurements of its viscosity with accuracy/uncertainty achieved are described. The principles of rotational and oscillation <b>viscometers</b> are explained to enhance the knowledge in calibration work. Devices used for specific materials and viscosity in non SI units are discussed {{with respect to the}} need to correlate viscosity values obtained by various devices. The description of commercial <b>viscometers</b> meets the needs of the user...|$|R

The correlation matrix between the <b>viscometers</b> {{at each level}} can be determined, which enables one to lower the uncertainty relative to the traditional “single-threaded” traceability chain...|$|R

25|$|At {{one time}} the {{petroleum}} industry relied on measuring kinematic viscosity {{by means of the}} Saybolt <b>viscometer,</b> and expressing kinematic viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). Other abbreviations such as SSU (Saybolt seconds universal) or SUV (Saybolt universal viscosity) are sometimes used. Kinematic viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.|$|E
25|$|Viscosity is {{measured}} with {{various types of}} viscometers and rheometers. A rheometer is used for those fluids that cannot be defined by a single value of viscosity and therefore require more parameters to be set and measured than {{is the case for}} a <b>viscometer.</b> Close temperature control of the fluid is essential to acquire accurate measurements, particularly in materials like lubricants, whose viscosity can double with a change of only 5°C.|$|E
25|$|His work is {{the basis}} of the falling sphere <b>viscometer,</b> in which the fluid is {{stationary}} in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by {{the time it takes to}} pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameter is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes.|$|E

50|$|Vibrating <b>viscometers</b> are rugged {{industrial}} systems used {{to measure}} viscosity in the process condition. The active part of the sensor is a vibrating rod. The vibration amplitude varies according to the viscosity of the fluid in which the rod is immersed. These viscosity meters are suitable for measuring clogging fluid and high-viscosity fluids, including those with fibers (up to 1,000 Pa·s). Currently, many industries around the world consider these <b>viscometers</b> {{to be the most}} efficient system with which to measure the viscosities {{of a wide range of}} fluids; by contrast, rotational <b>viscometers</b> require more maintenance, are unable to measure clogging fluid, and require frequent calibration after intensive use. Vibrating <b>viscometers</b> have no moving parts, no weak parts and the sensitive part is very small. Even very basic or acidic fluids can be measured by adding a protective coating such as enamel, or by changing the material of the sensor to a material such as 316L stainless steel.|$|R
40|$|A wide- range {{viscosity}} {{standard system}} {{has generally been}} realized with capillary <b>viscometers,</b> which are calibrated by the stepping-up method {{on the basis of}} viscosity value of distilled water at 10 °C. An extension of this scale is being realized up to 100 000 mm 2 /s. The aim of this work is to realize the NIS viscosity scale and make an intercomparison between NIS-Egypt and IMGC-Italy in the range from 14 000 mm 2 /s to nearly 70 000 mm 2 /s. National Institute for standards (NIS) viscosity scale using glass capillary <b>viscometers</b> was realized for the first time during 2001. The scale was realized from 1 mm 2 /s to nearly 70 000 mm 2 /s. The values were obtained for NIS <b>viscometers</b> on subsequent recalibration over a period of some years. From the results obtained on recalibration of the National Institute for Standards <b>viscometers</b> and the comparisons made with IMGC-Italy it can be concluded that the present scale is realized with an uncertainty of about 0. 4...|$|R

25|$|Vibrating <b>viscometers</b> {{can also}} be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or {{vibrational}} <b>viscometers</b> work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, energy is lost due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured, and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.|$|R
50|$|Vibrating <b>viscometers</b> {{can also}} be used to measure viscosity. These models such as the Dynatrol use {{vibration}} rather than rotation to measure viscosity.|$|R
50|$|A <b>viscometer</b> (also called viscosimeter) is an {{instrument}} {{used to measure}} the viscosity of a fluid. For liquids with viscosities which vary with flow conditions, {{an instrument}} called a rheometer is used. Thus, a <b>viscometer</b> can be considered as a special type of rheometer. Viscometers only measure under one flow condition.|$|E

The original plan called for the evaluation of five prototype on-line <b>viscometers</b> along with laboratory bench versions. At a later stage in the project an additional experimental prototype under development at Southwest Research Institute was added. The <b>viscometers</b> are evaluated for accuracy and repeatability under varying process conditions, such as black liquor species, solids content, temperature, flow rate, and contaminants, as well as for maintenance and reliability.

The instruments are intended for operation in the liquid phase at pressures up to 300 MPa and have been designed specifically for this purpose using the detailed theory of the device. Extensive evidence is adduced {{to demonstrate that the}} operation of the <b>viscometers</b> is consistent with the theory. Although the instruments attain a precision in viscosity measurements of __+ 1 % when used in an absolute mode the accuracy that can be achieved is no better than __+ 3 %. However, if the instrument is calibrated for two welldefined instrumental parameters, the uncertainty in the reported viscosity is improved to _+ 0. 5 %. The results of measurements of the viscosity of normal heptane in the temperature range 303 to 348 K at pressures up to 250 MPa made with one of the <b>viscometers</b> are reported.

'Cup and bob' <b>viscometers</b> work by {{defining}} the exact volume {{of a sample}} {{which is to be}} sheared within a test cell; the torque required to achieve a certain rotational speed is measured and plotted. There are two classical geometries in [...] "cup and bob" [...] <b>viscometers,</b> known as either the [...] "Couette" [...] or [...] "Searle" [...] systems - distinguished by whether the cup or bob rotates. The rotating cup is preferred in some cases because it reduces the onset of Taylor vortices at very high shear rates, but the rotating bob is more commonly used as the instrument design can be more flexible for other geometries as well.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of applications of high pressure chemical and process technologies across a range of engineering fields, there is a corresponding growing interest in the need to measure accurately and reliably important rheological parameters. Of these, the measurement of good and reliable viscosity data is critical in engineering design. The ability to measure viscosity at high pressure, however, presents a number of engineering challenges and a number of innovative <b>viscometers</b> have consequently been devised and operated. This review considers those devices which are based on the falling body principle and considers falling ball, cylinder and needle in open and closed systems. Viscosity is determined from the rate of fall and the usual challenge is to detect its position during descent. While reliable data can be obtained from these <b>viscometers,</b> there is a discrepancy between theoretical values and actual values. This is the result of end effects in the form of vortices, wake oscillations and hedding. Calibration is therefore necessary in all cases. Improvements to analytical models have been attempted and computation fluid dynamics is also used to examine in more detail the flow fields around bodies to understand and appreciate better the performance of these <b>viscometers...</b>|$|R
