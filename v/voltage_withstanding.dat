25|$|Some {{applications}} like AC/AC converters with DC-link for frequency {{controls in}} three-phase grids need higher voltages than aluminum electrolytic capacitors usually offer. For such applications electrolytic capacitors can be connected in series for increased <b>voltage</b> <b>withstanding</b> capability. During charging, the voltage across {{each of the}} capacitors connected in series {{is proportional to the}} inverse of the individual capacitor’s leakage current. Since every capacitor differs a little bit in individual leakage current the capacitors with a higher leakage current will get less voltage. The voltage balance over the series connected capacitors is not symmetrically. Passive or active voltage balance has to be provided in order to stabilize the voltage over each individual capacitor.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{prediction}} of medium voltage cable insulation condition. Different kinds of electrical measurements and chemical analyses are tested {{to find out the}} most representative combination. A large scale test program was carried out on field aged XLPE-insulated and oil-paper insulated cables. Cable samples were collected from different utility companies in Finland. Degradation of XLPE-insulation will change insulation material properties and {{it should be possible to}} detect these changes with chemical analysis. These chemical changes can lower the <b>voltage</b> <b>withstand</b> level of XLPE-cables. Degradation of paper insulation will decrease the mechanical properties of the paper. Increased moisture content will affect the electrical performance of the oilpaper insulation and will also speed up degradation processes. Methods such as dielectric response measurement and FTIR-analysis were used to determine the degree of degradation. It was found that XLPE-cables used in friendly environments are still in good condition after thirty years of service. Cables can be ranked clearly into different condition classes, but overall the XLPE-cables were in good condition. The FTIR-analysis results had good correlation to the <b>voltage</b> <b>withstand</b> levels of the cable samples. The field aged oilpaper insulated cables were also in good condition, even after more than fifty years of service life. Insulations were dry and degree of polymerisation (DP-value), related to mechanical strength, were high. FTIR-analysis results showed good correlation to the moisture content in the insulation. Since increased moisture content and high temperature will increase degradation rate significantly, FTIR-analysis can be used to estimate oilpaper insulation condition. Based on the research project results, FTIR-analysis can be used to estimate cable insulation condition. Results of FTIR-analysis can be linked to the <b>voltage</b> <b>withstands</b> levels of XLPE-cables and the moisture content of oilpaper cables.

When evaluating the compatibility of ester oils with existing transformer insulation designs, {{it is essential to}} not only compare the mean breakdown voltages of the oils, but also to consider the role of dispersion and thus the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> levels (with the acceptable breakdown likelihood).

40|$|Today's {{design and}} {{manufacturing}} of high voltage equipment focuses increasingly on a {{shift away from}} SF 6 as a quenching and isolation medium. SF 6 is has a detrimental effect on the atmosphere's greenhouse potential. Bans or regulations regarding SF 6 may well be imposed on the industry in the future. In order to replace SF 6 with air as insulation, {{more research is needed}} to achieve compact and efficient designs. The goal of this master thesis has been to investigate the effect of barriers on the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> in rod-plane gaps, with atmospheric air, subjected to positive high voltage impulses. The high voltage electrode was a rod with a spherical tip and a diameter of 7 mm. The barriers used as insulation were made out of Lexan polycarbonate plates and measured 1 mm times 600 mm times 600 mm. The 50 %breakdown voltage, the standard deviation and the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> have been determined using the up- and down-method. The barriers were tested in several configurations, changing both the horizontal and vertical placement of the barrier in the rod-plane gap. In addition to physical experiments, these configurations have been investigated in terms of electric background eld calculations in COMSOL,as well as streamer inception voltage calculations in MATLAB. The results show an increase in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of up to 28 % for the configuration with the largest barrier protrusion. The optimal barrier position has been found to be close to the high voltage rod. However, a relative decrease in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is observed when the rod is touching the barrier. This can be explained by a strong tangential eld allowing the streamer to propagate along the surface of the barrier. For a small barrier, protruding 0 mm from the tip of the rod, the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is lower than that of a barrier-less rod plane gap when the barrier touches the rod. A sharp increase of above 10 % in the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> is shown in a barrier with a 0 mm overlap, by simply moving the barrier 10 mm closer to the high voltage rod. This can to some degree be explained by applying electric potential to the barriers in the background eld distributions.

40|$|The vacuum {{switching}} technology is preferred {{used in the}} medium voltage level due to its high reliability, {{the high number of}} switching operations, its free-maintenance as well as its long term durability. Contrary to gas-insulated switches, the contact surface of a vacuum circuit breaker has a substantial influence on the <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage.</b> Charge carriers, escaped from the contacts due to an electrical field stress, will be accelerated in the contact gap, whereas the absorbed energy could not be reduced significantly, because of the marginal number of collisions. Caused by the impact on the contact surface, additional charge carriers may be generated with a subsequent breakdown. The required <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> of a vacuum circuit breaker is reached by a conditioning of the metallic surfaces inside the vacuum circuit breaker. A mechanical handling alone is not sufficient. All established procedures for conditioning vacuum circuit breakers to reach a required <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> use current limited breakdowns to remove emission centers which are the origin of a breakdown. In this work, a conditioning process for industrial type vacuum circuit breakers is investigated, using high-frequency currents in the kHz-range. Due to high current rises before and high voltage rises after a current interruption during a current zero crossing, a reignition of a vacuum insulation can be enforced. On the one hand the high-frequency conditioning process has been evaluated if the required lightning impulse <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be reached reliably, on the other hand it has been investigated, how far the lightning impulse <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage</b> can be increased beyond it. It is investigated, to what extend the voltage and current distribution, measured during a high frequency conditioning process, can be used to specify the reached lightning impulse <b>withstand</b> <b>voltage.</b> The conditioning process is successful only, if every critical emission centre is removed. Therefore the spatial distribution of the arcs is an important information for the evaluation of the conditioning process.
