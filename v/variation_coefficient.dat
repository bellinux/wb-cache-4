40|$|A {{problem in}} the {{expression}} of diameter distribution of plantations using only the Weibull parameters a, b and c was examined. First, it was shown that the scatter of diameters could not be evaluated exactly using only parameter b. Therefore, to solve this, a simple calculating method of a standard deviation and <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of diameters using the Weibull parameters b and c was devised. From examples taken from application, {{it became clear that}} differences in the scatter of diameter distributions, where parameter b was nearly the same and c was greatly different, could be evaluated precisely by comparison of standard deviation and <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> calculated using the above method. Furthermore, when comparing of some diameter distributions in which parameter b was different, it was shown that difference in the scatter of diameters must be evaluated using standard deviation and <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> From the viewpoint of forest management technology, {{it is very important to}} ascertain the scatter of diameters with regard to plantations. Therefore, the simple method of calculating standard deviation and <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of diameters proposed in this study should be utilized effectively in study of forest management technology of plantations using the Weibull distribution. 人工林の直径分布をワイプルパラメータa，b，cのみで表現するさい，直径のバラツキが，尺度のパラメータbのみで正確に判断できない欠点があった．本研究は，この欠点を解決するために，先ず，パラメータb，cを用いて直径の標準偏差，変動係数を簡単に計算する方法を提案した．次に，本方法により計算した標準偏差，変数係数を比較すれば，パラメータbがほぼ同じでcが著しく異なる直径分布のバラツキの違いが正確に判断できることを，三つの応用例を示すことにより明らかにした．さらに，パラメータbが異なる直径分布を比較するさいにも，一つの応用例から，直径のバラツキの差は，標準偏差，変数係数を用いて検討しなければならないことを指摘した．森林施業の立場からみると，直径のバラツキの程度を知ることは重要である．したがって，今回提案されたパラメータb，cを用いた直径の標準偏差，変動係数の簡単な計算法は，今後のワイプル分布を用いた人工林の施業技術の研究に有効に利用できるものと考えられる...|$|E

In order {{to study the}} effect of the filling caves in the edge of loess tableland on loess slope stability, the slope stability of sliding from the caves was calculated in irrigation when caves were filled with compacted soil, lime soil, lime-ash soil and non-filled. The results show when caves are filled with lime soil the slope stability is the highest. The effects of variability of the physical and mechanical property indexes of caver filler on loess slope stability were researched further. The results show that (1) the variation coefficients of unit weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler “lime soil ” have small effect on the average value of safety reserve, but have big effect on the standard deviation of safety reserve, which explains that the design risks increase while the <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> increasing. (2) with the increase of variation coefficients of unit weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler the failure probability increases. Especially when <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is bigger than 0. 3, the failure probability of loess slope is very sensitive to <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> (3) the effect of correlation coefficient among unit weight and the shear strength indexes of cave filler on failure probability increases with the <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> increasing. It is very important to guarantee filling project.

40|$|Abstract: The Lorenz {{curve is}} used to {{estimate}} the heterogeneity of an oil reservoir. The corresponding permeability distributions {{in a series of}} concept reservoir models with a uniform average permeability but different heterogeneities are obtained and characterized by inverse calculation of the Lorenz curve. Then the development laws of a reservoir in relation to its heterogeneity are studied in method of numerical simulation. The results show that reservoirs with a Vk (permeability <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is defined in appendix) which characterizes the heterogeneity less than 0. 2 have almost the same development rule. It is also found that the permeability profile is consistent with the water-cut profile in both positive and reverse rhythm reservoirs where injected water channels in high permeable layers. Furthermore, the water-cut profile of a reverse rhythm reservoir is more uniform than that of a positive rhythm reservoir. In addition, results also show an exponential relation between water-free recovery and variation coefficients in positive rhythm heterogeneous reservoirs. From the simulation results of reservoir models with different oil-water viscosity ratios, it is found that during the development process, the water-free recovery firstly decreases rapidly with an increasing oil/water viscosity ratio less than 30 : 1 before it decreases slightly. Besides, a modified logistic function is built to present the relation between ultimate recovery and <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> for positive rhythm reservoirs. The ultimate recovery firstly decreases slightly before the permeability <b>variation</b> <b>coefficient</b> increases up to 0. 4, and then decreases sharply.
