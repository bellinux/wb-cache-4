40|$|The {{agreement}} between <b>vectorcardiograms</b> obtained by different lead systems may {{be judged by}} various subjective and objective methods. To test the validity of these methods, the results were studied when they were applied to <b>vectorcardiograms</b> obtained by the lead systems of Frank, McFee and Burger. For each individual case the three <b>vectorcardiograms</b> were compared pair-wise from the loop-projections (P) {{as well as from}} spatial wire models (S), and the degree of similarity was evaluated subjectively and expressed by a rating between 0 and 10. Objectively, the difference between the <b>vectorcardiograms</b> was given by the “relative average true distance” (T) between isophasic points on the loops, {{as well as by the}} extent of the displacement brought about by a linear transformation designed to transform the one system into the other (δ). Correlations between P, S, T, and δ were calculated and were all found to be significant. T appeared to be interchangeable with δ (r = 1. 00). Of the other correlations, the best one was between S and T (or δ) (r = 0. 74), although the difference with P and T was only small. The regression coefficient proved to be plausible. For purposes of comparison of systems the use of wire models has only slight advantage over loop-projections...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vectorcardiograms</b> {{obtained}} with the Frank lead system {{were recorded in}} 258 healthy subjects (139 men, 119 women) and were classified according to QRS loop patterns. Sex and age effects on the <b>vectorcardiograms</b> were studied. We classified the <b>vectorcardiograms</b> into 4 types according to the frontal axis of the maximum QRS vector (A≧ 60 >B≧ 30 >C≧ 10 >D). Type B was frequent among young persons {{and the number of}} persons with type C increased with aging. The magnitude of the maximum QRS vector diminished with aging in both sexes. The axis deviated horizontally and posteriorly in men and horizontally in women. The magnitude of the maximum T vector was larger in men than in women. The axis was more anterior in men than in women. The axis of the 20 -msec QRS vector deviated from the right anterior to the left anterior. The terminal QRS vector demonstrated no sex or age defference. The percentage of the QRS Bite increased with aging...|$|R
50|$|The spatial QRS-T angle (SA) {{is derived}} from a <b>vectorcardiogram,</b> which is a {{three-dimensional}} representation of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) created with a computerized matrix operation. The SA is the angle of deviation between two vectors; the spatial QRS-axis representing all of the electrical forces produced by ventricular depolarization and the spatial T-axis representing all the electrical forces produced by ventricular repolarization. The SA {{is indicative of the}} difference in orientation between the ventricular depolarization and repolarization sequence. In healthy individuals, the direction of ventricular depolarization and repolarization is relatively reversed; this creates a sharp SA. There is high individual variability and gender difference in the magnitude of the SA. The mean, normal SA in healthy young adult females and males is 66° and 80°, respectively, and very similar magnitudes are found in the elderly population (65 years and older). In ECG analysis, the SA is categorized into normal (below 105°), borderline abnormal (105-135°) and abnormal (greater than 135°). A broad SA results when the heart undergoes pathological changes and is reflected in a discordant ECG. A large SA indicates an altered ventricular repolarization sequence, and {{may be the result of}} structural and functional myocardial changes that induce regional shortening in action potential duration and impaired ion channel functioning. Current standard ECG markers of repolarization abnormalities include ST depression, T wave inversion and QT prolongation. Many studies have investigated the prognostic strength of the SA for cardiac morbidity and mortality compared to these and other ECG parameters. In treated hypertensive patients, the SA was significantly larger in patients with elevated blood pressure compared to those with lower blood pressure values and a discrimination between patients with high and low blood pressure could not be detected using other ECG parameters. In the Rotterdam Study with men and women aged 55 years and older, having an abnormal SA significantly increased the hazard ratios for cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, non-fatal cardiac events (infarction, coronary interventions) and total mortality. Independently, the SA was a stronger risk indicator of cardiac mortality compared to the other cardiovascular and ECG risk factors analyzed. The Women’s Health Initiative study concluded that a wide SA was the strongest predictor for incident coronary heart failure risk and a dominant risk factor for all cause mortality compared to several other ECG parameters. The SA also increases accuracy of diagnosing left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Using only conventional ECG criteria to diagnose LVH the diagnostic accuracy was 57%, however the inclusion of the SA significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy to 79%.|$|E

Nine patients had bundle-branch block and 12 had had previous episodes of myocardial infarction. Serial electrocardiograms and vectorcardiograms were recorded {{during the first week}} in hospital. The most striking finding was that in more than half the cases there was disagreement between the electrocardiogram and <b>vectorcardiogram</b> in the localizationof infarction. The earliest evidence of infarction in the electrocardiogram is often restricted to ST and T changes though in the corresponding vectorcardiograms evidence of infarction may be present in the QRS loop.

To investigate the cause of myocardial damage in diabetic patient, <b>vectorcardiograms</b> (VCG) of dogs which had been injected with allylamine intravenously, were recorded. The results were as follows: 1. QRS bites defined as deviation from a smooth conture of the VCG loop with a duration longer than 2 msec and an amplitude greater than 0. 05 mv were observed more often in diabetic patients than in normal controls. 2. The prevalence of the QRS bite increased along with an increment in the duration of diabetes mellitus and {{in the frequency of}} diabetic microangiopathy of ocular fundus. 3. The magnitude of the QRS bite increased with exercise, both in diabetic patients with an abnormal resting ECG and in patients with a normal resting ECG and a vectorcardiographically abnormal response to the exercise. 4. Diabetic patients frequently showed ST,T changes in VCG after exercise regardless of the resting ECG. 5. Repeated intravenous injection of allylamine frequently caused QRS bite in the VCG of dog's. 6. Pathological studies on the myocardium of the dog showing bite in VCG revealed lesions characterized by subendotherial proliferation of mononuclear cells, mainly in small intramural coronary arteries 100 - 200 μm in diameter. The results suggest that microangiopathy of the myocardium would be responsible for diabetic myocardial damage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vectorcardiograms</b> were {{recorded}} with the Frank lead system using electrodes positioned {{at the level}} of the 5 th intercostal space with the subject in the supine position. Deep inspiration produced the following significant changes compared with deep expiration: (1) the maximum leftward forces of the P, QRS, and T vectors decreased, whereas the maximum anterior and posterior forces of the QRS and T vectors increased; (2) the maximum spatial QRS vector decreased in magnitude; (3) the maximum spatial P, QRS, and T vectors shifted vertically, posteriorly and vertically, and anteriorly, respectively; and (4) the spatial QRS-T angle increased remarkably. The spatial instantaneous QRS vectors were analyzed at 5 msec intervals in 35 of the 61 subjects. With inspiration, the 35 - through 50 -msec vectors shifted posteriorly with markedly reduced leftward forces and increased posterior forces. It was suggested that the respiration-related vectorcardiographic changes reflected cardiac anatomic positional change, distortion of lead-field potential by lung gases, and other mechanisms. Since the respiratory effect is potentially important for vectorcardiographic interpretation, <b>vectorcardiograms</b> should be recorded under identical respiratory status. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundWhen triaging {{a patient}} with acute chest pain at first medical contact, an {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) is routinely made and inspected for signs of myocardial ischemia. The guidelines recommend comparison of the acute and an earlier-made ECG, when available. No concrete recommendations for this comparison exist, neither is known how to handle J-point identification difficulties. Here we present a J-point independent method for such a comparison. MethodsAfter conversion to <b>vectorcardiograms,</b> baseline and acute ischemic ECGs after 3 minutes of balloon occlusion during elective PCI were compared in 81 patients of the STAFF III ECG database. Baseline <b>vectorcardiograms</b> were subtracted from ischemic <b>vectorcardiograms</b> using either the QRS onsets or the J points as synchronization instants, yielding vector magnitude difference signals, ΔH. Output variables for the J-point synchronized differences were ΔH at the actual J point and at 20, 40, 60 and 80 ms thereafter. Output variables for the onset-QRS synchronized differences were the ΔH at 80, 100, 120, 140 and 160 ms after onset QRS. Finally, linear regressions of all combinations of ΔHJ+… versus ΔHQRS+… were made, and the best combination was identified. ResultsThe highest correlation, 0. 93 (p< 0. 01), was found between ΔH 40 ms after the J point and 160 ms after {{the onset of the}} QRS complex. With a ΔH ischemia threshold of 0. 05 mV, 66 / 81 (J-point synchronized differences) and 68 / 81 (onset-QRS synchronized differences) subjects were above the ischemia threshold, corresponding to sensitivities of 81 % and 84 %, respectively. ConclusionOur current study opens an alternative way to detect cardiac ischemia without the need for human expertise for determination of the J point by measuring the difference vector magnitude at 160 ms after the onset of the QRS complex...|$|R

Design of the test sequences allowed direct comparisons of supine resting, Earth based (reference) <b>vectorcardiograms</b> with those taken during lower body negative pressure stress and those obtained at rest in orbit, as well as combinations of these conditions. Results revealed several statistically significant space flight related changes; namely, increased testing and lower body negative pressure stressed heart rates, modestly increased PR interval and corrected QTC interval, and greatly increased P and QPS loop maximal amplitudes. In addition, orientation changes in the QRS maximum vector and the J-vector at rest in space seem quite consistent among crewmen and different from those caused by the application of lower body negative pressure. No clinical abnormalities were observed. Etiology of these findings is conjectured to be, at least in part, related to fluid mass shifts occurring in weightlessness and attendant alterations in cardiovascular dynamics and myocardial autonomic control mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|The spatial <b>vectorcardiogram</b> and {{the spatial}} {{ventricular}} gradient of normal {{subjects in the}} last trimester of pregnancy and {{in some of the}} same subjects following delivery have been studied. It was found that the vectorcardiograms could be divided into two groups {{on the basis of the}} form of the QRS sfi-loops, as has been previously reported for other normal subjects. In some instances records taken after delivery or records taken during pregnancy with the subject in deep inspira-tion altered both the orientation and the form of the QRS se-loop. Since these alterations were most likely due to changes in position of the heart and extracardiac tissues, it is suggested that these are factors determining the configurations of the two types of normal QRS se-loops. BECAUSE of the importance of cardiac position in determining the form of the electrocardiogram and the vectorcardi-ogram and because of the difficulty of inter-preting the electrocardiogram with a large Q wave in lead III, it was considered worthwhile to investigate the spatial <b>vectorcardiogram</b> and the spatial ventricular gradient in subjects during the eighth and ninth months of preg-nancy and following delivery. In a previous study of normal subjects it was found that the spatial <b>vectorcardiogram</b> varied considerably in its spatial orientation and that these variations largely accounted for the marked variations in contour of the plane pro-jections of normal vectorcardiograms. 1 In that study it was not possible to evaluate adequately the effect of cardiac position on the orienta-tion or contour of the <b>vectorcardiogram.</b> The present study was undertaken because it was thought that the changes in the vectorcardi-ogram which occurred with changes in cardiac position during pregnancy and following de...|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{usefulness of}} the <b>vectorcardiogram</b> is well documented by the numerous reports published in the last 3 decades. It has been found more reliable than the electrocardiogram for the diagnosis of atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia that demands medical attention. Computer-based detailed analysis of cardiac electrical signals from healthy subjects and patients with a history of atrial fibrillation has become an important tool in the further clarification of this disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore supraventricular conduction using the following selected techniques, to present some results, and to clarify methodological aspects. Heart rate-stratified RR interval histograms were used to non-invasively assess the characteristics of the atrioventricular node during atrial fibrillation. An RR interval distribution with two distinct peaks was seen in most recordings, believed to represent the dual pathway physiology of the atrioventricular node. Atrial activation patterns were analyzed using signal-averaged P waves, a technique that can extract repetitive signals from uncorrelated noise. Using several different templates, a variability of P wave morphology was identified. In a modeling experiment, a mathematical algorithm was used to automatically classify different P wave morphologies. Different sets of parameters were tested, with the best results seen when using a decimated P wave morphology as input. A mathematical transform was used to derive <b>vectorcardiograms</b> from recorded 12 -lead electrocardiograms. A comparison was made between P waves extracted from derived and recorded <b>vectorcardiograms,</b> illustrating that parameters used to describe morphology were preserved on a group basis, but with less accurate results in the individual case. Left atrial activation was studied using electrograms recorded from a coronary sinus catheter. Correlation function analysis was used to find similarity and time delay between pairs of electrograms. An organized and reproducible atrial conduction pattern was seen in signals recorded during sinus rhythm as well as during atrial fibrillation. The selected methods for studying atrial fibrillation have each contributed with genuine information concerning the mechanism of this common arrhythmia.
