6000|$|Section 28. Turning now to Figure 8,I., {{we have a}} {{side view}} of a tadpole's skull. On the ventral {{side of the head}} is a series of {{vertical}} cartilaginous bars, the visceral arches supporting the walls of the tadpole's gill slits. The first of these is called the hyoid arch (c.h.), and the four following this, the first (br.1), second, third, and fourth (br.4), branchial arches. Altogether there are four gill slits and between the hyoid arch and the jaw arch, as it is called (= Meckel's cartilage + the palato-pterygoid), is [...] "an imperforate slit," [...] which becomes the ear-drum.* The frog no longer breathes by gills, but by lungs, and the gills are lost, the gill slits closed, and the branchial arches consequently much reduced. Figures 8, II., and 8, III., show stages in this reduction. The hyoid arch becomes attached, to the otic capsule, and its median <b>ventral</b> <b>plate,</b> including also the vestiges of the first, second, and fourth branchial arches, is called the hyoid apparatus. In Figure 5, the apparatus is seen from the side; c.h. is called the (right) anterior cornu** of the hyoid. The function of the hyoid apparatus in the frog is to furnish, a basis of attachment to the tongue muscles; it remains cartilaginous, {{with the exception of the}} relic of one branchial arch, which ossifies as the thyro-hyal (Figure 7 th.h.). It will be noted that, as development proceeds, the angle of the jaw swings backward, and the hyoid apparatus, shifts relatively forward. These changes of position are indicated in Figure 8, III., by little arrow-heads.|$|E

5|$|Unlike modern amphibians, many temnospondyls {{are covered}} in small, closely packed scales. The undersides of most temnospondyls {{are covered in}} rows of large <b>ventral</b> <b>plates.</b> During early stages of development, they first have only small, rounded scales.

Later semiaquatic temnospondyls, such as trematosaurs and capitosaurs, have no evidence of scales.

5000|$|The genus Bruchus is {{well-defined}} by {{a number}} of characters, such as the shape of the pronotum, an arrangement of spines or plates on the tibia of the middle leg of the male, and the unique morphology of the male genitalia. The latter are slender and elongated, and the eighth abdominal sternite in particular is large and sclerotized, [...] "with a characteristic boomerang shape". This part of the genitalia has been called the [...] "urosternite", but other authors suggest the term [...] "ventral plate" [...] is more appropriate. The robust <b>ventral</b> <b>plate</b> of Bruchus helps distinguish the genus from other seed-beetles, which tend to have vestigial or lobe-like ventral plates. The <b>ventral</b> <b>plate</b> is useful in identification because each species seems to have a distinctive shape to it, and it does not vary among individuals of one species.|$|E

40|$|Larvae of the sawfly, Athalia rosae, have {{remarkable}} abdominal prolegs. We {{analyzed the}} morphogenesis of appendages and {{the expression of}} decapentaplegic and Distal-less genes during embryonic development to characterize the origin of prolegs. Proleg primordia in abdominal segments A 1 –A 9 appeared shortly after the inner lobes (endites) of gnathal appendages were formed. These were located on the <b>ventral</b> <b>plates,</b> medioventral to the appendages of the other segments in light of serial homology. Nothing was seen where the main axis of the appendage should develop in abdominal segments. The primordia in A 1 and A 9 disappeared before larval hatching. Anal prolegs appeared separate from cerci, the main axes of appendages, which were formed temporarily in A 11. The expression of decapentaplegic, which reflects the primary determination of appendages, was detected in the lateral juxtaposition with the prolegs. Distal-less was expressed in the main axes of appendages, protruding endites and the cerci, but not in prolegs and anal prolegs or the gnathal endites which do not protrude. These findings suggest a possibility that the abdominal and anal prolegs of A. rosae are outgrowths of <b>ventral</b> <b>plates</b> which derived from coxopodal elements, but not main axes of appendages...|$|R
50|$|However, {{because many}} {{defining}} traits for phyllolepis {{must be used}} in conjunction with other traits (for example, the genera Phyllolepis, Placolepis, and Cobandrahlepis all lack a posterior median <b>ventral</b> <b>plate),</b> it is difficult to identify phyllolepid placoderms unless a full fossil assemblage is known. Due to the isolated phyllolepid plates found for species such as P. concentrica, konicki, undulata, and delicatula, it has been suggested by J. Long and E. Daeschler that they be recategorized as Phyllolepidae gen. et sp. Indeterminate. P. woodwardi, orvini, neilseni, and rossimontina are all species with complete and valid sets of plates.|$|E
