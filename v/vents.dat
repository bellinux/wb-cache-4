They formed {{as a result of}} lava flowing out in all {{directions}} from central summit <b>vents</b> and from groups of <b>vents,</b> building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of lava flows of highly fluid basaltic lava, which spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. In some shield volcano eruptions, basaltic lava has poured out quietly from fissure <b>vents</b> instead of central <b>vents,</b> flooding the surrounding countryside with lava flow upon lava flow, forming Edziza's broad lava plateau.|$|E

Smoke <b>venting</b> logging, which represents the failure of smoke <b>venting,</b> was experimentally found from certain operating pressure called initial logging pressure. The CO concentration was found to increase after sprinkler was operated as the smoke is constrained in the spray region with horizontal momentum decreased.

40|$|In deep-sea {{hydrothermal}} <b>vent</b> fields, faunal {{distribution is}} associated with the geochemical environments generated by hydrothermal <b>vent</b> activity. Hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields on the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) are associated with <b>vent</b> fauna which is thought as a mixture of Atlantic and Pacific and are discretely distributed along the ridge axis of more than 1, 000 km apart. In this chapter, faunal distribution in hydrothermal <b>vent</b> fields on the CIR is summarized at the intra- and inter-field levels. The species composition of the <b>vent</b> fauna in the four <b>vent</b> fields hitherto known is reviewed and updated, and faunal resemblance among the four <b>vent</b> fields of the CIR appears to reflect the number of species recorded, indicating that faunal surveys are not sufficient in describing the whole <b>vent</b> fauna on the CIR. All the genetic studies of the CIR <b>vent</b> fauna have indicated a high genetic connectivity among the local populations, despite the many potential dispersal barriers existing between the <b>vent</b> fields. On the basis of the spatial distribution of <b>vent</b> species in a <b>vent</b> field, typical <b>vent</b> fields on the CIR were classified into six zones, of which the central two zones are often covered by Rimicaris swarms in the Kairei and Edmond fields. The close relationship between <b>vent</b> fauna from the CIR and the western Pacific, compared to those from other regions, is highlighted.

Several new <b>vents</b> with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground.|$|E

5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around <b>vents</b> during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around <b>vents.</b> Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E
5|$|Flow-dominated eruptions are {{long-lived}} {{events that}} build up extensive, compound lava flows. The extent of these flows makes them a major terrain type on Io. In {{this style of}} eruption, magma emerges onto the surface from <b>vents</b> {{on the floor of}} paterae, <b>vents</b> surrounding paterae, or from fissures on the plains, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kīlauea in Hawaii. Images from the Galileo spacecraft revealed that many of Io's major flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava on top of older flows. Flow-dominated eruptions differ from explosion-dominated eruptions by their longevity and their lower energy output per unit of time. Lava erupts at a generally steady rate, and flow-dominated eruptions can last for years or decades.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to investigate {{the effect of a}} sprinkler spray on adjacent horizontal smoke <b>venting</b> and in particular the water droplet drag component. The pressure difference across a roof <b>vent</b> and the volumetric flow of smoke <b>vented</b> are determined by considering the interaction between the drag force of the sprinkler spray and the buoyancy of the smoke layer in the spray region. Smoke <b>venting</b> may become progressively more inefficient as the sprinkler operating pressure increases due to the cooling and drag effect of the sprinkler spray. Full scale experiments were carried out to validate the model. Results show that the {{mathematical model}} can predict the observed trend of a decrease in <b>vented</b> volumetric flow with an increase in sprinkler operating pressure, which eventually leads to ineffective smoke <b>venting.</b> Experiments with different smoke <b>venting</b> areas show that <b>vent</b> area has little influence on smoke flow once sprinkler pressure causes a loss in smoke flow efficiency or <b>vent</b> function.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>vent</b> ducts on gas explosions was investigated {{with the aim}} of determining whether the use of larger area of the <b>vent</b> duct than the <b>vent,</b> would reduce the overpressure in <b>vented</b> duct explosion.
