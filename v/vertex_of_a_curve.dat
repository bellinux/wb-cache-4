40|$|Abstract. The {{distance}} or D-eigenvalues <b>of</b> <b>a</b> graph G are the eigenvalues of {{its distance}} matrix. The distance or D-energy ED(G) of the graph G {{is the sum}} of the absolute values of its D-eigenvalues. Two graphs G 1 and G 2 are said to be D-equienergetic if ED(G 1) = ED(G 2). Let F 1 be the 5 -vertex path, F 2 the graph obtained by identifying one <b>vertex</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triangle with one end <b>vertex</b> <b>of</b> the 3 -vertex path, F 3 the graph obtained by identifying <b>a</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triangle with <b>a</b> <b>vertex</b> <b>of</b> another triangle and F 4 be the graph obtained by identifying one end <b>vertex</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 4 -vertex star with <b>a</b> middle <b>vertex</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 3 -vertex path. In this paper we show that if G is r-regular, with diam(G) 2, and Fi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are not induced subgraphs of G, then the k-th iterated line graph Lk(G) has exactly one positive D-eigenvalue. Further, if G is r-regular, of order n, diam(G) 2, and G does not have Fi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4, as an induced subgraph, then for k 1, ED(Lk(G)) depends solely on n and r. This result leads to the construction of non D-cospectral, D-equienergetic graphs having same number of vertices and same number of edges. 1...|$|R

Graph sandwich {{problems have been}} introduced recently by Golumbic, Kaplan and Shamir in a paper in the Journal of Algorithms. The graph sandwich problem for property Φ is defined as follows: Given two graphs G 1 = (V; E 1) and G 2 = (V; E 2) such that E 1 ` E 2, is there a graph G = (V; E) such that E 1 ` E ` E 2 which satisfies property Φ? We prove that the sandwich problem when property Φ {{is to be a}} 1 -join composition is NP-complete.
