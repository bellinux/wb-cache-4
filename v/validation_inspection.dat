40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} devise, build and control a {{self-organizing}} smart manufacturing system for certain modular product architecture to support mass personalization, {{it is essential}} to accurately predict quality and performance of the manufacturing processes among others. Dimensional quality issues have been widely studied to understand causes of variations of product manufacturing qualities and various point solutions such as Variation Simulation Analysis (VSA), Dimensional Planning and Validation (DPV) and Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) have been adopted. However, dimensional quality issues will never be sufficiently addressed unless all major causes during lifecycle are identified and managed. This research provides a holistic approach to build a closed loop Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) lifecycle from dimensional design, planning and inspections via a unique data repository which can accurately, effectively and smartly carry on and reuse Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI) during product lifecycle time. The new approach integrates universal semantic model using Feature Associated Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) Information Reuse, consistently stated Dimensional Quality Lifecycle and it captures, identifies and reuses 3 D geometry characteristics and their associated GD&T information of the semantic model. The approach also establishes a closed loop quality lifecycle management system incorporating GD&T Design and <b>Validation,</b> <b>Inspection</b> Planning and Validation, Measurement Data Analysis and Reporting, and GD&T Design and Validation. The new approach has been applied by a functional failure study for an industrial product platform. It proves that the holistic approach can ensure single version of truth, enforce reusable technical specifications, eliminate silos among different process steps, and enable design for manufacturing to achieve optimal cost/performance balance at very early stage. Furthermore, the paper suggests future research directions of dimensional quality management system advancement based on smart PMI technologies augmented by Internet of Things, VR/AR and Cyber Physical Systems...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{refers to}} the area of complex {{projects}} of public works managed with the tools of public-private partnership (PPP); the paper returns theoretical and methodological premises and the first results of ongoing experimentation concerning university buildings. The aim is to highlight the importance of information management processes related to public works and to underline some basic questions: the construction work must be considered in its life cycle; in the life cycle, the direct and indirect relations between the different stages (planning, design, construction, operation) must be acknowledged; synergies and convergences should be found between methodological approaches and methods of project management and knowledge management; based on these assumptions, the information system assumes the role of area of application and, at the same time, the role of an operational tool. The development of public works under the approach named "PPP" (public private partnership) has highlighted the central role of the operational phase of the buildings and has also underlined the multiple and articulated consequences that the previous phases (e. g. design and construction) may have on the last one. The organization of information is therefore of strategic importance for the success of complex projects; in order to do that, the organization must be able to connect, combine and aggregate into a single management system the multiple and heterogeneous information coming from the different stages of the construction process. To this aim, knowledge management and project management methods and tools should be appropriately combined. The industrial perspective of the work - named Information Management System of the Public Work (SgIOP) - is the set up of procedural manuals to support the public administrations and to develop computerized information management systems to be used in project and facility management. The paper presents the organizational structure and the mode to represent the processes that are necessary {{for the construction of a}} procedural information system (SgIOP) in order to regulate the information produced/used in the different stages of the construction process relating to public works; planning, design, construction, verification and <b>validation,</b> <b>inspection</b> during construction, design of maintenance services, monitoring during the operation and maintenance.

The <b>inspection</b> <b>validation</b> (IV) model is currently under development. This decision-support model can be used to evaluate the a priori design assumptions on the condition in time versus the actually measured deterioration. The aim of the IV model is to bridge the gab between design and inspection, and to provide maintenance engineers with better founded maintenance advises. The variability of the deterioration in time is modeled by a gamma process. Its parameters have been estimated based on inspection data by combining the methods of least squares and maximum likelihood.

Admittedly, {{in the case of}} measuring, the explained variance for routine measures is very low (below . 01). Writing and calculating are surveyed only until the 1991 / 92 data collection. Their positive correlation with computer activities could be interpreted as either complementary or substitutionary effects. Measuring is not only inconsistently correlated with computer tasks, but also positively related to manual skill requirements. Altogether, the criterion validation demonstrates that the meaning of measuring changes throughout the rounds; classifying this task variable as a measure for routine cognitive tasks—as it is suggested by existing theory—is not supported by the criterion <b>validation.</b> An <b>inspection</b> of educational groups reveals (see Appendix Fig.  1) that measuring is more often performed by workers with high-skilled vocational degrees (ISCED 5 B), suggesting that it rather measures a non-routine cognitive task.|$|R

Ultrasonic {{simulation}} tools {{have been}} {{gathered in the}} Civa software developed at CEA (the French Atomic Energy Commission), in order to conceive, optimise and predict the performances of various inspection techniques.

These simulation tools include beam propagation and defect scattering models, thus the whole inspection performances may be predicted {{for a wide range of}} applications (phased arrays, complex specimen geometry and/or materials, various flaws).

OLTC failure occurs due to the insulation degradation and contacts failure inside it.

The worn contacts will cause hotspots in the OLTC tank and cause the insulating oil to degrade faster. Consequently, this will lead to the damage of complete transformer unit. Thus, the research work that has been carried out applied three different stages related to the diagnosis of OLTC.

The software organizations have {{to ensure that the}} quality of their developed products is what the customers expect. Thus, the organizations have to verify that the product is functioning as expected and validate that the product is what the customers expect. Empirical studies have shown that in many software development projects as much as half of the projected schedule is spent on the verification and validation activities. The research in this thesis focuses on exploring the state of practice of the verification and validation process and investigating methods for achieving efficient fault detection during the software development. The thesis aims at increasing the understanding of the activities conducted to verify and validate the software products, by the means of empirical research in the software engineering domain. A survey of eleven Swedish software development organizations investigates the current state of practice of the verification and validation activities, and how these activities are managed today.

Semantic issues are discussed and notations based on natural and graphical languages are provided, which allow a hierarchical structure and enable representation at different abstraction levels.

40|$|Background. Several {{researchers}} {{have criticized the}} standards of performing and reporting empirical studies in software engineering. In order to address this problem, Andreas Jedlitschka and Dietmar Pfahl have produced reporting guidelines for controlled experiments in software engineering. They pointed out that their guidelines needed evaluation. We agree that guidelines need to be evaluated {{before they can be}} widely adopted. If guidelines are flawed, they will cause more problems that they solve. Aim. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the method we used to evaluate the guidelines and report the results of our evaluation exercise. We suggest our evaluation process may be of more general use if reporting guidelines for other types of empirical study are developed. Method. We used perspective-based inspections to perform a theoretical evaluation of the guidelines. A separate inspection was performed for each perspective. The perspectives used were: Researcher, Practitioner/Consultant, Meta-analyst, Replicator, Reviewer and Author. Apart from the Author perspective, the inspections were based on a set of questions derived by brainstorming. The inspection using the Author perspective reviewed each section of the guidelines sequentially. Results. The question-based perspective inspections detected 42 issues where the guidelines would benefit from amendment or clarification and 8 defects. Conclusions. Reporting guidelines need to specify what information goes into what section and avoid excessive duplication. Software engineering researchers need to be cautious about adopting reporting guidelines that differ from those used by other disciplines. The current guidelines need to be revised and the revised guidelines need to be subjected to further theoretical and empirical <b>validation.</b> Perspective-based <b>inspection</b> is a useful validation method but the practitioner/consultant perspective presents difficulties...|$|R

When instrumentation such as accelerometers and electronically scanned pressure modules is required, temperature control of these devices needs to be incorporated into the design, which requires added effort. Additional thermal analyses and subsystem tests may be necessary, which also adds to the design costs.

40|$|International audienceFor air {{transport}} navigation, VOR systems are crucial: they give to aircraft their direction {{with respect to}} North. However, this information can be deteriorated by nearby obstacles, which yield multipaths. Signals coming from unwanted directions are processed by the on-board VOR receiver, which modify the displayed bearing. In this context, we propose and validate a method hybridizing the parabolic equation method (PE) with physical optics (PO) to compute the VOR multipath error. The modelling follows four steps. First, the field is calculated on the wind turbines using PE. One PE simulation is performed for each wind turbine. Second, the currents on the scatterers are calculated from the PE incident field. Third, the field radiated by the currents is computed on the receiver by PO. Finally, a VOR error is applied by considering the multipaths and the direct field. With this method, simulations account for a possible hilly terrain and a generic model of wind turbines that includes dielectric blades. Besides, the output is the VOR error, which is easily interpretable for the {{air transport}} community. As an example, {{the case of a}} specific wind farm will be presented.

Most existing validations use the direct approach of comparing renderings with real scenes and are usually briefly described. We propose a colorimetric validation using radiometrically calibrated photographs as valid perceptual references of the real scene, which avoids taking spectral measurements of the scene.

We sought to develop a next-generation constraint-based E. coli model that achieved improved phenotypic prediction accuracy while being frequently updated and easy to use. We also sought to compare model predictions with experimental data to highlight open questions in E. coli biology. Results: We present EcoCyc- 18. 0 -GEM, a genome-scale model of the E. coli K- 12 MG 1655 metabolic network. The model is automatically generated from the current state of EcoCyc using the MetaFlux software, enabling the release of multiple model updates per year. EcoCyc- 18. 0 -GEM encompasses 1445 genes, 2286 unique metabolic reactions, and 1453 unique metabolites. We demonstrate a three-part validation of the model that breaks new ground in breadth and accuracy: (i) Comparison of simulated growth in aerobic and anaerobic glucose culture with experimental results from chemostat culture and simulation results from the E. coli modeling literature. (ii) Essentiality prediction for the 1445 genes represented in the model, in which EcoCyc- 18. 0 -GEM achieves an improved accuracy of 95. 2 % in predicting the growth phenotype of experimental gene knockouts. (iii) Nutrient utilization predictions under 431 different media conditions, for which the model achieves an overall accuracy of 80. 7 %. The model's derivation from EcoCyc enables query and visualization via the EcoCyc website, facilitating model reuse and <b>validation</b> by <b>inspection.</b> We present an extensive investigation of disagreements between EcoCyc- 18. 0 -GEM predictions and experimental data to highlight areas of interest to E. coli modelers and experimentalists, including 70 incorrect predictions of gene essentiality on glucose, 80 incorrect predictions of gene essentiality on glycerol, and 83 incorrect predictions of nutrient utilization. Conclusion: Significant advantages can be derived from the combination of model organism databases and flux balance modeling represented by MetaFlux.

The OLS regression models, based on theoretical molecular descriptors, are calculated for Henry's law constant, melting point, subcooled liquid vapor pressure, water solubility, octanol-air partition coefficient, and octanol-water partition coefficient. These models can be useful to predict the big amount of missing data and to plan safer alternatives to dangerous BFRs. The innovative aspect of the proposed models, compared to those already published in the literature, is their development according to the OECD principles for regulatory acceptability of QSARs. This includes the validation for predictivity (both by internal and external statistical <b>validation)</b> and the <b>inspection</b> of the applicability domain...|$|R
