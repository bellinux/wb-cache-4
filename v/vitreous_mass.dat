40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the effects of mechanical activation and temperature on the dissolution process of a Portuguese Class F fly ash was developed. The evolution of the silica and alumina dissolved and transferred to the aluminosilicate gel was characterised. Quantification of bulk <b>vitreous</b> <b>mass</b> was performed using X-ray diffraction, together with the identification of the most relevant amorphous phases dissolved. The breakage process is responsible for further modifications of the original particle than just the exposure of additional surface area and increased structural disorder. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld amorphous bulk quantification proved to be an inadequate methodology to quantify the effects of mechanical activation. Increasing dissolution temperature proved to be very effective in terms of bulk mass dissolved, with higher dissolution values after 16 h, at 80 C, than after 90 days, at 20 C. The semi empirical Avrami model was found to be satisfactorily fitted to the experimental data regarding the dissolution percentage as a function of time. Compressive strength evolution was found {{to be related to the}} release of amorphous bulk phases, and in particular to the transfer of aluminium into the aluminosilicate gel, throughout the entire curing period of 90 days...|$|E
40|$|The full {{excavation}} of the fortified Chalcolithic settlement of Moita da Ladra {{by one of}} us (J. L. C.) has shown {{the existence of a}} single archaeological layer corresponding to the occupation of the site {{during the second half of}} the 3 rd millennium BC. Among the archaeological remains collected during the field campaigns there is a bead, with a spheroid shape, longitudinally fractured, presenting a black matrix with numerous whitish spots. The fracture presents a vitreous greasy surface, and exposes a suspension cylindrical bore. Various techniques were used to identify the material that was used in the manufacture of the artifact, including CHN elemental analysis, EDXRF, μ-PIXE and XRD, conducted by the other authors. It was found that the material is not organic (carbon is absent), presenting significant amounts of the elements Si, K, Ca, Ti, Fe, Sr, Zr, and Sb. The X-ray diffraction spectra indicates that the material has an essentially vitreous nature, being the whitish particles dispersed in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>mass</b> identified as quartz. μ-PIXE results show a chemical composition that is consistent with an artificial glass, which implies a much more recent chronology for the bead than that of the Chalcolithic archaeological layer where it was recovered. Thus, although the bead was recorded from a Chalcolithic context, its provenance must be ascribed to the Late Bronze Age occupation recorded nearby and resulting from the early Phoenician trade. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that Apollo 14 type breccias lithify by sintering of particles of matrix glass under stress-free conditions. Meteorite impacts generate the heat necessary for sintering. Compacted angular particles of glass with {{the composition of}} an Apollo 14 rock were sintered experimentally. Loose clods of sub 37 micron grains form in several days at 700 C. Synthetic rocks, which texturally resemble the breccias, were produced at 795 C and above in 7. 5 hours. Glass devitrified with increasing temperature. At 850 C, devitrification prevents much further densification of the synthetic breccias after 2 hours. Experiments compressing glass at 500 bars at 600 C produced dense <b>vitreous</b> <b>masses</b> which did not resemble lunar breccias. Confining pressure does not {{play a major role}} in lithifying the breccias. It is concluded that Apollo 14 type lunar breccias form at shallow depths at 800 C+ in a period of minutes to days...|$|R
5000|$|The {{synthetic}} {{investigation of}} rocks proceeds by experimental work {{that attempts to}} reproduce different rock types and to elucidate their origins and structures. In many cases no experiment is necessary. Every stage in the origin of clays, sands and gravels {{can be seen in}} process around us, but where these have been converted into coherent shales, sandstone and conglomerates, and still more where they have experienced some degree of metamorphism, there are many obscure points about their history upon which experiment may yet throw light. Attempts have been made to reproduce igneous rocks, by fusion of mixtures of crushed minerals or of chemicals in specially contrived furnaces. The earliest researches of this sort are those of Faujas St Fond and of de Saussure, but Sir James Hall really laid the foundations of this branch of petrology. He showed (1798) that the whinstones (diabases) of Edinburgh were fusible and if rapidly cooled yielded black <b>vitreous</b> <b>masses</b> closely resembling natural pitchstones and obsidians, if cooled more slowly they consolidated as crystalline rocks not unlike the whinstones themselves and containing olivine, augite and feldspar (the essential minerals of these rocks).|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} vitreous gel structure after lens extirpation combined with anterior vitrectomy in rabbit eyes. METHODS: Twenty-eight chinchilla rabbits were divided into three groups. The control group (Group I) included 16 eyes from eight rabbits who did not receive any treatment. Group II included 20 eyes from 10 rabbits that underwent lens aspiration only. Group III included 20 eyes from 10 rabbits that underwent lens aspiration combined with posterior capsulotomy and anterior vitrectomy. Eyes were harvested on the 30 th and 60 th day postoperatively, respectively. Changes in vitreous gel stretch length due to gravity {{and the rate of}} vitreous liquefaction were observed. The collagen content in the vitreous body was examined using the L-hydroxyproline test. Electronic microscopic images were obtained from each eyeball. RESULTS: On both the 30 th and 60 th day postoperatively, the vitreous gel length of group III was significantly shorter than group I and group II (P< 0. 05), while the rate of liquefaction of the vitreous body in group III was significantly higher than group I and group II (P< 0. 05). The collagen content in group III was also higher than that in group I and group II (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Loss of <b>vitreous</b> gel <b>mass</b> is more likely to occur in the eyes of rabbits receiving anterior vitrectomy. Lensectomy combined with anterior vitrectomy may damage the stable three-dimensional mesh structure of collagen, which could aggravate vitreous gel liquefaction...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} first case of {{endogenous}} Klebsiella endophthalmitis associated with liver abscess in Iran. Case Report: A 79 -year-old man was referred to our hospital due to severe pain and visual loss in the left eye. On physical examination, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, hypopyon and severe vitreous cellular reaction were identified in the left eye; however, yellowish conjunctival discoloration was more apparent in the right eye. Abdominal CT scan showed a right liver lobe abscess that was confirmed by sonographically guided percutaneous liver <b>mass</b> biopsy. Blood, <b>vitreous</b> and liver <b>mass</b> aspirate cultures revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae growth. The patient was thus diagnosed with endogenous Klebsiella endophthalmitis secondary to bacteremia associated with liver abscess. Conclusion: This report suggests that, rather than being confined to Taiwan, endogenous endophthalmitis secondary to a liver abscess due to K. pneumoniae may be a global problem. Therefore, physicians {{should be aware of}} the possibility of endophthalmitis whenever a patient with K. pneumoniae liver abscess complains of ocular symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic {{measurements}} {{have been}} implemented in past years in the Cultural Heritage Field with the aim to improve the diagnostic process of a monument prior to any restoration. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study regarding the application of non-destructive ultrasonic techniques in evaluating the conservation state of the Dolmen Sa Coveccada in northern Sardinia (Italy). The study was carried out within the framework of a relevant project of restoration of megalithic monuments promoted by the Soprintendenza per i Beni Archeologici di Sassari (Italy) (National Archaeological Authority of Sassari – Italy), Comunità Montana di Monte Acuto (Mountain Community Administration of Monte Acuto) and Comune di Mores (Local Town Authority of Mores) (Italy). The study Dolmen is a megalithic structure of great historic and scientific importance and is the only example of its kind in Sardinian archaeology (Italy). It is made of the dacites of the Oligo-Miocene calcalkaline volcanic cycle of northern Sardinia. At the petrographic microscope, the volcanic rocks present a porphyric vitrophyric structure and an isotropic texture, with phenocrystals of plagioclase (often united in glomerocrystals), quartz, biotite, amphibole, clinopyroxene and sanidine, included in a <b>vitreous</b> fluidal <b>mass</b> with laminar flow, glass shards and spherulitic devitrification. In the femic minerals, which are more unstable at environmental temperature and pressure, intense oxidation has caused an increase in microporosity and microcracks which at the macroscale have triggered some important forms of degradation such as exfoliation and fissuration that have drastically changed the stability and safety of the monument. In this context the use of the ultrasonic techniques was very effective both to define the elasto-mechanical properties of the building materials such as longitudinal ultrasonic velocity, quality index and fracture coefficient, and to detect the presence of discontinuities caused by degradation phenomena and cracks. In addition, the ultrasonic techniques were used in laboratory on samples of the same volcanic building materials of the Dolmen to investigate the repairing efficiency of chemical consolidating materials such as epoxidic resins and to test their compatibility with the investigated materials. The selected epoxidic resin (EPO 150) was applied on fresh-cut dacite volcanic samples so that changes on elasto-mechanical properties were also evaluated in time...|$|R
