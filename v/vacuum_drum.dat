50|$|At the time, Ferranti was in {{the midst}} of {{developing}} the DATAR system for the Royal Canadian Navy. DATAR was a <b>vacuum</b> tube-based <b>drum</b> memory computer that stored and collected data for display. Radar and sonar operators on any of the ships in a convoy could send contact reports to DATAR using a trackball-equipped display that sent the data over a UHF PCM radio link. DATAR stored the data on the drum and periodically sent out the complete dataset to the ships, which plotted them on local displays, rotated and scaled for that ship's position in the convoy. The result was a single unified picture of the entire battlefield that could be seen on any of the ships, even those without direct contact with the targets.|$|R

50|$|Rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> filter (RVDF), {{patented}} in 1872, {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} filters used in the industrial liquid-solids separation. It offers a wide range of industrial processing flow sheets and provides a flexible application of dewatering, washing and/or clarification.|$|E
5000|$|The rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> filter designs {{available}} vary {{in physical}} aspects and their characteristics. The filtration area ranges from 0.5 m2 to 125 m2. Disregarding {{the size of}} the design, filter cloth washing is a priority as it ensures efficiency of cake washing and acting vacuum. However, a smaller design would be more economical as the maintenance, energy usage and investment cost would be less than a bigger rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> filter.Over the years, the technology drive has pushed development to further heights revolving around rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> filter in terms of design, performance, maintenance and cost. This has also {{led to the development of}} smaller rotary drum vacuum filters, ranging from laboratory scale to pilot scale, both of which can be used for smaller applications (such as at a lab in a university) [...] High performance capacity, optimised filtrate drainage with low flow resistance and minimal pressure loss are just a few of the benefits. With advanced control systems prompting automation, this has reduced the operation of attention needed hence, reducing the operational cost. Advancements in technology also means that precoat can be cut to 1/20th the thickness of human hair, thus making the use of precoat more efficient [...] Lowered operational and capital cost can also be achieved nowadays due to easier maintenance and cleaning. Complete cell emptying can be done quickly with the installation of leading and trailing pipes.Given that the filter cloth is usually one of the more expensive component in the rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> filter build up, priority on its maintenance must be kept quite high. A longer lifetime, protection from damage and consistent performance are the few criteria that must not be overlooked.Besides considering production cost and quality, cake washing and cake thickness are essential issues that are important in the process. Methods have been performed to ensure a minimal amount of cake moisture while undergoing good cake washing with large cake dewatering angle. An even thickness of filter cake besides having a complete cake discharge is also possible. 611 ...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear grade {{ammonium}} diuranate (ADU) and UO powders were produced on a pilot plant scale by the continuous single-stage precipitation of ADU with ammonium hydroxide, dewatering with a rotary <b>drum</b> <b>vacuum</b> filter or a solid bowl centrifuge, and batch-tray drying and calcination-reduction to UO powder. Precipitation at 50 ºC and pH {{values in the}} range 7. 2 to 8. 0 produced ADU materials which could be converted to UO powder by calcination and reduction at temperatures of 600 to 730 ºC, and fabricated into sintered pellets with densities of 10. 37 to 10. 77 g cm- 3. The lower the pH of precipitation the lower was the reduction temperature required to achieve a specified pellet density. Precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 80 ºC and with ammonia gas at 50 ºC offered no advantages over precipitation with ammonium hydroxide at 50 ºC. The UO 2 powders and sintered pellets produced from ADU powders precipitated by the three methods were similar. Precipitation at pH 7. 5 and 50 ºC is recommended since a reasonably filterable precipitate can be produced reproducibly without a need for stringent control, and considerable flexibility {{is available in the}} subsequent production of a sinterable UO 2 powder. Dewatering of ADU slurries was carried out more efficiently using a solid bowl centrifuge rather than a rotary <b>drum</b> <b>vacuum</b> filter.

50|$|As {{the drum}} rotates {{into and out}} of the trough, the slurry is sucked on the surface of the cloth and rotated out of the liquid/solids {{suspension}} as a cake. When the cake is rotating out, it is dewatered in the drying zone. The cake is dry because the <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> is continuously sucking the cake and taking the water out of it. At the final step of the separation, the cake is discharged as solids products and the drum rotates continuously to another separation cycle.|$|E

50|$|Generally, {{the main}} {{process in a}} rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum</b> filter is {{continuous}} filtration whereby solids are separated from liquids through a filter medium by a vacuum. The filter cloth {{is one of the}} most important components on a filter and is typically made of weaving polymer yarns. The best selection of cloth can increase the performance of filtration. Initially, slurry is pumped into the trough and as the drum rotates, it is partially submerged in the slurry. The vacuum draws liquid and air through the filter media and out the shaft hence forming a layer of cake. An agitator is used to regulate the slurry if the texture is coarse and it is settling rapidly. Solids that are trapped on the surface of the drum are washed and dried after 2/3 of revolution, removing all the free moisture 6.|$|E
40|$|The {{sewage sludge}} from {{wastewater}} treatment plant is a potential source of infectious organism. The number and type of pathogens in sludge depends on various factors namely, the wastewater source, the type of treatment plant, and other environmental {{factors such as the}} biological medium offered by the sewage sludge. The principal sludge- borne diseases are presented followed by discussion on biological aspect of growth and occurrence. The overall objective of this work is to estimate kinetic reduction of pathogen population in sludge during different thermal-drying process including: the agitated conductive drying, drum drying, solar drying, and fry-drying. The temperature curves were reported from literature except frying data which were determined in experiment. In order to apply the temperature inﬂuence on pathogens population, kinetic parameters for the thermal inactivation (D, z-values) were chosen from literature. Values of concentrations of each pathogen were also extracted from scientiﬁc review of pathogens in bio-solids. This study conducted to resolve the survival kinetic of Hepatitis A viruses. The result showed that a concentration of 7 × 104 cfu/ 100 ml initially present in the sewage sludge is signiﬁcantly reduced during the heat drying processes except the solar plant.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc. Field {{tests to}} {{evaluate}} in-line dosing with bentonite followed by centrifugation {{as an alternative}} to batch fining for protein haze control in white wine or juice were undertaken. The tests were performed at a commercial winery with a Sultana wine and Gordo (Muscat of Alexandria) juice and using two types of bentonite: Vitiben and SIHA-Active-Bentonite G. Fining performance was monitored by heat testing and quantification of heat unstable protein by HPLC. Heat test turbidity and heat unstable protein concentration decreased to stable values between 30 s and 2 min after bentonite injection. Sensory evaluation of Sultana wine fined with Vitiben by balanced reference duo-trio difference tests detected no difference between untreated, in-line dosed, and batch fined wine. Furthermore the volume of wine or juice occluded in lees can be substantially reduced by centrifugal compaction. However, incomplete separation of bentonite from wine or juice during centrifugation produced a carryover of 30 % of the added bentonite into the clarified wine. This carryover problem may be mitigated, inter alia, by reducing operating flowrate through the centrifuge or using multiple centrifugation steps (in parallel or series). Therefore, in-line dosing followed by centrifugation provides a rapid processing method for protein haze reduction in wine or juice with a decreased volume of lees. It can reduce significant value losses presently arising in the wine industry from batch fining and the resulting quality downgrades that occur in wine recovered from bentonite lees by rotary <b>drum</b> <b>vacuum</b> filtration.

40|$|Protein-induced wine haze is a {{major concern}} to the wine {{industry}} worldwide. While the presence of protein haze is unlikely to affect the sensory profile, consumers will generally reject wines containing hazes as they appear microbially spoiled. Consequently, an important step during commercial winemaking is to treat wines with bentonite, which removes heat unstable proteins by adsorption, and prevents haze formation. Whilst this process is effective, it is claimed to adversely affect the quality of the treated wine under certain conditions. Furthermore, 5 - 10 % of the wine volume is typically occluded in bentonite lees. This wine is either lost or substantially diminished in quality and value during recovery. Therefore the development of alternative and economically viable process technologies that maintain wine quality and reduce costs would be highly desirable. This thesis is concerned with the development of alternative and innovative approaches to bentonite treatment of wine. Particular emphasis was placed on developing practical research outcomes that could be readily commercially adopted. Pursuant to this, fundamental research regarding the mechanics of protein adsorption onto bentonite was undertaken to gain an understanding of how bentonite properties relate to adsorption and settling behaviour in wine. The effect of bentonite heat treatment on protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour in a model wine was also investigated. In general, heating was found to increase the initial hindered settling velocity and reduce both protein adsorption capacity and the final volume of lees. Particle size, pH and cation exchangeability of bentonites and the changes that occur to these properties on heating are related to the nature of bonding between cations and the clay surface, as are protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour. Partial Least Squares (PLS) Analysis showed that the variance in individual cation exchangeability and the total cation exchange capacity was primarily responsible for the observed variance in protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour. PLS analysis was also used to develop correlations for the prediction of adsorption and settling behaviour, based on the physical and chemical properties of the bentonites tested. Qualitative comparison of the volume fraction of model wine occluded by each of the bentonites indicated that certain heat treatments may result in a combination of protein adsorption performance and settling behaviour which would produce a significant reduction in wine loss. The effect of different factors on adsorption of a purified grape protein (VVTL 1) in a model wine was investigated using a factorial design approach with surface response analysis. Adsorption of VVTL 1 by sodium bentonite was well characterised by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. pH, temperature, potassium concentration ([K]), and the pH*[K]interaction were all found to have a significant effect (p < 0. 05) on the adsorption capacity. Block effects appeared to correctly correlate with bentonite slurry age, suggesting that increasing slurry age may {{have a positive effect on}} adsorption capacity. Ethanol concentration, phenolic (caffeic acid and catechin) oncentration, sugar (glucose and fructose) concentration, as well as the pH*temperature and temperature*[K] interactions did not have a significant effect. The equilibrium constant was found to be independent of the factors studied. This may be explained by changes in protein structure and charge with pH, which affect electrostatic interaction with the bentonite surface. Variation in potassium concentration can cause similar effects and may also influence adsorption capacity by affecting bentonite swelling and zeta potential. This knowledge was applied to the development of in-line dosing of bentonite as an alternative process strategy for commercial use. Field tests of in-line dosing at a commercial winery were conducted on a Sultana wine and Gordo (Muscat of Alexandria) juice with Vitiben and SIHA-Aktiv-Bentonit G bentonites. Fining performance was monitored by heat testing and quantification of heat unstable protein by HPLC. Heat test turbidity and heat unstable protein concentration were reduced in a similar manner upon fining. These reductions were achieved with a contact time of less than two minutes. Sensory evaluation of Sultana wine fined with Vitiben by balanced reference duo-trio difference tests did not detect any difference between untreated, in-line dosed and batch fined wine. A dynamic simulation model of in-line dosing was developed and compared with field trial results, marking the first quantitative study of the dynamic adsorption kinetics of wine protein adsorption onto bentonite. The simulation results confirmed the rapid adsorption behaviour observed during field testing, and provided strong evidence that protein adsorption occurs predominantly on the external particle surface only, with adsorption kinetics being limited by external-film mass transfer. Incomplete separation of bentonite from wine/juice during centrifugation produced a carryover of up to 30 % of the added bentonite into the clarified wine. If this problem can be overcome, use of in-line dosing instead of batch fining could eliminate significant value losses presently arising from quality downgrades of wine recovered from bentonite lees by rotary <b>drum</b> <b>vacuum</b> filtration. Moreover, in-line dosing of selected heattreated bentonites under optimal wine or juice conditions may provide even further costs savings whilst maintaining wine quality. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The so-called ‘Single cell oils’ (SCO), oils produced by micro-organisms: yeasts, algae, fungi and bacteria, are well known in this context.

This {{is one of the main}} limiting factors to make them commercially attractive for the production of bio fuels. Cryptococcus curvatus, the used model organism, is a yeast with industrial potential because it can grow and accumulate lipid (up to 50 %) on a very broad range of substrates. Traditionally yeast cells are harvested by centrifugation and further dewatered with a combination of different techniques (e. g. rotary <b>vacuum</b> <b>drum,</b> fluidized bed,…).

Centrifuged yeast (dry weight 20 %) is enveloped in two layers of cloth: a filter cloth with pore size 5 μm and a cotton absorbent cloth. This envelop is compressed using a series of consecutive roller pairs to expel excess water. The pressure is enhanced gradual by diminishing the spacing in the roller pairs.
