Such investigations were carried out in the absence and in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH), as a thiol-donor. Two different biodegradative pathways were identified, in the former case leading to aromatic ring cleavage, side chain oxidation and dimerization, while in the latter case <b>veratraldehyde</b> was recovered as the only metabolite...|$|E
