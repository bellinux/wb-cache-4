Of 67 patients with intracerebral lesions who had 2 different DTI scans, 3 DTI series were reconstructed to compare the effects of NGD and SR. Tractographies for 4 clinically relevant tracts (corticospinal tract, superior longitudinal fasciculus, optic radiation, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) were constructed with a probabilistic tracking algorithm and automated region of interest placement and compared for 3 quantitative measurements: tract <b>volume,</b> <b>median</b> fiber density, and mean fractional anisotropy, using linear mixed-effects models. The mean tractography volume and intersubject reliability were visually compared across scanning protocols, to assess the clinical relevance of the quantitative differences. Both NGD and SR significantly influenced tract <b>volume,</b> <b>median</b> fiber density, and mean fractional anisotropy, {{but not to the}} same extent. In particular, higher NGD increased tract <b>volume</b> and <b>median</b> fiber density. More importantly, these effects further increased when tracts were affected by disease.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare Data Mining diagnosis with clinical diagnosis by applying a Data Miner (DM) to a clinical dataset of infertile men with azoospermia. DESIGN: One hundred and forty-seven azoospermic men were clinically classified into four groups: a) obstructive azoosper-mia (n= 63), b) non-obstructive azoospermia (n= 71), c) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (n= 2), and d) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (n= 11). The DM (IBMs DB 2 /Intelligent Miner for Datafi 6. 1) was asked to reproduce a four-cluster model. RESULTS: DM formed four groups of patients: a) eugonadal men with normal testicular volume and normal FSH levels (n= 86), b) eugonadal men with significantly reduced testicular <b>volume</b> (<b>median</b> 6. 5 cm 3) and very high FSH levels (n= 29), c) eugonadal men with moderately reduced testicular <b>volume</b> (<b>median</b> 14. 5 cm 3) and raised FSH levels (n= 20), and d) hypogonadal men (n= 12).

Material/Methods: Fourteen-month-old female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into an exercised group (EG) and a non-exercised group (NG). The EG rats were trained on treadmill running for 4 or 14 months. The NG rats were housed under identical conditions without running. Spatial learning and memory were assessed with the Morris water maze. The cortical capillary parameters were quantitatively investigated using immuno-histochemical and stereological methods. Results: The escaped latencies of the EG were significantly different from those of the NG in 18 -month-old females and 28 -month-old males (p 0. 05). In 28 -month-old female rats, stereological techniques showed significant differences between the EG and NG in the cortical capillary <b>volume</b> (<b>median,</b> 22. 55 vs. 11. 42, p< 0. 05) and the cortical capillary surface area (median, 7474. 13 vs. 3935. 90, p< 0. 05).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the precision of}} three-dimensional ultrasonography (3 DUS) in estimating the ipsilateral lung volume and the potential of this measurement to predict neonatal death in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods: Between January 2002 and December 2004, the ipsilateral lung volumes were assessed by 3 DUS using the technique of rotation of the multiplan imaging in 39 fetuses with CDH. The observed/ expected ipsilateral lung volume ratios (o/e-IpsiFLVR) were compared to the lung/head ratios (LHR) and to the observed/ expected total fetal lung volume ratios (o/e-TotFLVR) {{as well as to}} postnatal death. Results: Ipsilateral lung <b>volumes</b> (<b>median</b> 0. 12, range 0. 01 - 0. 66) were more reduced than the total lung <b>volumes</b> (<b>median</b> 0. 52, range 0. 11 - 0. 95, p 0. 05). The sensitivity, speci-ficity, (positive and negative) predictive values and accuracy of o/e-IpsiFLVR in predicting neonatal death was 52. 6 % (10 / 19), 83. 3 % (10 / 12), 83. 3 % (10 / 12), 52. 6 % (10 / 19) and 64. 5 % (20 / 31), respectively. Conclusion: Although the ipsilateral lung volume can be measured by 3 DUS, it cannot be used to predict neonatal death when considering it alone.

As part of this study, continuous particle size and mass concentration data were collected in four single-family homes, with each home monitored for one or two 6 -day periods. Additionally, housing activity and air exchange rate data were collected. Cooking, cleaning, and the movement of people were identified as the most important indoor particle sources in these homes. These sources contributed significantly both to indoor concentrations (indoor-outdoor ratios varied between 2 and 33) and to altered indoor particle size distributions.

Reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of brain tissue are associated with reductions in regional CBF in animal stroke models. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and radiological features of patients with severe reductions in CBF on MRI and to analyze the relationship between reduced CBF and ADCs in acute ischemic stroke. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Referral center. METHODS: We studied 17 patients with nonlacunar acute ischemic stroke in whom perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were performed within 7 hours of symptom onset. A PWI-DWI mismatch of more than 20 % was required. We compared patients with ischemic lesions that had CBF of less than 50 % relative to the contralateral hemisphere with patients with lesions that had relative CBF greater than 50 %. Characteristics analyzed included age, time to MRI, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, mean ADC, DWI and PWI lesion volumes, and 1 -month Barthel Index score. RESULTS: Patients with low CBF (n = 5) had lower ADC values (median, 430 x 10 (- 6) mm(2) /s vs. 506 x 10 (- 6) mm(2) /s; P =. 04), larger DWI <b>volumes</b> (<b>median,</b> 41. 8 cm(3) vs. 14. 5 cm(3); P =. 001) and larger PWI lesions {{as defined by the}} mean transit time <b>volume</b> (<b>median,</b> 194. 6 cm(3) vs. 69. 3 cm(3); P =. 01), and more severe baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (median, 15 vs. 9; P =. 02).

The pretreatment MRI or CT scan was {{used to calculate the}} primary tumor <b>volume.</b> <b>Median</b> follow-up was 19. 8 months. RESULTS: The average primary tumor volume was 37. 0 cm(3) (range, 2. 1 - 182. 7 cm(3); median, 28. 7 cm(3)). Multivariate analysis showed a significant effect of tumor volume on local control. The hazard ratio for a local recurrence increased by 14 % per 10 cm(3) volume increase (95 % CI, 8 % to 21 %). There was no significant independent effect of T and N status on local control. CONCLUSION: For advanced HNSCC, tumor volume is more powerful for predicting outcome after CCRT than TNM status...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{a system}} for the {{collection}} of bioaerosols emitted from the mail sorting process was designed and characterized. Two different wetted-wall cyclones, the JBPDS cyclone and the glass cyclone sampler (GCS), were evaluated as system collection devices. These devices operate at 780 L/min and have a D 50 of ~ 1 ?m. A trimming impactor with a D 50 of 10 ?m was used upstream of the collection devices. Using two reference probes, the cyclone liquid outputs were compared with aerosol collected on filters and the output of an Aerosol-to-Hydrosol Transfer Stage (AHTS). The mass emission rate of the postal sorting machine was 3. 15 mg/min and found not to vary significantly with flow rates above 700 L/min. On average, greater than 66 % of the mass collected had a Da < 10 ?m. Using a Coulter Counter, the <b>volume</b> <b>median</b> diameter (<b>volume</b> equivalent) for both device hydrosol outputs was 4. 18 ?m. For the effluent aerosol, the <b>volume</b> <b>median</b> diameter was 12. 5 ?m. For a bioaerosol release, this study found that greater than 65 % (by volume) of the material released had a Da greater than 7. 2 ?m. Using filters, {{it was found that}} on average, 95 % of the bioaerosol particles emitted had a Da less than 10 ?m. According to the reference data, the expected number of bioaerosol particles in 1. 5 times that collected by the GCS and 5. 5 times that collected by the JBPDS cyclone for a one milligram release. The time constant for the system in response to a letter release was found to be 1. 3 minutes for the GCS and 1. 75 minutes for the JBPDS cyclone. A final note to this study states that the probe dimensions were incorrectly developed, therefore affecting the aspiration efficiency of the probes. In turn, this may have affected the outcome of some of the results. A plot is given {{at the end of the}} paper showing to what extent the results may have been affected. It is recommended that further experimental studies be performed to verify the results in this study...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of a measurement method, applicable to a poly-dispersion of particles, {{in which the}} intensity of scattered light at any angle is weighted by a factor proportional to that angle. Determination is then made of four angles at which the weighted intensity is four fractions of the maximum intensity. These yield four characteristic diameters, i. e., the diameters of the volume/area mean (D sub 32 the Sauter mean) and the volume/diameter mean (D sub 31); the diameters at cumulative volume fractions of 0. 5 (D sub v 0. 5 the <b>volume</b> <b>median)</b> and 0. 75 (D sub v 0. 75). They also yield the volume dispersion of diameters. Mie scattering computations show that an average diameter less than three micrometers cannot be accurately measured. The results are relatively insensitive to extraneous background light and {{to the nature of}} the diameter distribution. Also described is an experimental method of verifying the conclusions by using two microscopic slides coated with polystyrene microspheres to simulate the particles and the background...|$|R
