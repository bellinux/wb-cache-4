5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers widened, straightened, and deepened the canal. As part {{of their}} work, the agency {{constructed}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> bridge across the canal. Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle turns in Chesapeake City. The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> bridge on July 28, 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission established a ferry service across the canal. Between 1946 and 1949, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present tied arch Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> Bridge was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> Bridge included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E

5|$|The Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> Bridge was renovated in 2006 {{and began}} regular service on April 2, 2007, sixteen {{years after the}} bridge closed.

5|$|In November 1957, the Arthur Kill {{swing bridge}} was damaged by an Esso oil tanker, and was {{replaced}} by a state-of-the-art, single track, 558 foot <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> bridge in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E

30|$|We then {{discuss how}} the {{findings}} {{can be used}} to develop power-assist devices to manipulate heavy materials in actual industrial environments. Note that as a preliminary initiative, we here consider <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> only as it is common in industries, humans feel heaviness more in <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting,</b> and it needs more power assistance. We also explain how the proposed approach can be augmented to 6 -DOF dexterous manipulation. The presented 1 -DOF design seems to be simple, but we think that such design may be sufficient to address the objectives, and achieve the core innovations.|$|R

Although the installation of a <b>vertical</b> platform <b>lift</b> {{is similar to that}} of an elevator it's much less expensive.

5|$|Beyond West Brighton near a NYCDEP water {{pollution}} control facility, the line rose onto a reinforced concrete trestle {{known as the}} Port Richmond Viaduct, crossing Bodine Creek and running for about a mile through the Port Richmond neighborhood. West of Nicholas Avenue near Port Richmond High School, the line entered an open cut, crossing under the Bayonne Bridge approach and continued west to the Arlington Yard and station at South Avenue. Rapid transit service continued via a northern spur to Port Ivory; freight service passed the current Howland Hook Marine Terminal (adjacent to Port Ivory) and crossed the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> Bridge to Cranford Junction in New Jersey. The right-of-way from the Port Richmond Viaduct to Arlington Yard has remained intact and in good condition, though the former station sites and infrastructure are dilapidated and need rehabilitation or replacement should passenger service be reactivated.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, US 213 was realigned {{to cross}} the Choptank River at Cambridge on the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge that opened in 1935. The route {{replaced}} MD 344 between Vienna and Mount Holly, ran concurrent with MD 16 between Mount Holly and Cambridge, and turned north across the river to continue to Easton. The former routing of US 213 between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. Also, US 213 was relocated to a new alignment to the north between West Ocean City and Ocean City. In 1939, the road between US 40 and the northern terminus of US 213 in Elkton and the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill was designated MD 280. The portion of MD 280 between Fair Hill and the Pennsylvania border was built as a state highway by 1933. On July 28, 1942, the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> bridge carrying US 213 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, built in 1927, was destroyed when the tanker Franz Klasen struck it. The destroyed bridge {{was replaced by the}} current Chesapeake City Bridge, which opened in 1949. The approaches to the original bridge are now designated as MD 537 and a western extension of MD 285. A portion of US 213 south of Easton was moved to a straight alignment by 1946; the former routing became MD 565. By 1946, work was underway for a bypass to the east of Easton along with a straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills. US 213 was moved to this new alignment in 1948, with the former alignment on Washington Street in Easton becoming an extended MD 333 {{in the southern part of}} the city and an extended MD 33 in the northern part the city, while MD 662 was designated on the original alignment between Easton and Wye Mills.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 1957, {{four years}} after North Shore Branch {{passenger}} trains ended, the very last SIRT special—a train from Washington carrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to the Staten Island Ferry from a state meeting in Washington, D.C. with President Eisenhower—crossed the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> Bridge. There was a royal train and a press train and they traveled over the Reading Railroad and the B to get to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. Since British royalty was being transported, the movement was done in secrecy with high security. The trains reached the Camp by traveling via the Port Reading Branch of the Reading Railroad. In order to travel to Staten Island, which required traveling over the Arthur Kill swing bridge, the two trains had to be reconfigured. Done at the Camp, the two diesel locomotives in the front were dropped from the two consists, allowing the trains to pass over the bridge, which had a limited load capacity. Awaiting {{the return of the}} equipment from Staten Island, the two diesel trains were sent to Cranford Junction. On the morning of October 21, the press train, consisting of 10 cars, left the Camp in New Jersey and traveled to the SIRT via the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The royal train, which was constructed by Pullman Standard, followed an hour later. These two trains terminated at the Stapleton freight yard, which was cleaned up for the occasion. Each of the trains were hauled back to Cranford Junction by a SIRT switcher after the Queen's motorcade left the yard. The trains, that afternoon, then went south to Baltimore.|$|E
