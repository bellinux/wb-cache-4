5|$|A plaque {{placed on}} the miller's house in 1973 to {{celebrate}} the 100th birthday of miller Gerardus <b>van</b> Hoorn commemorates both fires. <b>Van</b> Hoorn had known the Dutch painter Vincent <b>van</b> Gogh, who lived in nearby Nuenen from 1883 until 1885. <b>Van</b> Gogh painted several paintings around the mill, including an 1884 painting of the mill itself, Water Mill at Opwetten (F48). In a video interview in 1973, <b>Van</b> Hoorn {{said that he had}} seen <b>Van</b> Gogh paint and had supplied him with bird nests for his paintings.|$|E

5000|$|... 5. Shuttle <b>Vans</b> - Shuttle <b>vans</b> {{are very}} similar to {{traveling}} <b>vans,</b> but with a different purpose and with a different seat configuration. While traveling <b>vans</b> are used by families, shuttle <b>vans</b> are usually used by businesses. These <b>vans</b> are traditionally used for taxis, school buses, limousines, airport buses, and for law enforcement.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the {{traditional}} small <b>vans</b> ceased in 1962 due to declining traffic and a surplus of wagons. When construction of general merchandise <b>vans</b> resumed around 1970, these were the air-braked VAA/VBA/VCA/VDA family of 20' 9" [...] wheelbase <b>vans.</b> The last mass-produced merchandise <b>vans</b> built for British Rail were the 29' 6" [...] wheelbase VGA class sliding-wall <b>vans</b> of the early 1980s. Subsequent <b>vans</b> used in the UK have mostly been large (usually bogie) sliding-wall <b>vans</b> of continental design.|$|R
50|$|Insulated <b>Vans</b> (for meat), Meat <b>Vans</b> (ventilated {{for fresh}} meat), Insulfish <b>vans</b> (insulated for fish traffic - these had longer wheelbases {{so that they}} could be {{operated}} at higher speeds), Fruit <b>Vans</b> (ventilated <b>vans</b> for fruit traffic) and Banana <b>Vans</b> (unventilated and fitted with steam heating apparatus to warm and ripen the load, which was picked before ripening) were all specialist types for specific types of perishable goods traffic.|$|R
5|$|Although <b>van</b> der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's {{name is not}} {{recorded}} {{in any of the}} early inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in <b>van</b> der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion dress and the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of <b>van</b> der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (<b>van</b> der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E

5|$|At the Boels Rental Hills Classic <b>Van</b> Dijk {{was part}} of front group that {{consisted}} of six riders which fell apart into {{a group of three}} riders. With an uphill finish, <b>Van</b> Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). <b>Van</b> Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, <b>Van</b> Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek <b>van</b> Vleuten (Rabo Liv). <b>Van</b> Dijk was disappointed and responded that she was not that good as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{because of}} the {{experiences}} encountered during rebuilding of the C <b>vans,</b> {{a new set of}} 15 C <b>vans</b> was built, numbered one to fifteen. These <b>vans</b> were intended for freight service. The remaining old C <b>vans</b> in that number range were renumbered to make room, but stayed as C <b>vans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vans</b> {{for special}} loads {{included}} shock-absorbing <b>vans</b> {{with the body}} anchored to the underframe by springs (diagrams V27 and V28) and grain hoppers (V20).

Motor cars were loaded through doors in the ends of 'Asmo', 'Damo' and 'Mogo' <b>vans</b> (G24-G32, G43), also the bogie 'Bocar' (G33-G38, G44, G45).|$|R

The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady <b>Van</b> Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady <b>Van</b> Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the <b>Van</b> Garretts, who then sold it to the <b>Van</b> Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill <b>Van</b> Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined <b>Van</b> Garrett and <b>Van</b> Tassel estates.|$|E
50|$|These letters (except Y and Z) did {{not usually}} apply to passenger-rated but goods {{carrying}} <b>vans</b> (e.g. parcels <b>vans,</b> horse boxes, milk and fish <b>vans).</b> Their codes were an acronym {{of their traditional}} railway description, e.g. GUV for General Utility <b>Vans.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1942 two Guard's <b>vans</b> {{were built}} on the same 56 ft type {{underframe}} to create <b>vans</b> to match the 56 ft carriage stock. The first two <b>vans</b> had narrow vestibules at both ends, and a further 19 <b>vans</b> built in 1943-44 only had this at one end. These <b>vans</b> were used on principal expresses in both Islands until the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|When {{construction}} of the 'D' <b>vans</b> stopped, the number group was from 1D to 265D. However, there were far more <b>vans</b> that this in total, {{because many of the}} earlier <b>vans</b> had been scrapped and replaced by new <b>vans</b> which took the same numbers. Eventually around 750 <b>vans</b> were constructed (not counting duplicates); and from 1888 bogie vehicles were constructed with a central cupola and two ends matching the D type design; these <b>vans</b> were called the DD class, later C class.|$|R

A RS Spyder from <b>Van</b> Merksteijn Motorsport driven by Jeroen Bleekemolen, Peter <b>van</b> Merksteijn and Jos Verstappen, came first in class and 10th overall with the Essex team coming second in class (12th overall). A RS Spyder won its class in every LMS race giving it a 1-2-3 in the LMP2 standing and securing the drivers championship for Jos Verstappen and the Team championship for <b>Van</b> Merksteijn Motorsport.|$|E

In 1896, the Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited John Peter Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell had been {{a close friend of}} <b>Van</b> Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's work, and gave him a <b>Van</b> Gogh drawing. Influenced by <b>Van</b> Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.|$|E

50|$|Panel <b>vans</b> {{were first}} offered by Holden from December 1953 in the FJ model, and by Ford Australia from May 1961, {{based on the}} XK Falcon. Painters, electricians, and general labourers quickly found panel <b>vans</b> ideal for their trades, as the cargo bay {{offering}} extended capacity otherwise wasted in passenger space, and a highly customisable interior, without the bulk or extended dimensions of other longer-base <b>vans.</b> Australian police forces also purchased fleets of panel <b>vans</b> to use in a black maria, or paddywagon, role. These were known formally as Divisional <b>Vans</b> and in slang as Divvy <b>Vans.</b>|$|R

5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob <b>Van</b> Dam in a No Disqualification match. Both wrestlers used a ladder {{to their advantage}} early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on <b>Van</b> Dam, he attempted to hit <b>Van</b> Dam with a flying clothesline. However, <b>Van</b> Dam {{moved out of the}} way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. <b>Van</b> Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a folding chair. Following this, <b>Van</b> Dam attempted to hit Kane with a <b>Van</b> Daminator with a chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. <b>Van</b> Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught <b>Van</b> Dam in mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered <b>Van</b> Dam for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Kane and Rob <b>Van</b> Dam faced La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvan Grenier) for the World Tag Team Championship. This {{was the final}} {{pay-per-view}} that featured a masked Kane. La Résistance gained the early advantage when Grenier performed a DDT RVD. Kane and <b>Van</b> Dam, however, regained control when Kane chokeslammed Duprée. Towards the end, Kane brawled with Grenier and Duprée at ringside, prompting <b>Van</b> Dam to perform an aerial technique onto ringside. La Résistance, however, avoided the attack resulting in <b>Van</b> Dam landing on Kane. In the ring, while Kane was still at ringside, La Resistance performed a double spinebuster on <b>Van</b> Dam, proceeding into a pinfall to win the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
