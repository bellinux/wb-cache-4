50|$|In {{common with}} other power {{steering}} systems, {{the control valve}} is of the rotary type and consists of a valve rotor and torsion bar. The valve rotor is the input shaft to the steering gear and has six longitudinal grooves machined into its outer surface.

50|$|The {{sleeve valve}} {{is a type}} of valve {{mechanism}} for piston engines, distinct from the usual poppet <b>valve.</b> <b>Sleeve</b> valve engines saw use in a number of pre-World War II luxury cars and in the United States in the Willys-Knight car and light truck. They subsequently fell from use due to advances in poppet-valve technology, including sodium cooling, and the Knight system double sleeve engine's tendency to burn a lot of lubricating oil or to seize due to lack of it. The Scottish Argyll company used its own, much simpler and more efficient, single sleeve system (Burt-McCollum) in its cars, a system which, after extensive development, saw substantial use in British aircraft engines of the 1940s, such as the Napier Sabre and Bristol Hercules and Centaurus, only to be supplanted by the jet engine.|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Perry Li, Thomas Chase. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 182 pages. The research {{described in this}} dissertation focuses {{on the development of}} innovative on/off valves for high performance, high efficiency control of fixed displacement hydraulic pumps and motors. On/off valves, the hydro-mechanical equivalent of transistors, enable the application of digital control techniques found in electrical systems to hydraulics. These techniques, such as pulse-width-modulation (PWM), have the potential of combining the low cost, high bandwidth characteristics of valve control with the efficiency of variable displacement machines. Effective control of hydraulic systems using PWM requires that the on/off valve simultaneously exhibits fast switching speed, large flow area, and low actuation power. The valves developed in this dissertation exploit continuous rotary motion to achieve the desired, and traditionally competing, operating characteristics. A helical land is used to mechanically embed the desired PWM functionality into the valve spool. The rotary motion of the valve performs the switching functionality while its axial motion determines the PWM duty ratio. Several unique rotary valve concepts are presented in this dissertation for switched-mode pump and pump/motor circuits. An analysis framework is developed that predicts valve performance and typical losses which can be used for design and optimization. Physics based dynamic models of switched-mode pump and motor circuits are also developed for simulating system pressures and flow rates and for validating the analytical models. In addition, guidelines for sizing the <b>valve</b> <b>sleeve</b> based on fatigue considerations are formulated to aid prototype design. Prototype hardware is fabricated and extensively tested to validate the analysis, performance, and predicted efficiency of the proposed valves. The research in this dissertation verifies that helical land rotary valves used in switched-mode hydraulic circuits are capable of exceeding the efficiency of comparable metering valve circuits at moderate PWM frequencies. In two comparable systems, the switched-mode circuit achieved 84 % efficiency at 50 % output flow compared to 50 % efficiency in the bleed off circuit. Analysis also shows that substantial gains in efficiency and switching frequency can be attained with improvements in valve configuration, circuit configuration, and valve geometry. Additional suggestions for further improving efficiency in switched-mode hydraulic systems are also discussed...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> {{can operate}} {{for long periods}} of time over a high {{differential}} pressure across the valve. When a cavitation condition does exist the cavitation takes place surrounded by water. Unlike other valves, air is not necessary to control or suppress the cavitation. Because of this a single <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> can replace several standard valves used in series.Sleeve valves can control flow and/or pressure over the entire stroke of the valve. Conventional control valves can typically control flow or pressure in the 20% to 80% range. Additionally, unlike conventional control <b>valves</b> the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> increases flow incrementally, i.e. 10% increase in stroke leads to a 10% increase in flow. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> are adaptive to system or consumer requirements. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> is designed to meet the requirements and allow for a wide range of variability of function. Most conventional control valves are designed to a specific set of conditions.|$|R
50|$|From 1910 Panhard {{worked to}} develop engines without {{conventional}} valves, using under license the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> technology {{that had been}} patented by the American Charles Yale Knight. Between 1910 and 1924 the Panhard & Levassor catalogue listed plenty of models with conventional valve engines, but these were offered alongside cars powered by <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> power units. Following various detailed improvements to the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> technology by Panhard's own engineering department, from 1924 till 1940 all Panhard cars used <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engines.|$|R

[...] A number of <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> aircraft engines were developed following this paper, notably by Napier, Bristol and Rolls-Royce.

50|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> are {{generally}} more expensive than other types of control <b>valves.</b> Typically, <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> are employed in situations where they would replace multiple valves in series or where frequent maintenance may be required,Sleeve valves need to be used where large debris is not expected in the system. As the orifice holes are relatively small, it is possible and likely that any trash in system will collect in front of sleeve {{or even in the}} nozzles themselves.

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of sleeve valves: inline, angle pattern and {{downflow}} pattern. Inline <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> {{can be installed}} in the pipeline or {{at the end of}} the pipeline for free discharge. Inline <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> have an inlet section which allows upstream media to flow into an outer annular area. The flow then takes a 90° turn through the sleeve and collides with flow from the opposite side dissipating the energy. The flow then travels downstream through an exit spool on the downstream end. The angle pattern <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> is installed at a 90° bend in place of an elbow. Angle pattern <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> employ a similar design as the inline <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> by creating an outer annular area to contain the media and a sleeve with tapered nozzles to pass the flow. The difference is that the flow direction after passing through the sleeve changes by 90°. Downflow pattern <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> are installed at the end of a pipeline and discharge into sumps, reservoirs, stilling wells or tanks. Unlike inline and angle pattern the discharge of a downflow pattern is outward and is not contained by the valve itself.|$|R
5|$|The three {{cylinders}} of each bogie {{were cast}} in mono-block format, each surrounded by two annular inlet steam chests {{and a single}} large outlet steam chest. These had the added function of keeping the cylinder heated by hot steam to maintain the temperature and pressure of steam entering the cylinders. However, these castings were difficult to machine accurately. The steam-sealing arrangements needed for this system were also complex, {{with each of the}} six cylinders and <b>valve</b> <b>sleeves</b> requiring 24 sealing rings.|$|R
50|$|Where radial engines {{have used}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valves</b> (notably {{those of the}} Bristol Engine Company), the junk head was the usual design of head.

50|$|Turbine bypass - when a valve {{is needed}} to bypass an energy {{recovery}} turbine, a <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> can minimize upstream and downstream pressure surges by slowly opening and closing in proportion with the turbine.
