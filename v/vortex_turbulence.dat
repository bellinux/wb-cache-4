40|$|The various source {{mechanisms}} which generate broadband noise on a {{range of}} rotors are reviewed. Analyses of these mechanisms are presented and compared to existing experimental data. The sources considered are load fluctuations due to inflow turbulence, due to turbulent blade boundary layers passing the trailing edge, and due to tip <b>vortex</b> formation <b>turbulence.</b> <b>Vortex</b> shedding noise due to laminar boundary layers and blunt trailing edges is not considered in detail as it can be avoided in most cases.

Better knowledge of the inflow turbulence improves the accuracy of the predictions. Inflow turbulence noise depends strongly on ambient conditions and dominates at low frequencies.

40|$|A trapped Bose-Einstein condensate, being {{strongly}} perturbed, exhibits several spatial structures. First, {{there appear}} quantum vortices. Increasing {{the amount of}} the injected energy leads to the formation of vortex tangles representing quantum <b>vortex</b> <b>turbulence.</b> Continuing energy injection makes the system so strongly perturbed that vortices become destroyed and there develops another kind of spatial structures with essentially heterogeneous spatial density.

40|$|As {{the growth}} in air travel {{continues}} over the coming decades, there {{will need to be}} increases in the capacity of the airspace system, especially airports. Technology associated with GPS, along with changes in procedures between air traffic controllers and pilots, has the capability to provide much of the required growth without sacrificing safety and without requiring wholesale expansions of airport land areas.

40|$|One of {{the longest}} {{standing}} unsolved problems in physics relates to the behavior of fluids that are driven far from equilibrium such as occurs when they become turbulent due to fast flow through a grid or tidal motions. In turbulent flows the distribution of vortex energy {{as a function of}} the inverse length scale [or wavenumber 'k'] of motion is proportional to 1 /k(sup 5 / 3) which is the celebrated law of Kolmogorov. Although this law gives a good description of the average motion, fluctuations around the average are huge. This stands in contrast with thermally activated motion where large fluctuations around thermal equilibrium are highly unfavorable. The problem of turbulence is the problem of understanding why large fluctuations are so prevalent which is also called the problem of 'intermittency'. Turbulence is a remarkable problem in that its solution sits simultaneously at the forefront of physics, mathematics, engineering and computer science. A recent conference [March 2002] on 'Statistical Hydrodynamics' organized by the Los Alamos Laboratory Center for Nonlinear Studies brought together researchers in all of these fields. Although turbulence is generally thought to be described by the Navier-Stokes Equations of fluid mechanics the solution as well as its existence has eluded researchers for over 100 years. In fact proof of the existence of such a solution qualifies for a 1 M$ millennium prize. As part of our NASA funded research we have proposed building a bridge between <b>vortex</b> <b>turbulence</b> and wave turbulence. The latter occurs when high amplitude waves of various wavelengths are allowed to mutually interact in a fluid. In particular we have proposed measuring the interaction of ripples [capillary waves] that run around on the surface of a fluid sphere suspended in a microgravity environment. The problem of ripple turbulence poses similar mathematical challenges to the problem of <b>vortex</b> <b>turbulence.</b> The waves can have a high amplitude and a strong nonlinear interaction. Furthermore, the steady state distribution of energy again follows a Kolmogorov scaling law; in this case the ripple energy is distributed according to 1 /k (sup 7 / 4). Again, in parallel with <b>vortex</b> <b>turbulence</b> ripple turbulence exhibits intermittency. The problem of ripple turbulence presents an experimental opportunity to generate data in a controlled, benchmarked system. In particular the surface of a sphere is an ideal environment to study ripple turbulence. Waves run around the sphere and interact with each other, and the effect of walls is eliminated. In microgravity this state can be realized for over 2 decades of frequency. Wave turbulence is a physically relevant problem in its own right. It has been studied on the surface of liquid hydrogen and its application to Alfven waves in space is a source of debate. Of course, application of wave turbulence perspectives to ocean waves has been a major success. The experiment which we plan to run in microgravity is conceptually straightforward. Ripples are excited on the surface of a spherical drop of fluid and then their amplitude is recorded with appropriate photography. A key challenge is posed by the need to stably position a 10 cm diameter sphere of water in microgravity. Two methods are being developed. Orbitec is using controlled puffs of air from at least 6 independent directions to provided the positioning force. This approach has actually succeeded to position and stabilize a 4 cm sphere during a KC 135 segment. Guigne International is using the radiation pressure of high frequency sound. These transducers have been organized into a device in the shape of a dodecahedron. This apparatus 'SPACE DRUMS' has already been approved for use for combustion synthesis experiments on the International Space Station. A key opportunity presented by the ripple turbulence data is its use in driving the development of codes to simulate its properties...|$|E
