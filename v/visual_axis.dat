5|$|Meier has {{exploited}} the two naturally-occurring ridges (which diverge at a 22.5 degree angle) by overlaying two grids along these axes. These grids serve {{to define the}} space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it. Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings. Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus. The main north-south axis starts with the helipad, then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings, continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station, through the rotunda, past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion, and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden. Its corresponding east-west <b>visual</b> <b>axis</b> starts with the edge of the scholar's wing of the Getty Research Institute (GRI), the walkway between the central garden and the GRI, the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden, the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion, and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of PCI over ultrasound biometry {{is that the}} axial length measurement is performed through the <b>visual</b> <b>axis</b> since the patient is asked to fixate into the laser spot. In highly myopic or staphylomatous eyes, this can be particularly advantageous since it can sometimes be difficult to measure the true axial length through the <b>visual</b> <b>axis</b> with an ultrasound probe. PCI is also superior to ultrasound in the measurement of pseudophakic and silicone oil-filled eyes. For optical biometry, {{it is not as}} critical how the media change because the correction factor that must be applied is much smaller than in ultrasound biometry. It {{should be noted that the}} axial length obtained from PCI may be slightly longer than that obtained from ultrasound. This is due to PCI measuring the distance from the corneal surface to the RPE while ultrasound measures to the anterior retinal surface. Therefore, many IOL measurement machines require refined IOL constants unique to their mechanism.|$|E

40|$|A tilted {{furnished}} room can induce strong visual reorientation illusions in stationary subjects. Supine subjects may perceive themselves upright when {{the room is}} tilted 90 degrees so that the <b>visual</b> polarity <b>axis</b> is kept aligned with the subject. This 'upright illusion' was used to induce roll tilt in a truly horizontal, but perceptually vertical, plane. A semistatic tilt profile was applied, in which the tilt angle gradually changed from 0 degrees to 90 degrees, and vice versa. This method produced larger illusory self-tilt than usually found with static tilt of a visual scene. Ten subjects indicated self-tilt by setting a tactile rod to perceived vertical. Six of them experienced the upright illusion and indicated illusory self-tilt with an average gain of about 0. 5. This value is smaller than with true self-tilt (0. 8), but comparable to the gain of visually induced self-tilt in erect subjects. Apparently, the contribution of nonvisual cues to gravity was independent of the subject's orientation to gravity itself. It therefore seems that the gain of visually induced self-tilt is smaller because of lacking, rather than conflicting, nonvisual cues. A vector analysis is used to discuss the results in terms of relative sensory weightings...|$|R
2500|$|Light travels {{from the}} {{fixation}} {{object to the}} fovea through an imaginary path called the <b>visual</b> <b>axis.</b> The eye's tissues and structures {{that are in the}} <b>visual</b> <b>axis</b> (and also the tissues adjacent to it) affect the quality of the image. These structures are: tear film, cornea, anterior chamber, pupil, lens, vitreous, and finally the retina. The posterior part of the retina, called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is responsible for, among many other things, absorbing light that crosses the retina so it cannot bounce {{to other parts of the}} retina. Interestingly, in many vertebrates, such as cats, where high visual acuity is not a priority, there is a reflecting tapetum layer that gives the photoreceptors a [...] "second chance" [...] to absorb the light, thus improving the ability to see in the dark. This is what causes an animal's eyes to seemingly glow in the dark when a light is shone on them. The RPE also has a vital function of recycling the chemicals used by the rods and cones in photon detection. If the RPE is damaged and does not clean up this [...] "shed" [...] blindness can result.|$|E
2500|$|When {{performed}} with a YAG laser {{designed specifically for}} vitreolysis, reported side effects and complications associated with vitreolysis are rare. However, YAG lasers have traditionally been designed {{for use in the}} anterior portion of the eye, i.e. posterior capsulotomy and iridotomy treatments. As a result, they often provide a limited view of the vitreous, which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes. They also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue. Accordingly, vitreolysis is not widely practised, being performed by very few specialists. One of them, John Karickhoff, has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 percent success rate. However, the MedicineNet web site states that [...] "there is no evidence that this [...] is effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye." [...] A YAG laser optimized for use in the posterior segment, in addition to use in the anterior segment, is recommended for vitreolysis. In order to visualize the floater and target accordingly, the laser's light source must be positioned in the same optical axis as the ophthalmologist's <b>visual</b> <b>axis.</b> Most conventional YAG lasers, in contrast, use a lower angle of illuminating light. Whilst these lasers are well-suited to use in the anterior part of the eye, they are ill-equipped for use in the vitreous chamber, and thereby make it difficult for the ophthalmologist to visualize (and treat) the floater(s).|$|E
50|$|However, Bruecke objected Einthoven's theory {{based on}} the grounds that not all people see red as closer than blue. Einthoven {{explained}} that this negative chromostereopsis is probably due to eccentrically positioned pupils because shifting the pupil can change the position of where light wavelengths focus in the eye. Negative chromostereopsis was further studied by Allen and Rubin who suggested that changing the angle between the pupillary center and <b>visual</b> <b>axis</b> can change the direction of chromostereopsis. If the pupillary center is located temporal to the <b>visual</b> <b>axis,</b> red will appear closer. The reverse effect is observed when the pupillary center is nasal to the <b>visual</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: As well as obtaining {{confirmation}} of the magnocellular system involvement in Developmental dyslexia (DD); the aim was primarily {{to search for a}} possible involvement of the parvocellular system; and, furthermore, to complete the assessment of the <b>visual</b> chromatic <b>axis</b> by also analysing the koniocellular system. METHODS: Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in response to achromatic stimuli with low luminance contrast and low spatial frequency, and isoluminant red/green and blue/yellow stimuli with high spatial frequency were recorded in 10 dyslexic children and 10 age- and sex-matched, healthy subjects. RESULTS: Dyslexic children showed delayed VEPs to both achromatic stimuli (magnocellular-dorsal stream) and isoluminant red/green and blue/yellow stimuli (parvocellular-ventral and koniocellular streams). To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that a dysfunction of colour vision has been brought to light in an objective way (i. e., by means of electrophysiological methods) in children with DD. CONCLUSION: These results give rise to speculation concerning the need for a putative approach for promoting both learning how to read and/or improving existing reading skills of children with or at risk of DD. The working hypothesis would be to combine two integrated interventions in a single programme aimed at fostering the function of both the magnocellular and the parvocellular streams...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the reference frames used to plan arm movements. Specifically, we asked whether the body <b>axis,</b> <b>visual</b> cues and graviception can each {{play a role in}} defining "up" and "down" in the planning and execution of movements along the vertical axis. Horizontal and vertical pointing movements were tested in two postures (upright and reclined) and two visual conditions (with and without vision) to identify possible effects of each of these cues on kinematics of movement. Movements were recorded using an optical 3 D tracking system and analysis was conducted on velocity profiles of the hand. Despite a major effect of gravity, our analysis shows an effect of the movement direction with respect to the body axis when subjects were reclined with eyes closed. These results suggest that our CNS takes into account multimodal information about vertical in order to compute an optimal motor command that anticipates the effects of gravity...|$|R

Recent data indicate that peptide YY is a gut hormone that also modulates bone metabolism. Increasing evidence is obtained on the role of afferent gastrointestinal nerves, especially the vagal nerve, in the modulation of the functions of the gut-brain axis. The gut-brain axis is involved in a multitude of physiological processes including satiety, food intake, regulation of glucose and fat metabolism, insulin secretion and sensitivity and bone metabolism.

40|$|Human {{exploration}} of Mars {{is a key}} goal in NASA's exploration planning in the next 20 years. Maintaining crew health and good vision is certainly {{an important aspect of}} achieving a successful mission. Continuous radiation exposure is a risk factor for radiation-induced cataracts in astronauts because radiation exposure in space travel has the potential of accelerating the aging process (ref. 1). A patented compact device (ref. 2) based on the technique of dynamic light scattering (DLS) was designed for monitoring an astronaut's ocular health during long-duration space travel. This capability of early diagnosis, unmatched by any other clinical technique in use today, may enable prompt initiation of preventive/curative therapy. An Internet web-based system integrating photon correlation data and controlling the hardware to monitor cataract development in vivo at a remote site in real time (teleophthalmology) is currently being developed. The new technology detects cataracts very early (at the molecular level). Cataract studies onboard the International Space Station will be helpful in quantifying any adverse effect of radiation to ocular health. The normal lens in a human eye, situated behind the cornea, is a transparent tissue. It contains 35 wt % protein and 65 wt % water. Aging, disease (e. g., diabetes), smoking, dehydration, malnutrition, and exposure to ultraviolet light and ionizing radiation can cause agglomeration of the lens proteins. Protein aggregation can take place anywhere in the lens, causing lens opacity. The aggregation and opacification could produce nuclear (central portion of the lens) or cortical (peripheral) cataracts. Nuclear and posterior subcapsular (the membrane's capsule surrounds the whole lens) cataracts, being on the <b>visual</b> optical <b>axis</b> of the eye, cause visual impairment that can finally lead to blindness. The lens proteins, in their native state, are small in size. As a cataract develops, this size grows from a few nanometers (transparent) to several micrometers (cloudy). Ansari and Datiles have shown that DLS can detect cataracts at least two to three orders of magnitude earlier noninvasively and quantitatively than the best imaging (Scheimpflug) techniques in clinical use today (ref. 3) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{so-called}} self–other correspondence {{problem in}} imitation demands {{to find the}} transformation that maps the motor dynamics of one partner to our own. This requires a general purpose sensorimotor mechanism that transforms an external fixation-point (partner’s shoulder) reference frame to one’s own body-centered reference frame. We propose that the mechanism of gain-modulation observed in parietal neurons may generally serve these types of transformations by binding the sensory signals across the modalities with radial basis functions (tensor products) {{on the one hand}} and by permitting the learning of contextual reference frames on the other hand. In a shoulder–elbow robotic experiment, gain-field neurons (GF) intertwine the visuo-motor variables so that their amplitude depends on them all. In situations of modification of the body-centered reference frame, the error detected in the visuo-motor mapping can serve then to learn the transformation between the robot’s current sensorimotor space and the new one. These situations occur for instance when we turn the head on its <b>axis</b> (<b>visual</b> transformation), when we use a tool (body modification), or when we interact with a partner (embodied simulation). Our results defend the idea that the biologically-inspired mechanism of gain modulation found in parietal neurons can serve as a basic structure for achieving nonlinear mapping in spatial tasks as well as in cooperative and social functions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} the {{influence}} of visual scene on both arm end point accuracy and spatial path kinematics was evaluated. Eight subjects, immersed in a virtual environment, were required to point to one of ten targets located at two distances and in five directions. Targets were presented in frameworks of different complexity. The simplest framework was constituted by a uniform background, the most complex framework was constituted by a perspective-arranged grid. In the other two conditions it consisted of lines having a direction parallel to either the subject's sagittal or frontal body axis. Movements were executed without vision of both target and framework. The results showed that pointing movements were hypometric in all conditions. No difference in end point localization was observed between movements executed after presentation of the simplest and the most complex scenes. However, hypometria significantly increased when the scene was formed by lines parallel to the subject's sagittal <b>axis.</b> <b>Visual</b> information on the scene was also used to specify hand path parameters. Trajectory curvature increased with decreasing complexity of the framework. Correspondingly, the pointing kinematics varied. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} visual analysis of cues surrounding the target can influence both target localisation and hand path planning. However, scene complexity is directly related only to determining trajectory curvature. We conclude that planning an arm movement consists of at least two processes: target localisation and hand path specification.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{underline}} {{the changes in the}} movement perception for early glaucoma. Our working hypothesis consisted in inquiring if the impairment of the magnocellular pathway may modify the movement perception capabilities in the visual field, more particularly in its peripheral area. Methods: We included 14 healthy subjects and 14 patients with early primary open angle glaucoma. A moving target was presented on a semicircular screen (1. 8 m diameter); participants were asked to localize the Ending Point (EP) of each movement. Each stimulus consisted in a white dot (0, 72 ° of diameter) moving horizontally with the imposed velocity profile. Two different laws of motion were displayed: a “biological” motion corresponding to the recording of an arm pointing movement, consisting in a bell-shaped velocity profile, and a “non-biological” motion corresponding to a constant velocity profile. The study field was divided into 4 quadrants and 2 eccentricities: EP may be displayed in the “peri-central” (10 ° from the foveal axis) or peripheral (20 ° from the foveal <b>axis)</b> <b>visual</b> field. Two trajectories length were presented (10 ° and 20 °). Each stimulus with same characteristics was displayed two times. Thus the experiment was constituted by 192 trials, presented in a random order. For every participant we calculated the PCE (Position Constant Error) which was defined as the average difference between the estimation of the EP indicated by the participant versus the true location of the same target. The PVE (Position Variable Error) was defined as the standard deviation of the responses of each participant. Results: All the participants overestimated the EP (13. 23 ± 8. 87 mm for healthy subjects and 17. 06 ± 13. 07 mm for glaucoma patients, p = 0. 2518). The PVE was 28. 14 ± 6. 86 mm for healthy subjects and 40. 95 ± 9. 83 mm for glaucoma patients (p = 0. 0004). There was {{a significant difference in the}} PVE for both groups when stimulus moved accordingly to the “non-biological” velocity profile (p = 0. 0001). Glaucoma patients had substantial PVE increase when the target image had a “non-biological” speed profile (p = 0. 0388). Conclusions: This study desrcibed disorders in movement perception and localization in patients with early glaucoma. Particularly, the unexpected lack of difference between normal subjects and patients in localizing a moving stimulus strongly suggested that the visual deficiency could be partly compensated by endogenous informations...|$|R
40|$|This practice-based {{research}} {{sets out}} to explore new ways of visualizing and conceptualizing the notion of aura in art. It departs from Walter Benjamin’s widely known critique of aura, the thesis {{of which is that}} aura as ‘uniqueness’ of an artwork decays with the rise of technological reproducibility. Benjamin affirms with the decay of aura also the loss of the transposition of religious projections of distance onto fascist politics. His thesis had a major influence on contemporary critical theory where aura is still approached with great reservations. These concern a relapse into religious structures, which mirror, so the thesis argues, the fact that aura has been, also in Benjamin’s ambivalent conceptualization, left ‘territorialized’ in a regime of transcendence in art. The main research question has been: What could aura mean for painting in the expanded field, especially in relation to digital imaging? The outcomes of this research are paintings, works on paper (both involving the input of digital sources), digital films and writings. The thesis develops a reading and visual ‘mapping’ of aura in the framework of Gilles Deleuze’s (and Félix Guattari’s) ontology of immanence where difference and its repetition as differentiation replaces the static metaphysics of ‘origin’ or ‘essence’. Splendor Solis, a series of book illuminations from the Northern Renaissance proved to become a major visual source for experimentation. Aura is introduced in this alchemical work as the ‘splendour’ of Becoming, the deframing power of the differential processes that accompany individuation. As a sensation experienced in intuitive art practice, aura affects and is affected by a field of interacting multiplicities and the potentiality of temporal differentiations, which reach beyond any ascertained subjectivity into virtual collective questions and problems. Aura suggests as an ‘echo’ of Becoming an involvement with affects, and the research follows strands between qualitative intense moments that activate a ‘wound’ and extend to what Deleuze calls a ‘wound that existed before me’, an experience related to the synthesis of future, which confronts an individual with its emerging double. Constructing, or ‘mapping’ aura as <b>visuals</b> on an <b>axis</b> that involves media of ‘uniqueness’ and digital technology gives those outcomes an ontological status of ‘simulacra’ or assemblages, far from the traditional associations aura would evoke. Touching both experience and experiment, so the thesis argues, aura in immanence can provide an access to the virtualities of the ‘new’ in art practice. The research introduces a visual scenario or ‘conceptual persona’ for intuition, which as method of this research folds both practice and writing. Friedrich Hölderlin’s unfinished play Empedocles at Etna, provides a metaphor or metamorphosis encompassing aura’s and intuition’s involvement with immediacy and duration. The practice documentation of the thesis reflects the strands of the research as plurality of its differentiations, allowing the dynamics of its method in action to reflect the dynamics of aura.
