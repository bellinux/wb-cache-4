40|$|Background: Although {{high-density}} resequencing microarray {{is useful}} for detection and tracking the evolution of viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, no report on using this technology {{for the detection of}} viruses in patients with conjunctivitis is available. Objectives: To test if high-density resequencing microarray can be applied to detection of viruses in conjunctival swabs for patients with conjunctivitis. Study design: In this prospective proof-of-concept study, every 4 or 5 bacterial culture-negative conjunctival swab samples were pooled and subject to viral detection using TessArray™ Resequencing Pathogen Microarrays-Flu 3. 1 (RPM-Flu- 3. 1). Results were compared with human adenovirus (HAdV) hexon gene PCR sequencing and viral culture. Results: Thirty-two of the 38 conjunctival swab samples were bacterial culture-negative. Four of the 7 pooled samples were positive for HAdV using RPM-Flu- 3. 1. Hexon gene PCR sequencing on the 38 original individual samples showed that 3 and 4 samples contained HAdVs species D and B respectively. All the 6 samples that were positive for hexon gene PCR but negative for bacterial culture were also positive by the resequencing microarray. Viral culture was positive for HAdV type 3 in 1 sample, which was also positive by PCR and resequencing microarray. Conclusions: Resequencing microarray is as sensitive as PCR for detection of HAdV in conjunctival swabs. Unlike viral culture and hexon gene PCR sequencing, resequencing microarray was not able to differentiate the type and species of HAdV.

40|$|There is {{significant}} evidence {{that patients with}} acute eye symptoms are poorly assessed in primary care. There {{is a tendency to}} diagnose <b>viral</b> or bacterial <b>conjunctivitis</b> in any acutely red eye. This has led to delays in treatment and in some cases, permanent loss of sight. The aim of this project was to improve acute eye consultations within the Birchwood Medical Practice. The project focused on the "red flag" findings that would identify patients who require referral for same-day ophthalmology assessment. A retrospective baseline audit was carried out on all cases read-coded "conjunctivitis " over the period of one year. Initially, only 2. 8 % of consultations had documented all four findings. By considering the main factors that lead to poor eye assessments, two main areas for improvement were identified. These were education (reinforced with memory aids) and improving the availability of eye examination equipment within each consultation room. An "eye examination kit " was developed with the needs of the general practitioner in mind. The practice was re-audited six weeks following the intervention. Consultations where all four red flag findings were documented rose from 2. 8 % to 50 %. This was found to be a statistically significant difference (p < 0. 01). Pain was checked 63 % of the time, compared to 26 % prior to intervention. Visual acuity screening had increased to from 35 % to 69 %.

40|$|INTRODUCTION : <b>Viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> is most {{commonly}} {{seen in the}} outpatient department. A variety of viruses which are responsible for conjunctival infection, of which Adenovirus is the most common. It is highly contagious during the first 2 weeks of infection. It can cause corneal involvement within 4 - 5 days after the onset of symptoms. Corneal lesions range from SPK (Superficial Punctat e Keratitis) to epithelial defects. These corneal lesions may cause intense photophobia and impairment of vision. AIM : To find out the commonest etiological agent, to study the clinical features and complications related to it. METHODOLOGY : This study was carried out prospectively. 100 patients who came to outpatient department between October 2013 to October 2014 {{were enrolled in the}} study. All the age groups and both the genders were included. Patients underwent slit lamp examination and were diagnosed cl inically. 25 cases were submitted for Gram staining and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) study to know the type of virus and serotype. RESULT : 100 patients were diagnosed with <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and were kept on follow up. 21 percent of patients developed SPK. Adenovirus 8 was found to be more common than other viruses.

40|$|Background: <b>Viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> are {{the most}} {{frequent}} infections in ophthalmology clinics. The diagnosis is usually relying on clinical findings and medical history. However, topical antibiotics are often used unnecessarily addition to symptomatic treatment because of unsure agents. We aimed to detect the Adenovirus, Coxsackievirus and Enterovirus from conjunctiva and pharyngeal samples of patients. Methods: The conjunctiva and pharyngeal samples of the patients with conjunctivitis were taken by Virocult transport media and kept at − 80  ̊C up to study day. Adenovirus spp, Enterovirus 70 and Enterovirus 71, Coxsackie A 24 and Coxsackie A 16 were detected by real-time PCR. Samples from healthy health care workers of ophthalmology clinic were used for control group. Results: A total of 176 samples (conjunctival and pharyngeal samples of 62 patient and 26 healthy subjects) were included. The mean age of 34 (55. 7 %) male and 27 (44. 3 %) female patients was 34  ±  17. Twenty five (40. 3 %) of the patients were receiving antibiotic drops at first visit. The main etiologic agent in conjunctival samples {{was found to be}} Adenovirus (46 / 62, 74. 2 %) followed by Enterovirus 70 (4 / 62, 6. 4 %) and Enterovirus 71 (4 / 62, 6. 4 %). Coxsackievirus 16 and 24 were also found in 2 patients (1 / 62 each, 1. 6 %). Pharyngeal samples were also positive for Adenovirus (20 / 62, 32. 3 %), Enterovirus 70 and 71 (7 / 62, 11. 3 % and 5 / 62, 8. 1 % respectively), Coxsackievirus 16 and 24 (2 / 62, 3. 2 % and 1 / 61, 1. 6 %). Conclusions: It is very difficult in <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> to make clinical differentiation caused by different agents because of common clinical signs and symptoms. In routine clinical work, the <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> usually related with Adenovirus. But almost one fourth of the patients’ conjunctivitis were not related to Adenovirus, which shows the importance of the laboratory diagnostics.

40|$|Conjunctivitis is {{the most}} common cause of red eye and one of the most {{frequent}} causes of visits to clinicians. There is significant controversy on the diagnosis and treatment of the disease and the use of ophthalmic antibiotics. The inconvenience of the untimely diagnostic tests led to the trend of treating conjunctivitis empirically with ophthalmic antibiotics. Subsequently, the diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis is higher than it should be resulting in overuse of antibiotics. Consequences of inappropriate diagnosis and treatment include increased virulence, increased health care costs, and incorrect use of antibiotics leading to possible adverse reaction and antibiotic resistance. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment will assist to reduce the diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis and use of ophthalmic antibiotics resulting in reduced virulence and reduced health care costs. The AdenoPlus test has been shown to be effective in appropriately diagnosing <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and subsequently decreasing the use of ophthalmic antibiotics however this evidence in limited.

40|$|International audienceHuman adenoviruses (HAdV) are {{the main}} cause of <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> In Tunisia and North Africa more generally, there is no regular {{nationwide}} surveillance program that monitors viruses causing conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis. In this study, we report the results of HAdV screening in conjunctival samples collected for over 14 years in Tunisia. A total of 282 conjunctival samples received between 2000 and 2013 were investigated. Detection and identification of genotype were performed by PCR-sequencing at the hexon gene; 64. 5 % of samples (n = 182) revealed positive by PCR detection without correlation noted between infection, age, sex, social class or clinical manifestations of <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> HAdV-D 8 was the largely predominant genotype in Tunisia, representing 81. 3 % of all isolates, and was detected continuously from 2000 to 2013. Minor co-circulating genotypes were also identified HAdV-E 4, HAdV-B 3, B 55 and HAdV-B 7 accounting for 10. 7 %, 4. 9 %, 1. 9 % and 0. 9 % of isolates, respectively. In conclusion, this work reports epidemiological data on adenoviral conjunctivitis from a region where such information is very scarce and contributes to a better knowledge of the worldwide distribution of causative genotypes. It also presents an approach for the identification of circulating HAdV in the country and demonstrates the importance of molecular tools for both detection and identification of genotypes, which allow rapid virological investigation, especially during epidemics.

Methods: Randomized, masked and controlled trial. One-hundred twenty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of presumed <b>viral</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> were randomized to either the treatment group or the control group. Physicians and patients were masked to the treatment. Swabs {{were taken from the}} conjunctival fornix for adenovirus PCR analyses. Patients in the treatment group received topical dexamethasone 0. 1 %/povidone-iodine 0. 4 % eye drops four times daily, and patients in the placebo group received artificial tears four times daily, both for seven days. Symptoms were recorded on the day of recruitment and at the time of a follow-up examination 5, 10 and 30 d later. The main outcome was duration of the disease. The others outcomes were overall discomfort, itching, foreign body sensation, tearing, redness, eyelid swelling, side effects of the eye drops, intraocular pressure and the incidence of subepithelial corneal infiltrates. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment group and the control group in terms of the patients' symptoms, intraocular pressure and incidence of subepithelial cornea infiltrates during the entire follow-up period. Patients of the treatment group reported more stinging (p< 0. 001) and a shorter conjunctivitis duration (9. 4 +/- 4. 6 d in the dexamethasone 0. 1 %/povidone-iodine 0. 4 % group versus 11. 8 +/- 4. 9 d in the artificial tears group, p = 0. 009).

The exact incidence of adenoviral conjunctivitis is still poorly known, but there are two well-defined adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis clinical syndromes: epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) and pharyngoconjunctival fever (PCF). Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is also the most severe form and presents with watery discharge, hyperemia, chemosis and ipsilateral lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, but its etiology can be confirmed using cell cultures, antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction or immune-chromatography. Multiple treatments have been tried for this disease, but none of them seem to be completely effective. Viruses are resistant to desiccation and certain common surface disinfectants. Prevention is the most reliable and recommended strategy to control this epidemic infection.
