40|$|Specimens of Nemoptera sinuata were reared from eggs {{to second}} instar larvae in captivity, and {{observations}} on imagos {{were carried out}} in the Struma Valley, Bulgaria. The adults occur in open sunny places in river gorges and feed only on pollen. They are most active at noon be-tween the middle of May and the end of June. The males occur one week earlier than the fe-males. The eggs are laid directly on the ground, most often in the morning. They are spherical (rare among Neuroptera), white, opaque, with one micropyle. Up to 70 eggs are laid by a fe-male over a period of 10 days. The egg stage usually lasts from 23 to 25 days. The lid is cut off by an eggbreaker during hatching. The newly hatched larvae are 2. 0 – 2. 1 mm long, are terricolous and always buried themselves by digging to 1 cm in depth. The larvae rejected liv-ing or freshly killed arthropods, or roots and blossoms of plants. They were only observed to take water and <b>vegetable</b> <b>sap.</b> The longest surviving larva moulted in September (first instar lasts 72 days) and hibernated. It increased in length to 5 mm and died in April after being reared for nine months...|$|E

Pulse {{electric}} field PEF) umožňuje inaktivaci baktérii (např. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis) ve vodných roztocích. Generátor impulsního elektrického pole je celek tvořený generátorem vysokonapěťových impulsů a aplikační komorou. Pro technologii impulsního elektrického pole jsou charakteristické: vysokonapěťové impulsy (exponenciálního či obdélníkové tvaru) s dobou trvání několik ?s, amplitudou napětí desítek kV a intenzitou IEP v aplikační komoře desítek kV/cm. Technology of pulsed {{electric field}} {{can be used}} to sterilization of liquid solution as water, milk, fruit juice and <b>vegetables</b> <b>sap</b> without using chemical substances and procedures. PEF - pulse electric field - {{can be used to}} inactivation of bacteria like as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis into water solution. Generator of pulsed electric field is system which consist of high voltage pulsed generator and application cell. Characteristic values for technology of pulsed electric field are high voltage pulses (exponential or rectangular wave decay) with long of several's, voltage amplifier amplitude of tens kV and intensity of PEF into application cell tens of kV/cm...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), edible fruit, nuts, peel of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), lac, gums, resins, <b>vegetable</b> <b>saps</b> and extracts nes (HS- 13), rubber and articles thereof (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or tufted fabric, lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not knit or crochet (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87). Those commodities are in line with Indonesian government export's strategy direction which mainly focuses on several sectors, including fishery, vegetable products, rubber, wood and wood products, textiles, and transportation. Therefore, Indonesian government should focus to improve those commodities in AEC.
