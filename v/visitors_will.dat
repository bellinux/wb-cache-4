The depressions inside the pā are pits, once roofed over and used for storing Kūmara tubers, but now largely infilled but still visible.|$|E

Under the proposal the ETIAS will be managed by the European Border and Coast Guard in cooperation with national authorities. Foreign <b>visitors</b> <b>will</b> be required to submit personal data in advance and pay a processing fee (fee is waived for children).

The authorisation request may be processed for up 72 hours {{in which case the}} applicant must be notified if the authorisation request was issued or refused or if additional information is required. In case the authorisation is refused the applicant will have the right of appeal in accordance with national law of the member state. The authorisation will be valid for five years.

It is expected to enter into operation on 1 January 2020. The cost for developing ETIAS is estimated at EUR 212,1 million.|$|E
