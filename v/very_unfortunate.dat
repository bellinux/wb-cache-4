[...] By the time archaeologists learned of the find several months later, the findspot had been built over, making proper archaeological investigation impossible.

30|$|Researchers {{spent much}} effort in pushing the {{frontier}} of optical resolution in a quest to image <b>very</b> small objects. <b>Unfortunate</b> optical resolution is limited by diffraction and dispersion effects. Diffraction causes light beams to spread in transverse direction during their propagation. A temporal pulse of light analogously spreads owing to material dispersion. The quest for ultimate super resolution has been described in a short Review [1], treating incoherent super-resolution techniques, coherent super resolutions schemes, near field super-resolution techniques, etc. Quite long ago Silberberg [2] has shown {{that it is possible}} for self-focusing nonlinearity to compensate both spatial and temporal spreading of the light pulse. The resulting wave packet is a spatiotemporal soliton which is referred to as a “light bullet”). Minardy et al. [3], by using arrays of wave guides, demonstrated a nonlinear propagation of a 3 D localized optical wave packet. Belic et al. [4] obtained exact spatiotemporal periodic travelling wave solutions to the generalized (3  +  1)–dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation and used these solutions to construct analytical light bullet solutions. Scattering effects {{have been found to be}} an impediment to focusing and imaging. Light scattering, however, does not lead to an irretrievable loss of information. The information might be scrambled into disordered interference patterns called laser speckles. Para-axial speckle based metrology systems have been analyzed by Kelly et al. [5]. There are various techniques for imaging inside scattering media. Methods for controlling waves in space and time for imaging and focusing in complex media have been developed by Mosk et al. [6]. A different approach to super resolution phenomena has been discussed in relation to microsphere optical experiments (see e.g. [7 – 10]). The microsphere optical system is different from those described in [1 – 6], as in this system the information on the fine structures of the object is obtained from the evanescent waves transmitted through the microsphere. Also as the microsphere is composed of dielectric materials there are not any nonlinear effects in this system. High resolutions were obtained in microsphere optical experiments (up to 50  nm in [7 – 9] and 25  nm in [10]). Such high resolutions might have an impact in the fields of integrated optics, microchips, photo lithography plus plasma etching, photo resists etc., in which very high resolutions are needed. Therefore the improvement of resolutions in these systems is of utmost importance.|$|R
6000|$|In {{referring}} to these masterpieces of Bewick's, {{it must not}} be forgotten {{that he had the}} aid of some clever assistants. His younger brother John was not without talent, as is clear from his work for Somervile's [...] "Chace," [...] 1796, and that highly edifying book, the [...] "Blossoms of Morality." [...] Many of the tail-pieces to the [...] "Water Birds" [...] were designed by Robert Johnson, who also did most of the illustrations to Bewick's [...] "Fables" [...] of 1818, which were engraved by Temple and Harvey, two other pupils. Another pupil was Charlton Nesbit, an excellent engraver, who was employed upon the [...] "Birds," [...] and did good work in Ackermann's [...] "Religious Emblems" [...] of 1808, and the second series of Northcote's [...] "Fables." [...] But by far the largest portion of the tail-pieces in the second volume of the [...] "Birds" [...] was engraved by Luke Clennell, a <b>very</b> skilful but <b>unfortunate</b> artist, who ultimately became insane. To him we owe the woodcuts, after Stothard's charming sketches, to the Rogers volume of 1810, an edition preceding those already mentioned as illustrated with steel- plates, and containing some of the artist's happiest pictures of children and amorini. Many of these little groups would make admirable designs for gems, if indeed they are not already derived from them, since one at least is an obvious copy of a well-known sardonyx--("The Marriage of Cupid and Psyche.") This volume, generally known by the name of the [...] "Firebrand" [...] edition, is highly prized by collectors; and, as intelligent renderings of pen and ink, there is little better than these engravings of Clennell's. {12} Finally, among others of Bewick's pupils, must be mentioned William Harvey, who survived to 1866. It has been already stated that he engraved part of the illustrations to Bewick's [...] "Fables," [...] but his best known block is the large one of Haydon's [...] "Death of Dentatus." [...] Soon after this he relinquished wood-engraving in favour of design, and for a long period {{was one of the most}} fertile and popular of book-illustrators. His style, however, is unpleasantly mannered; and it is sufficient to make mention of his masterpiece, the [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] of Lane, the illustrations to which, produced under the supervision of the translator, are said to be so accurate as to give the appropriate turbans for every hour of the day. They show considerable freedom of invention and a large fund of Orientalism.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there is}} the {{disregard}} of his own health and comfort which results {{from the fact that}} he is, by the nature of his work, an emergency man. We are polite and considerate to the doctor when there is nothing the matter, and we meet him as a friend or entertain him as a guest; but when the baby is suffering from croup, or its mother has a temperature of 104 degrees, or its grandfather has broken his leg, nobody thinks of the doctor except as a healer and saviour. He may be hungry, weary, sleepy, run down by several successive nights disturbed by that instrument of torture, the night bell; but who ever thinks of this in the face of sudden sickness or accident? We think no more of the condition of a doctor attending a case than of the condition of a fireman at a fire. In other occupations night-work is specially recognized and provided for. The worker sleeps all day; has his breakfast in the evening; his lunch or dinner at midnight; his dinner or supper before going to bed in the morning; and he changes to day-work if he cannot stand night-work. But a doctor is expected to work day and night. In practices which consist largely of workmen's clubs, and in which the patients are therefore taken on wholesale terms and <b>very</b> numerous, the <b>unfortunate</b> assistant, or the principal if he has no assistant, often does not undress, knowing that he will be called up before he has snatched an hour's sleep. To the strain of such inhuman conditions must be added the constant risk of infection. One wonders why the impatient doctors do not become savage and unmanageable, and the patient ones imbecile. Perhaps they do, to some extent. And the pay is wretched, and so uncertain that refusal to attend without payment in advance becomes often a necessary measure of self-defence, whilst the County Court has long ago {{put an end to the}} tradition that the doctor's fee is an honorarium. Even the most eminent physicians, as such biographies as those of Paget show, are sometimes miserably, inhumanly poor until they are past their prime. In short, the doctor needs our help for the moment much more than we often need his. The ridicule of Moliere, the death of a well-informed and clever writer like the late Harold Frederic in the hands of Christian Scientists (a sort of sealing with his blood of the contemptuous disbelief in and dislike of doctors he had bitterly expressed in his books), the scathing and quite justifiable exposure of medical practice in the novel by Mr. Maarten Maartens entitled The New Religion: all these trouble the doctor very little, and are in any case well set off by the popularity of Sir Luke Fildes' famous picture, and by the verdicts in which juries from time to time express their conviction that the doctor can do no wrong. The real woes of the doctor are the shabby coat, the wolf at the door, the tyranny of ignorant patients, the work-day of 24 hours, and the uselessness of honestly prescribing what most of the patients really need: that is, not medicine, but money.|$|R
