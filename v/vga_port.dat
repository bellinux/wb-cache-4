50|$|The various RGB (red, green, blue) analog {{component}} video standards (e.g., RGBS, RGBHV, RGsB) use no compression and impose no real limit on color depth or resolution, but require large bandwidth {{to carry the}} signal and contain much redundant data since each channel typically includes {{much of the same}} black-and-white image. Most modern computers offer this signal via a <b>VGA</b> <b>port.</b> Many televisions, especially in Europe, utilize RGB via the SCART connector. All arcade games, other than early vector and black-and-white games, use RGB monitors.|$|E
50|$|For {{connecting}} displays, Apple used a DA-15 connector on {{all models}} {{prior to the}} Blue and White Power Mac G3, which used a VGA connector. The original AGP-based Power Mac G4 used VGA, complemented by a DVI port; almost all later Macs, however, used the Apple Display Connector {{in addition to a}} <b>VGA</b> or DVI <b>port,</b> until the last revisions of the Power Mac G5 came standard with two DVI ports. Apple includes DVI-to-VGA adapters with its DVI-equipped computers. With the release of the unibody MacBook Pro, DVI was phased out in favor of DisplayPort.|$|R
5000|$|The Linux console {{provides}} {{a way for the}} kernel and other processes to output text-based messages to the user, and to receive text-based input from the user. In Linux, several devices can be used as system console: a [...] virtual terminal, serial port, USB serial <b>port,</b> <b>VGA</b> in text-mode, framebuffer. Some modern Linux-based systems have deprecated kernel based text-mode input and output, and instead show a graphical logo or progress bar while the system is booting, followed by the immediate start of a graphical user interface (e.g. the X.Org Server on desktop distributions, or SurfaceFlinger on Android).|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{describes an}} {{implementation of a}} minimal operating system which supports user interaction through keyboard and a terminal window. The system design is inspired by GNU/Linux operating system and is at its core monolithic kernel with support for memory management, kernel modules and various peripheral drivers, like serial <b>ports,</b> <b>VGA</b> terminal, timers and interrupts. The {{second part of the}} system is the user mode using a REPL terminal with some inbuilt tools for basic computer tasks and demonstration on system capabilities. The operating system uses C programming language, as well as x 86 architecture assembly for some critical parts. Bochs, the virtual machine software was used to emulate hardware while in development, however, the system can be booted on compatible physical hardware...|$|R
