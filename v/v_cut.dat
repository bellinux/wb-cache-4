2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was flat-sided, {{built up}} around four longerons which {{were made of}} spruce at the rear and ash forward of the cockpit. [...] Behind the cockpit, the fuselage narrowed in plan view in a gently curved way to the tail, but less usually Comper made the fuselage reduce in depth also; whilst the upper longeron was horizontal with the aircraft in flying position, the lower one was angled upwards. [...] The fin and rudder formed an approximate quadrant, though the unbalanced rudder extended down between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. [...] The nearly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron. A standard curved decking, built up with stringers over frames topped the fuselage from front to rear. Forward of the cockpit the lower longerons curved strongly upwards and inwards, meeting the now inward curving upper members at the engine bulkhead, on which was mounted the 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub I flat-twin driving a two-bladed small diameter propeller. The single axle undercarriage was mounted {{on a pair of}} short V-shaped legs, each <b>V</b> <b>cut</b> out of plywood and mounted vertically on the lower longerons, so that the track was about 4ft (1.22 m). The CLA.2 sat close to the ground, with its wheels only slightly ahead of and below the wing leading edge.|$|E
5000|$|The variety V in its {{projective}} embedding is projectively normal if R is integrally closed. This condition {{implies that}} V {{is a normal}} variety, but not conversely: the property of projective normality is not independent of the projective embedding, as is shown by {{the example of a}} rational quartic curve in three dimensions. Another equivalent condition is in terms of the linear system of divisors on <b>V</b> <b>cut</b> out by the tautological line bundle L on projective space, and its d-th powers for d = 1, 2, 3, ... when V is non-singular, it is projectively normal if and only if each such linear system is a complete linear system. In a more geometric way one can think of L as the Serre twist sheaf O(1) on projective space, and use it to twist the structure sheaf OV k times, for any k. Then V is called k-normal if the global sections of O(k) map surjectively to those of OV(k), for a given k; if V is 1-normal it is called linearly normal, and projective normality is the condition that V is k-normal for all k ≥ 1. Linear normality may be said geometrically: V as projective variety cannot be obtained by an isomorphic linear projection from a projective space of higher dimension, except in the trivial way of lying in a proper linear subspace. Projective normality may similarly be translated, by using enough Veronese mappings to reduce it to conditions of linear normality.|$|E
50|$|Around 1590, hammocks {{were adopted}} {{for use in}} sailing ships; the Royal Navy {{formally}} adopted the canvas sling hammock in 1597. Aboard ship, hammocks were regularly employed for sailors sleeping on the gun decks of warships, where limited space prevented the installation of permanent bunks. Since a slung hammock moves {{in concert with the}} motion of the vessel, the occupant is not at a risk of being thrown onto the deck (which may be 5 or 6 feet below) during swells or rough seas. Likewise, a hammock provides more comfortable sleep than a bunk or a berth while at sea since the sleeper always stays well balanced, irrespective of the motion of the vessel. Prior to the adoption of naval hammocks, sailors would often be injured or even killed as they fell off their berths or rolled on the decks on heavy seas. The sides of traditional canvas naval hammocks wrap around the sleeper like a cocoon, making an inadvertent fall virtually impossible. Many sailors in the Royal Navy, during the 1950s at least, used a spreader - a length of wood with a <b>V</b> <b>cut</b> in each end to engage the second hammock string on each side. The first string was set up more tightly than the others so that it raised a protective lip along each side to keep out drafts and prevent the sleeper being thrown out. A narrow mattress was also issued which protected the user from cold from below. In addition naval hammocks could be rolled tightly and stowed in an out of the way place or in nets along the gunwale as additional protection during battle (as was the case during the age of sail). Many sailors became so accustomed to this way of sleeping that they brought their hammocks ashore with them on leave. The naval use of hammocks continued into the 20th century. During World War II, troopships sometimes employed hammocks for both naval ratings and soldiers in order to increase available space and troop carrying capacity. Many leisure sailors even today prefer hammocks over bunks because of better comfort in sleep while on the high seas.|$|E

40|$|The {{reflection}} on whether {{and on what}} grounds {{the absence of a}} sign turns out to be as just significant as the sign itself inevitably leads, in the linguistic field, to concentrating oneâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 s attention on the heterogeneous set of linguistic phenomena which modern linguistics generally refers to with the term "zero" 9 ̆ 9. Examples are easily found in many languages, such as in Engl. sheep (sing.) <b>vs.</b> sheep (pl.); <b>cut</b> (present) <b>vs.</b> <b>cut</b> (past) or, even more interesting, as it involves a transcategorisation, cheat (noun) vs. cheat (verb). In all these and many other examples the "absence of an otherwise necessary sign" to stay with Whitney's words may be recognised either through analogical reasoning (which allows one to postulate for example the necessity of an s to mark the morphological function of plural as in brook vs. brooks etc.) or through opposition which highlights the morphological role of some absences of sign. Similar phenomena have also been taken into account in the first Sanskrit grammar ever written, the Aṣṭādhyāyī of Pāṇini (4 th c. BC) in 239 rules involving the technical device of lopa lit.

Despite dendrometric variations within and between trails and transects, only density estimates of Hapalemur griseus griseus differed significantly by transect type. The spatial variation may {{be a result of}} removal by local people of giant bamboo, which is the main food for Hapalemur griseus griseus, along trails. Conversely, seasonality influenced density estimates for Cheirogaleus major, Eulemur rubriventer, Hapalemur griseus griseus, and Microcebus rufus. The tempo-ral variations may be related to seasonal torpor for Cheirogaleus major and increased detection probabilities during periods of fruit exploitation for Eulemur rubriventer, Microcebus rufus, and Hapalemur griseus griseus. Transect type and seasonality did not affect density esti-mates for Avahi laniger, which {{may be related to the}} highly folivorous and low-energy diet of the nocturnal lemur.

40|$|While the {{activation}} of the infant hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis {{and the existence of}} a postnatal gonadotrophin surge were first documented in the early 1970 s, study of the longitudinal development of gonadal hormones in infancy, and the potential physiological and behavioral correlates of this development, have been hampered by reliance on infrequent serum sampling. The present study reports the validation of a noninvasive method for repeated assessment of steroid hormones in infant fecal samples. Fecal samples were collected in, and excised from cotton diaper liners, and extracted using methanol. Extracts were analyzed for estradiol using a diluted assay modification. Method validity was supported by a steroid recovery rate of at least 80 %, a sensitivity of 0. 35 pg/ml, and inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variations of less than 10 % and 20 %, respectively. Variation in estradiol concentration was assessed across (1) sample type (scraped <b>vs.</b> <b>cut</b> from diaper liner), (2) time of day (morning vs. afternoon/evening samples), (3) time interval between samples and (4) time to assay (1 day vs. 489 days after collection). Of these characteristics, only the time interval between samples within an individual was significantly associated with estradiol concentration. This is the first report of human infant fecal estradiol levels.

40|$|The current {{investigation}} evaluates laser assisted machining, which uses an external laser beam to heat and soften {{the material to}} be machined locally {{in front of the}} cutting tool and offers an alternative approach to improving the machinability of titanium alloys. By reducing the cutting resistance, the cutting tool sees less pressure and life is enhanced. This paper reports on the cutting forces and tool life during laser assisted milling of Ti 6 Al 4 <b>V</b> alloy. <b>Cutting</b> forces, especially the force in the feed direction, reduce dramatically with laser beam assistance. The reduction of feed force depends on the laser power, depth of cut and cutting speed. This paper also discusses the major tool failure mode observed during both conventional and laser assisted milling operations...|$|R
