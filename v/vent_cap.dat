40|$|Air {{is removed}} from {{residential}} buildings for different reasons such as heat, odor, or moisture removal. The air is usually removed with exhaust fans connected to duct work that lead outside the building. At the interface between the ducting and the ambient, there are vent caps {{that are used to}} allow air to flow out the building but not into it. These vent caps can significantly contribute to the pressure that the exhaust fan must overcome to remove air from the building, which means the exhaust fan must consume more energy to run. Unfortunately, <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> performances are not currently evaluated because there is no establish method to test them. For this reason the objective of this research was to develop a <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> performance evaluation method that may be used for a variety of <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> types, designs, and sizes. The evaluation method was then implemented to determine the variance among <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> designs, determine the evaluation method's repeatability, and to create a method to estimate the vent cap's performance at a specific air flow rate. An air flow chamber with an extension arm was used to test the vent caps. The extension arm is U-shaped to allow the adjustment to the three different orientations that are needed by the three <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> types. The extension arm also has static pressure taps to measure the pressure drop across the <b>vent</b> <b>cap.</b> The pressure drop was also used to calculate a nondimensional parameter known as a loss coefficient to facilitate performance comparison. From this research it was concluded that the evaluation method can be implemented on the three <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> types and a variety of designs and sizes. The repeatability of the evaluation method was confirmed by comparing two trials for two different products. The evaluation method was used to confirm that the variation in the products is significantly larger than the uncertainty in the measurements, which were 0. 0077 in. w. c. for the pressure loss and 0. 06 in the loss coefficient. It was also shown that the loss coefficients can be used to estimate the vent caps' pressure drop at high air flow rates...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} and modeled {{the performance}} of a range-hood ventilation system and the important aspects such as major and minor pressure losses, volumetric airflow, and capture efficiency. Results can be classified into two parts: previous test data and the EES program model. Previous test data include fan performance curves produced by the Riverside Energy Efficiency Laboratory (REEL), <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> performance data produced by a former student at the REEL facility and capture efficiency data published by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). An assortment of six (6) fans, twenty-two (22) vent caps, and the capture efficiency equations were used to complete a mathematical model in the EES program. The <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> performance data collected was for the two most common residential ventilation duct diameters, 4 -inch and 6 -inch in the variety of wall-mounted, roof-jack, and soffit. With most range-hoods using the larger duct size, all fan performance curves collected were 6 -inch round. Trend lines using a spreadsheet calculator were constructed to fit the associated static pressure and flow rate data plots. It was shown that increasing the R^ 2 value to a maximum of one (1) did not necessarily produce trend lines similar to the experimental data. In fact, a third degree polynomial trend line in most cases fit the experimental data better than a larger degree polynomial. Graphing alongside the experimental data was determined to {{be the best way to}} quickly see how well the trend line fit the experimental data. With the combination of fan and <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> performance, associated ductwork, and the capture efficiency data from LBNL, a mathematical model was constructed and implemented in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. Careful use of trend lines and initial variable guesses allowed the EES program to converge to a solution. Being dependent on airflow, capture efficiency range was from 49 % - 94 %...|$|E

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the real-world {{performance of a}} typical range-hood ventilation system by focusing on parameters such as duct pressure drop and range hood capture efficiency. The research {{can be divided into}} two parts, mathematical modeling and laboratory testing. For example, the pressure drop through a typical range hood ducting system and the capture efficiency of under-cabinet range hoods were modeled individually. For laboratory testing, the range hood was experimentally tested in two ducting configurations representing two typical installation strategies found in practice, namely flexible and rigid ducts exiting through walls and ceilings. The bulk of the effort in this project was the experimental phase, and it could be divided into a Case 1 and Case 2. In Case 1 three different lengths of flexible duct (32 ?, 46 ?, 75 ?) and five different lengths of rigid duct (32 ?, 46 ?, 75 ? 119 ?, 148 ?) were mounted so as to exit a sidewall. In Case 2, rigid duct was vented through the roof by using the same duct lengths tested in Case 1. Pressure drops through the duct and <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> were measured at different fan speed levels to produce system performance curves. These curves were overlaid with measured fan curves to find operating points (i. e. flow rate, and pressure drop) that represent real-world range-hood ventilation systems. This study provides the basis for system performance assessments and system design recommendations. The results of this study showed that the pressure drop through flexible ducting is larger than the pressure drop through rigid ducting of same length. The increased static pressure drop in flexible ducting had a negative impact on range hood performance, which results in a lower airflow rate and capture efficiency. By comparing the predicted and the actual results, {{it was found that the}} pressure drop measured in the experimental test is higher than that predicted by the mathematical model, which needs to be taken into consideration in future designs. For capture efficiencies, it was found that they do not differ much for different duct lengths in the same configuration. At the same fan speed, rigid-duct range hood systems have higher capture efficiencies compared to flexible-duct range hood systems. Furthermore fan speeds have the largest effect on capture efficiencies, with values varying from 75 % to 95 % for fan speeds varying from low to high...|$|E
40|$|Polypropylene {{has proven}} to be the ideal {{material}} for the outer shell of the lead acid batteries. Due to its mold-ability and inert properties the material provides a capsule for the functioning components of the lead acid battery and can withstand a variety conditions encountered during its application, such as impact shock resistance, high and low temperatures and acid resistance. Polypropylene has however become of great concern with regards to environmental pollution since it is generally resistant to normal conditions of degradation and can only be properly disposed of by incineration. This factor has encouraged the industry to find ways to regenerate spent polypropylene. A good example of such a process is the recycling of lead acid batteries. This allows not only for the regeneration of lead, but also for the recycling of polypropylene in the manufacturing of battery cases. There are some cost advantages in using recycled polypropylene. However it does have its disadvantages in that the material does start to deteriorate after multiple processes. A common practice amongst battery manufacturers is to add virgin polypropylene to the recycled material in order to ensure performance consistency. The comparative study investigated the use of various ratios of virgin and recycled PP in the manufacturing of lead acid battery cases and their influence on the physical properties and performance of the final material. The degradation of PP was also investigated as the material was subjected to multiple manufacturing processes where the influence of stabilizers was further considered. A common technique of PP analysis such as MFI was shown to be an effective technique to maintain good quality control. The study further showed that {{it is important that the}} material grade of PP used in the manufacturing of the battery case and lid is compatible in order to allow for effective heating sealing of the two components. Polypropylene has a waxy surface finish and it is generally difficult to label or write on. Labels tend to fall off in application and make it difficult to maintain a track record of the manufactured batteries with time. This study showed successfully that a laser activated dye can be added to the PP without influencing its color or its performance. This allows for successful labeling of battery cases by various bar coding writers that can trace the battery through its manufacturing process. Lead acid batteries are often operated outside the specified temperature range that is determined by battery manufacturers resulting in premature failure. These failures can occur within the warranty period of the battery and result in illicit claims since the monitoring of the batteries in its application was not possible. A suitable temperature monitoring device was designed that would be incorporated into the <b>vent</b> <b>cap</b> or lid of the battery case. The device contained temperature sensitive indicators that would undergo a permanent color change at specified temperatures thereby giving the battery manufacturer an indication as to the maximum temperature the battery was exposed to...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue for}} the project {{is that some of}} the rear axles for General Motors GMT 800 and GMT 900 are found to be leaking. Most of the leaks are spotted already at the paint {{facility}} Paint Tech International (PTI), but some make it all the way to the customer before being spotted. The leaks are normally discovered as a wet spot around the vent tube area on the differential, or in more severe cases as a puddle of lube around the pinion flange. The leak has already been isolated to the interface between the vent and a plastic cap covering it during manufacturing and assembling. The project is a Design for Six Sigma project, and follows the IDDOV cycle. IDDOV offers a systematic approach to find and eliminate causes of variation in a process. IDDOV stands for Identify, Define, Develop, Optimize and Verify. The purposes of this project are to find out why some axles leak and to suggest a design or process change to reduce the number of leaking axles. The area of the leaks was verified and the strategy to be used was decided in the projects phase. The project was broken down into two categories: process study and design study. The process study made comparisons against axles of other sizes as well as differences between different GM assembly plants. In the design study a capability study was made, which showed some shortcomings in the <b>vent,</b> <b>cap</b> and the amount of lube injected in each axle. A component search without any reliable results was also done here. The most interesting finding was from the process study which showed differences in the manufacturing processes between the 8. 6 ” axle and the 11. 5 ” axle. The 11. 5 ” axle got new fresh caps after the paint process to make sure the axle had been pressure equalized. To find out if the vent and cap pairs are affected by the heat that are applied to them in the manufacturing process, a design of experiments was made in two steps. The first step was to see if heat had an impact, and the second step was later done, with some additional factors, to more precisely determining the impact. From the study, heat and time in the oven were found to impact the amount of pressure it takes to pop off the plastic cap of from the vent. By that it is known that the heat treatment is weakening the cap. A process improvement was made early in the project. All 8. 6 ” axles have now their caps pulled for a few seconds at PTI. The cap is then replaced when the pressure inside the axle has been equalized. Since the process change, interaction has been held with GM regularly to make sure no axles leak anymore. GM has also made a test to confirm that the axles do not leak anymore. The total amount of savings from the project is estimated to be about $ 29, 000. The suggestion for process change, based on the findings of the project, is to continue with the ongoing task of removing and replacing the caps at PTI. Preferably a new cap should be used instead of the old one, to separate the equalized axles from the nonequalized ones, and also since the cap does get deformed by the heat earlier in the manufacturing process.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. 2014. Major: Dentistry. Advisor: Scott McClanahan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); 70 pages. INTRODUCTION: Removal of contaminated canal contents and biofilms by mechanical preparation alone are limited. Irregular cross sections, lateral canals, and apical deltas are mostly inaccessible to mechanical preparation (Siqueira et al., 1997). Therefore, {{the use of}} chemical dissolution and disinfection of these regions is necessary. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sodium hypochlorite in providing these functions (Hand et al., 1978; Rosenfeld et al., 1978). However, adverse cytotoxic outcomes have been reported with its use (Joffe et al., 1991), as well as reports of allergic hypersensitivity (Kaufman et al., 1989). 	The ideal irrigant has attributes of; broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, ability to dissolve pulp tissue remnants, inactivates endotoxin, removes the smear layer components, and is systemically nontoxic to periodontal tissues. Such an irrigant does not yet exist (Zehnder, 2006). MTAD, a final irrigation solution containing 3 % doxycycline, 4. 25 % citric acid, and 0. 5 % Tween- 80 {{has been shown to}} remove smear layer on extracted human teeth and provides broad spectrum antimicrobial activity (Torbinejad et al., 2003). QMiX, a final irrigation solution containing; bisbiguanide, calcium chelating agent, cetrimide surfactant, and saline has demonstrated efficacy at removing smear layer and disinfecting dentin tubules (Wang et al., 2013). SmearClear, a smear layer removing irrigant containing EDTA, cetrimide and water, has been shown to remove smear layer efficiently in an ex-vivo, split-tooth model (Andrabi et al., 2013). 	The aims of this study are to; demonstrate the use of a novel polymicrobial biofilm model to test endodontic irrigants, measure the susceptibility of a biofilm to individual irrigant treatment groups, and to characterize the responses visually through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser confocal microscopy. METHODS: Clinical endodontic microbial samples were collected from six adult patients that presented to the graduate endodontics clinic at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry with a diagnosis of pulpal necrosis. For each of the 3 experimental runs a pool of one to three patients were combined to ensure a collection of heterogeneous microbial species. A series of baffled 500 mL Erlenmeyer culture flasks were used as a “bioreactor” system to facilitate biofilm formation on hydroxyapatite discs. A total of six discs were contained per flask (2 discs per cell strainer basket). The flasks were covered with a sterile, <b>vented</b> flask <b>cap</b> and placed within the anaerobic chamber for incubation at 37 °C and 20 RPM. This allowed for biofilm formation on the hydroxyapatite discs under shear force conditions. 	The flasks were allowed to incubate according to the conditions described above for approximately 48 total hours. Following incubation, discs were randomly selected for placement into a sterile, flat-bottomed, 12 -well polystyrene culture plate (Sigma-Aldrich) for treatment according to the irrigant protocol. Four irrigation solutions were independently used for testing on the 48 hour biofilms. Sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a negative control treatment group. MTAD (DENTSPLY, Int.), QMiX (DENTSPLY, Int.), and Smearclear (SybronEndo, Orange, CA) were used as challenge treatment groups. Groups included; 1 X PBS at 1 minute exposure, MTAD at 1 minute exposure,MTAD at 20 minutes exposure, QMiX at 1 minute exposure,QMiX at 20 minutes exposure,SmearClear at 1 minute exposure, and SmearClear at 20 minutes exposure. Evaluation of biofilm disruption was determined by; cell viability staining, crystal violet biomass staining, SEM, and confocal laser microscopy. Microbial speciation was performed by the Forsyth Institute (Cambridge, MA) by HOMIM 16 sRNA analysis. RESULTS: The flask bioreactor, as previously described, can be utilized for growing a polymicrobial biofilm suitable for testing the efficacy of antimicrobial and biofilm removing endodontic irrigants. 	When compared as a group, the endodontic irrigants in this study achieved a statistically significant reduction in cell viability as time of exposure increased. In a pairwise comparison between irrigants, the mean cell viability was lowest for QMiX. No statistically significant difference in the reduction of biomass between endodontic irrigants was observed. Comparing endodontic irrigants individually by time did not result in a statistically significant difference in reducing cell viability or biomass. None of the endodontic irrigants completely removed the biofilm, as observed by SEM and confocal laser microscopy. 6 of 12 microbial species recovered were found to be in common between the patient pools when analyzed by HOMIM 16 sRNA identification. This study presents a simple model for growing endodontic biofilms under anaerobic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study support the inefficient removal of biofilm by the irrigants included in the study. It was determined that QMiX achieved the lowest cell viability over the 20 minute treatment exposure. As a group, the irrigants were statistically significant in reducing cell viability and reducing biomass. However, it could be concluded that they should not be utilized as a single irrigant to disinfect or remove biofilm...|$|R
