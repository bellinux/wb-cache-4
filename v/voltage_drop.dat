25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across the fuse at rated current. There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> value. Once current is applied, resistance and <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. <b>Voltage</b> <b>drop</b> often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) type fuses.|$|E
25|$|The {{on-state}} forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> in IGBTs behaves {{very differently}} from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> can be modeled as a resistance, with the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> (typically {{of the order}} of 2V) increasing only with the log of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.|$|E
25|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> VF {{across the}} forward biased diode {{in the circuit}} of a passive {{rectifier}} is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of VF. As a result, the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> VF is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (super) diode with VF = 0 V.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Decreased {{power supply}} levels {{have reduced the}} {{tolerance}} to voltage changes within power distribution networks in CMOS integrated circuits. High on-chip currents, required to charge and discharge large on-chip loads while operating at high frequencies, produce significant transient IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> within a power distribution network. These transient IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> can affect the propagation delay of a CMOS logic gate, creating delay uncertainty within data paths. Analytical expressions characterizing these transient IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> are presented in this paper. The peak value of these transient IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> is within 6 % as compared to SPICE. Circuit- and layout-level design constraints are also discussed to manage the peak value of the transient IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drops.</b> The propagation delay of a CMOS logic gate based on these analytical expressions is within 5 % of SPICE while the estimate without considering transient IR <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> can exceed 20 % for a 20 � power line.

30|$|The major loss {{mechanism}} of the presented low voltage output experiments are caused by the <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> on the rectifier diodes. This is due to fact that the diode <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> are relatively large in low voltage output charger circuit. Thus, employing a synchronous rectifier circuit at the output would increase the overall efficiency. In contrast to low voltage chargers, the diode <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> are not a big concern for high voltage charger applications, where {{the efficiency of the}} proposed charger circuit is expected to increase dramatically.|$|R

25|$|In contrast, {{electrochemical}} capacitors (supercapacitors) {{consists of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) and electrically connected via an electrolyte. Energy storage occurs within the double-layers of both electrodes as a mixture of a double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. When both electrodes have approximately the same resistance (internal resistance), {{the potential of the}} capacitor decreases symmetrically over both double-layers, whereby a <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the electrolyte is achieved. For asymmetrical supercapacitors like hybrid capacitors the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> between the electrodes could be asymmetrically.

INTRODUCTION As modern VLSI technology moves into the very deep submicrometer (VDSM) regime, millions of transistors will be integrated onto a single chip (a system-on-a-chip), operating at frequencies much greater than a gigahertz.

25|$|Due {{to their}} {{substantially}} lower forward voltage (0.3V versus 0.7V for silicon diodes) germanium diodes have an inherent advantage over silicon diodes, especially in circuits like full-wave bridge rectifiers which result in 2X <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> because the current must pass through two diodes.|$|E
25|$|A real {{rectifier}} characteristically drops part of {{the input}} voltage (a <b>voltage</b> <b>drop,</b> for silicon devices, of typically 0.7 volts plus an equivalent resistance, in general non-linear)—and at high frequencies, distorts waveforms in other ways. Unlike an ideal rectifier, it dissipates some power.|$|E
25|$|In modern sets, a {{semiconductor}} diode {{is used for}} the detector, which is much more reliable than a cat's whisker detector and requires no adjustments. Germanium diodes (or sometimes Schottky diodes) are used instead of silicon diodes, because their lower forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> (roughly 0.3V compared to 0.6V) makes them more sensitive.|$|E
40|$|We {{present in}} this letter a {{theoretical}} analysis of the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of a hybrid normal-superconducting device consisting of a quantum dot and two electrodes that can be either normal or superconducting. We show that <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> at two different contacts that have been regarded unimportant in literature play essential roles in the Andreev tunneling process when {{at least one of}} electrodes is superconducting. A differential-conductance-anomaly caused by the aforementioned <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> is predicted.

25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> than p–n junction diodes. Their forward <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster reverse recovery than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E
25|$|The three-wire {{system was}} adopted because the initial system was fed {{directly}} from the dynamos in the surface power plant at the Stockwell end of the line. It was important to minimise the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> as much as possible, bearing in mind the rather steep gradient on the approach to King William Street station.|$|E
25|$|In a small {{silicon diode}} {{operating}} at its rated currents, the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is about 0.6 to 0.7 volts. The value is different for other diode types—Schottky diodes can be rated {{as low as}} 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.|$|E
50|$|The input {{bias current}} thus causes the same <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> at both the {{positive}} and negative terminals. A practical circuit is shown below.|$|R

25|$|Non-zero output {{impedance}}: Low {{output impedance}} {{is important for}} low-impedance loads; for these loads, the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> across the output impedance effectively reduces the open loop gain. In configurations with a voltage-sensing negative feedback, the output impedance of the amplifier is effectively lowered; thus, in linear applications, op-amp circuits usually exhibit a very low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{fraction}} of the electrical energy input into a lamp is converted to useful light. The ballast dissipates some heat; electronic ballasts may be around 90% efficient. A fixed <b>voltage</b> <b>drop</b> occurs at the electrodes, which also produces heat. Some of the energy in the mercury vapor column is also dissipated, but about 85% is turned into visible and ultraviolet light.|$|E
30|$|The SI-FCL is {{designed}} to limit the fault current to an acceptable level. In addition, the SI-FCL applied in the VSC-HVDC system {{is also used to}} extend the time before the <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> to Udc,min. Therefore, in addition to analyzing whether the SI-FCL has current-limiting ability in the process when the capacitor <b>voltage</b> <b>drops</b> from the initial state Udc 1 to Udc,min, the maximum fault current (i 2,max) and the duration of this process (T) also needs to be obtained.|$|R
