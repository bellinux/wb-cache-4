He is known for the VRP (<b>Variety</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Program)),</b> in which variety and costs are reduced in product development. Another key product development approach by Kōdate is the henshu sekkei (cut and paste) design technique. Many techniques, including VRF, developed by Kōdate are still in use worldwide.|$|E
40|$|A Bill of Materials, or Product Structure, is a {{diagrams}} {{that lists}} {{all the components}} and parts required to produce one unit of a finished product, or end part. It is often represented as a tree structure with hierarchical relationships among different components and materials. In this paper, we introduce two procedures to convert single and multiple bills of materials into networks. These procedures allow us to leverage the potentialities of network analysis, providing new perspectives in terms of representation and extractable informative content, and thus gaining insights into the criticalities of parts and components. We conclude interpreting some network measures and their outcomes in terms of practical implications in industrial management, e. g. product functional design and, above all. <b>variety</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R

Although there are currently effective risk <b>reduction</b> <b>programs</b> for sexual victimization, those interventions fail to decrease the incidence of sexual revictimization. Therefore, a new sexual revictimization risk <b>reduction</b> <b>program</b> {{in the form of}} a dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) skills group was proposed. A review of the literature on childhood sexual abuse and sexual revictimization was conducted, including an exploration of risk factors for sexual revictimization and existing risk <b>reduction</b> <b>programs</b> for revictimization. Key features of DBT were summarized, and the rationale for and a brief overview of the proposed risk <b>reduction</b> <b>program</b> were presented...|$|R
