25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay {{also makes it}} <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Companions did not differ at all about what {{was part of the}} Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same is true of the other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E

25|$|November 23: After {{becoming}} {{a free agent}} following the conclusion to the 2011 season, the Braves decided to decline arbitration to shortstop Álex González. If the team had accepted his arbitration they would have received a compensatory draft pick {{between the first and}} second rounds of the 2012 MLB draft if González signed with another team. The move made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> González would not return as the starting shortstop in 2012. González looked to receive a multi-year contract on the free agent market, something the Braves were not willing to offer due to rising prospects such as Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons. On December 8, González signed a contract with the Milwaukee Brewers for one year and a vesting option for the 2013 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{thematic}} {{material of}} Symphony No. 2 {{is designed to}} emulate the sensation of flying. Barber was <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he did not view the symphony as program music. However, in his program notes he mentions that the first movement was meant to capture the excitement of flying while the second movement was inspired by his night flights. The final movement begins with very fast string passages with no barlines to express the sensation of flight. Samuel Barber uses tension and release throughout to create {{a greater sense of}} energy. His use of ostinatos, polytonality, dissonance, and angular lines create a work that can be described as one of Barber's most progressive works. Barber would later revise the work and state that the symphony has no programmatic intentions.|$|E
25|$|According to simulations, a two-lane {{roundabout}} {{with three}} right turns should offer 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout {{of the same}} size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it.|$|E

25|$|The Company made it <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{published}} timetables {{were only}} {{to indicate the}} times before which a train would not depart and the specified times for each stop were only given as a rough guide. Trains normally made three regular and eight conditional stops, but 'expresses' did run which did not stop between Bideford and Westward Ho!. With two engines in steam the frequency could be every half-hour, but a train every hour or so was the norm in summer, normally taking about 20 minutes from Bideford to Northam or 15 minutes for the 'express'. Fifteen trains ran in each direction in the July 1906 Bideford to Northam timetable and lighter service of four ran on Sundays. The 1910 Bradshaw's Timetable shows trains taking thirty minutes for the journey from Bideford to Appledore, ten trains in each direction, with an extra run on the Market Days (Tuesdays and Saturdays) and no trains on Sundays. The winter timetable for 1 November 1917 to 30 April 1918, which was destined never to be used, was down to seven trains in each direction and no Sunday service. Horse-drawn buses ran from Westward Ho! to Clovelly and through tickets were issued from Instow to cover the journey by ferry, railway and road transport. The bus service cost £51 18s 0d (£51.90) {{to run for the}} six months ending 31 December 1906.|$|E
