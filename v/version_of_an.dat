5|$|In 2009, Winslet narrated the English <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Icelandic {{documentary}} named A Mother's Courage: Talking Back to Autism, about Margret Ericsdottir whose child, Keli Thorsteinsson, {{suffers from}} non-verbal autism. Inspired by the story, she teamed with Ericsdottir in 2010 {{to form an}} NGO named the Golden Hat Foundation. The organisation aims to create autism awareness and was named after a poem written by Thorsteinsson. As the brand ambassador of the luxury brands Lancôme and Longines, Winslet partnered with these companies to raise awareness and funds for the foundation. She created a make-up collection for Lancôme in 2011, and in 2017, she designed a new watch for Longines.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a revised <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote {{for her first}} fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E

5|$|Johann Kuhnau, Bach's {{predecessor}} as Thomaskantor, {{composed a}} Latin Magnificat in two versions: one version {{with only the}} Latin text of the Magnificat for Marian feasts such as Visitation, and another version expanded with four German and Latin laudes relating to Christmas. When Bach presented his Latin Magnificat in 1723 (E-flat major version, BWV243a) it had the same expandable format: without laudes for Visitation, and with four laudes, on the same text as Kuhnau's, for Christmas. Another composition presented by Bach at that year's feast of the Visitation was Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV147, an expanded <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Advent cantata composed before his Leipzig period (BWV147a).|$|E

5|$|The initial {{issue of}} Shonen Jump sold over 300,000 copies, far {{exceeding}} Viz's expected 100,000 copies {{and making it}} one of the top comic titles in 2002. The first printing of 250,000 copies was sold out before the issue was released, and two additional printings were necessary to fully meet the demand. After the initial launch, the magazine had an average monthly circulation of 190,000, but it quickly grew to 205,000 by its first anniversary. The August 2003 issue, which included a demo <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upcoming Yu-Gi-Oh! PC game, was the top issue with 540,000 copies sold. As of 2008, the magazine has a circulation of 215,000, with subscriptions constituting 54% of the copies distributed.|$|E

5|$|In both games, {{there are}} many {{circumstances}} when a previous item can be upgraded into a more useful form. The latter three dungeons in both games will hold a more powerful <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> item received earlier in the game. Both the sword's offensive power and the shield's defensive abilities can be upgraded twice, once through passwords and again through side quests. If Link swings an enhanced sword at full health, a sword-shaped beam will escape from the sword as a ranged attack. The number of bombs and Mystical Seeds that can be held can also be increased through the same ways as the shield and sword. Roc's Feather and the Power Bracelet are special cases, as, while the two are in both games, the former can only be upgraded in Oracle of Seasons while the latter only in Oracle of Ages.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is a modified <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> APC {{from the previous}} titles modified {{to be able to}} build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E
5|$|Rehearsals {{began in}} Russell Square, London, with a read through. After {{a week of}} rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards {{directed}} the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned {{two days before the}} premiere and the cast had their first dress rehearsal, which lasted until 3 a.m. After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a Variety correspondent, the play closed after five performances because of low attendances. It moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, where it fared no better. By {{the end of the second}} week, Welles had resorted to reading portions of the works of Irish author J. M. Synge, and from Riders to the Sea, to attract an audience. Eventually the play simply became a <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>An</b> Evening with Orson Welles, which would often include a question and answer section with the audience and Welles's solo performance of Moby Dick—Rehearsed or the works of Isak Dinesen.|$|E

5|$|Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is {{an updated}} <b>version</b> <b>of</b> , <b>an</b> arcade-style {{fighting}} game, and changes little from the basic gameplay of the original. Players select teams {{of three different}} characters to engage in one-on-one combat. The game utilizes the same tag team-based fighting mechanics as its predecessors; players may choose to swap between their characters at any point during a match. Players must use the various attacks in their arsenal, such as character assists, special moves, and hyper combos, to exhaust their opponent's life gauge and defeat the entire enemy team, or have the most cumulative health when time runs out. While the core mechanics remain the same, a number of aesthetic changes {{have been made in}} Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, with a stronger emphasis on the comic book motif. The HUD, character selection, and stage selection screens have been redesigned. In addition, many returning characters receive balancing changes, which include new moves and animation tweaks.|$|E
