5000|$|The {{invention}} of the <b>vertical</b> <b>file</b> remains an unsolved mystery. The Vertical Filing Cabinet section in the Early Office Museum website begins {{with a discussion of}} the erroneous conclusions by highly credentialed “secondary sources,” concerning the origin of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing.</b> The secondary sources claimed that a gold medal was presented at the World’s Fair of 1893 for a <b>vertical</b> <b>file.</b> The Early Office Museum found no evidence to substantiate those claims. However, the information presented in the Early Office Museum’s discussion of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets suggests that the commercial introduction of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> may have occurred in 1900 when a company named the Library Bureau (founded in 1876, later a division of Remington Rand) published a catalog that included a <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of commercial <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets businesses kept papers in envelopes in turn stored in arrays of pigeonholes often lining a wall. Finding and opening envelopes and unfolding papers was troublesome and inefficient. However, the concept of <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> was clearly practiced as early as 1895 when a U.S. patent(533053)was issued to W.A. Cooke, Jr. for A Receptacle for Letters or Other Papers.|$|R

25|$|A {{filing cabinet}} {{is a piece}} of office {{furniture}} usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A <b>vertical</b> <b>file</b> cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15inches) of the cabinet. The <b>vertical</b> <b>filing</b> cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.|$|R

Logic {{for the use of}} 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer files {{is similar to that of}} <b>vertical</b> <b>files.</b> Unlike <b>vertical</b> <b>files,</b> most lateral files allow for side-to-side or front-to-back filing.|$|R
