5|$|The more distantly related ascomycete {{mushrooms}} of {{the genus}} <b>Verpa,</b> such as V. bohemica and V. conica, are also known as false morels, early morels or thimble morels; like the Gyromitra, they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific literature by the Czech physician and mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz in 1828, under the name Morchella bohemica. The German naturalist Joseph Schröter transferred it to the genus <b>Verpa</b> in 1893. Ptychoverpa bohemica is a synonym that was published by Frenchman Jean Louis Émile Boudier in his 1907 treatise on the Discomycetes of Europe; the name is still occasionally used, especially in European publications. Boudier believed that the large, curved ascospores and the rare and short paraphyses were sufficiently distinct to warrant a new genus to contain the single species. Ptychoverpa has also been classified as a section of <b>Verpa.</b> The section {{is characterized by the}} presence of thick longitudinal ridges on the cap that can be simple or forked.|$|E
5|$|Like many morel species, the {{ecological}} mode of Morchella populiphila {{is not known}} with certainty, but it is suspected of being both saprobic (obtaining its nourishment from nonliving or decaying organic matter) and mycorrhizal (symbiotic with trees) at different stages in its life cycle. Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups. It is found in Oregon to Nevada and northern California, where it grows on dried-out riverbeds. Fruiting, which occurs in the spring, tends to occur shortly after the emergence of <b>Verpa</b> mushrooms, and before the appearance of other morels.|$|E
5|$|Morchella populiphila is a {{distinct}} morel because of its cap attachment and its habitat, and {{it is unlikely to}} be mistaken for other species. <b>Verpa</b> bohemica is somewhat similar in appearance, but its cap hangs free from attachment to the stipe. The other North American half-free morel, Morchella punctipes, is very similar in appearance to M.populiphila, and they cannot be reliably distinguished on morphology alone. The distribution of M.punctipes extends from the Great Plains eastward. The widespread European species Morchella semilibera is morphologically indistinguishable from M.populiphila, in both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics.|$|E
500|$|The {{closely related}} species <b>Verpa</b> conica {{typically}} has a smooth cap, although specimens with wrinkled caps are known. V.conica may be distinguished microscopically by its eight-spored asci. Its North American range extends much further south than V.bohemica. Another similar group of species are the [...] "half-free" [...] morels, Morchella semilibera and others, which have a honeycombed cap that {{is attached to the}} stalk for about half of its length, and with ridges that are darker than the pits. Additionally, a cross-sectioned stem of a specimen of M.semilibera is hollow, while V.bohemica usually has cottony wisps in the stem, and M.semilibera usually has vertical perforations near the base, while V.bohemica lacks them. <b>Verpa</b> bohemica may be reliably distinguished from all similar species by its much larger spores.|$|E
500|$|<b>Verpa</b> bohemica is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae. Commonly known as the early morel (or early false morel) or the {{wrinkled}} thimble-cap, {{it is one of}} several species known informally as a [...] "false morel". The mushroom has a pale yellow or brown thimble-shaped cap— in diameter by [...] long—that has a surface wrinkled and ribbed with brain-like convolutions. The cap hangs from the top of a lighter-colored, brittle stem that measures up to [...] long by [...] thick. Microscopically, the mushroom is distinguished by its large spores, typically 60–80 by 15–18µm, and the presence of only two spores per ascus.|$|E
500|$|The edibility of {{this species}} is questionable; {{although}} <b>Verpa</b> bohemica is eaten by many, consumption of large amounts in a single sitting, or on successive days, {{has been reported to}} cause poisoning in susceptible individuals. Symptoms include gastrointestinal upset and lack of muscular coordination, similar to the effects reported by some individuals after consuming the false morel species Gyromitra esculenta. The responsible toxin in G.esculenta is gyromitrin; it is suspected that V.bohemica may be able to synthesize low levels of the toxin. Over-consumption of the mushroom has been reported to have induced a coma. Those who do wish to eat this species are often advised to parboil with copious quantities of water (discarding the water before consumption), to dry the specimens before eating, or, if eating for the first time, to restrict consumption to small portions to test their tolerance. Some advocate only eating the caps and discarding the stems. Opinions on the flavor of the mushrooms vary, ranging from [...] "strong but not on a par with true morels", to [...] "pleasant", to [...] "not distinctive".|$|E
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} V.bohemica grow singly or {{scattered}} {{on the ground in}} woods in early spring, often before the appearance of the morel, and throughout the morel season. It is often found along riverbanks, near cottonwoods, willows and aspens, often buried in plant litter. The fungus prefers to fruit in moist areas with ample sunlight. Its minimum growth temperature is , with an optimum of , and a maximum of about [...] A study of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios indicated that <b>Verpa</b> bohemica is saprobic, that is, obtaining nutrients from decomposing organic matter. It has been suggested, however, that the fungus is mycorrhizal for at least part of its life cycle. The fungus has a wide distribution throughout northern North America; its range extends south to the Great Lakes in the Midwestern United States, and south to northern California on the West Coast. In Europe, the fungus is widely distributed, and has been collected from Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the Ukraine. In Asia, it has been recorded from India and Turkey.|$|E

Most Romance languages have adopted metaphorical euphemisms as the chief words for the penis; as in [...] Spanish, Portuguese and Italian verga, obscene for penis, and in Romanian vargă (although pulă is far more common), and in Catalan and French verge, from Latin virga, [...] "staff".|$|E

50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} {{under the name}} Phallus conicus by Otto Friedrich Müller in 1775.

The species was transferred to <b>Verpa</b> by Olof Swartz in 1814.|$|E
50|$|The name {{false morel}} {{is given to}} several species of {{mushroom}} which bear a resemblance to the highly regarded true morels of the genus Morchella.

50|$|Other {{than the}} anamorph genus Costantinella, the three {{remaining}} genera of Morchellaceae are distinguished by ascocarp morphology. Morchella species have an ascocarp with a sponge-like pileus, with a hollow stipe and pileus. <b>Verpa</b> species have a cup-like or thimble-shaped, smooth or wrinkled pileus above a hollow stipe.
