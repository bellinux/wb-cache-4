A running illustrative example (containing a base and a future case) is developed, using plausible values for each factor in the model. The base case suggests that 6. 1 per cent of the workforce may be currently telecommuting, with 1. 5 per cent doing so on any given day, eliminating at most 1 per cent of total household <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled.</b> Future reductions could be smaller as commute distances of telecommuters become more average and as the stimulation effect of telecommuting grows.

40|$|Throughout the United States, {{state highway}} revenue, which is {{dominated}} by receipts from fuel taxes, has failed {{to keep up with}} expected investments required for infrastructure preservation and improvement. The reasons for this trend include the increasing fuel efficiency of vehicles, slowing of the growth in <b>vehicle-miles</b> of <b>travel,</b> and the erosion of the purchasing power of the dollar due to inflation. This development motivates highway agencies not only to seek new funding sources but also to make predictions of the expected future revenues from existing and potential sources. ^ To establish and implement an effective and efficient financing strategy that incorporates potential new funding sources, it is necessary to model the possible outcomes of these sources in terms of their impacts on revenue stream and to study the sensitivity of these outcomes with respect to changes in key revenue factors such as <b>vehicle-miles</b> of <b>travel</b> and fuel price. In addressing this issue, this study utilizes data on amounts of travel, fuel price, and other primary information to enhance the existing models for state highway revenue forecasting in Indiana. To facilitate implementation of the study results, the existing revenue forecasting software package has been enhanced to include traditional and new revenue sources, to estimate revenue under several different scenarios, and also to analyze sensitivity of revenue to changes in input factors such as fuel price, per capita income, gross domestic product, driving age population, and traffic growth rate. The package provides long range annual forecasts for both existing and alternative highway revenue sources in Indiana, and short range forecasts for existing highway sources. ...|$|R

This comparison provides an assessment of how well the two networks in question deal with trips generated by the activities which they serve. All aspects of the modelled communities are held constant except for the actual configuration of the networks. This type of evaluation can indicate, for example, whether the same level of activity (defined by the land uses within the community) creates greater congestion on one type of network, or if trip lengths on one network are generally longer.

40|$|As {{congestion}} grows along roadways in the country, it {{is important}} to see how this will affect crashes on America 2 ̆ 7 s highways. I- 80 in Iowa is a major trucking corridor for transferring goods between the east and west coasts and carries an increasing volume of freight trucks on the road. The recent ability to record detailed speed and volume data over Iowa 2 ̆ 7 s road system presents a new opportunity to examine whether congestion and slowdown affect the occurrence and severity of crashes along I- 80. This study examines the use of INRIX speed data, Wavetronix radar data and Road Weather Information Systems [RWIS] data on I- 80 in Iowa to model freight truck crashes. A random-parameter Poisson regression model is used to examine how speed, weather and roadway characteristics affect the frequency of crashes along different segments. An ordered probit model examines how these factors affect the severity of injuries in truck crashes. In general, lower speeds and congestion were associated with more frequent crashes (taking into account the <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled)</b> of lower severity.

Extensive planning and review is needed to keep this corridor running as efficiently as possible, minimizing the impacts of construction or disruptions. The Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) has established re-routing plans for portions of I- 95 in Delaware. These plans provide guidance to system managers and law enforcement {{as to how to}} re-direct traffic in case sections of the interstate are closed. These plans are based on the knowledge and experience of the DelDOT Traffic Management Team. However, it is difficult to evaluate these plans since complete closures are thankfully rare events. There does exist a capability to evaluate these plans, without disrupting traffic, by using a simulation model. Using the DelDOT regional transportation planning model, which covers the entire DelMarVa Peninsula, a series of scenarios were developed and tested to evaluate the existing plans and suggest alternatives. Each scenario was compared to the un-disrupted condition and impact to drivers was measured by computing additional <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled</b> and vehicle-hours travelled and looking at the impact on the environment by the increased emissions.

40|$|Park-and-Ride (PnR) lots are an {{increasingly}} common element of many areas ’ plans for air qual-ity conformity. By {{making it easier}} to carpool or use transit, PnR lots should theoretically reduce the number of persons driving alone, especially to work. However, accessing a PnR lot still requires a vehicle trip (usually a “cold start ” trip) and the <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled</b> (VMT), conges-tion impact, and emissions of the PnR access trip should be accounted for in order to produce a proper accounting of the potential air quality benefits of PnR lots. Few, if any, travel models estimate the impacts of carpool PnR lots. If carpool lots are to be rea-sonably considered as part of a region’s air quality conformity strategy, their impacts must be ana-lyzed. Some adhoc manual methods or geographic information system (GIS) -based have been developed, but the author is unaware of any network-based models which are sensitive to such lots. Careful, detailed analysis of carpool lots is important, because such lots are generally not considered to {{have a major impact on}} carpool formation (and properly so). Further, given the time and distance necessary to access the lot, it is entirely possible that some carpool PnR lots could actually increase VMT.

Concern has also been expressed regarding the current dependency of the U,S, on foreign oil. An option for addressing these concerns is to reduce <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled</b> (VMT), High- occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes have been cited as one alternative for achieving this goal. However, latent travel demand frequently negates {{some or all of the}} VMT savings brought about by HOV lanes, The net effects of modal shifts to HOV lanes and the subsequent latent travel demand were studied in the thesis, A methodology was developed for estimating vehicle emissions and energy consumption impacts of modal shifts from private vehicles in the freeway mainlanes to buses in an HOV lane when latent travel demand is considered. The methodology was evaluated and determined to yield reasonable results, Finally, the methodology was applied to a freeway corridor in Houston, Texas. The results of the application indicate that reductions in VMT do not necessarily cause reductions in vehicle emissions of interest even when considered, all three of the pollutants of latent travel demand is not consumption was decreased at considered.

40|$|This {{research}} {{identified and}} analysed {{a number of}} inland port sites in the five counties surrounding Los Angeles, using a location-allocation methodology. It also considered the inland ports' potential for integration into a more efficient regional intermodal goods movement system served by the southern California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. GIS was used to map the sites where international cargo is processed in the five counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura. One hundred transportation zones were determined from a truck travel {{survey conducted by the}} ports. These zones represent density points for distribution/processing centres. First, a single facility location model was used to define the proximal location of an inland port that minimises the total truck-miles travelled. Then, we extended this model to a series of location-allocation models with up to six inland port locations included. With no inland port (current system), the total daily <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled</b> (VMT) is 220, 100 miles, and the average trip length is 11. 6 miles. As more inland ports are added to the location-allocation model, the total truck-miles travelled is reduced significantly. The new system follows the concept of a ‘satellite inland port’, which is based on a hub-and-spoke configuration. Also, with significant reductions in VMT, a proportional amount of congestion relief and air pollution reduction is expected from this new goods movement framework. The results show that the mathematical approach is a useful platform for initial investigations into inland port site selection.

40|$|Procedures {{developed}} for the estimation of <b>Vehicle-Miles</b> of <b>Travel</b> (VMT) have been fraught with problems of inaccuracy. Emphasis on environmental issues (air quality), as mandated by current regulations (CAAA, ISTEA- 91, and TEA 21), requires State DOTs to accurately estimate travel on their highway infrastructure. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has developed, and subsequently modified, the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) to assist in data collection and reporting. INDOT currently estimates VMT by a method that closely follows the HPMS method. Roads that {{are not on the}} state highway system (minor collectors, urban collectors and local) are not represented in the estimation procedure, thus INDOT is uncomfortable with the accuracy of the statewide VMT estimates reported to the FHWA. Cross-classification models are being developed, based on licensed driver and household travel characteristics, with data from the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS). These models are intended to address the problems of sampling bias associated with current VMT estimation procedures because they are independent of highway functional class.

The proposed model is applied with the SACSIM regional travel demand model to illustrate that households with a higher mixed index generate less VMT. As a result, this research not only confirms that jurisdictions within the SACOG region would produce less VMT with greater land use diversity policies, it also provides a tool to quantify or measure the mix of land use at the household or parcel level.

The study simulated the effects of the Washington State Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) programs implemented by 189 employers on an 8. 6 -mile segment of I- 5 in the Seattle downtown area. This comprehensive dataset included before/after employer trip reduction plans and the origins/destinations of nearly 63, 000 commuters working for those 189 employers. The current performance of the selected network was compared to that of a scenario with reduced vehicle trips due to CTR programs added back onto the network.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of optimizing maintenance, repair and reconstruction decisions for bridge networks. Incorporating network topologies into bridge management problems is computationally difficult. Because of the interdependencies among networked bridges, {{they have to be}} analyzed together. Simulation-based numerical optimization techniques adopted in past research are limited to networks of moderate sizes. In this dissertation, novel approaches are developed to determine the maintenance policies that best balance network performance and agency cost. For two different types of networks, two performance metrics are adopted, and the research is divided into two parts accordingly. The first part focuses on moderate-size networks with limited redundancy. The network performance is quantified by a graph-theoretic indicator of network connectivity, since connectivity is the fundamental service function of a network. The objective is to ensure an adequate level of network connectivity at the lowest possible life-cycle maintenance cost. A novel two-stage approach is developed, which makes it possible to solve the problem by using standard optimization tools (with guaranteed convergence to optimality), as opposed to the heuristic algorithms used in related literature. The second part studies large and redundant networks, and the network performance is quantified by the total user costs due to potential bridge failures. The objective is to minimize the total user costs, specifically, the extra travel distance over a planning horizon and under a budget constraint. It is conjectured and then verified that the expected increase in <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled</b> due to failures can be approximated by the sum of expected increases due to individual failures. This allows the network-level problem to be decomposed into single-bridge problems and tackled efficiently. The computational effort increases linearly with the number of bridges...|$|E

Results suggest that congestion spurs firms to decentralize and agglomerate away from the urban center, with households living more centrally. A congestion-toll policy brings more compact urban form and serves as the most effective strategy to reduce congestion and correct congestion externalities, by maximally improving social welfare.

Methods: Driver involvement rates for all police reported crashes were calculated per capita, per licensed driver, and per <b>vehicle-mile</b> of <b>travel</b> for 1990 and 1995. Also, driver involvement rates for fatal crashes were calculated for 1983, 1990, and 1995.

Results: Driver crash involvement rates per capita decreased with age, but fatal involvement rates per capita increased starting at age 70. The same pattern existed for involvement rates per licensed driver. For both all crashes and fatal crashes, involvement rates per mile driven increased appreciably at age 70. Using projections of population growth, it was estimated that for all ages there will be a 34 % increase in the number of drivers involved in police reported crashes and a 39 % increase in the number involved in fatal crashes between 1999 and 2030.

Past studies on the issue of highway revenue forecasting for Indiana highways were conducted under different economic conditions than what exists today. The present study updates the revenue projections of particularly with the recognition of new CAFE Standards. The present study also updates the equations for estimating vehicle miles of travel. Impacts of alternative options for changing the fuel tax rate structure are also investigated. The present study predicted fuel tax revenues from 2012 to 2025 under the existing fuel tax rate structure and also considered possible options for changes in fuel tax rates. Fuel tax revenue from existing rate structure indicated a continuous annual decrease from 2012 to 2025 by 2. 96 % to 3. 49 % in real terms. Adopting one of the four fuel tax rate modifications would provide additional short- term revenue for a variable number of years.

The same study highlights a rate of 15.7 deaths per 100, 000 for the 65  years and over group compared to a rate of 24.7 deaths per 100, 000 {{of the population in}} the 15 – 24  years group and 9.6 in the 24 – 65  years age group [7]. Li et al.

However, in the same study, a measure of fragility can be found by comparing the number of road deaths per number of drivers involved in a crash (a measure of risk) and excessive crash involvement (i.e. drivers involved in crashes per <b>vehicle-miles</b> <b>travelled</b> (VMT)) showed that the rate of drivers involved in crashes per VMT was highest for those aged 16 – 19  years and falls rapidly until the 70 – 74  years age group when it rises again. Thus, although the under 24  years age group has a larger crash risk than the over 65  years age group, the over 65 group drives comparatively fewer miles than the under 24 age group, but are more likely to suffer more serious or even fatal injuries, thereby having a higher measure of fragility and vulnerability. Furthermore, elderly drivers also have a problem with maintaining a constant vehicle speed [9].|$|E

The study identified {{gaps in the}} existing practice and research, and established a practical framework that includes the development of asset families; establishment of realistic types and timings of reconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance, traffic volumes and growth projections; and damage cost estimation for each asset family and age group. The sensitivity of asset damage cost with respect to key policy and analysis variables was explored. Finally, the study examined the cost and operational issues associated with the enforcement of overweight truck policies. For pavement assets, the damage cost estimates were found to range from $ 0. 006 per ESAL-mile on Interstates to $ 0. 218 per ESAL-mile on non-national highways. The results also suggested that the pavement damage cost estimates are highly sensitive to the pavement life-cycle length, interest rate, rest period, and the costs and service lives of rehabilitation treatments.

The relationship between changes in emissions related to motor-vehicle use and changes in health welfare (measured in dollars) can be modeled in three steps: 1) relate changes in emissions to changes in air quality; 2) relate changes in air quality to changes in physical health effects; and 3) relate changes in physical health effects to changes in economic welfare. We have made a detailed model of this sort to estimate the cost of the health effects of motor-vehicle air pollution 1. We estimate the human-health cost of motor-vehicle air pollution in the entire U. S., in urban areas of the U. S., in rural areas of the U.

This ?induced? travel has implications for the site planning process, which assumes that all internal trips are replacing trips on the external street network. In this investigation, travel survey data were analyzed to determine {{the nature and extent of}} induced travel at mixed-use developments. The study site was a 75 -acre suburban infill mixed-use development in Plano, Texas. Features of the study site included a diverse land-use mix, a grid-style street layout, and pedestrian-oriented streetscapes. The travel survey was administered as an interview of persons exiting buildings at the site and gathered information about two trips made by the respondent, including whether the trip made at the time of the interview was induced. A trip was considered induced if the respondent would not have made the trip if it had required travel outside of Legacy Town Center. Analysis found that in the morning, four percent of all trips at the study site were induced; in the afternoon, about one-quarter of all trips were induced. Induced trips accounted for one-eighth of internal trips in the morning and forty percent of internal trips in the afternoon. Most internal trips made in an automobile were replacements for off-site travel while most trips made on foot were induced. Based on this study, it is evident that some internal trips at mixeduse developments are not ?captured? from external streets, but represent additional trips, induced by travel cost savings in the mixed-use environment. However, it is demonstrated that, even with this additional travel, mixed-use developments still contribute to a reduction in overall <b>vehicle-miles</b> of <b>travel.</b> Stakeholders are encouraged to consider these findings when evaluating new land-use policies or the traffic impacts of proposed mixed-use developments...|$|R
40|$|The freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) {{collects}} {{real time}} traffic data from sensors and generates performance measures of vehicle miles traveled, hours traveled, and travel time. This project {{is sponsored by}} the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). PeMS provides tools and reports for traffic planners, operators, and engineers. It has a Web interface. Growing traffic demand in metropolitan areas has far outpaced increases in freeway lane-miles in the United States. The solution to congestion lies in increasing the efficiency of existing infrastructure. Performance measurement {{is the first step in}} effective management and operation of any system. Currently, the freeway system is not managed scientifically. Planning and operating decisions are made without accurate knowledge of the performance of each part of the system. PeMS collects data from automatic sensors that are already installed on most of California freeways. Its large database of real time and historical data 2 allows us to accurately measure the performance of freeways and its trends. Traffic planners need this information to allocate the available resources to improve mobility. PeMS computes performance measures and other traffic quantities from sensor data. Among them are speed, vehicle-hours of delay, <b>vehicle-miles</b> traveled, and <b>travel</b> time statistics. These values can be visualized in plots and summarized in reports, and they are available online through a Web interface. Policy makers can use PeMS to evaluate the effect of their decisions and set performance targets, planners monitor trends in congestion and respond with congestion-reduction measures, engineers view detailed data to improve conditions at specific locations, and travelers use the information to make more informed decisions. Researchers use PeMS's database to analyze traffic behavior on a large scale. We present some results from studies on freeway capacity, travel time variability, and the impact of incident on overall delay. In these cases, using observations from a large number of locations and times allows us to characterize traffic flow statistically. PeMS processes raw data into useful forms. It computes speed from single loop detectors, predict travel time from real time and historical data, and detect and fix data errors. We describe these data processing algorithms, which are based on empirical models and fitted to historical data. ...|$|R
