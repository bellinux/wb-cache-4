5|$|Underwater {{vision is}} {{affected}} by the clarity and the refractive index of the medium. Visibility underwater is reduced because light passing through water attenuates rapidly with distance, leading to lower levels of natural illumination. Underwater objects are also blurred by scattering of light between the object and the viewer, resulting in lower contrast. These effects vary with the wavelength of the light, and the colour and turbidity of the water. The human eye is optimised for air vision, and when it is immersed in direct contact with water, visual acuity is adversely affected by the difference in refractive index between water and air. Provision of an airspace between the cornea and the water can compensate, but causes scale and distance distortion. Artificial illumination can improve visibility at short range. Stereoscopic acuity, the ability to judge relative distances of different objects, is considerably reduced underwater, and this {{is affected by}} the field of vision. A narrow field of vision caused by a small <b>viewport</b> in a helmet results in greatly reduced stereoacuity, and an apparent movement of a stationary object when the head is moved. These effects lead to poorer hand-eye coordination.|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{said the}} stereo sound helped gamers to locate events that {{occurred}} outside the current <b>viewport.</b> K. Bailey of 1UP liked units' speech effects, especially in response to repeated clicks, while Scott Love and the J-Man found this monotonous. Game Revolution’s review of the Mac version complained that Warcraft: Orcs & Humans’s graphics, which were ported from the DOS version's VGA, did not exploit the Macintosh's superior resolution. However, Game Revolution and Mac Gamer agreed that visual shortcomings did not reduce Mac gamers' enjoyment of the engrossing gameplay. Both also complained that the Macintosh was released {{about a year later}} than the DOS version. In contrast, a reviewer for Next Generation, while not overlooking the fact that Warcraft II was already out by the time the Macintosh version was released, made no criticism on this point, and asserted that [...] "Amazingly easy to pick up and play, Warcraft still manages to offer enough challenge to keep gaming veterans happy for hour after hour.

Tools like [...] "Hyperion", a lightmap rendering software, were used in place of Maya’s <b>viewport</b> rendering software. In-game animation was assisted with another tool they created called [...] "AnimationBlender" [...] and particle effects were edited using a tool called [...] "Particle Editor".

The other lights (another name for the <b>viewports)</b> are generally fixed. <b>Viewports</b> were glass on the early helmets, {{with some of the}} later helmets using acrylic, and are usually protected by brass or bronze grilles. [...] The helmet has fittings to connect the air line and the diver's telephone.|$|R

50|$|The inputs are {{a list of}} polygons and a <b>viewport.</b> The {{best case}} {{is that if the}} list of polygons is simple, then draw the polygons in the <b>viewport.</b> Simple is defined as one polygon (then the polygon or its part is drawn in {{appropriate}} part of a <b>viewport)</b> or a <b>viewport</b> that is one pixel in size (then that pixel gets a color of the polygon closest to the observer).

40|$|Using {{everyday}} skills, such as {{pointing and}} drawing freehand sketches, facilitates effective communication when reviewing visual information. However, for sharing three-dimensional (3 D) data, {{it is difficult}} to support such approaches of using hands and real ink in a seamless way. This thesis proposes a new system design called AnnoScape as an approach to performing a remote collaborative review of 3 D digital data using a live video overlay of the desktop image on the <b>viewports</b> of the 3 D scene. The system's virtual <b>viewports</b> are controlled with tangible handles and can be left spatially in the 3 D data space. The <b>viewports</b> can be shared with remote collaborators both asynchronously and in real time. The system allows distributed users to navigate shared 3 D space individually or jointly (synchronizing the viewport); generate an overlay of the live video of hand drawings, physical objects, and printed images from the desktop surface with the viewport; and control the legibility of the visual contents. This spatial video overlay technique in the 3 D data space allows distributed users to share the live annotations over the synchronized <b>viewports.</b> We report the prototype design and initial experiments to explore AnnoScape's possibilities through the scenario of having remote collaborators review the exterior site and interior reconfiguration of an existing architectural setting. by Austin Seungmin Lee.

40|$|For {{successful}} operation, all manned diving systems, submersibles, and hyperbaric chambers re-quire pressure-resistant vie~kports. These <b>viewports</b> {{allow the}} personnel inside the diving bells and sub-mersibles {{to observe the}} environment outside the pressure-resistant hulls. In addition, on land, opera-tors of hyperbaric chambers can observe the behavior of patients or divers undergoing hyperbaric treatment inside the chambers. Since the <b>viewports</b> form {{a part of the}} pressure-resistant envelope, they must meet or surpass the safety criteria used for designing either the metallic or plastic composite pressure envelope. The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section 8 provides such design criteria, and the chambers/ pressure hulls designed on their basis have generated an unexcelled safety record. The <b>viewports,</b> because of the unique structural properties of the acrylic plastic used in construct-ing the windows, could not be designed according to the same criteria as for the pressure envelopes fabricated of metallic or piastic composite materials. To preclude potential catastrophic failures of windows designed on the basis of inadequate data, in 1965, the U. S. Navy initiated a window testing program at the Naval Civil Engineering Laborator % and the Naval Ocean Systems Center. trnder this program, window testing was conducted until 1975...|$|R
