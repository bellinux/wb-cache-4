2500|$|Exploitation of the Pittsburgh-seam coal began slowly. Initially, blacksmiths and foundrymen made coal into coke to use {{in their}} hearths and small furnaces. During the early nineteenth century, {{entrepreneurs}} in western Pennsylvania adapted British coke-making practices to produce coke for local iron works. To make coke, coal is burned under controlled conditions to drive off <b>volatile</b> <b>matter</b> (gases expelled when coal is burned), leaving carbon and ash from the coal fused together {{in the form of}} coke. They made coke in turf-covered [...] "mounds," [...] in which coal burned slowly and without oxygen to drive off impurities. [...] The adoption of beehive coke ovens in the 1830s spurred the use of Pittsburgh-seam coal in iron furnaces, and these ovens made better-quality coke than mounds.|$|E

30|$|In the {{underground}} coal mine settings, the essential conditions for coal dust {{to participate in}} an explosion are: (1) fine coal dust suspended in air with a minimum concentration of 100  g/m 3 for biyuminous coal and (2) sufficient ignition energy with a minimum temperature of 440  °C (Stephan). The first condition ensures sufficient reaction surface between the fine coal dust particles and oxygen in the air. The second condition provides sufficient thermal energy to ignite the coal dust and to sustain the chain explosion process. It should be noted that among the combustible contents in the coal (mainly the <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> and the fixed carbon), the <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> should be the first part and most likely the only part {{to be involved in the}} explosion process considering the short contact time between the passing hot air and the coal dust particles. However, the <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> have to be devolatilized, stimulated with sufficient thermal energy, into vapor before the start of dust explosion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract>> Effect of {{inherent}} <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> in fuels on electrochemical {{reactions of}} anode was investigated {{for a single}} direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC). Raw coals used as power source in the DCFC release light gases into the atmosphere under the operating temperature of DCFC (700 ℃) by thermal decomposition and only char remained. These exhausted gases change the gas composition around anode and affect the electrochemical oxidation reaction of system. To investigate the effect of produced gases, comparative study was conducted between Indonesian sub-bituminous coal and its char obtained through thermal treatment, carbonizing. Maximum power density of raw coal (52 mW/cm 2) was appeared {{higher than that of}} char (37 mW/cm 2) because the gases produced from the raw coal during thermal decomposition gave additional positive results to electrochemical reaction of the system. The produced gases from coals were analyzed using TGA and FT-IR. The influence of <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> on anodic electrolyte-electrode interface was observed by the equivalent circuit induced from fitting of impedance spectroscopy data...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce CO_ 2 {{emission}} from combustion systems with fossil fuel, {{it is necessary to}} increase thermal efficiency of them. Heat recovery from flue gas is very effective in increasing thermal efficiency of a small furnace. Through this heat recovery, temperature of flue gas decreased with increasing a recovery amount of heat. It is feared that a decrease of temperature newly causes secondary condensed particles in a stack, and these particles become a problem in future. In this study, therefore, particulate matters (PM) in a flue gas stream from a spray combustion furnace were sampled and their compositions and size distributions were measured. As the result, it was shown that the mass of <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> in PM and the number of particle gradually increased along the stack.

The total concentration of CO and CO 2 represented {{the rate of}} coal oxidation. We did not measure the CO 2 for the limitation of the Gas Analyzer, hence the exact rate of coal combustion could not be known, but we could gain a general idea by analyzing the concentration of O 2 and CO. Figure 1 shows the emission {{profiles of}} NO, CO and O 2. It was clearly seen {{that there were a}} major peak of O 2 reduction at nearly 6000 C and a shoulder peak at about 4500 C. The shoulder peak resulted from the combustion of volatile, and the main peak was due to the combustion of char. The peak temperature for CO formation is at around 5000 C, which is mainly due to the oxidation of <b>volatile</b> <b>matters.</b> After that, with rising the temperature the oxidation of CO accelerated, {{at the same time the}} oxidation of char to form CO became difficult because of the bad reactivity of char compare to that of <b>volatile</b> <b>matters,</b> the CO concentration was decreased and formed a shoulder peak at about 5500 C...|$|R

50|$|Lignite {{begins as}} an {{accumulation}} of partially decayed plant material, or peat. Burial by other sediments results in increasing temperature, depending on the local geothermal gradient and tectonic setting, and increasing pressure. This causes compaction of the material and loss {{of some of the}} water and <b>volatile</b> <b>matter</b> (primarily methane and carbon dioxide). This process, called coalification, concentrates the carbon content, and thus the heat content, of the material. Deeper burial and the passage of time result in further expulsion of moisture and <b>volatile</b> <b>matter,</b> eventually transforming the material into higher rank coals such as bituminous and anthracite coal.|$|E

40|$|The cement {{industry}} is a high energy consumer. This energy is mostly provided by the combustion of pulverized carbonaceous solid fuels. Up to 60 % of this fuel income may be injected into the calciner. However, the combustion of solid fuels produces pollutants, particularly NOx. Several reduction technology were developed. The most promising one, in term of cost and efficiency, is the reburning. It consists in a secondary fuel injection, creating a fuel rich zone favorable to NOx reduction. The fuel injection in cement plant calciners may be compared to this technique. The solids interact with NOx at different levels : through gas phase reactions with <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> released during the pyrolysis, and through solid-gas heterogeneous reactions : i. e. char oxidation that produces N-species and NO reduction at the char surface. A coupled experimental and modeling protocol was developed to determine the relative contribution of these different phenomena. The used fuels are of four distinct types, commonly used in cement plants: a lignite, a coal, an anthracite and a petcoke. Thus, the elementary heterogeneous reactions – devolatilisation, char oxidation and NO reduction by char – were characterized by specific experiments and modelings. One observes a large disparity between the four fuels in terms of kinetic parameters and quantity of <b>volatile</b> <b>matters</b> released. Finally, the experiments and modelings representative of the reactions occurring simultaneously during reburning in calciner conditions were performed. It appears {{that the effect of}} NO reduction in the gas phase is of the same order of magnitude that the effect of reduction by char after a particle residence time of 2 s. The NO reduction by char increases continuously with the temperature, whereas the gas phase reduction presents singularities in function of the temperature for the high volatile fuels: The NO reduction is lower at 900 C than at 800 and 1000 C, in case of lignite and coal. A detailed chemical analysis of these singularities was carried out and enabled to determine the main reaction paths occurring during NOx formation and reduction in the gas phase...|$|R
