5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or {{in groups}} or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in fairy rings.

5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions of the map are gated off until specific levels are completed.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane.

Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in Vorticons the player can save their game at any point. In between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game.

The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing.

In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, or by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given a password that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever a password is entered.|$|E
