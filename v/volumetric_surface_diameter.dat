40|$|In {{computer}} graphics, {{two types}} of geometric representations are widely used: surfaces and volumes. Surfaces are infinitely thin skins defining the boundary of an object, and {{have been successful in}} modeling realistic appearances. However, their lack of information about the solid nature of objects make them inadequate for many applica-tions. Volumes represent the entire solid geometry of an object in a three-dimensional grid. Volumes, however, are inefficient and cannot achieve high resolutions since they must maintain information about internal geometry that is not pertinent to rendering realistic appearances. We have created a new, hybrid data structure, the <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface,</b> which com-bines the benefits of surfaces and volumes. A <b>volumetric</b> <b>surface</b> represents solid ma-terials in a thin region near the surface of an object in an efficient, multi-resolution data structure. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>surfaces</b> are thus designed to exploit the coherency of roughly surface aligned-layers of materials which are ubiquitous in real-world mate-rials.

Film thicknesses were varied by variation of oxidation parameters time, temperature, and oxygen concentration and measured with electron microscopy. The mass density of the porous carbon film material was estimated by fitting a geometrical model to experimental gravimetric data. Optical Raman spectroscopy line scans suggest that the porosity has a gradient between the surface and the film/bulk interface, which is supported by pore-size distribution data obtained from small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) on slightly oxidized and fully oxidized samples. Detailed inspection of the power law behavior of SAXS data suggests that the internal surface area of well-oxidized glassy carbon (GC) is compact and extends over the entire probed volume and thus has optimal pore connectivity. This effect goes along with pore enlargement and a relative decrease of internal surface area per volume. Slightly oxidized carbon has no pore space with a compact, high connectivity internal surface area.

These systems are attractive since they provide global data coverage and the horizontal resolution is similar to weather forecasting models.
