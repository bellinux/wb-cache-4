50|$|The London and Croydon Railway system {{employed}} a metal weather cover over the <b>leather</b> <b>valve,</b> {{but this was}} not used on the SDR line.|$|R
50|$|The slot {{was sealed}} by a {{longitudinal}} <b>leather</b> <b>valve,</b> that was lifted by rollers on the piston carriage as it passed, {{to let the}} piston bracket pass. Samuda was contracted to supply this.|$|R
2500|$|The {{system was}} that {{designed}} and patented by the Samuda Brothers. The pipe was laid in [...] sections between the [...] broad gauge rails with a continuous slot {{along the top}} that was sealed by a <b>leather</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{blow pipe}} is a short, conical wooden or bone tube {{in which the}} player blows to refill the bag. At {{the end of the}} blow pipe that is within the bag, there is a small return <b>valve</b> of <b>leather</b> or felt which allows air into the bag via the blow pipe but not back out. In some more {{primitive}} gaida there is no flap, but the player blocks returning air with his tongue during breaths.|$|R
50|$|Reed <b>valves,</b> {{normally}} a <b>leather</b> flap covering a hole, are amongst the earliest form of automatic flow control for liquids and gases. They {{have been used}} for thousands of years in water pumps and for hundreds of years in bellows for high-temperature forges and musical instruments such as church organs and accordions. In nature, heart valves operate in a somewhat similar fashion.|$|R
5000|$|Brunel's {{report to}} the Directors, now shown the meeting, was comprehensive, {{and he was also}} mindful of his own {{delicate}} position, and of the contractual obligations of Samuda. He described the stationary engines, obtained from three suppliers: [...] "These engines have not, on the whole, proved successful; none of them have as yet worked very economically, and some are very extravagant in the use of fuel." [...] As to the difficulties with the <b>leather</b> <b>valve</b> in extremes of weather, heat, frost and heavy rain, ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>leather</b> <b>valve</b> {{along the}} top of the pipe tended to dry out and air could then leak in, but this was mitigated {{slightly}} by the passing trains spraying water on the leather. The harsh environment of the line, which runs adjacent to the sea for much of its length and is often soaked with salt spray, presented difficulties in maintaining the leather flaps provided to seal the vacuum pipes, which had to be kept supple by being greased with tallow; even so, air leaked in, reducing the pressure difference.|$|R

5000|$|The pump was {{operated}} by a breastshot water wheel which was direct coupled to a three-throw crankshaft (cast in 1912) which swung three 12 ft long beams pivoted at one end through connecting rods. The pump plunger rods connected to the outer free ends of the beams travel in a substantially straight-line motion; these were fitted with back to back 6 in diameter leather cups and non-return <b>valves</b> made from <b>leather</b> flaps. The pump has three cylinders with a 6.5 in bore and a stroke of 13 in. The pump could produce an operating pressure of in excess of [...]|$|R
50|$|In 1844, the L&CR {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to lay an additional line {{next to the}} existing track and test an atmospheric railway system. Pumping stations were built at Portland Road, Croydon and Dartmouth Arms, which created a vacuum in a pipe laid between the running rails. A free-running piston in the pipe {{was attached to the}} train through a slit sealed by a <b>leather</b> <b>valve.</b> The piston, and hence the train, was propelled towards the pumping station by atmospheric pressure. The pumping stations were built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower, which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|R

25|$|In the 3rd century BCE, Li Bing, an {{official}} of the expansionist and innovative Qin dynasty, in addition to organizing the Sichuan basin water control system at Dujiangyan, discovered that the salt pools which had been used for many centuries were actually fed from deep under the ground, the remnants of an ancient inland sea. He ordered first that the pools be made deeper, then that wells be dug, and eventually that narrower and more efficient shafts be sunk. By the end of the 2nd century CE, workers had devised a system of <b>leather</b> <b>valves</b> and bamboo pipes which drew up both brine and natural gas, which they burned to boil the brine (the technology they developed for the bamboo piping was eventually applied to household plumbing).|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the entire}} length of the tube, a section is made in the top, leaving an open space of about five inches. In each cut edge of the section there is an offset, to catch the edges of a valve which fits down upon it. The valve is made of a piece of sole leather half an inch thick, having plates of iron {{attached}} to it on both the upper and corresponding under side to give it strength ... which are perhaps one-fourth of an inch in thickness ... The plates are about nine inches long, and their ends, above and below, are placed three quarters of an inch apart, forming joints, so as to give the <b>leather</b> <b>valve</b> pliability, and at the same time firmness.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1847-1848 the <b>leather</b> flap <b>valve</b> that sealed the {{traction}} pipe slot began to give trouble. During the cold days of winter the leather froze hard in frost after saturation in rain. This resulted in its failing to seat properly {{after the passage of}} a train, allowing air into the pipe and reducing the effectiveness of pumping. In the following spring and summer there was hot and dry weather and the <b>leather</b> <b>valve</b> dried out, with pretty much the same outcome. Brunel had the leather treated with whale oil in an attempt to maintain flexibility. There was said to be a chemical reaction between the tannin in the leather and iron oxide on the pipe. There were also difficulties with the leather cup seal on the pistons.|$|R
50|$|Reeds are pre-tuned to {{individual}} pitches. Tuning may involve changing a reeds length, the weight near its free end, or the stiffness near its fixed end. Longer, heavier and springier reeds produce deeper, lower sounds; shorter, lighter and stiffer reeds make higher-pitched sounds. If, as on most modern harmonicas, a reed is affixed {{above or below}} its slot {{rather than in the}} plane of the slot, it responds more easily to air flowing in the direction that initially would push it into the slot, i.e., as a closing reed. This difference in response to air direction makes it possible to include both a blow reed and a draw reed in the same air chamber and to play them separately without relying on flaps of plastic or <b>leather</b> (<b>valves,</b> wind-savers) to block the nonplaying reed.|$|R
25|$|A round {{drilling}} edge is used, {{being the}} size of a drinking bowl, while the depth of the borehole amounts to several tens of zhang. Large bamboo stems are used with the septa removed and fitted together by male-female joints to form the well, thus keeping the fresh water out so that the salty spring water comes up by itself. Smaller bamboo tubes are also used which travel {{up and down in the}} wells as buckets. They have no bottom, but an orifice is mounted at the top. A piece of leather of several inches in size is hung up. As the tubes go in and out of the brine, the air pushes and sucks, closing and opening the <b>leather</b> <b>valve.</b> Each tube brings up several dou of brineâ€¦ Where profit is to be had, people do not fail to know about it.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{the bags}} {{are made from}} goat hides that are removed from the {{slaughtered}} animal in one piece, cured, turned inside out, then tied off {{just in front of}} the rear legs, one of the front legs serving to house the blow pipe with its simple <b>leather</b> <b>valve</b> (soffietto), and the other tied off. The typical round stock into which both chanters and drones are fixed goes into the neck of the skin. The hair is left on, and is contained in the inside of the bag (otre). Today, however, some pipers are substituting the traditional goat and sheep hide bags with a rubber inner tube or wintex which is covered with an artificial fleece. This practice of using the synthetic bag is particularly popular among the pipers from Scapoli in the Molise region, and those of Atina in Latium.|$|R
60|$|Pump.--An {{excellent}} and very simple pump {{is used by}} the Arabs in Algeria. A piece of leather or waxed canvas, is stretched round one or more hoops; it forms a hollow cylinder, that admits of being shut flat like an accordion. The top and bottom of the cylinder are secured round the edges of two discs of wood. Holes are bored in these discs and <b>leather</b> <b>valves</b> are fitted to them. The lower disc is nailed to the bottom of a tub; the hole in it corresponds with the feed-pipe, and the valve that covers the hole opens upwards. The upper disc Is attached to the pump handle; the valves that cover the holes in this disc, open upwards also. When the leather-pump barrel is pressed flat, water flows through the upper valves into the barrel around it; when it is pulled out, water is sucked up through the feed-pipe, and an equal quantity is displaced from the barrel. This flows out into the trough. A bag would do as well as a tub, to hold the water which surrounds the pump-barrel; but, without the water which it is the object of either the one or the other to contain, the pump-barrel must be air-proof as well as water-proof. The action of this pump is marvellously perfect. It attracted much attention in the French Exhibition of 1855.|$|R
