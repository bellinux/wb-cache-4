40|$|One of {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} in potato cultivars is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which affects leaves, stems and tubers. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that protects potato plants from Phytophthora infestans. In Mexico, farmers apply metalaxyl 35 times during the cycle of potato production and the last application is typically 15 days before harvest. There are no records related to the presence of metalaxyl in potato tubers in Mexico. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Acinetobacter sp on metalaxyl degradation in <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings.</b> The effect of bacteria and metalaxyl on the growth of <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> was also evaluated. A metabolite profile analysis was conducted to determine potential molecular biomarkers produced by <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> in the presence of Acinetobacter sp and metalaxyl. Metalaxyl did not affect the growth of <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings.</b> However, Acinetobacter sp strongly affected the growth of inoculated seedlings, as confirmed by plant length and plant fresh weights which were lower in inoculated <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> (40 % and 27 %, respectively) compared to the controls.

40|$|High {{amounts of}} manual labor {{are needed to}} control <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants in arable fields. Due to the high costs, this leads to {{incomplete}} control of these weed plants, and they spread diseases like Phytophthora infestans to other fields. This results in higher environmental loads by curative spraying of crop protection chemicals, which is in contradiction to the required decreased use of crop protection chemicals to save the environment. Therefore, the main objective of this thesis was “to develop a system for automated detection and control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants”. A systematic design approach was used to define a program of requirements and to identify and order possible solutions to accomplish the detection and control. The main requirements were a travel speed of up to 2 m s- 1, resolution of control at least 10 × 10 mm, work under variable natural light conditions, control of volunteer plants > 95 %, and undesired control of sugar beet plants < 5 %. The design strategy resulted in color and near-infrared machine vision as detection method and a micro-sprayer for application of glyphosate as a result. Furthermore, issues were identified that required further investigation to successfully come to a proof of principle machine. The research was then focused on: - Detection of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants, - Control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants, - Real-time implementation of integrated detection and control on a proof of principle machine. For the purpose of detection of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants, the narrow band spectral reflectance properties of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants and sugar beet plants were analyzed. Narrow band spectral measurements were done in 2006 and 2007 on two different fields. This resulted in 15 datasets on clay and sand soil. Discriminating wavebands were selected and classified with neural networks and statistical discriminant analysis. A neural network with two hidden neurons performed best for classification. Two sensors were used covering the range from 450 to 900 nm and from 900 to 1650 nm. Both visible and near infra-red wavebands were responsible for discrimination. From the analysis 450, 765, and 855 nm from sensor 1 and 900, 1440, and 1530 nm from sensor 2 were identified as important discriminative wavebands. However, the discriminative wavelengths depended on field and crop status {{and could not be}} generalized. Ten wavebands that were optimally adapted to the datasets gave 99 % true negative classification of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants. On the other hand, a fixed set of three wavebands that was not adapted to the individual datasets gave 80 % true negative classification of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants. This indicates that adaptive feature sets are required for classification. The development of the machine vision detection system started with measurements in 2005. Color based detection showed that the difference in classification results was larger between fields than the difference between a static neural network and static Bayesian classification. Then, machine vision measurements in 2006 with a color camera under changing and constant natural light conditions showed that crop and weed properties change within a field. An adaptive instead of static classification increased classification accuracy from 34. 9 % to 67. 7 % under changing light conditions. Under constant natural light conditions, the classification accuracy increased from 84. 6 % to 89. 8 %. So, adaptive classifiers are required and were implemented in the further research as these gave significantly higher classification results. As a next step, besides a color camera also a near-infrared camera was used for imaging within the proof of principle machine, as this gave a better feature set for classification. Additionally, the field of view of the cameras was shielded and artificial light was used to maintain constant light conditions. For the real-time implementation, an unsupervised adaptive Bayesian classifier was used. The crop row position and crop row width were determined and a Kalman filter improved tracking of the rows, to adapt to the varying properties of the crop in the field. Data from between the crop rows was trained as the <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> class and data from within the crop row was trained as the sugar beet class. This resulted in good quality training data for the Bayes classifier. The system was unsupervised, as it learned and trained itself based on row recognition. The features that were used for training and classification were: blue, hue, saturation, excessive green, red minus blue, near-infrared and near-infrared difference vegetation index (NDVI). These feature values within the training data were continuously locally adapted, in two first-in-first-out buffers both with an area of 500 cm 2 for sugar beet and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants. Measurements were done on seven days in 2007 and 2008. The results showed a trade-off between the percentage of correct classified <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants and the percentage of misclassification of sugar beet plants. In one of the fields 96. 6 % <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> classification and 8. 0 % sugar beet misclassification was achieved. Connected to the detection system was a micro-sprayer that applied glyphosate in gel to the <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants. Spraying gel through a micro-sprayer was innovative. This proved to work in the application of glyphosate on plants. As knowledge of the dose response of glyphosate on potato was outdated and could not be used for plant specific application, a dose-response study was done with flat fan nozzles on 120 potato plants to determine the efficacy of glyphosate. The effect parameters tuber weight and photosynthesis activity were analyzed with log-logistic nonlinear regression methods. This resulted in an amount of 843 μg a. e. per plant for reduction of tuber weight and photosynthesis with 90 %. This amount was applied on plants with a height of 6. 1 ± 1. 39 cm and an area of 53. 3 ± 19. 6 cm 2. As glyphosate was to be applied with a micro-sprayer, the dose-response study was extended to 500 greenhouse grown potato plants. Five application methods were used: 1) flat fan water application, 2) flat fan gel application, 3) micro-sprayer low density distribution, 4) micro-sprayer medium density distribution, and 5) micro-sprayer high density distribution. As effect parameters again tuber weight, photosynthesis activity, and in addition shoot dry weight were used. They were analyzed with ANOVAs and box-plots. The micro-sprayer dense distribution with 3022 droplets m- 2 and 3. 3 mg per droplet had the best efficacy. The micro-sprayer controlled the <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants with less glyphosate compared to flat fan nozzles. Furthermore, it had a centimeter precision resolution and low risks of unwanted crop damage. With real-time hardware, machine vision detection and micro-sprayer were integrated to a proof of principle machine. A travel speed of 0. 8 m s- 1 was reached with the proof of principle machine and it had an approximated capacity of 2. 5 hrs ha- 1. This was the maximum that could be realized as the micro-sprayer valve actuation frequency was maximally 80 Hz. The image processing time for one image of 0. 2 m length was 195 ms. At this travel speed automated feedback systems on the operation of the system are required to support and replace human surveillance. Therefore, the Fréchet distance measure between multivariate distributions was introduced as quality indicator of classification performance. The Fréchet distance measure was significantly smaller when the classification performance was low, as identified on ground truth determined classification results afterwards. This proves that the performance could be predicted with a distance measure between multivariate distributions. In case of poor predicted classification performance, the application of glyphosate with the micro-sprayer can be halted to prevent unwanted crop damage and economic losses. The accuracy of application was ± 1. 4 cm in longitudinal direction and ± 0. 75 cm in transversal direction. During a field trial, up to 84 % of the volunteer plants were controlled with 1. 4 % unwanted controlled sugar beet plants. To sum up, within this research a proof of principle machine for automated detection and control of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants in sugar beet fields has successfully been developed. The system performed closely to the requirements that were set in the start-up of the project. The percentage of 95 % controlled <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants can be reached. On the other hand, the travel speed still has to be increased from 0. 8 m s- 1 to 2. 0 m s- 1. The system is an example of new technology that can be developed for practical applications {{to reduce the amount of}} required labor and to reduce the crop protection inputs for weed control in arable farming...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the reflectance properties of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> and sugar beet and to assess the potential of separating sugar beet and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> at different fields and in different years, using spectral reflectance characteristics. With the ImspectorMobile, vegetation reflection spectra were successfully repeatedly gathered in two fields, on seven days in 2 years that resulted in 11 datasets. Both in the visible and in the near-infrared reflection region, combinations of wavelengths were responsible for discrimination between sugar beet and <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants. Two feature selection methods, discriminant analysis (DA) and neural network (NN), succeeded in selecting sets of discriminative wavebands, both for the range of 450 – 900 and 900 – 1650 nm. First, 10 optimal wavebands were selected for each of the 11 available datasets individually. Second, by calculating the discriminative power of each selected waveband, 10 fixed wavebands were selected for all 11 datasets analyses. Third, 3 fixed wavebands were determined for all 11 datasets. These three wavebands were chosen because these had been selected by both DA and NN and were for sensor 1 : 450, 765, and 855 nm and for sensor 2 : 900, 1440, and 1530 nm. With the resulting three sets of wavebands, classifications were performed with a DA, a neural network with 1 hidden neuron (NN 1) and a neural network with two hidden neurons (NN 2). The maximum classification performance was obtained with the near-infrared sensor coupled to the NN 2 method with an optimal adapted set of 10 wavebands, where the percentages were 100 ± 0. 1 and 1 ± 1. 3 % for true negative (TN) classified <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants and false negative (FN) classified sugar beet plants respectively. In general the NN 2 method gave the best classification results, followed by DA and finally the NN 1 method. When the optimal adapted waveband sets were generalized to a set of 10 fixed wavebands, the classification results were still at a reasonable level of a performance at 87 % TN and 1 % FN for the NN 2 classification method. However, when a further reduction and generalization was made to 3 fixed wavebands, the classification results were poor with a minimum performance of 69 % TN and 3 % FN for the NN 2 classification method. So, these results indicate that for the best classification results it is required that the sensor and classification system adapt to the specific field situation, to optimally discriminate between <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> and sugar beet pixel spectr...|$|R
40|$|<b>Volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> is an {{increasing}} problem in crop rotations where winter temperatures are often not cold enough to kill tubers leftover from harvest.

In greenhouse bioassays, larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were placed in population densities of 0, 5, 10, and 40 per potato (cv. Russet Burbank) plant and 0, 5, 10, and 15 per cutleaf nightshade and hairy nightshade plant. Plants were treated with different rates of herbicides including fluroxypyr, prometryn, and mesotrione rates, and the physiological response on the potato plants was assessed by weighing shoot biomass 14 days after treatment. Consistently, across all bioassays, rate response functions were shifted as L. decemlineata density increased, such that less herbicide was required to achieve control. For instance, the herbicide rate needed to achieve 90 % reduction in potato biomass was reduced from 62 to 0 g fluroxypyr per hectare and 711 to 0 g prometryn per hectare as L. decemlineata density was increased to 40 larvae per plant. Herbivory at higher L. decemlineata population densities and herbicides above certain rates resulted in large reductions in cutleaf and hairy nightshade biomass. Differences in rate response functions among L. decemlineata population densities indicated that L. decemlineata contributed to weed suppression in combination with herbicides.

Large root galls, hyperplasia, abnormal proliferation of lateral roots and asymmetry of root structure were common anatomical changes induced by the nematode feeding in tomato roots...|$|R
40|$|Early blight {{of potato}} {{is caused by}} the fungus Alternaria alternata, one of the most {{destructive}} foliar diseases, especially in hot climates under irrigation. In this study, the virus free <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> were obtained from the National Plant Gene Bank of Iran and were inoculated in vitro with a culture filtrate of A. alternate. The leaflets received a 1000 -μl droplet of the A. alternata culture filtrate and were inoculated by spraying with a suspension of 10 5 conidia/ml of isolate A. alternata in the greenhouse method. The experimental design was a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications and seven genotypes, which have been infected with the two leaves of each iteration. In vitro selection of fungal isolates of A. alternata, chlorotic and necrotic symptoms began 1 to 2 days after inoculation, but the assessment of greenhouse symptoms appeared 6 - 10 days after inoculation. The area under the disease progress curve values were pres ented by analysis of variance (ANO VA), and they were compared using Duncan’s test (a = 0. 01 %).

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} {{can be used}} as {{an alternative}} method to obtain high-quality <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings.</b> This research was conducted in order to evaluate: the potential of different types of explants to produce somatic embryos; combinations of 2, 4 -D and BAP for somatic embryo induction; and the ability of BAP to act as growth regulator for the somatic embryo maturation process. Young leaf and stem nodal sections were cultured in MS media supplemented with 2, 4 -D and BAP. The developing calli were then transferred into media containing several concentrations of 2, 4 -D and BAP. The embryogenic calli were then transferred into media containing 1 - 5 μM BAP. The results show that MS media containing 2, 5 µM 2, 4 -D + 5 µM BAP and µM 2, 4 -D + 0. 5 µM BAP were the most suitable for inducing somatic embryos from leaf explants and stem nodal section explants, respectively. The somatic embryos were well-developed in the MS media supplemented with 5 µM BAP. The stem nodal section explants were able to produce a higher percentage of globular, heart and torpedo stage embryos compared with the leaf explants. Based on this research, stem nodal section explants have a high potential for producing somatic embryos induced in medium containing 1 μM 2, 4 -D + 0. 5 μM BAP...|$|R
5|$|The {{common earwig}} is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, <b>potatoes,</b> roses, <b>seedling</b> beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|R
40|$|In the {{agriculture}} industry, adventitious root formation is a core issue of plants asexual propagation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of adventitious root formation is far beyond understanding. In present study {{we found that}} target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling {{plays a key role}} in adventitious root formation in potato and Arabidopsis. The core components of TOR complex including TOR, RAPTOR, and LST 8 are highly conserved in <b>potato,</b> but the <b>seedlings</b> of <b>potato</b> are insensitive to rapamycin, implying FK 506 Binding Protein 12 KD (FKBP 12) lost the function to bridge the interaction of rapamycin and TOR in potato. To dissect TOR signaling in potato, the rapamycin hypersensitive potato plants (BP 12 -OE) were engineered by introducing yeast FKBP 12 (ScFKBP 12) into potato. We found that rapamycin can significantly attenuate the capability of adventitious root formation in BP 12 -OE potatoes. KU 63794 (KU, an active-site TOR inhibitor) combined with rapamycin can more significantly suppress adventitious root formation of BP 12 -OE potato than the single treatments, such as KU 63794 or rapamycin, indicating its synergistic inhibitory effects on potato adventitious root formation. Furthermore, RNA-seq data showed that many genes associated with auxin signaling pathway were altered when BP 12 -OE <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> were treated with rapamycin + KU, suggesting that TOR may play a major role in adventitious root formation via auxin signaling. The auxin receptor mutant tir 1 was sensitive to TOR inhibitors and the double and quadruple mutants including tir 1 afb 2, tir 1 afb 3, and tir 1 afb 1 afb 2 afb 3 displayed more sensitive to asTORis than single mutant tir 1. Consistently, overexpression of AtTIR 1 in Arabidopsis and potato can partially overcome the inhibitory effect of asTORis and promote adventitious root formation under asTORis treatments. These observations suggest that TOR signaling regulates adventitious root formation by mediating auxin signaling in Arabidopsis and potato...|$|R
40|$|Viral {{diseases}} {{are among the}} most limiting factors in the production of potato in Colombia {{and the rest of the}} world. The best strategy to control plant viruses consists on the use of certified seed tubers, control of arthropod vectors and the use of adequate crop management practices that reduce mechanical transmission and the presence of viral reservoirs like weeds and volun-teer plants. However, the successful implementation of these practices relies on the availability of highly sensitive techniques that allow for the asymptomatic detection of viruses. In this work, we tested the performance of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) on a single <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plant (cv. Diacol-Capiro) growing naturally in a seed-tuber storage facility in Yarumal (Antioquia). Our NGS results demonstrate a mixed infection with Potato virus Y (PVY) and Potato leafroll virus (PLRV). RT-qPCR was performed in roots, main stolons, crown (root collar) and upper, middle and lower leaves using specific primers for PVY, PLRV, Potato virus S (PVS), Potato virus V (PVV), Potato virus X (PVX) and Potato yellow vein virus (PYVV). Only PVY and PLRV were detected in good agreement with the NGS data. This work demonstrates the use-fulness of both techniques for supporting integrated management of plant viruses in potato, in-cluding virus detection in natural reservoirs such as volunteer plants and weeds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the fourth}} major crop of the world after rice, wheat and maize. In Ethiopia, the yield per unit area of potato is very low {{compared}} {{to those of other}} countries. There are many factors that reduce the yield of the crop among which the diseases like late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and bacterial wilt (Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) solanacearum) which play an important role. Management of these diseases is therefore very essential. In Ethiopia, however, much research has not been done for the management of bacterial wilt disease except identification of bacteria and screening of biological control agents and use of resistant varieties. Late blight of potato can be managed using the following management (control) strategies: use of biological control agents, use of resistant varieties, intercropping, use of certified disease-free seed, use of selective fungicides and cultural practices such as destruction of cull piles by freezing or deep burying, destruction of <b>volunteer</b> <b>potato</b> plants in nearby fields throughout the season, destruction (desiccate, disc or flail and desiccate) of infected plants to avoid spread, reduction of periods of leaf wetness and high humidity within the crop canopy by appropriately timing irrigation, application of a recommended fungicide spray program (the program should start prior to the arrival of the pathogen) and desiccation of vines prior to harvest...|$|R
40|$|In organic {{agriculture}} <b>potato</b> <b>volunteers,</b> presenting an important primary inoculum source for late Blight (Phytophthora infestans), {{are controlled by}} mechanical meth-ods. These may be partly replaced by ‘foraging’ livestock animals, such as cattle, sheep, horses, ponies or pigs. Most animals eat only the remaining potatoes on the field surface; however, pigs also dig up potatoes. This paper reports on two experi-ments with pigs (sows or finishing pigs), which appear to be very effective in digging up potatoes that are left in the field after the potato harvest within a reasonable time period. However, the workload for the farmer, problems with animal health and meat quality and possible damage to the soil structure seriously limit the applicability of pigs for the control of <b>potato</b> <b>volunteers.</b> Aspects of animal health, animal nutrition and environmental aspects (nutrient excretion) are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Potato is {{classified}} among the vegetables with low nitrate content but, in diet, it contributes most {{to the daily}} intake of nitrate, because of its high per capita consumption. Two trials were carried out in winter-spring and autumn-winter cycles using a trough bench subirrigation system. <b>Potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> were transplanted into pots containing peat, pumice and vermiculite in a 3 : 1 : 1 volume ratio Both trials were carried out to compare three nutrient solutions having the same nitrogen concentration (6. 4 mM), but different ammonium:nitrate (NH 4 -N:NO 3 -N) percentage ratios (100 : 0, 50 : 50 and 0 : 100). In the winter-spring cycle, tubers were lower in weight and were more numerous than in the autumn-winter cycle. The tuber yield of ammonium-fed plants was lower than with the mixed form and 100 % NO 3 -N, {{but only in the}} trial carried out in the winter-spring period. Nitrate-fed plants yielded a number of tubers almost 3 -fold higher than ammonium-fed plants. The NO 3 content of tubers harvested in spring in the presence of 100 % NH 4 -N in the nutrient solution was a 25 % of that in nitrate-fed plants (44 vs 169 mg kg - 1 of fresh mass); in tubers harvested in winter, with worse light conditions, nitrate content increased with increasing NO 3 -N in the nutrient solution (26, 109, and 225 mg kg- 1 of fresh mass with NH 4 -N:NO 3 -N 100 : 0, 50 : 50 and 0 : 100, respectively).

40|$|Host–parasite {{relationships}} and pathogenicity of Meloidogyne javanica on potatoes (newly recorded from Malta) were studied under glasshouse and natural conditions. Potato cvs Cara and Spunta showed a typical susceptible reaction to M. javanica under natural and artificial infections, respectively. In potato tubers, M. javanica induced feeding sites {{that consisted of}} three to four hypertrophied giant cells per adult female. Infection of feeder roots by the nematode resulted in mature large galls which usually contained at least one mature female and egg mass. In both tubers and roots, feeding sites were characterized by giant cells containing granular cytoplasm and many hypertrophied nuclei. Cytoplasm in giant cells was aggregated alongside the thickened cell walls. Stelar tissues within galls appeared disorganized. The relationship between initial nematode population density (P) [0 – 64 eggs + second-stage juveniles (J 2 s) per cm 3 soil] and growth of cv. Spunta <b>potato</b> <b>seedlings</b> was tested under glasshouse conditions. A Seinhorst model [y = m + (1 − m) z (P − T) ] was fitted to fresh shoot weight and shoot height data of nematode-inoculated and control plants. Tolerance limits (T) for fresh shoot weight and shoot height of cv. Spunta plants infected with M. javanica were 0 · 50 and 0 · 64 eggs + J 2 s per cm 3 soil, respectively. The m parameter in that model (i. e. the minimum possible y -values) for fresh shoot weight and shoot height were 0 · 60 and 0 · 20, respectively, at P = 64 eggs + J 2 s per cm 3 soil. Root galling was proportional to the initial nematode population density. Maximum nematode reproduction rate was 51 · 2 at a moderate initial population density (P = 4 eggs + J 2 s per cm 3 soil). peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Crop weeds are patchily distributed. In weed {{management}} it {{is important}} to be able to estimate the weed-free fraction of the total field area, because this fraction determines the potential saving on herbicides that may be achieved by site-specific application (and not spraying those patches with no weeds). In this chapter, we model the weed-free fraction by combining Taylor¿s power law (TPL) for the variance-mean relationship with a prediction of the zero class frequency according to the negative binomial distribution. The resulting predictions of occupancy were compared to observations on weed density and occupancy in 32 data sets on occurrence of agricultural weeds in The Netherlands. The results using weed species specific parameters for TPL provided strong validation for the approach, with R 2 prediction varying between 0. 735 and 0. 998 for 13 of the 14 species groups. Estimates of the slope parameter b of TPL varied substantially between weeds (from 0. 78 for <b>volunteer</b> <b>potatoes</b> to 1. 95 for Echinochloa crus-galli), but only slightly between data sets. Predictions based on a common slope parameter still had high coefficients of prediction for most weed species. Based upon a spatially explicit data set collected using counts in contiguous quadrats, the effect of scale of the sample unit was analysed. At levels of scale relevant to decision making in weed management, the effect of scale on occupancy was minor. We conclude that the relationship between density and occupancy for arable weeds is strong, and that there is scope for prediction of the weed-free area and prediction-based weed managemen...|$|R
