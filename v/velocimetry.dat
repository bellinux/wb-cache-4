5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, <b>velocimetry,</b> and optometry.|$|E

25|$|His {{scientific}} {{activity was}} firstly {{addressed to the}} Vascular Diagnostics non-invasive, especially {{to the use of}} Continuous wave Doppler <b>Velocimetry</b> in Vascular Pathology, and he published several scientific works both in Italian and foreign languages.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{originally}} for velocity measurements {{in medical}} applications (blood flow), Ultrasonic Doppler <b>Velocimetry</b> (UDV) can measure {{in real time}} complete velocity profile in almost any liquids containing particles in suspension such as dust, gas bubbles, emulsions. Flows can be pulsating, oscillating, laminar or turbulent, stationary or transient. This technique is fully non-invasive.|$|E
25|$|Particle image <b>velocimetry</b> methods will {{in general}} {{not be able}} to measure {{components}} along the z-axis (towards to/away from the camera). These components might not only be missed, they might also introduce an interference in the data for the x/y-components caused by parallax. These problems do not exist in Stereoscopic PIV, which uses two cameras to measure all three velocity components.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of airflow around a {{model can be}} determined by tufts of yarn attached to the aerodynamic surfaces. The {{direction of}} airflow approaching a surface can be visualized by mounting threads in the airflow ahead of and aft of the test model. Smoke or bubbles of liquid can be introduced into the airflow upstream of the test model, and their path around the model can be photographed (see particle image <b>velocimetry).</b>|$|E
25|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the blue}} region of the spectrum became widely {{available to the public}} in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447nm laser diode technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image <b>velocimetry,</b> due to their superior beam quality. Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography, DNA sequencing, optical pumping, and other scientific and medical applications.|$|E
500|$|From the 1960s commercially {{available}} systems were introduced. Soon, other advances in electronics and piezoelectric materials enabled further improvements {{which meant that}} ultrasound was quickly adopted for use in medicine due to its rapid, accurate diagnostic capabilities which offered the possibility of prompt treatment. Alongside the improving imaging technology, acoustic Doppler <b>velocimetry</b> and medical ultrasonography color Doppler were developed, which have {{had a significant impact}} on many specialties, including radiology, obstetrics, gynecology, angiology and cardiology, and have provided even greater scope for ultrasound investigations. Since 1970, real-time scanners and pulsed Doppler, have enabled the use of [...] ultrasound to study the function of the venous system. The first demonstration of color Doppler was achieved by Geoff Stevenson.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{techniques}} {{used to measure}} flows are laser Doppler <b>velocimetry</b> [...] and hot-wire anemometry. The main difference between PIV and those techniques is that PIV produces two-dimensional or even three-dimensional vector fields, while the other techniques measure the velocity at a point. During PIV, the particle concentration is such {{that it is possible}} to identify individual particles in an image, but not with certainty to track it between images. When the particle concentration is so low {{that it is possible to}} follow an individual particle it is called Particle tracking <b>velocimetry,</b> while Laser speckle <b>velocimetry</b> is used for cases where the particle concentration is so high that it is difficult to observe individual particles in an image.|$|E
2500|$|The target chamber is {{approximately}} [...] {{in diameter and}} height and can accommodate {{a wide variety of}} targets and mounting fixtures. It can maintain vacuum levels below , or can be back filled with various gases to simulate different planetary atmospheres. Impact events are typically recorded with high-speed video/film, or Particle Image <b>Velocimetry</b> (PIV).|$|E
2500|$|Laser Doppler <b>Velocimetry</b> predates PIV as a laser-digital {{analysis}} {{system to}} become widespread {{for research and}} industrial use. Able to obtain all of a fluid's velocity measurements at a specific point, it can be considered the 2-dimensional PIV's immediate predecessor. [...] PIV itself found its roots in Laser speckle <b>velocimetry,</b> a technique that several groups began experimenting with in the late 1970s. In the early 1980s {{it was found that}} it was advantageous to decrease the particle concentration down to levels where individual particles could be observed. At these particle densities it was further noticed that it was easier to study the flows if they were split into many very small 'interrogation' areas, that could be analyzed individually to generate one velocity for each area. The images were usually recorded using analog cameras and needed immense amount of computing power to be analyzed.|$|E
2500|$|Particle image <b>velocimetry</b> (PIV) is {{an optical}} method of flow {{visualization}} used {{in education and}} research. [...] It is used to obtain instantaneous velocity measurements and related properties in fluids. The fluid is seeded with tracer particles which, for sufficiently small particles, are assumed to faithfully follow the flow dynamics (the {{degree to which the}} particles faithfully follow the flow is represented by the Stokes number). [...] The fluid with entrained particles is illuminated so that particles are visible. [...] The motion of the seeding particles is used to calculate speed and direction (the velocity field) of the flow being studied.|$|E
2500|$|Fluid {{mechanics}} is {{a branch}} of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them. [...] Fluid mechanics has {{a wide range of}} applications, including mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, geophysics, astrophysics, and biology. Fluid mechanics can be divided into fluid statics, the study of fluids at rest; and fluid dynamics, the study of the effect of forces on fluid motion. [...] It is {{a branch of}} continuum mechanics, a subject which models matter without using the information that it is made out of atoms; that is, it models matter from a macroscopic viewpoint rather than from microscopic. Fluid mechanics, especially fluid dynamics, is an active field of research with many problems that are partly or wholly unsolved. [...] Fluid mechanics can be mathematically complex, and can best be solved by numerical methods, typically using computers. [...] A modern discipline, called computational fluid dynamics (CFD), is devoted to this approach to solving fluid mechanics problems. Particle image <b>velocimetry,</b> an experimental method for visualizing and analyzing fluid flow, also takes advantage of the highly visual nature of fluid flow.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Velocimetry</b> is the {{measurement}} of the velocity of fluids, as often used to solve fluid dynamics problems, or to study fluid networks, {{as well as in}} industrial and process control applications, or in the creation of new kinds of fluid flow sensors.

5000|$|Particle {{tracking}} <b>velocimetry</b> (PTV) is a <b>velocimetry</b> method i.e. {{a technique}} to measure velocity of particles that are resident in a fluid.

Opto-mechanical techniques do not rely on photonics alone for flow measurements but require macro-size seeding.

Within the field of all-optical techniques we can distinguish analogous techniques but using molecular tracers.

In molecular tagging techniques, like in PIV, <b>velocimetry</b> is based on visualizing the tracer displacements.|$|E
