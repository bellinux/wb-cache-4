50|$|Early video synthesiser technologists {{concerned}} {{themselves with}} achieving arbitrary curves not limited by film chemistry. A {{goal was to}} extend the range of solarisation effects possible to a computer specified curve. They then applied the defined solarisation curve to real time video images. A <b>video</b> <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> was often used to implement this. Using this enhanced solarisation technology, still photos could also be passed through a grey scale or colour lookup table with the advantage that the effect could be previewed and progressively improved, instead of a procedure based on darkroom exposure calculations applied on a one time basis to a volatile light sensitive film or print, as described above. This was an especial advantage for creating colour solarisations with 3 primary colours.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{point source}} light used for synthetic image generation provides no adjustments other than position, and this severely limits {{the effects that}} can be achieved. It {{can be difficult to}} highlight particular features of an object. This paper describes new lighting controls and techniques which can be used to optimize the lighting for synthetic images. These controls are based in part on observations of the lights used in the studio of a professional photographer. Controls include a light direction to aim a light at a particular area of an object, light concen-tration to simulate spotlights or floodlights, and flaps or cones to restrict the path of a light. Another control relates to the color of the light source and its effect on the perceived color of specular highlights. An object color can be blended with a color for the highlights to simulate different materials, paints, or lighting conditions. This can be accomplished dynamically while the image is displayed, using the <b>video</b> <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> to approximate the specular color shift...|$|E

In small embedded systems the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> must {{be reduced to a}} minimum {{in order to reduce the}} memory footprint and intermediate table values are estimated by linear interpolation. Since interpolation introduces an estimation uncertainty that increases with the sparseness of the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> there is a trade-off between <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> size and estimation precision.

40|$|Traditional image {{processing}} techniques used for 3 - and 4 - band images are not {{suited to the}} many-band character of spectral images. A sparse multi-dimensional <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> with inter-node interpolation is a typical {{image processing}} technique used for applying either a known model or an empirically derived mapping to an image. Such an approach for spectral images becomes problematic because input dimensionality of <b>lookup</b> <b>tables</b> {{is proportional to the}} number of source image bands and the size of <b>lookup</b> <b>tables</b> is exponentially related to the number of input dimensions. While an RGB or CMY source image would require a 3 -dimensional <b>lookup</b> <b>table,</b> a 31 -band spectral image would need a 31 -dimensional <b>lookup</b> <b>table.</b> A 31 dimensional <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> would be absurdly large.

When the input of the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> is small within a certain threshold, the change of the outputs {{with respect to the}} change of the inputs is relatively small.

40|$|Abstract tector and the <b>lookup</b> <b>table.</b> The VLC {{detector}} {{receives the}} input variable length codes and generates an address for the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> (LUT). To reduce additional circuit overhead, address generation is implemented by aligning the VLCs {{at a fixed}} position so that the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> uses the VLC itself as the address. The <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> receives the address from the VLC detector and produces the corre-sponding output codeword and length. Both components of the variable length decoder must be optimized to achieve low power operation. A data driven variable length decoder chip is presented which exploits the signal statistics of variable length codes to reduce power. The approach uses fine grain <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> partitioning to reduce switched capacitance based on code-word frequency.
