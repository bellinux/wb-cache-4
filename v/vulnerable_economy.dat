The main conclusion is that the benefits from WTO membership in terms of improved market access for traditional exports are likely to be limited.

5000|$|One {{approach}} that some developing countries {{have attempted to}} foster capacity building is through isomorphic mimicry. Similar {{to the concept of}} mimetic isomorphism used in organizational theory, isomorphic mimicry refers to the tendency of government to mimic other governments' successes by replicating methods and policy designs deemed successful in other countries. While such an approach can be effective for solving certain development problems that have [...] "a universal technical solution", it often ignores the political and organizational realities on the ground and produces little benefits to those using it. An example of a failed mimicry relates to the legal reform in Melanesia. In response to a major international assistance mission {{to improve the quality of}} the justice system, a jail and a courthouse were built, costing millions of dollars. However, the new justice infrastructure has been rarely used since its establishment, because there has been a lack of bureaucracy and financial sources to support the expensive justice system. As summarized by Haggard et al., accelerated modernization is an entirely inappropriate strategy for enhancing the functionality of legal system as solutions like this often require state capacities that developing countries do not have. Another example took place in Argentina. During the economic crisis in late 1980s, the government implemented a series of fiscal policies as recommended by IMF to regulate high point inflation affecting the country's economy. However, rather than constraining aggregate spending, the fiscal rule merely shifted spending from the central and to provincial governments. Adopting international best practices do not often translate into positive changes; in the case of Argentina, the mimicry produced little change to the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

Such small island homogeneity and consensualism is therefore not necessarily indicating a deficient democratic practice, but might just connote another way of conducting democratic governance, spawned from a particular way of living and a particular range of need...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade many Central and East European (CEE) {{countries}} experienced strong foreign capital inflows. Slovenia was one of them. Sources of inflows in Slovenia changed radically, even though privatisation-driven inflows were absent, in contrast to other CEE countries. Since such inflows could have significant adverse effects {{on the performance of}} the economy, some policy measures were taken. This article presents an empirically tested assessment of policy for adjustment to surges in capital flows during {{the last decade}}. Speculative reversals, a decline in external competitiveness, exchange rate appreciation, loss of control over the monetary base and inflation {{are just some of the}} detrimental effects that can be provoked by surges in capital flows if the economy suffers from fundamental sectoral deficiencies. Empirical results indicated that Slovenia quite successfully mitigated the listed effects of excessive foreign exchange inflows. Efficient combination of direct and indirect adjustment methods succeeded in preventing the still <b>vulnerable</b> <b>economy</b> from suffering a major financial crisis and nominal currency appreciation (which was not the case in some other CEE countries) although there was some real appreciation. ...|$|E

The authors find that changes in sovereign ratings have an impact on country risk and stock returns. They also find that these changes are transmitted across countries, with neighbor-country effects being more significant. Rating upgrades (downgrades) tend to occur following market rallies (downturns). Countries with more <b>vulnerable</b> <b>economies,</b> as measured by low ratings, are more sensitive to changes in U. S. interestrates.

40|$|When {{analyzing}} the appropriate response for monetary policy during a currency crisis {{it is important}} to keep in mind two distinct channels: (a) the impact of raising interest rates on exchange rates; and (b) the direct impact of exchange rate changes on output. The first pertains to the monetary side of the economy as given by the interest parity condition, while the second pertains to the real side of the economy. The interaction between these two legs of the economy derives the equilibrium output and exchange rate in the economy. This paper expands on the Aghion,Bacchetta and Banerjee (2000) monetary model, with nominal rigidities and foreign currency debt playing to examine the interaction between the real and monetary sides of the economy to analyze the impact of monetary policy on the real economy. To preview the main conclusion, we find that the impact of monetary policy on exchange rate and output depends largely on the shape of the W-curve, which is theoretically ambiguous. This in turn suggests that the appropriate monetary policy response could vary between countries at any point in time, or for a particular country between two different periods. interest rate, exchange rate, <b>vulnerable</b> <b>economy,</b> monetary policy, monetary model, real economy, Economics,Macroeconomics, Public Finance,Indian Economy...|$|E

Vanuatu is currently designated, on the basis of quality of life, as one of the five least developed countries among the Pacific island countries, the other four being Kiribati, Samoa, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Recognizing its special circumstances, including its high dependency on strategic imports with unstable export earnings, proneness to natural disasters and inadequate human resource skills, the international community has been assisting the country with generous external aid ever since its independence in 1980. Bilateral development assistance comes especially from the two regional powers. But, in terms of pure grants given on an annual basis, multilateral funding agencies, including the Asian Development Bank, have been assisting the country with concessional loans for projects and reform programmes. Despite these annual aid inflows, Vanuatu has been performing poorly which is reflected in the stagnation of its per capita income. This article seeks to examine the nexus between aid and growth in Vanuatu and investigates causes behind the country’s weak performance.
