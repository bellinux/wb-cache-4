30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, {{comparing}} with the unfiltered curves, the 50 -Hz low-pass filter <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> of frame’s center are little different with bottom’s center <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> {{and both the}} curves (50 -Hz low-pass filter) have obviously three peaks (due to three Maglev train marshalings). So, although the frame’s center acceleration value is much bigger than bottom’s center <b>acceleration</b> value (unfiltered <b>curves</b> and time–history), it {{is caused by the}} frame local vertical vibration and the vibration is high frequency (more than 50  Hz). The different low-frequency vibration is little caused by the overall vertical vibration (less than 50  Hz). Due to the China’s <High-Speed Railway Design Standard>, the bridge’s limited value of vertical acceleration at ballast less track is 0.5  g considering the 20 -Hz low-pass filter. The limited filter value references the European Standard. Because the vibration of frame and bottom belongs to two different frequency domains, using the filter limited value (20 -Hz low-pass filter) to filter the <b>vertical</b> <b>acceleration</b> <b>curves</b> based on the China’s <High-Speed Railway Design Standard> is slightly unsuitable.|$|R

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{properties of}} a new <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> that consists of a transition curve (cubic polynomial), a parabolic curve, and another transition curve have been presented in a companion paper. The present paper addresses the sight distance characteristics of this new <b>curve,</b> called transitioned <b>vertical</b> <b>curve.</b> The minimum sight distance and the required curve length are analytically derived for both crest and sag curves, considering various cases related to the minimum sight distance and the lengths of transition and parabolic curves. Using the developed analytical models, example design graphs are established for the length requirements of the transitioned <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> based on the upper range of stopping sight distance presented by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The transitioned <b>vertical</b> <b>curve,</b> which resembles the spiraled horizontal curve commonly used in practice, represents {{an alternative to the}} simple <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> especially for sharp vertical alignments. ...|$|R

40|$|Introducing spiral curves {{before and}} after {{horizontal}} circular curves has been widely accepted to enhance traffic safety, highway esthetics, sight distance, and driver comfort. Though, <b>vertical</b> <b>curves</b> are still designed as parabolic curves that are connected directly to the tangent (without transitions). In this paper, a cubic polynomial is used to develop a <b>vertical</b> transition <b>curve</b> {{before and after}} the parabolic <b>vertical</b> <b>curve.</b> The resulting <b>curve,</b> called transitioned <b>vertical</b> <b>curve,</b> consists of transition-parabolic-transition segments. Detailed mathematical formulation and derivation of the instantaneous elevation, grade, rate of curvature, and offset from the first tangent at any point are presented. The highest (or lowest) point on a transitioned crest (or sag) <b>vertical</b> <b>curve,</b> where the instantaneous grade equals 0, is determined as it is of particular importance in highway drainage design. The minimum length of a transition curve is derived based on the criterion of driver comfort. In addition, guidelines are provided to identify the conditions where the drainage of surface water on transitioned curves can be a concern. Finally, the layout of the transitioned <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> is described and illustrated using two numerical examples. The new transitioned <b>vertical</b> <b>curve,</b> which exhibits striking similarities to the spiraled horizontal curve, should enhance the design of highway vertical alignments. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{characteristics}} of wheel-rail vibration of the vertical section in a high-speed railway, a vehicle-line dynamics model is established using the dynamics software SIMPACK. Through this model, the paper analyzes the influence of vertical section parameters, including vertical section slope and <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius, on wheel-rail dynamics interaction and the acting region of wheel-rail vibration. In addition, the characteristics of wheel-rail vibration of the vertical section under different velocities are investigated. The {{results show that the}} variation of wheel load is not sensitive to the vertical section slope but is greatly affected by the <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius. It was also observed that the smaller the <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius is, the more severe the interaction between the wheel and rail becomes. Furthermore, the acting region of wheel-rail vibration expands with the <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius increasing. On another note, it is necessary to match the slope and <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius reasonably, on account of the influence of operation speed on the characteristics of wheel-rail vibration. This is especially important at the design stage of vertical sections for lines of different grades.|$|R

30|$|The {{methodology}} which utilizes triangulation techniques (Digital Terrain Model – DTM) {{consists of}} three stages: development of (a) the road surface, (b) virtual field-of-view surface, and (c) virtual line of sight-plane. Moreno et al. [6] maximized the available stopping sight distance (SSD) at crest <b>vertical</b> <b>curves</b> overlapped with horizontal curves in two lane highways. They used a finite element method algorithm to generate an SSD profile. The available SSD profile indicated the available SSD of each evaluated position of the driver. The resulted available SSD could finalize certain alignment zones where <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>curve</b> could be improved if the minimum available SSD was lower than required among these curves. This study concluded that the <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> curvature in meters (Kv = Lv/A = Rv/ 100, i.e. the horizontal distance in meters {{needed to make a}} 1  % change in gradient, where: L is the horizontal length of <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> in meters, A is the algebraic difference of grade lines in percents, Rv is the <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> radius in meters), and the available horizontal radius (Rh) affect the available SSD. The optimal proportion of Kv/Rh (Kv and Rh were previously defined) which maximizes the available SSD is generally ranged between 0.05 to 0.15. The study also revealed a negligible impact of the offset between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>curves</b> on available SSD.

40|$|Rural roadways {{account for}} a {{significant}} portion of fatal crashes in the United States despite carrying lower total vehicle miles traveled than urban roads. An important contributor to this is excessive speeds at horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>curves.</b> While geometric design has established norms for handling these curves, the message is still often difficult to communicate to drivers. Recent technologies have been developed to enhance this communication on horizontal curves; however, treatments for <b>vertical</b> <b>curves</b> have not yet experienced similar advancements. A new approach, involving chevron signs, is being considered by Washington County, Minnesota. To accurately assess the impact of these signs on driver behavior, a before-after study must be implemented on one or more <b>vertical</b> <b>curve</b> locations.
