50|$|To {{explain and}} {{illustrate}} {{the emergence of}} a techno-aesthetic, Popper stresses the panoramic and multi-generational reach of <b>virtual</b> <b>art.</b> As regards to <b>virtual</b> <b>art,</b> openness is stressed both {{from the point of view}} of the artists and their creativity and from that of the follow-up users in their reciprocating thoughts and actions. This commitment to the teeming openness found in <b>virtual</b> <b>art</b> can be traced to the theories of Umberto Eco and other aestheticians.|$|E

5000|$|Touching is {{not limited}} to feeling, but allows {{interactivity}} in real-time with virtual objects. Thus, haptics are used in <b>virtual</b> <b>arts,</b> such as sound synthesis or graphic design and animation. [...] The haptic device allows the artist to have direct contact with a virtual instrument that produces real-time sound or images. For instance, the simulation of a violin string produces real-time vibrations of this string under the pressure and expressiveness of the bow (haptic device) held by the artist. This can be done with physical modeling synthesis.|$|R

A recent trend in digital art has been to address physical behaviour explicitly. However, the prospect of modifying and authoring alternative physical laws demands appropriate software tools. In this paper, we introduce the use of qualitative physics in <b>Virtual</b> Reality <b>Art.</b> We discuss how qualitative process theory {{can be used to}} specify alternative physical behaviour in virtual environments. After introducing the hardware and software architecture for our project, we discuss an example which is part of early experiments with the baseline “alternative reality ” software we are developing...|$|R
