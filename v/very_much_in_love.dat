We had stood it very well, as long as we did not hear anything about them, and we had lent ourselves in a sort of semi-forgetfulness of them to the associations of the past when they were not; but now to learn that they were hearty and happy, and that they sent love and kisses, was too much. With one mind we renounced the notion of going on to Quebec; we found that we could just get the ten-o'clock train that would reach Boston by eleven that night, and we made all haste and got it. We had not been really at peace, we perceived, till that moment since we had bidden the children good-bye.|$|R

40|$|Writers are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> united <b>in</b> their <b>love</b> of stories; however, it is {{important}} to note that we are unique in temperament, influence, style, taste and attitude. We’d be lying if we told you that the process of producing Tide was all peaches and lavender. Tide is difficult. It is the clash of creative opinions, perspectives and goals—as diverse as we are as people. Despite the struggle, it was the culmination and transcendence of these aspects which gives rise to Tide: something unique in both the experience and the finished product. Tide is a foray into the scary world of organised creativity. It’s mighty hopeful to ask creative writers to take on the roles of editors, designers, fundraisers and production managers. We may have eaten far more Caramello Koalas than any human should consume, and did not receive the recommended eight hours of sleep per night, but we reached the finish line and are proud to present to you the ninth edition of Tide. This year we have asked contributors to explore the theme of ‘endings’. The finality of such a topic is sometimes dark, sometimes nostalgic and often illuminating. It encompasses the cyclic nature of not only the writing process but also of life. While we may never re-friend each other on Facebook, we will always have our memories and, like us, you will always have Tide...|$|R

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 31, 1910. It states, [...] "May Smalley is a simple little country girl with whom Jack, a youth whom she has known since childhood, is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>love.</b> When a traveling show, consisting of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician comes to the opera house in her little town, the two young people are among the other interested spectators who flock to see the performance. May's youth and beauty attract the hypnotist, who plans to lure her away from her home. He sends May a message {{that he has a}} communication for her from the spirit world. Against the protest of Jack, her escort, May goes behind the scenes after the performance to meet with the great hypnotist, who fascinates her with his wiles. The hypnotist is an unscrupulous villain, and seeing that May is thoroughly impressed with his few tricks and considers him quite superhuman, he induces her to follow him when he leaves the town. How Jack proves himself to be a youth of resource as well as courage, the important part he played in May's deliverance by the Hindu fakir, is well told by the picture. Finally the hypnotist is shown in his true light. May is disillusioned, and comes to decide that Jack is just about the kind of protection she needs in a world of uncertainty." [...] According to a reviewer, Jack comes up to the stage where the Hindu magician is and knocks him down. Jack takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May to the hotel where he rescues her.|$|E

The distinction is comparable to that drawn by ethologists [...] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity", just as [...] "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".|$|E

2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E

Bush and Saddam Hussein, as the two of them [...] "...have selfish interests and are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> with power. Also, a disregard for the environment. A love for manipulating people." [...] Andrew Slack and the Harry Potter Alliance compare media consolidation in the U.S. to Voldemort's regime in Deathly Hallows and its control over the Daily Prophet and other media saying that [...] "Once Voldemort took over every form of media in the wizarding world, Dumbledore's Army and the Order of the Phoenix formed an independent media movement called 'Potterwatch'. Now the HP Alliance and Wizard Rock have come together to fight for a Potterwatch movement in the real world to fight back against Big VoldeMedia from further pushing out local and foreign news, minority representation, and the right to a Free Press." [...] Julia Turner from Slate Magazine also noted similarities between the events of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the current War on Terror. She said that Voldemort takes up terrorism by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill their elders.|$|E
