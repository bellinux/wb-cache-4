This acquisition gave Rakon a European-based operation, including 2 factories {{located in the}} UK and France. The new business unit specialised in other forms of wireless communications and allowed Rakon to become less dependent on the GPS market, and expanded Rakon's product range greatly to include oven-controlled <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> (OCXO), <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> (VCXO), the Pluto ASIC {{and a range of}} low performance commodity products.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} of the crystal is slightly adjustable ("pullable") by modifying the attached capacitances. A varactor, a diode with capacitance depending on applied voltage, is often used in <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators,</b> VCXO. The <b>crystal</b> cuts are usually AT or rarely SC, and operate in fundamental mode; the amount of available frequency deviation is inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} overtone number, so a third overtone has only one-ninth of the pullability of the fundamental mode. SC cuts, while more stable, are significantly less pullable.|$|R

40|$|This is {{a thesis}} report done {{as part of}} the Master of Science in Electronics Design Engineering given at Linköping University, Campus Norrköping. The thesis work is done at Ericsson AB in the spring of 2005. The thesis {{describes}} a method of removing variations in the tuning sensitivity of <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillators</b> due to different manufacturing processes. These variations results in unwanted variations in the modulation bandwidth of the phase-locked loop the oscillator is used in. Through examination of the theory of phase-locked loops it is found that the bandwidth of the loop is dependent on the tuning sensitivity of the oscillator. A method of correcting the oscillator-sensitivity by amplifying or attenuating the control-voltage of the oscillator is developed. The size of the correction depends on the difference in oscillator-sensitivity compared to that of an ideal oscillator. This error is measured and the correct correction constant calculated. To facilitate the measurements and correction extra circuits are developed and inserted in the loop. The circuits are both analog and digital. The analog circuits are mounted on an extra circuit board and the digital circuits are implemented in VHDL in an external FPGA. Tests and theoretical calculations show that the method is valid and able to correct both positive and negative variations in oscillator-sensitivity of up to a factor ± 2. 5 times. The bandwidth of the loop can be adjusted between 2 to 15 Hz (up to ± 8 dB, relative an unmodified loop) ...|$|R
40|$|Every day, {{millions}} of people ask what time it is. Depending on the person and their reason for asking, the required accuracy and precision of an answer varies. Humans {{are not the only}} ones that care about time though, (perhaps more importantly) countless electronic devices ranging from cell phones to satellites do as well. Without accurate and precise frequency references and timekeeping systems, many of the electronics in use today would function incorrectly. The primary goal of this thesis was to achieve both synchronization and syntonization using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver called Namuru, which was developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). In the former case, this means that the pulse per second (PPS) signals output by the receiver should be aligned with the second boundaries of GPS Time (GPST). In the latter case, this means that the frequency of the <b>voltage-controlled</b> temperature-compensated <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VC-TCXO) onboard the receiver should be equal to its setpoint. The secondary goal of this thesis was to develop a clock model that accurately simulated the synchronization and syntonization performance of the receiver. The tertiary goal of this thesis was to develop supplementary features for the receiver like position-hold and holdover modes. In order to achieve these goals, several new capabilities were added to the receiver and much work was done in a number of different areas, such as field-programmable gate array (FPGA) programming, writing firmware, modifying hardware, and modeling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Jitter is {{a matter}} of great concern for {{high-speed}} digital designers because of its ability to degrade the overall system performance. Designing a low-jitter and wide-band phase locked loop (PLL) system is of practical importance because of its application in high speed digital systems. This paper presents experimental results of a low-jitter wide-band dual cascaded PLL system using a single crystal oscillator. The first PLL employs a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VCXO) to eliminate the input jitter whereas the second PLL provides wide bandwidth. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used to generate a jittered clock source which is then passed through the proposed system to achieve wide-band and low-jitter signal.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A remote {{synchronization}} {{system for}} the on-board crystal oscillator (RESSOX) of the QZSS is proposed. Aimed at offering an alternative architecture for the classic GPS time-keeping system (TKS), the proposed system consists of a synchronization framework where an ultrastable atomic clock, localized at the ground station, is kept synchronized to a second time reference, a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VCXO), on-board the QZSS satellite. Based on orbit calculations and delay predictions, feedback and feed-forward control guarantee the correct synchronization of the on-board time reference and the ground-station atomic clock. Compared with the classic GPS TKS, the RESSOX scheme offers several advantages in terms of accuracy, cost, weight, and power consumption. An extensive explanation of this novel design is presented. Differences and advantages of the proposed system are compared with the classic atomic clock scheme...|$|E

40|$|A new analog {{frequency}} modulation (FM) detector (demodulator) for dynamic force microscopy (DFM) is presented. The detector {{is designed for}} DFM by utilizing the FM detection method where the resonance frequency shift of the force sensor is kept constant to regulate the distance between a tip and a sample surface. The FM detector employs a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit using a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VCXO) so that the thermal drift of the output signal is negligibly reduced. The PLL is used together with a frequency conversion (heterodyne) circuit allowing the FM detector {{to be used for}} a wide variety of force sensors with the resonance frequency ranging from 10 kHz to 10 MHz. The minimum detectable frequency shift was as small as 0. 1 Hz at the detection bandwidth of 1 kHz. The detector can track a resonance frequency shift as large as 1 kHz.

40|$|This {{application}} note delivers {{a system that}} is designed to replace external <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VCXO) circuits by utilizing functionality within each serial gigabit transceiver. Note: In this {{application note}}, transceiver refers to these types of transceivers: A common design requirement is to frequency or phase lock a transceiver output to an input source (known as loop, recovered, or slave timing). Traditionally, an external clock cleaning device or VCXO and PLL components are used to provide a high-quality clock reference for the transceiver, since FPGA logic-based clocks are generally too noisy. While effective, external clock components carry a power and cost penalty that is additive as each individual clock channel is generated. When using many channels or in low-cost systems, the cost can be signif icant. Additionally, adding many external clock sources provides more opportunity for crosstalk and interference at the board level. The system described in this application note provides a method to effectively replace these external clock components using a combination of unique Xilinx transceiver features in conjunction with a high-performance FPGA logic based digital PLL (DPLL). Each transceiver has a phase interpolator (PI) circuit in the high-speed analog PLL output circuits that provides, on...|$|E
40|$|Quartz crystal oscillator, {{which uses}} quartz crystal as the resonator, has {{excellent}} frequency stability and very low phase-noise characteristics. They {{can be found}} in many applications that require a highly precise and stable frequency reference. However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of the crystal, the uncompensated crystal oscillators have temperature stability over ± 50 ppm. Conventional design of Temperature-Compensated <b>Voltage-Controlled</b> <b>Crystal</b> <b>Oscillator</b> (TC-VCXO) uses an external varactor diode as the frequency tuning element and temperature compensation network to compensate the temperature dependence. Due to the lack of the ability for integration and automatic calibration, the production cost of TC-VCXO is very expensive. In this thesis, an analog compensation technique using op-amps and resistors network with digital calibration ability is proposed such that automatic calibration can be achieved. This technique is capable of enhancing the temperature stability of a VCXO to be less than ± 2. 5 ppm. A fully integrated VCXO, without the crystal resonator, with a very linear and temperature invariant tuning range is also proposed. The maximum deviation of the linearity of the proposed VCXO is less than ± 5 % with a temperature range from - 45 °C to 85 °C. By combining this VCXO with the analog compensation technique, a low cost and high performance TC-VCXO with tuning range of ± 15 ppm and temperature stability of ± 2. 5 ppm over a temperature range from - 45 °C to 85 °C is developed...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 02 - 04, 1967 / Marriott Motor Hotel, Washington, D. C. Long-loop phase-lock {{receivers}} utilize a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator</b> (VCXO) as {{the first}} local oscillator (LO). Tuning across a band of frequencies with such an arrangement has been virtually impossible {{in many of the}} existing space and satellite tracking equipments; the characteristics of the long-loop configuration have necessitated the use of VCXO's. One particular advantage of the long-loop, the capability of maintaining coherent LO and reference frequencies for coherent demodulation of all IF outputs, is a constraint on the receiver system described here. One approach for multi-channel operation has been to employ one VCXO for each frequency; this has obvious economic limitations in applications requiring many channels. For stations used in multiple vehicle tracking, frequency-agile or frequency-hopping anti-jamming applications, or for nearly unlimited tuning capability in a data gathering station it is desirable to use a frequency synthesis technique to tune the receiver. Such a synthesizer should lend itself to on-line computer control. It is the intent of this paper to describe a technique of digital synthesizer tuning for a long-loop S-band phase-lock receiver. Hardware utilizing this technique is now in operation at Marshall Space Flight Center and Kennedy Space Center. The synthesizer provides both direct-reading pushbutton and computer tuning; frequency changing can be accomplished in microseconds. The frequency band 2200 - 2300 MHz is covered in 0. 1 Hz steps.

40|$|Using a VCXO (<b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>oscillator)</b> as a clock (CLK) {{generator}} Abstract: A VCXO (voltage controlled crystal oscillator) is an oscillator whose frequency {{is determined}} by a crystal, but can be adjusted by a small amount by changing a control voltage. VCXO clock (CLK) generators {{have been used in}} various applications, such as digital TV, digital audio, ADSL, and STB. This application note provides the general structure for a VCXO CLK generator, key performance measurements, guidelines for PCB design, and a test setup for MAX 9485, a VCXO CLK Gen chip for MPEG 2 and AC- 3 audio applications. Structure and application of a VCXO CLK generator A VCXO, or voltage controlled crystal oscillator, oscillates with a frequency determined by a crystal, but which can be adjusted over a narrow range by a control voltage, usually in the range of 0 V– 2 V or 0 V– 3 V. The tuning range of the VCXO is about ± 100 ppm to ± 200 ppm. Figure 1 shows the structure of a typical VCXO CLK generator and the crystal's circuit model. Figure 1. Block diagram of a typical VCXO CLK generator. As the capacitance of the varactors CV 1 and CV 2 changes, the crystal's model is affected and the oscillation frequency changes.
