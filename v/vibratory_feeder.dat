40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} vibratory transmission system, and concentrates on its driving technology. <b>Vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> is used to transfer parts {{from one place to}} another by vibration which plays an important role in assembly automation. Decoupled <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> (DVF) is a novel feeder which can be excited in two mutual perpendicular directions. In decoupled <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> system (DVFS), vibration angle, frequency and waveform of driving signals can be easily adjusted in software way, as well as the phase angle between vertical vibration and horizontal vibration, so DVFS has a great superiority. Up to now, two DVFS prototypes have been successfully developed, but the driving technology cannot meet the demands of parts’ smooth moving. The electromagnet, the core of the drive system, should be optimized in its external dimensions and drive performance. And we fabricate a series of electromagnets. To test electromagnet performance, a test system has been designed. Presently, two researches on the electromagnet driving circuit have been made in our laboratory. One method is to receive analog signal from D/A output, then drive electromagnet through power amplifier. The other method actually is to use a switching circuit controlled by PWM technology.

The vibratory bowl feeder for automatic assembly, presents a geometric model of the feeder, and develops force analysis, leading to dynamical modeling of the <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder.</b> Based on the leaf-spring modeling of the three legs of the symmetrically arranged bowl of the feeder, and equating the <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> to a three-legged parallel mechanism, the paper reveals the geometric property of the feeder. The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation, and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix. This reveals the characteristics of the feeder, that the resultant force is along the z-axis and the resultant moment is about the z direction and further generates the closed-form motion equation. The analysis presents a dynamic model that integrates the angular displacement of the bowl with the displacement of the leaf-spring legs...|$|E

40|$|<b>Vibratory</b> <b>feeders</b> or <b>vibratory</b> {{conveyors}} {{have been}} widely used for the transport and orientation of individual parts and bulk materials in many branches of industrial activity. From the designer’s standpoint, the current endeavor is to conceive efficient <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeders,</b> satisfying constraints of power consumption, vibration transmission and noise emission. Moreover, the interest in the reduction of maintenance cost is always present. In this context, this paper investigates experimentally the concept of vibratory conveying based on the use of piezoelectric materials for motion generation. A small-size prototype of a linear conveyor, in which lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) patches are bonded to the resilient elements, is described. One of the main design goals is that the prototype is intended to be fed directly from the electric network, aiming at avoiding the use of electronic equipment for driving. To comply with this feature and, at the same time, enable to adjust the transport velocity, a mechanical device has been conceived {{in such a way that}} the first natural frequency of the conveyor can be changed.

40|$|The use of micro-scale {{metallic}} pins {{in small}} engineering devices poses numerous problems {{due to their}} physical size and the dominant forces which act on micro-scale objects. Assembly of devices with micro-scale parts is problematic because the components are below the practical threshold of unaided human manipulation and most robotic manipulation. The use of tweezers and microscopes to aid human assembly is possible but challenging because the micro-scale pins tend to adhere to tweezers. Previous work has found that vibratory feeder-bowls provide a feasible means to singulate and orient micro-scale pins by overcoming the adhesive forces that plague other manipulation techniques. ^ The analysis and prediction {{of the behavior of}} <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> bowls for micro-scale components has previously been limited to two dimensions.

This model is based on an impulse-momentum contact model and it incorporates traditional macro-scale forces such as gravity, air-drag, and friction as well as micro-scale interactions such as magnetic and electrostatic forces. In comparison to prior experimental pin capture rates, the three dimensional simulation produced more accurate results than the existing two dimensional simulation. Finally, the simulation was used to conduct a parametric study to characterize the effects that varying system parameters have on the performance of the feeder bowl. ...|$|E

40|$|Autosprout is {{the mass}} {{manufacturing}} equipment envisioned to produce Sprout, a pencil with a seed. This pencil concept {{was developed by}} MIT students a successful round of funding and first production run through Kickstarter. The goals for Autosprout are to fully automate the manufacturing process, and to reduce the manufacturing costs from eighty cents per pencil to less than thirty, while also producing a completely assembled pencil every five seconds. The original assembly process was slow and required a lot of manpower. However, it laid a foundation to design the automated process described in this thesis. The new system will feature two carousel systems. The first carousel will load the cedar pencil, cut a shoulder using a specially designed router, and finally add a dab of glue around the shoulder. The second carousel will load a pill capsule body and fill it with soil and two to three seeds. At {{the end of each}} carousel process the pill capsule and pencil will come together and the capsule will be placed onto the shoulder and the glue will hold it in place. Before the capsule is loaded into the carousel, it must be sorted and properly aligned. Models for a <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> were first designed and tested, but, due to the inconsistent performance of the models, an industrial <b>vibratory</b> <b>feeder</b> was purchased and modified. The modification consists of a chute leading to a vacuum system that removes the capsule from the feeder, rotates, and finally loads the capsule into the carousel by switching a valve making the vacuum into a stream of high air pressure. A similar system will be used for removing seeds from a hopper and placing them in the capsule. by Eric A. Del Castillo. Thesis (S. B.)
