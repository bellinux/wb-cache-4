In the USSR, {{the principles of the}} grape cure were developed in the 1920s by a group of physicians of the Semashko Institute (Yalta), headed by A.V. D’iakov. Ampelotherapy continues to be offered in health clinics and spas, particularly in Europe, together with <b>vinotherapy,</b> a cosmetic treatment that involves rubbing grapes into the skin. Johanna Brandt, a South African doctor, popularized the grape diet as a treatment for cancer from 1925. She published about twenty pamphlets on the subject of natural remedies for health problems with her best-known publication being The Grape Cure, which {{is said to have been}} written after Brandt had cured herself of stomach cancer by following the diet. The book was republished in 1989 as How to Conquer Cancer, Naturally, including an endorsement of Brandt’s work by Benedict Lust, who is commonly referred to as [...] "the father of naturopathy". The book may have been inspired by Arnold Ehret, a contemporary, who taught a Grape Cure course.|$|E
