5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport.|$|E

Wounded in 1915 by a bullet, Kertész suffered temporary paralysis of his left arm.|$|E

Sheriff Porttens again ordered the police to protect the streetcars, but another twenty-nine officers resigned; because the force was so short on men, the sheriff refused their resignation and put them on other duties.|$|E

5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that they}} were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italians.|$|E

5|$|With Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops {{launched}} a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, {{but during the}} course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. As a result, the ANC perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.|$|E
5|$|By 1896, the {{government}} planned to pass policing responsibilities to the provincial authorities and ultimately close the force. With {{the discovery of}} gold in the Klondike, however, the force was redeployed to protect Canada's sovereignty over the region and to manage the influx of prospectors. The mounted police sent volunteers {{to fight in the}} Second Boer War, and in recognition were retitled the Royal North-West Mounted Police in 1904. The plans for closure were abandoned in the face of opposition from regional politicians. Large numbers of the police volunteered for military service during the First World War, {{and the future of the}} badly depleted force was once again in doubt. Towards the end of the war, however, fears grew about a potential Bolshevik conspiracy and the authorities tasked the mounted police to investigate the threat. In the aftermath of the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Winnipeg General Strike, {{the government}} decided to amalgamate the force with the Dominion Police, to form the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suppression, the {{government}} and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued {{to be worried about}} fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded to the memory of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E

5|$|Lenin {{was back}} in Galicia when the First World War broke out, an {{international}} situation that he had paid little attention to. The war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to his Russian citizenship, Lenin was deemed a spy by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In August, they arrested him and imprisoned him in Nowy Targ, although they released him once his anti-tsarist credentials were explained. To escape the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern front, Lenin and his wife moved to neutral Switzerland, settling in Bern, although in February 1916 they moved to Zurich, which was cheaper. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party had supported the German war effort, thereby contravening the Stuttgart resolution of the Second International that all socialist parties would oppose the international conflict. As a result, Lenin saw the Second International as defunct. In particular, he denounced German Marxist Karl Kautsky for supporting the German Social-Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack reminded the public of Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis {{caused the}} newly {{independent}} African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, {{it led to the}} division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.|$|E

5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} had passed anti-Semitic laws in 1939, {{and these were}} applied to the occupied and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied selectively due to {{the transfer of the}} territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in the occupied territories were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate, but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} Western Europe had been {{stabilized}} after the Christianization of the Saxon, Viking, and Hungarian peoples {{by the end}} of the 10th century. However, the breakdown of the Carolingian Empire gave rise to an entire class of warriors who now had little to do but fight among themselves. The random <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knightly class was regularly condemned by the church, and in response it established the Peace and Truce of God to prohibit fighting on certain days of the year. At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the Holy Roman Emperors, resulting in the Investiture Controversy. Popes such as Gregory VII justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of Christendom, not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against Al-Andalus, or, theoretically, against the Seljuq dynasty in the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} {{was a direct}} {{challenge}} to Kenyatta'a rule, and soon after its creation the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution {{to ensure that the}} defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed this <b>violence.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained his Central Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as Vice President by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.|$|E

5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged marionette productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1967, Peckinpah was {{rewriting}} the screenplay and preparing for the production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Rio Nazas. Peckinpah's epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and America's growing frustration with the Vietnam War and what he {{perceived to be the}} utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time. He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, but as well the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in Major Dundee, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa's work in Seven Samurai (1954)), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in The Wild Bunch.|$|E
5|$|In {{over half}} of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action. In the rest he played {{a wide range of}} characters, {{included}} doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (The Virginian). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (A Farewell to Arms). During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (Mr. Deeds, Meet John Doe, and For Whom the Bell Tolls). In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (The Fountainhead and High Noon). In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the <b>violence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (Friendly Persuasion and Man of the West). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, and sincere man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.|$|E
