50|$|Forfeiture of {{the shark}} fins was denied {{on the grounds}} that, {{although}} according to the Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000 any shark fins found aboard <b>a</b> fishing <b>vessel</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> corresponding shark carcass may be deemed the product of illegal harvesting, the vessel from which the fins were seized was not in fact a fishing vessel {{within the meaning of}} the act.

5000|$|The name [...] "Sin Bandera" [...] (<b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>Flag)</b> {{was adopted}} to {{transmit}} {{the idea to}} worry about world union.

As love and music do not have <b>a</b> <b>flag,</b> from that they were inspired to name their new musical adventure. The duo wants to spread that message through the music; We are one and that feeling is the best route to communication; That love is the fundamental energy that gives sense to all.|$|R
5000|$|The Māori {{had become}} {{involved}} in international trade and owned trading ships and in 1834, the year prior to {{the signing of the}} Declaration of Independence, the chiefs had selected <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> for use on ships originating from New Zealand.

50|$|A {{competition}} to design <b>a</b> new <b>flag</b> for County Durham {{was launched in}} July 2013 on the blog of Andy Strangeway, who had already established flags for the Ridings of Yorkshire.

The flag features the Cross of St Cuthbert, counterchanged on the county colours of blue and gold.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, a constitutional convention assembled in Jackson on August 22, 1865, began to revoke and repeal many of the actions taken by the Secession Convention of 1861.

500|$|Compared {{to other}} states, Indiana has few {{official}} symbols. The first symbol was the Seal of Indiana, {{which was made}} official in 1801 for the Indiana Territory and again in 1816 {{by the state of}} Indiana. It served as the state's only emblem for nearly a century until the adoption of the state song in 1913. [...] For many years, Indiana was the only state <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag.</b> The official state banner was adopted in 1917, and renamed the state flag in 1955. The newest symbol of Indiana is the state rifle, the Grouseland Rifle, assigned in 2012 during the second regular session of the 117th Indiana General Assembly.|$|R

5000|$|The idea of <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> to {{represent}} New Zealand first arose when the New Zealand-built trading ship Sir George Murray was seized in Sydney for sailing <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> or register in 1830. British navigation laws applied in Australia and ruled that every ship must carry an official certificate {{that included the}} nationality of the ship. New Zealand was not yet a British colony, so could not sail under <b>a</b> British <b>flag</b> or register. With no flag {{to represent}} the islands, trading ships and their cargoes could be confiscated. While a temporary licence was granted for the Sir George Murray by New South Wales authorities, {{it was clear that}} a more permanent solution was needed. Busby was approached by Maori chiefs in 1833 about the matter of <b>a</b> <b>flag.</b> Busby asked Reverend Williams and the Colonial Secretary Richard Bourke in New South Wales for assistance, and, with additional consultation with tribal leaders, three designs were drawn up.|$|R

He told us that he passed to the north of Samburan on purpose {{to see what was going}} on. At first, it looked as if that side of the island had been altogether abandoned. This was what he expected. Presently, above the dense mass of vegetation that Samburan presents to view, he saw the head of the flagstaff <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag.</b> Then, while steaming across the slight indentation which for a time was known officially as Black Diamond Bay, he made out with his glass the white figure on the coaling-wharf. It could be no one but Heyst.|$|R
