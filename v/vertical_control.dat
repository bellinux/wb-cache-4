25|$|The {{direct cause}} of the {{accident}} is presumed to be {{the collapse of the}} vertical stabilizer. There are two alternative explanations for how the crash may have happened. The first explanation is that the lack of <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> caused by the broken elevator torque tube stalled the aircraft. Be{{cause of the}} lack of pitch control, {{it would have been easy}} for the aircraft to fall back into a stall repeatedly, each time losing altitude. The aircraft would thus eventually have fallen into the sea. The vertical fin and rudder would have broken off on impact. This theory does not explain why the vertical stabilizer was found at such a distance from the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We explore issues {{relating}} to the vertical structure of ownership and control in gasoline distribution and retailing. Some have argued that refiner control of the retail sector has increased California gasoline prices, prompting proposals for legislation to restrict refiner participation in gasoline retailing. We study the arguments for and against government intervention in gasoline distribution and retailing, and describe {{the conditions under which}} such intervention could be justified. In theory, <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> in the gasoline industry can produce both positive and negative effects. Many <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> can increase efficiency, both operations and in the transactions between refiners and retail outlet. Some controls, however, could also influence the structure or incentives of refiners in a way that increases their market power (reduces competition) and could therefore prove costly to consumers. In general, the positive aspects of <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> impact the pricing and operations of retail outlets, and are passed through to consumers in the form of lower retai...|$|R

In general, the positive aspects of <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> impact the pricing and operations of retail outlets, and are passed through to consumers in the form of lower retail mark-ups over wholesale prices. The negative consequences primarily impact wholesale prices through the influence of vertical structure on the incentives of refiners to reduce competition at the wholesale level. We conclude that {{in order to make a}} case that public intervention could be justified as a basis for reducing consumer prices, one must establish both that intervention could indirectly reduce the wholesale margins of refiners and that these wholesale benefits are not offset by increased costs and market power at the retail level...|$|R
25|$|The basic oscilloscope, {{as shown}} in the illustration, is {{typically}} divided into four sections: the display, <b>vertical</b> <b>controls,</b> horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a CRT or LCD panel which is laid out with both horizontal and vertical reference lines referred to as the graticule. In addition to the screen, most display sections are equipped with three basic controls: a focus knob, an intensity knob and a beam finder button.|$|R
2500|$|Reportedly, the B-2 has a radar {{cross-section}} (RCS) of about [...] [...] The bomber {{does not always}} fly stealthily; when nearing air defenses pilots [...] "stealth up" [...] the B-2, a manoeuvre whose details are secret. [...] The aircraft is stealthy, except briefly when the bomb bay opens. The B-2's clean, low-drag flying wing configuration not only provides exceptional range but is also beneficial to reducing its radar profile. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would lack angles to reflect back radar waves (initially, {{the shape of the}} Northrop ATB concept was flatter; it gradually increased in volume according to specific military requirements).|$|E

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} exclusive territories, which are typical <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> imposed by upstream firms. Using shipping spatial models, I consider an industry that consists of many independent local markets. An upstream monopolist restricts competition between downstream firms using exclusive territories. I find that exclusive territories reduce the prices of final products in all local markets in quantity-setting competition. In price-setting competition, they raise prices in half the local markets, reduce them in other markets, and also reduce the total consumer surplus. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>control</b> limitations: Though {{horizontal}} {{placement of}} elements was always generally easy to control, vertical placement was frequently unintuitive, convoluted, or outright impossible.

The Flexible Box Module improved the situation considerably and <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> is much more straightforward and supported {{in all of the}} modern browsers.

These samples were fabricated using a <b>vertical</b> <b>controlled</b> drying method. The spectral position and width of a stopgap depend on the core-to-shell ratio, {{in a manner consistent}} with numerical calculations. Both experiments and calculations show that the relative L-stopgap width in the case of high-index core low-index shell particles can be larger in comparison to the case of homogeneous particles of either material.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Vertical gaze palsy is a {{recognized}} manifestation of midbrain lesions. It rarely {{is a consequence}} of unilateral thalamic infarction. Case presentation We report the case of a 48 -year-old African-American woman who presented to our facility with vertical gaze palsy and evidence of left medial thalamic infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging without coexisting midbrain ischemia. The etiology of infarct was determined to be small vessel disease after extensive investigation. Conclusions This report suggests a possible role of the thalamus as a <b>vertical</b> gaze <b>control</b> center. Clinicoradiological studies are needed to further define the role of the thalamus in <b>vertical</b> gaze <b>control.</b> </p...|$|R
