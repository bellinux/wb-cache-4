5|$|By 1930, the <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> the Nazis and communists led {{to local}} SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by {{two members of}} the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels turned him into a martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially {{declared}} Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the NSDAP anthem.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the team's support base {{consists}} of fans of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated with hooliganism, though <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> the two groups does not usually occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly from fans of Zrinjski Mostar. The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called Uvijek Vjerni (Always Faithful).|$|E

5|$|By July 1789, revolutionary {{sentiment}} {{was rising}} in Paris. The Estates-General was convened in May {{and members of}} the Third Estate proclaimed the Tennis Court Oath in June, calling for the king to grant a written constitution. <b>Violence</b> <b>between</b> loyal royal forces, mutinous members of the royal Gardes Françaises and local crowds broke out at Vendôme on 12 July, leading to widespread fighting and the withdrawal of royal forces from the centre of Paris. Revolutionary crowds began to arm themselves during 13 July, looting royal stores, gunsmiths and armourers' shops for weapons and gunpowder.|$|E

Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene. According to a Palestinian official, the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army, but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees–Red Sox match-up is {{regarded}} by some sports journalists {{as the greatest}} rivalry in sports. Games between the two teams often generate considerable interest and receive extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. Many national networks, including ESPN and Fox Sports, broadcast the games on the weekend. Yankees–Red Sox games {{are some of the}} most-watched MLB games each season. Outside of baseball, the rivalry between the two teams has led to <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> fans, along with attention from politicians and other athletes.|$|E
5|$|The {{competition}} was played intermittently between 1970 and 1996 between clubs from England and Italy. It {{was founded by}} Gigi Peronace, following the two-team Anglo-Italian League Cup in 1969. The initial Anglo-Italian Cup was played as an annual tournament from 1970 to 1973. The first final was abandoned early due to violence, with Swindon Town declared the winners. During its time the tournament {{had a reputation for}} <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> fans, but it returned as a semi-professional tournament from 1976 before it was abolished again in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{transactional}} {{theory of}} stress and coping, threat appraisals influence coping and adjustment. Previous {{research has shown that}} threat appraisals mediate relations <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> exposure and adjustment, but few studies have examined links between threat appraisals and coping. The current study examined relations <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> exposure, threat appraisals, and coping among typologies of victimized adolescents. The sample included 159 predominately African American adolescents (M = 12. 1). Path analyses were used to test whether threats of negative evaluation by self and others mediated relations <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> exposure and avoidance and positive reframing coping, respectively. Results did not indicate mediation or differential relations between study constructs for victim typologies. Significant direct effects were found <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> exposure and negative self-evaluation and positive reframing, such that greater violence exposure was associated with a greater likelihood of self-blaming and positive reframing. These findings have implications for youth violence prevention and intervention efforts...|$|R
5|$|Book One, Awake to Emptiness, {{begins with}} Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, {{discovering}} a Magyar village {{where all the}} inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe (encountering only one lone native). Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu hates the Chinese for {{what they have done}} to him and he incites <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Even as the act {{was being}} debated, {{settlers}} {{on both sides of}} the slavery issue poured into the territories so as to secure the outcome they wanted in the voting. The passage of the act resulted in so much <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> groups that the territory became known as Bleeding Kansas. Thousands of pro-slavery Border Ruffians came across from Missouri to vote in the territorial elections although they were not resident in Kansas, giving that element the victory. Pierce supported the outcome despite the irregularities. When Free-Staters set up a shadow government, and drafted the Topeka Constitution, Pierce called their work an act of rebellion. The president continued to recognize the pro-slavery legislature, which was dominated by Democrats, even after a Congressional investigative committee found its election to have been illegitimate. He dispatched federal troops to break up a meeting of the Topeka government.|$|E
40|$|Ankara : The Department of Political Science and Public Administration, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2012. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis aims at {{understanding}} the relationship <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> {{and politics in}} twentieth century political thought. To this end, the study looks at the works of selected thinkers and suggests a threefold categorization of existing approaches: a ‘non-problematization of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> and politics’ exemplified in the liberal-democratic paradigm, a ‘nonproblematization of violence in politics’ in some critiques of liberal thought and the position of ambivalence, which suggests a historical relationship <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> and politics. The thesis moves to a further analysis of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, whose works are considered as representing the third position and discuss their analysis of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>violence</b> and politics {{with a focus on}} power and revolution.

5|$|Fixtures between Millwall and West Ham United are {{currently}} categorised by the Metropolitan Police as category C– games which carry {{a high risk}} of disorder amongst supporters. For the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure that the games passed by without any incident. In 2013 a member of West Ham's hooligan Inter City Firm was jailed for 12 months for organising <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> West Ham and Millwall fans during an FA Cup match between Dagenham & Redbridge and Millwall on 7 January 2012. He chose this game in the belief fewer police would be in attendance at a match in Dagenham, but who instead, turned out in force to prevent trouble. In November 2014 the two sides' development squads were drawn against each other in the U21 Premier League Cup. The Metropolitan Police took preventative measures against any trouble occurring, demanding the game at Rush Green kick-off at 12pm and be played behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|In the Star Trek universe, {{prior to}} the arrival of Voyager in the Delta Quadrant, {{hostilities}} between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe keeping them subjugated. <b>Violence</b> <b>between</b> the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them rising up against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the quadrant. On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe's technology and ships and, rather than settle on a new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control of resources and technology.|$|E
5|$|Millwall's fiercest rival is West Ham United. It {{is one of}} {{the most}} passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in {{different}} leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899–1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as Green Street.|$|E

The following year, a three-day period of <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> Hindus and Muslims in the western Indian state of Gujarat, known as the 2002 Gujarat riots, spread to Ahmedabad; refugee camps were set up around the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. In some quarters {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{was present}} during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the {{accompanying}} ethnic <b>violence</b> <b>between</b> Hindu and Muslim communities.

He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob.
