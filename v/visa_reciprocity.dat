50|$|Even {{though the}} Brazilian {{checkpoint}} {{had not yet}} been completed and full <b>visa</b> waiver <b>reciprocity</b> {{had not yet been}} achieved, due to pressure from the French government, the bridge was inaugurated on 18 March 2017 in the presence of officials from Brazil and French Guiana (including the Governor of Amapá, Waldez Góes, the Prefect of French Guiana, Martin Jaeger, and the Mayor of Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock, Georges Elfort). The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, was originally due to attend the inauguration ceremony, but in the end was not present. The official reason for her absence at the inauguration ceremony was that her Brazilian counterpart would not be present, but local media suggested that the actual reason was the various protests she faced during her visit in French Guiana, which led her to cut short her visit in the overseas department and fly back to Paris on 17 March 2017.|$|R
5000|$|Though the Oyapock Bridge {{was to be}} inaugurated {{in early}} 2012, it {{remained}} closed as the road on the Brazilian side was not completely paved. As of April 2013, the opening was scheduled {{for the end of}} 2013, but as of January 2015 the bridge had still not opened due to delays {{in the construction of the}} Brazilian customs facility, and no opening date was forecast. Another reason for the delayed opening of the bridge, as identified by Brazilian Senator João Capiberibe, was the lack of reciprocity pertaining to the visa requirements for Brazilian and French nationals entering each other's territory (French nationals could enter Brazil visa-free for up to 3 months, whereas Brazilian nationals had to obtain a visa to enter French Guiana, a requirement which was justified by the French government on the grounds of high levels of illegal immigration by Brazilians working as gold panners in French Guiana). In 2014, the Brazilian and French governments reached an agreement allowing residents of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana to apply for a local border crossing card, enabling them to visit each other's city visa-free for up to 72 hours (but not further inland). The arrangement came into effect on 1 January 2015 and, as of 1 October 2015, over 200 cards had been issued to Brazilian citizens resident in Oiapoque. According to the French government, the Brazilian government was 'largely satisfied' with this arrangement (though it fell short of full <b>visa</b> waiver <b>reciprocity).</b>|$|R

2500|$|Whilst {{citizens}} of all Member States of the European Union and Schengen associated countries {{are entitled to}} use the eVisitor system since 27 October 2008, the European Commission is still assessing whether the eVisitor <b>visa</b> fully satisfies <b>reciprocity</b> requirements. In its [...] Seventh report on certain third countries' maintenance of visa requirements in breach {{of the principle of}} reciprocity from 2012, the European Commission found that in principle, the eVisitor provides equal treatment of the {{citizens of}} all Member States and Schengen associated countries. However, while the average autogrant rate was high (86.36%), the quarterly reports on eVisitor application statistics showed that applications by citizens of some Member States are mainly processed manually. Autogrant rates for Bulgaria and Romania were at just 18% and 23%, as the majority of applications were sent for additional examination. The Commission therefore engaged to continue to closely monitor the processing of eVisitor applications. The Commission would submit its assessment of whether eVisitor is equivalent to the Schengen visa application process in a separate document in parallel with the assessment of the Final Rule on ESTA. Currently the Schengen Area does not have visa requirements in place for short-term stays of Australian nationals. The United Kingdom and Ireland are exempt from this particular EU policy, but still do not impose any short-term visa requirements on Australians.|$|R
40|$|The Australian state's {{present day}} borders are {{controlled}} and {{protected by a}} universal visa system in which all non-citizens must be {{in possession of a}} categorical visa before entry and while staying within the country; anyone without a visa is illegally within the state and subject to detention or removal. Amongst the visa categories offered by the Australian government that allow foreigners to dwell legally within the state is the Working Holiday Visa Subclass 417. This subclass visa is only available to citizens of Belgium, Canada, Republic of Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. This visa offers citizens of these countries, if meeting certain requirements, the opportunity to live and work within Australia for a maximum period of 24 months. The Australian government offers a similar type visa to the citizens of Bangladesh, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey, and the United States of America; the Work And Holiday Visa Subclass 462. This visa offers the citizens of these countries, if meeting certain requirements, the opportunity to live and work within Australia for a maximum period of 12 months. However, certain requirements to obtain this visa are not applied to the similar category Subclass 417 applicants, namely a language proficiency requirement. The object of this thesis study is to examine why there are two separate subclasses within the working holiday category offered by the Australian government in which different distinct groups of countries belong to, are subjected to different eligibility requirements, and are allotted different lengths of time in Australia. To conduct my analysis of these two subclass visa policies, I have applied sociological and anthropological theory and studies about nation-state formation and administration to the current qualifications and eligibility of these visas, which are deemed as official immigration policy in practice and described on official Australian government web pages. Historical accounts of past immigration policy have been accessed from the National Archives of Australia to demonstrate that preferential treatment toward certain desired immigrants has existed through much of Australia's development into a nation-state and to draw a connection between current cases of preferential treatment within the Working Holiday Maker Program - the collective title for both visas under scrutiny. My analysis will show that the offering of temporary work and living rights to citizens of particular European and Asian countries which are eligible for the Working Holiday Visa Subclass 417, in comparison to citizens of those countries eligible for the Work and Holiday Visa Subclass 462, is evidence of preferential treatment, and therefore Australian government policy, which is reminiscent of preferential policy that was practiced in the past. Despite claims that these visas are offered under the guise of promoting cultural understanding and good will between nations, this is merely a case of the state enacting policies that allow it to influence population demographics that offer less obstacles of administration to the government and foster perceived national identity.

50|$|Countries which grant visa-free or visa-on-arrival {{entry to}} ROC {{passport}} holders may restrict this privilege to {{persons who are}} guaranteed to be removable to Taiwan. The {{presence or absence of}} a National Identification Card number in the passport is used to make this determination. As NWOHRs do not hold identification cards, their ROC passports thus do not get them visa-free treatment from a number of countries and territories, including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Deputy-Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lyushun (沈呂巡) stated that during the visa-exemption negotiations with Australia in 2010, he requested the extension of visa-free treatment to NWOHRs, but the Australian side rejected the idea precisely over concerns regarding lack of returnability. Similarly, the United States only grants visa waivers to ROC passport holders with an identification card imprinted in the ROC passport; bearers of an ROC passport without an identification card number are considered them to be stateless persons for visa-issuing purposes, and the Taiwan <b>visa</b> <b>reciprocity</b> schedule does not apply to them.

Such an approach could offer {{a way out of the}} EU’s current inter-institutional dispute regarding the measures to take under a post-Lisbon regulatory framework.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} {{and analysis of the}} EU law and policy on Schengen visas. The EU visa policy is analysed in its historical development and its place in the framework of Schengen acquis. Separately, important visa policy measures are analysed including the typology of visas, exceptions from visa obligation, <b>visa</b> <b>reciprocity,</b> visa facilitation and processes of visa liberalisation. Different phases of the visa procedure are studied with focus on the questions whether there is a right to be issued a Schengen visa when the conditions are met and the right of appeal. The relevant legislation subject to analysis is above all the Visa Code, the regulation on visa lists and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. By way of illustration, the implementation in the Czech legal order is used and jurisprudence of the Czech higher courts is quoted to show to what extent the EU visa procedure and visa refusal matches the requirements of the administrative law theory on the administrative procedure and decision in general. The relevant rules are assessed as to the extent they match with principles of legitimacy, influence of legal certainty, effectiveness and proportionality. The core of the work is a hypothesis that current EU visa rules do not establish a right to a visa when the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{on the new}} DEMIG VISA {{database}} {{which covers}} global bilateral travel restrictions from 1973 to 2013, this paper explores patterns and trends in international visa regimes. We construct indices of cross-regional inbound and outbound travel restrictiveness to investigate (i) {{the extent to which}} different world regions and regional unions have opened or closed to other regions and (ii) {{the ways in which the}} formation of regional unions or the disintegration of countries or unions of countries (e. g. the USSR) has affected international visa regimes. Generally, the analysis challenge the idea of a growing global mobility divide between ‘North’ and ‘South’, and yields a more complex image reflecting the rather multi-polar and multi-layered nature of international relations. While the strongest change has been the decreasing use of exit restrictions, the level of entry visa restrictiveness has remained remarkably stable at high levels, with currently around 73 per cent of country dyads being visa-restricted. While predominantly European and North American OECD countries maintain high levels of entry visa restrictiveness for Africa and Asia, these latter regions have the highest levels of entry restrictions themselves. Although citizens of wealthy countries generally enjoy greatest visa-free travel opportunities, this primarily reflects their freedom to travel to other OECD countries. Visa-free travel is mostly realised between geographically proximate countries of integrated regional blocs such as ECOWAS, the EU, GCC and MERCOSUR. Analyses of global dynamics in <b>visa</b> <b>reciprocity</b> show that 21 per cent of the country dyads have asymmetrical visa rules, but also show that levels of reciprocity have increased since the mid- 1990 s. Our analysis shows that visas are not ‘just’ instruments regulating entry of visitors and exit of citizens, but are manifestations of broader political economic trends and inequalities in international power relations...|$|E
40|$|When {{immigration}} {{policy and the}} treatment of Roma collide in international relations there are surprising consequences which are revelatory of the underlying tensions between internal and external policies in the European Union. This book examines the relationship of citizenship, ethnicity and international relations and how these three aspects of the State, its people and its neighbours relate to one another. It studies the wide issue of international relations, citizenship and minority discrimination {{through the lens of}} the case study of European Roma who seek refugee status in Canada on account of their persecution in Europe. The volume assesses the relationships among citizenship, state protection and persecution and minority status, and how they can intersect with and destabilize foreign affairs. The central background to the book is the European treatment of Roma, their linkages with visa and asylum policies and their human rights repercussions. The various contributions reveal how modern liberal democracies can find themselves in contradictory positions concerning their citizens - when these are looking for protection abroad - and foreigners - in search of international protection - as a consequence of visa and pre-border surveillance policies and practices.
