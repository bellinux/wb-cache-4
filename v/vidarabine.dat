5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with viral replication called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or <b>vidarabine),</b> considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. <b>Vidarabine</b> was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous <b>vidarabine</b> was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to <b>vidarabine</b> vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over <b>vidarabine</b> has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of <b>vidarabine.</b> However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on <b>vidarabine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> is more toxic {{and less}} metabolically stable {{than many of}} the other current antivirals such as {{acyclovir}} and ganciclovir. Viral strains resistant to <b>vidarabine</b> show changes in DNA polymerase. It is prone to deamination by adenosine deaminase to inosine. This metabolite still possesses antiviral activity, but is 10-fold less potent than <b>vidarabine.</b> 60% of <b>vidarabine</b> eliminated by the kidney is excreted as 9-β-D-arabinofuranosylhypoxanthine in the urine. Some breakdown of the purine ring may also occur, forming uric acid.Structural modifications of <b>vidarabine</b> have proven partially effective at blocking deamination, such as replacement of the amine with a methoxy group (ara-M). This results in about a 10-fold greater selectivity against Varicella Zoster Virus than ara-A, however analog of <b>vidarabine</b> is inactive against other viruses due to it not being able to be phosphorylated.The use of an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase to increase the half-life of <b>vidarabine</b> has also been tried, and drugs such as dCF and EHNA have been used {{with a small amount of}} success.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> is an antiviral, active against herpes viruses, poxviruses, rhabdoviruses, hepadnaviruses {{and some}} RNA tumour viruses. A 3% {{ophthalmic}} ointment Vira-A {{is used in}} the treatment of acute keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent superficial keratitis caused by HSV-1 and HSV-2. <b>Vidarabine</b> is also used to treat herpes zoster in AIDS patients, reducing lesions formation and the duration of viral shedding.Many of the previous uses of <b>vidarabine</b> have been superseded by acyclovir, due to the hospitalisation required for intra venous dosing, and acyclovir has a higher selectivity, lower inhibitory concentration and higher potency.Toxic side effects are rare, but have been reported with high concentrations of <b>vidarabine,</b> such as nausea, vomiting, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients receiving high intravenous doses daily.|$|E
5000|$|The {{drug was}} {{originally}} intended as an anti-cancer drug. [...] The anti-viral activity of <b>vidarabine</b> was first described by M. Privat de Garilhe and J. De Rudder in 1964. [...] It {{was the first}} nucleoside analog antiviral to be given systemically {{and was the first}} agent to be licensed for the treatment of systematic herpes virus infection in humans. It was University of Alabama at Birmingham researcher and physician Richard J. Whitley in 1976 where the clinical effectiveness of <b>vidarabine</b> was first realized, and <b>vidarabine</b> was used in the treatment of many viral diseases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> {{works by}} {{interfering with the}} {{synthesis}} of viral DNA. It is a nucleoside analog and therefore has to be phosphorylated to be active. This is a three-step process in which <b>vidarabine</b> is sequentially phosphorylated by kinases to the triphosphate ara-ATP. This is the active form of <b>vidarabine</b> and is both an inhibitor and a substrate of viral DNA polymerase.When used as a substrate for viral DNA polymerase, ara-ATP competitively inhibits dATP leading {{to the formation of}} ‘faulty’ DNA. This is where ara-ATP is incorporated into the DNA strand replacing many of the adenosine bases. This results in the prevention of DNA synthesis, as phosphodiester bridges can no longer to be built, destabilizing the strand.Vidarabine triphosphate (ara-ATP) also inhibits RNA polyadenylation; preventing polyadenylation essential for HIV-1 and other retroviruses; and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, preventing transmethylation reactions.Uniquely to <b>vidarabine,</b> the diphosphorylated <b>vidarabine</b> (ara-ADP) also has an inhibitory effect. Other nucleoside analogs need to be triphosphorlated to give any antiviral effect, but ara-ADP inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. This prevents the reduction of nucleotide diphosphates, causing a reduction of viral replication.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} herpes simplex virus-derived meningitis, {{antiviral}} therapy (acyclovir or <b>vidarabine)</b> must be started immediately for a favorable outcome. Acyclovir {{is a better}} antiviral because it shows a similar effect on the infection as <b>vidarabine</b> and is safer {{to use in the}} neonate. The recommended dosage is 20 mg/kg every six hours for 21 days.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{synthesis}} of <b>Vidarabine</b> was first attained in 1960, {{as a part}} of studies on developing potential anticancer agents by B. R. Baker et al. based on unique biological properties of 1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (ara-U). More specifically some of its important reactions include treatments with 2'-deoxyribonucleoside phosphorylase, methyltransferase, or nucleoside phosphorylase, affording the corresponding 5'-phosphate, giving rise to no methylation at its 5-position, or no cleavage of the glycosyl bond in contrast to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, respectively. This earlier work gave impetus to further synthetic studies on the nucleosides with the β-D-arabinofuranosyl moiety including <b>Vidarabine,</b> and the isolation of <b>Vidarabine</b> from the fermentation culture broth of Streptomyces antibioticus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> or 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (ara-A) is an {{antiviral}} drug which is active against herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> {{phosphate}} is an {{adenosine monophosphate}} nucleotide in which ribose is replaces by an arabinso moiety. It has antiviral and possibly antineoplastic properties.|$|E
50|$|A Cochrane Systematic Review {{showed that}} {{trifluridine}} and acyclovir were {{a more effective}} treatment than idoxuridine or <b>vidarabine,</b> significantly increasing the relative number of successfully healed eyes in 14 days.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the human}} body it can be treated {{by a number of}} drugs and {{therapeutic}} agents including acyclovir for the chicken pox, famciclovir, valaciclovir for the shingles, zoster-immune globulin (ZIG), and <b>vidarabine.</b> VZV immune globulin is also a treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> is {{an analog}} of {{adenosine}} with the D-ribose, replaced with D-arabinose. As {{you can see}} from figure 1.1 that it is a stereoisomer of adenosine.It has a half-life of 60 minutes, and its solubility is 0.05%, and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) when converted to its active metabolite.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the potential anticancer properties antiviral activity of <b>Vidarabine</b> was also demonstrated in 1965. [...] Particularly worthy of mention is the collaboration of efficient chemical and enzymatic reactions, i.e., transesterification from ethylene carbonate to uridine accompanied by spontaneous intramolecular elimination of carbon dioxide giving 2,2'-O-anhydro-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil (anhydro-ara-U); and acid-hydrolysis of anhydro-ara-U giving ara-U; and subsequent enzymatic transglycosylation of the sugar moiety of ara-U to the 9-position of adenine with perfect retention of the β-configuration. and following papers. Ultimately, in 1984, these pioneering syntheses led to the first commercial synthesis of <b>Vidarabine</b> in Japan under the trade name of [...] "Arasena-A." [...] An enzymatic approach duplicating the same concept was also later reported.Furthermore, replacement of adenine with 2-fluoroadenine in the enzymatic transglycosylation reaction from ara-U to the 9-position of adenine made it bring about efficient synthesis of 2-fluoro-9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (fludarabine).|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s two nucleosides were {{isolated}} from the Caribbean sponge Tethya crypta: spongothymidine and spongouridine; which contained D-arabinose rather than D-ribose. These compounds led to the synthesis of a new generation, sugar modified nucleoside analog <b>vidarabine,</b> and the related compound cytarabine. In 2004 these were the only marine related compounds in clinical use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> is less {{susceptible}} {{to the development of}} drug resistant strains than other antivirals such as IDU, and has been used successfully in the treatment of IDU resistant viral strains.The half-life of the active triphosphate metabolite (ara-ATP) is three times longer in HSV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells, however the mechanism of selectivity is not known.|$|E
50|$|The nucleosides spongothymidine and spongouridine were {{isolated}} from this sponge, providing {{the basis for}} anti-viral drugs and anti-cancer drugs. <b>Vidarabine,</b> an antiviral drug, was derived from these compounds. The discovery of these nucleosides also {{led to the development}} of cytarabine for clinical use in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma. Gemcitabine, a fluorinated derivative of cytarabine, is used to treat pancreatic, breast, bladder, and non-small-cell lung cancer.|$|E
50|$|Reductions in {{morbidity}} and mortality are due {{to the use of}} antiviral treatments such as <b>vidarabine</b> and acyclovir. However, {{morbidity and}} mortality still remain high due to diagnosis of DIS and CNS herpes coming too late for effective antiviral administration; early diagnosis is difficult in the 20-40% of infected neonates that have no visible lesions. A recent large scale retrospective study found disseminated NHSV patients least likely to get timely treatment, contributing to the high morbidity/mortality in that group.|$|E
50|$|Epithelial {{keratitis}} {{is treated}} with topical antivirals, {{which are very}} effective with low incidence of resistance. Treatment of the disease with topical antivirals generally should be continued for 10-14 days. Aciclovir ophthalmic ointment and Trifluridine eye drops have similar effectiveness but are more effective than Idoxuridine and <b>Vidarabine</b> eye drops. Oral acyclovir is as effective as topical antivirals for treating epithelial keratitis, {{and it has the}} advantage of no eye surface toxicity. For this reason, oral therapy is preferred by some ophthalmologists.|$|E
50|$|Inhibitors of DNA primases are {{valuable}} compounds for the elucidation of biochemical pathways and key interactions, {{but they are}} also of interest as lead compounds to design drugs against bacterial diseases. Most of the compounds known to inhibit primases are nucleotide analogs such as AraATP (see <b>Vidarabine)</b> and 2-fluoro-AraATP. These compounds will often be used as substrates by the primase, but once incorporated synthesis or elongation can no longer occur. For example, E. coli DnaG will use 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates (ddNTPs) as substrates, which act as chain terminators {{due to the lack of}} a 3' hydroxyl to form a phosphodiester bond with the next nucleotide.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> (adenine arabinoside) is a purine {{nucleoside}} useful in humans for therapy of {{herpes simplex virus}} encephalitis and herpes zoster virus infections in immunocompromised patients. However, the potential usefulness of vidaribine is limited by its poor solubility, which requires continuous infusion in relatively large volumes of intravenous fluid. <b>Vidarabine</b> 5 ′-monophosphate is highly soluble and has the advantage {{that it can be}} administered intermittently intramuscularly or intravenously. In a clinical, pharmacokinetic study, plasma levels and urinary excretion of <b>vidarabine</b> 5 ′-monophosphate were determined after intravenous and intramuscular administration in 29 immunosuppressed patients with herpes simplex or zoster virus infections at dosages of 15 to 30 mg/kg per day administered for 5 days. As determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography, <b>vidarabine</b> 5 ′-monophosphate was metabolized in a fashion comparable to the metabolism of <b>vidarabine</b> and its major metabolite in plasma was arabinosyl hypoxanthine. After administration, 40 to 50 % of the <b>vidarabine</b> 5 ′-monophosphate was recovered from the urine as arabinosyl hypoxanthine, and 3 to 4 % was recovered as <b>vidarabine.</b> Determinations of areas under the curve for arabinosyl hypoxanthine were not statistically different by dosage for intramuscular or intravenous routes of administration. At all dosages studied, viral clearance appeared to occur with therapy. The advantage of increased solubility will lead to controlled clinical investigations in which <b>vidarabine</b> 5 ′-monophosphate is administered by intramuscular or intravenous routes against targeted human herpesvirus infections...|$|E
40|$|Acyclovir and <b>vidarabine</b> exerted a less-than-additive {{effect on}} the {{replication}} of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-l) in green monkey kidney cells. The synthesis of viral DNA was reduced much more (97010) than that of cellular DNA (45010) by combined acyclovir and <b>vidarabine</b> in cell culture. Furthermore, the combined drugs, given topically or systemically, were {{more effective than the}} individual drugs in diminishing the develop-ment of clinical signs of HSV-l infection in hairless mice. However, mortality among animals given topical acyclovir plus <b>vidarabine</b> was not significantly lower than that among animals given topical acyclovir only. Systemic acyclovir (50 mg/kg per day) plus <b>vidarabine</b> (100 mg/kg per day), given for five consecutive days starting 24 hr after viral inoculation, significantly reduced the frequency of development of latent HSV-l infec-tion in the trigeminal ganglia of mice, whereas systemic acyclovir or <b>vidarabine</b> alone did not. Several potent, selective antiherpetic viral agents have been developed [1, 2]. These agents, including acyclovir and (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuri...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether acyclovir resistance in mice infected with herpes simplex virus could be overcome by using high doses of acyclovir or <b>vidarabine</b> alone or by using a combination of the two drugs. The results indicate that the mice infected intracerebrally were refractory to acyclovir alone but responded to <b>vidarabine</b> or a combination of <b>vidarabine</b> and acyclovir. These observations have major implications for the clinical management of severe herpetic infections, particularly if attempts are to be made to devise means of circumventing drug resistance...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vidarabine</b> (adenine arabinoside, ara-a) {{has been}} found to be useful in the {{treatment}} of various viral infections. Its adverse neurological effects include tremor and encephalopathy. Two cases of <b>vidarabine</b> encephalopathy are reported and the five other cases in the literature are reviewed. The clinical features of the tremor and encephalopathy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, permeability {{was shown}} {{to be one of}} the most important factors influencing the delivery of <b>vidarabine</b> and its 5 '- 0 -esters in the vaginal membrane of the mouse. The present report describes the results of the extension of these studies to the guinea pig vaginal membrane. By a vaginal smear procedure, the estrous cycle (approx. 16 days in duration) was monitored by dividing it into five stages. The vaginal membrane permeability of <b>vidarabine</b> was measured during each stage in a two-chamber diffusion cell. This study revealed that the permeability coefficients for <b>vidarabine</b> were 5 - 100 times higher during the early diestrus stage than during the estrus stage. Additional permeation studies on membranes at the estrus stage were performed by separating the upper layer (keratin layer combined with mucous layer) from the rest of the membrane. The low permeability coefficient of <b>vidarabine</b> for the upper layer suggests that this layer may be the major diffusion barrier (mainly keratin layer) for <b>vidarabine</b> when the drug is topically applied during the estrus stage. The immature guinea pig vaginal membranes showed permeability coefficients comparable to those values obtained from the membranes of mature guinea pigs during the early diestrus stage...|$|E
40|$|Seventy-three immunocompromised {{patients}} with disseminated herpes zoster were evaluated in a double-blind controlled trial of acyclovir (n = 37) versus <b>vidarabine</b> (n = 36) therapy. Acyclo-vir was administered at 30 rug/kg/day at 8 -h intervals and <b>vidarabine</b> was given {{as a continuous}} 12 -h infusion at 10 rug/kg/day for 7 days (longer if resolution of cutaneous or visceral disease was incomplete). No demographic differences existed between treatment groups. No deaths at-tributable to varicella-zoster virus infection occurred within 1 month of treatment. Neither rates of cutaneous healing, resolution of acute neuritis, and frequency of postherpetic neuralgia nor adverse clinical and laboratory events differed between treatment groups. Acyclovir recipients were discharged from the hospital more promptly than <b>vidarabine</b> recipients (P =. 04, log rank test). These data indicate that disseminated herpes zoster is amenable to therapy with either acyclovir or vidarabine; resultant mortality is low. Disseminated herpes zoster is a significant cause ofmorbid-ity and mortality in the immunocompromised host [I, 2]. Over the past decade, first <b>vidarabine</b> and subsequently acy-clovir were proven efficacious for the intravenous (iv) treat...|$|E
40|$|A 24 -year-old {{man with}} disseminated herpes zoster, which {{occurred}} 9 months after {{bone marrow transplantation}} for chronic myeloid leukemia, developed encephalopathy and immobilizing myoclonus after 7 days of <b>vidarabine</b> treatment (10 mg/kg of body weight per day). Only mild hepatic dysfunction was {{a risk factor for}} a toxic reaction. After the <b>vidarabine</b> therapy was stopped, the symptoms worsened until treatment with hydration, large doses of chlordiazepoxide, and protective care gave symptomatic relief...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} therapeutic {{effects of}} <b>vidarabine</b> (9 -beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine), cyclaradine (the adenosine deaminase-resistant carbocyclic analog of <b>vidarabine),</b> and cyclaradine- 5 '-methoxyacetate in the parenteral treatment of systemic {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 infections in Swiss mice were determined. Among control mice inoculated intraperitoneally with virus, a mortality rate of 95 % was observed. The intraperitoneal administration of nontoxic doses of <b>vidarabine</b> (125 to 250 mg/kg per day) or cyclaradine (113 to 450 mg/kg per day), by daily injections for 7 days beginning 4 h after virus inoculation, reduced mortality to 0 to 10 %. Among control animals inoculated intracerebrally with 32 50 % lethal doses of virus, 100 % mortality was observed, with a mean survival time of 4. 6 days. Treatment with either drug at equimolar dose levels ranging from ca. 32 to 750 mg/kg per day produced significant (P less than 0. 0005), dose-dependent increases in the mean survival time of animals dying of herpesvirus encephalitis. Mice inoculated intracerebrally with 10 50 % lethal doses of virus exhibited 97 % mortality and a mean survival time of 5. 5 to 6. 4 days. Treatment with <b>vidarabine,</b> cyclaradine, or cyclaradine- 5 '-methoxyacetate significantly increased the mean survival time of dying animals and, at doses ranging from 250 to 750 mg/kg per day, produced significant increases in survival. The three drugs displayed equivalent antiviral efficacy in vivo. Drug toxicity (measured by weight loss) was not detected in mice treated with cyclaradine or cyclaradine- 5 '-methoxyacetate at 750 mg/kg per day, whereas severe toxicity (weight loss of {{greater than or equal}} to 3 g) was observed in mice treated with <b>vidarabine</b> at an equivalent dose level. Thus, cyclaradine or its 5 '-methoxyacetic acid ester may possess some advantage over <b>vidarabine</b> in the treatment of severe herpesvirus infections and should therefore be considered for clinical trials in humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>vidarabine</b> {{were studied}} on 22 occasions in nine infants and three older children with herpesvirus infection. The drug was administered for 10 days in doses of 15 - 30 mg/kg per day. <b>Vidarabine</b> was not {{detected in the}} serum of any pa-tient, although small quantities were detected in the urine {{of two of the}} older children. Peak serum concentrations of arabinosyl hypoxanthine, the major metabolite of vidar-abine, ranged from 2. 3 to 11. 4 ug/ml. Concentrations of this metabolite were higher in two preterm infants than in full-term infants receiving comparable doses. The mean elimination half-life estimated from cumulative urinary excretion was 2. 4 hr in a pre-term infant, 3. 1 hr in full-term infants, and 2. 8 hr in older children. Neither clearance nor half-life changed when multiple doses were administered. <b>Vidarabine</b> and arabino-syl hypoxanthine did not accumulate during therapy. The rates of recovery of drug from the urine and of renal clearance of arabinosyl hypoxanthine were directly related to the age and maturity of the patient. Arabinosyl hypoxanthine readily diffused into cerebrospinal fluid. <b>Vidarabine</b> (9 -(3 -D-arabinofuranosyladenine) is a...|$|E
40|$|Four {{patients}} who had chronic liver disease and were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were treated with <b>vidarabine,</b> a synthetic purine nucleoside that inhibits DNA polymerase activity in vitro and in vivo. Before treatment all had raised serum DNA polymerase concentrations. Three also had hepatitis B e (HBe) and were shown by electron microscopy to have hepatitis B virus (Dane) particles in their serum. In all patients 10 days' treatment with <b>vidarabine</b> resulted in an immediate loss of DNA polymerase activity. In three patients the activity returned when treatment was stopped. In those three patients Dane particles and HBe antigen persisted during and after treatment; in the fourth patient, who remained negative for DNA polymerase, HBsAg titres fell. Although <b>vidarabine</b> inhibited virus replication, virus particles did not disappear from the blood in these patients, presumably because the particles were cleared only slowly. Similar results with interferon suggest that the virus disappears, and HBsAg titres fall, some weeks after the fall in DNA polymerase activity. Continued treatment may therefore have a sustained effect on viral replication. Whether <b>vidarabine</b> can permanently clear HBsAg and so arrest chronic liver disease remains to be seen, but {{at the very least}} it could reduce the spread of infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of various concentrations of acyclovir and <b>vidarabine</b> or its 5 '-monophosphate usually produced an additive interaction with various strains of {{herpes simplex virus}} types 1 and 2 in Vero cells. Similarly, certain combinations of these drugs were {{more effective than the}} individual drugs in decreasing the mortality and increasing the mean day of death of mice inoculated intracerebrally with herpes simplex virus type 2. Neither antagonism nor interference was noted for any of the in vitro or in vivo combinations. The increased antiviral activity was determined not to be secondary to toxic effects of the drugs. Although viruses resistant to either <b>vidarabine</b> or acyclovir developed readily in cell culture, no evidence of cross-resistance was obtained. Furthermore, {{in the presence of the}} two drugs, mutants resistant to <b>vidarabine,</b> acyclovir, or vidarabine/acyclovir could not be isolated. These findings suggest that combinations with these antivirals, which are currently being evaluated singly for the therapy of severe forms of herpetic infection, could prove clinically useful if increasing numbers of resistant viral strains are observed...|$|E
40|$|Agents {{available}} to treat herpesvirus infections include idoxuridine, trifluridine, <b>vidarabine</b> and acyclovir for the topical treatment of herpetic eye infections; <b>vidarabine</b> and acyclovir for the systemic (intravenous) treatment of herpes encephalitis; acyclovir for the topical and systemic (oral) treatment of genital herpes; acyclovir for the systemic (intravenous, oral) treatment of HSV or varicella-zoster (VZV) infections in immunosuppressed patients; brivudin for the systemic (oral) treatment of HSV- 1 or VZV infections in immunosuppressed patients; and ganciclovir and foscarnet for the systemic (intravenous) treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Brivudin is also {{effective in the}} treatment of herpetic eye infections that no longer respond to idoxuridine, trifluridine, <b>vidarabine</b> or acyclovir; and foscarnet is effective {{in the treatment of}} infections with acyclovir-resistant, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) HSV or VZV mutants. Other antiviral agents considered for use in herpesvirus infections include brovavir, penciclovir (and its prodrug famciclovir), desciclovir (a prodrug of acyclovir), bishydroxymethylcyclobutylguanine (BHCG) and, in particular, 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine (HPMPC).

The relative potency of these compounds was trifluridine much greater than idoxuridine greater than <b>vidarabine</b> greater than bromovinyldeoxyuridine much greater than acyclovir. Concentrations of trifluridine and idoxuridine (0. 67 and 6. 8 microM, respectively) required to reduce plaque numbers by 50 %, {{compared with that of}} controls, were significantly lower (P less than 0. 001) than were those of other compounds. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the capacities of aciclovir to protect mice challenged intracerebrally with multiple lethal doses of type 1 herpes simplex virus and to control multiplication of this virus in the brain. With treatment initiated 12 h after inoculation and continued for 4 consecutive days, aciclovir administered subcutaneously in daily doses ranging from 40 to 100 mg/kg led to 21 -day survival rates of from 33 to 73 % and reduced virus titers by 1 to ½ × 4 logs on postchallenge day 8. The therapeutic accomplishments of the 100 -mg/kg doses of aciclovir were comparable to those of 1, 000 -mg/kg doses of <b>vidarabine</b> (9 -β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine); however, as measured by impact on body weight, aciclovir was better tolerated than <b>vidarabine</b> at these similarly effective doses...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{neurotoxic}} effects resulting from therapy with <b>vidarabine</b> are described. Both patients were undergoing treatment for cutaneously disseminated herpes zoster complicating therapy for solid malignant tumours. Both had normal renal function. The serum levels of hepatic enzymes were normal in one patient and slightly elevated in the other.
