5|$|The Tax Foundation {{determined}} that Bergen County had the third-highest median property tax burden {{in the nation}} ($8,708 <b>vs.</b> <b>a</b> New Jersey median of $6,579 and a national median of $1,917) and the fourth-highest level of property taxes {{as a percentage of}} median income (8.59% vs. 7.45% statewide and 3.03% nationally), based on an analysis of data from the 2009 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau for all 792 counties in the United States with more than 20,000 residents. As of 2010, Teaneck's effective tax rate of $2.492 per $100 of equalized value was the 12th-highest of the 70 municipalities in Bergen County, which had a countywide median effective rate of $2.115 per $100, ranging from a low of $.596 in Alpine to a high of $3.005 in Ridgefield Park.|$|E

40|$|Following {{the opinion}} {{expressed}} by Kramer in 1971, {{it is commonly}} accepted that the V. aspis complex is composed of 5 subspecies: <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> aspis (Linnaeus, 1758), <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra Meisner, 1820, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi Laurenti, 1768, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> hugyi Schinz, 1834 and <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> zinnikeri Kramer, 1958.

We had the unique opportunity to study the sample employed by Kramer to revalidate the subspecies <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra and <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi. Using Kramer’s determinations, but another set of characters, we reanalysed his sample, by applying the same statistical methods (discriminant and canonical analyses), in order to determine whether observed differences among taxa were sufficiently distinctive to warrant recognition as subspecies. The preliminary results of our morphological study allow us to admit the validity of <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi Laurenti, 1768, but also to question the subspecific rank of <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra Meisner, 1820. These conclusions agree perfectly with the results of our previous genetic study...|$|R

40|$|The asp viper, Vipera aspis, is {{distributed}} in western Europe and comprises several morphological subspecies {{other than the}} nominal form, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> aspis of northern to southern France: <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> zinnikeri, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> atra, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> francisciredi, <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> hugyi. Each form is very often distinguishable, both by dorsal colour pattern and number of ventral scales.

25|$|Variations in {{vocabulary}} also occur: {{for example}} the dialect word for ant in East Cornwall is emmet which is of Old English etymology, whereas in West Cornwall the word muryan is used. This is a word from the Cornish language spelt in the revived language (in Kernewek Kemmyn dictionaries) as muryon. There is also this pair, meaning the weakest pig of a litter: nestle-bird (sometimes nestle-drish) in East Cornwall, and (piggy-)whidden in West Cornwall. Whidden may derive from Cornish byghan (small), or gwynn (white, Late Cornish gwydn). Further, there is pajerpaw <b>vs</b> <b>a</b> four-legged emmet in West and mid-Cornwall respectively.

25|$|On Krypton, {{parallel}} evolution {{led to the}} emergence of analogous species to Terran cats, simians, birds and dogs, which were domestic companion animals as they were on Earth. As explained in his first appearance, Krypto was originally the toddler Kal-El's dog while they were on Krypton. Jor-El, testing prototypes for the rocket that would eventually send Kal-El to Earth, decided to use Krypto as a test subject. However, Krypto's rocket was knocked off-course; the rocket drifted through space for years until it eventually landed on Earth, where Krypto was reunited with the now-teenaged superhero, Superboy. Due to the environment (Earth's yellow sun and lower gravity), Krypto possessed the same powers and abilities as his master, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species, similar to an ordinary dog <b>vs.</b> <b>a</b> human. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto's (senses of smell and hearing) would be more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog's senses would be more acute than those of an ordinary human. Krypto also had super-canine intelligence (approximately human level, though with his canine traits and interests still present); the comics expressed this via the use of thought balloons indicating what Krypto was thinking.|$|E
50|$|In the past, three {{subspecies}} of V. acanthurus were recognised: The continental subspecies <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> acanthurus and <b>V.</b> <b>a.</b> brachyurus, and <b>V.</b> insulanicus, {{that only}} inhabits Groote Eylandt and {{the islands of}} the Wessel group.

25|$|A {{good example}} that {{highlights}} {{the pros and}} cons of using dynamic arrays vs. linked lists is by implementing a program that resolves the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is an election method that works by having a group of people stand in a circle. Starting at a predetermined person, you count around the circle n times. Once you reach the nth person, take them out of the circle and have the members close the circle. Then count around the circle the same n times and repeat the process, until only one person is left. That person wins the election. This shows the strengths and weaknesses of a linked list <b>vs.</b> <b>a</b> dynamic array, because if you view the people as connected nodes in a circular linked list then it shows how easily the linked list is able to delete nodes (as it only has to rearrange the links to the different nodes). However, the linked list will be poor at finding the next person to remove and will need to search through the list until it finds that person. A dynamic array, on the other hand, will be poor at deleting nodes (or elements) as it cannot remove one node without individually shifting all the elements up the list by one. However, it is exceptionally easy to find the nth person in the circle by directly referencing them by their position in the array.|$|E
