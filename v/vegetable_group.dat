The 13 C: 12 C of serum retinol (13 C: 12 C-retinol) was evaluated as a biomarker for vegetable intake in a 3 -mo dietary intervention designed to promote weight-loss by increased vegetable consumption or reduced calorie and fat intake. Subjects were 21 – 50 y of age with a BMI between 30 – 40 kg/m 2 and were enrolled from one geographic area in the US. The high <b>vegetable</b> <b>group</b> (n = 20) was encouraged to increase daily vegetable and fruit consumption to 0. 95 liter vegetables and 0. 24 – 0. 35 liter fruits.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: To determine if there are mean cost differences between all-organic foods and conventional (non-organic) foods; {{to determine if there}} are differences in the mean cost of all-organic foods among higher, moderate, and lower price grocery venues; and to determine if the mean cost difference between all-organic and conventional foods varies among higher, moderate, and lower price grocery venues. The sample included selected organic food items and their conventional counterparts at a lower price (Walmart Supercenter), moderate price (Food City) and higher price (The Fresh Market) grocery venues in Kingsport, TN. Product price and package size in ounces or fluid ounces were collected. Cost per ounce was calculated for analysis. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with two within-subjects factors was used to determine statistically significant differences. A p value [less than or equal to] 0. 05 was chosen as statistically significant. There was a significant main effect of organic status, F(1, 27) = 27. 497, p < 0. 001, for all foods e. g., food costs were significantly higher for organic foods compared with conventional foods. There was not a significant main effect of organic status in the Dairy group, F(1, 4) = 5. 779, p = 0. 074, though there was a trend towards significance since the p value was not much larger than 0. 05. There was not a significant main effect of organic status in the Fruit group, F(1, 1) = 4. 267, p = 0. 287.

There was a significant interaction between the organic status and grocery venue, F(2, 54) = 8. 633, p = 0. 001 e. g., the difference in mean food costs between organic and conventional foods was significantly different among lower price, moderate price, and higher price grocery venues. It was found that organic foods were significantly more expensive than their conventional counterparts. Organic food costs were not influenced by grocery venue. Therefore an all-organic shopper may not significantly benefit by shopping for organic food at a lower price grocery venue. The differences in food costs between organic and conventional foods, however, were significantly different among grocery venues. Perceived cost increases between conventional and organic food items may depend on a chosen grocery venue.

A community-based sample of 96 Australian adults completed a FFQ and 12 d of WFR over 12 mo. The FFQ was adapted to the Australian setting from the questionnaire used in the US Nurses' Health Study. Spearman rank correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 08 for "other vegetables" to 0. 88 for tea. Exact agreement by quartiles of intake ranged from 27 % (eggs) to 63 % (tea). Differences between FFQ and WFR regressed on personal characteristics were significantly associated with at least 1 characteristic for 20 of the 37 foods. Sex was significantly associated with differences for 17 food groups, including 5 specific <b>vegetable</b> <b>groups</b> and 2 "total" fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>groups.</b> Use of dietary supplements and the presence of a medical condition were associated with differences for 5 foods; age, school leaving age, and occupation were associated with differences for 1 - 3 foods.

40|$|Sorrel (Rumex acetosa) is a {{vegetable}} crop species {{that belongs to}} the nonconventional <b>vegetable</b> <b>group</b> in Brazil (MAPA, 2010). It is cultivated in mild climate regions from Rio Grande do Sul to Minas Gerais. The leaves are eaten fresh in salads or cooked in soups (Leone, 2009). Its origin is not known for certain but it {{is found in the}} wild in mild climate regions of Europe and Asia and is spontaneous in Portugal (Lawrence, 1973). Sorrel belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a fistulous, erect, striated stem that is frequently reddish in color, 20 - 60 cm tall and forms clumps with dozens of propagules (Lawrence, 1973; MAPA, 2010). It has a relatively high calcium oxalate content that limits consumption by people with kidney problems. In pharmacological terms, however, the plant has been indicated for treatment of jaundice, liver complaints, mouth sores and inflammation of the gallbladder (Balbach, 1992; Estrella, 1995). There is variability but the plants are fairly similar and in practice local cultivars are selected and maintained. Two types of sorrel occur spontaneously in the region of Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil, that have contrasting phenotypic characteristics known locally as Type I and Type II. Type I plants are robust and larger than Type II plants (Figure 1). The leaves are larger and wider although the other characteristics are fairly similar.

40|$|Background: The low {{vegetable}} intake {{in children}} {{may be attributed to}} their low preference for vegetables. During the first year of life, first taste preferences are formed, which may track over time. In a previous study to increase infants' vegetable intake and liking, we found that at the start of weaning, infants had a higher vegetable intake in the lab after repeated exposure to vegetable purées than to fruit purées. The current study is a follow-up of these infants at the age of 12 and 23 ¿months, and examined whether the group that started weaning with vegetables continued eating more vegetables than the group that started weaning with fruits. Methods: At 12 (n¿=¿ 86) and 23 (n¿=¿ 81) months of age the children's daily vegetable consumption was reported by their parents using a 3 -day food diary. The intake of green beans and apple purée was measured in the laboratory. Results: Reported daily intake of vegetables at 12 ¿months of age was 38 % higher (P¿=¿ 0. 02) in the <b>vegetable</b> <b>group</b> (75 ¿±¿ 43 ¿g) than in the fruit group (54 ¿±¿ 29 ¿g), but was similar for both groups at 23 ¿months of age (49 ¿±¿ 43, 57 ¿±¿ 35 ¿g, respectively; NS). Both at 12 and 23 ¿months of age, apple and green beans intake in the lab did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusion: These findings suggest that weaning exclusively with vegetables results in a higher daily vegetable consumption until at least 12 ¿months of age.

In the daily diet vegetables have been strongly associated with improvement of gastrointestinal health, good vision, and reduced risk of heart disease, stroke, chronic diseases such as diabetes, and some forms of cancer. Some phytochemicals of vegetables are strong antioxidants and are thought {{to reduce the risk}} of chronic disease by protecting against free radical damage, by modifying metabolic activation and detoxification of carcinogens, or even by influencing processes that alter the course of tumor cells. All the vegetables may offer protection to humans against chronic diseases. Nutrition is both a quantity and a quality issue, and vegetables in all their many forms ensure an adequate intake of most vitamins and nutrients, dietary fibers, and phytochemicals which can bring a much-needed measure of balance back to diets contributing to solve many of these nutrition problems.

40|$|Poster (1 page); [URL] audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to create a food taste {{database}} using an innovative in-home profile method and to have an overview on the sensory sapid world we face in our diet. The intensity of salty, sweet, acid and bitter tastes were scored using universal scales proposed within the Spectrum™ method (Muñoz and Civille, 1992) and newly developed scales for umami taste and fattiness. The in-home taste profile method was composed of two phases. The first phase consisted in an intensive training in laboratory (55 h). The second one was the in-home measurements phase (8 months) during which 12 panellists had to rate the taste and fattiness intensity of the foods they typically consumed, and to regularly report these ratings thanks to a web-based tool. The in-home taste profile method which allowed obtaining reliable data is the first contribution of this work. The second contribution is an initial food taste database containing tastes and fattiness intensities perceived in 590 foods. This database could be supplemented over time because the method was demonstrated to be reproducible. The major food items and food groups which are high-intensity vectors were identified. Moreover, the 590 foods were classified into six subsets with contrasted sensory profiles: 1 - salty-umami-fat foods; 2 -sweet foods; 3 - sweet-sour-bitter foods; 4 - bitter foods; 5 - salty-umami-sour-bitter foods; 6 - salty foods. Some usual food groups (codex alimentarius) corresponded fairly well with one of these six classes established on sensory criteria, despite the many possible recipes or cooking methods; whereas some other groups were more heterogeneous, particularly the <b>vegetable</b> <b>group.</b> These data enabled a new classification of foods based on sensory criteria (tastes and fat sensation).

40|$|Background: Health {{care workers}} need to be {{equipped}} to deal with the increasing obesity and obesity-related morbidity occurring in developing countries. Objectives: To assess weight status, eating practices and nutritional knowledge amongst nursing students at the University of Fort Hare, Eastern Cape. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted on 161 undergraduate (51 male and 110 female) students of the Department of Nursing Sciences at the University of Fort Hare. Body mass index, waist and hip circumferences and waist hip ratio were determined. Nutritional knowledge and eating practices were investigated by structured intervieweradministered questionnaires. Results: Statically, 49. 7 % were overweight or obese (58. 2 % of the females; 31. 4 % of the males) and 65. 2 % had waist circumferences putting them at risk for non-communicable diseases. Most did not meet the recommendations for intakes from the <b>vegetable</b> <b>group</b> (97. 5 % ate < 3 servings per day), the fruit group (42. 2 % ate < 2 servings per day), and the dairy group (92. 6 % ate < 2 servings per day); whilst 78. 3 % ate ≥ 4 serving per day of sugar or sweets. Most consumed margarine, oil or fat (68. 3 %), sugar (59. 0 %) and bread (55. 9 %) daily, but few reported daily intakes of vegetables (12. 4 %), fruit (23. 6 %), fruit juice (21. 2 %) and milk (15. 6 %). Fewer than 50 % knew the recommended intakes for vegetables, fruit, dairy, starchy foods and meat or meat alternatives. Conclusions: These nursing students had a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, poor eating habits and inadequate knowledge on key nutrition issues, which may impact negatively on their efficacy as future health ambassadors to the public. </p...|$|E
40|$|Context: Some {{epidemiologic}} {{studies suggest}} that elevated fruit and vegetable consumption {{is associated with a}} reduced risk of breast cancer. However, most have been case-control studies in which recall and selection bias may influence the results. Additionally, publication bias may have influenced the literature on associations for specific fruit and vegetable subgroups. Objective: To examine the association between breast cancer and total and specific fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>group</b> intakes using standardized exposure definitions. Data Sources/Study Selection: Eight prospective studies that had at least 200 incident breast cancer cases, assessed usual dietary intake, and completed a validation study of the diet assessment method or a closely related instrument were included in these analyses. Data Extraction: Using the primary data from each of the studies, we calculated study-specific relative risks (RRs) that were combined using a random-effects model. Data Synthesis: The studies included 7377 incident invasive breast cancer cases occurring among 351825 women whose diet was analyzed at baseline. For comparisons of the highest vs lowest quartiles of intake, weak, nonsignificant associations were observed for total fruits (pooled multivariate RR, 0. 93; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 86 - 1. 00; P for trend =. 08), total vegetables (RR, 0. 96; 95 % CI, 0. 89 - 1. 04; P for trend =. 54), and total fruits and vegetables (RR, 0. 93; 95 % CI, 0. 86 - 1. 00; P for trend =. 12). No additional benefit was apparent in comparisons of the highest and lowest deciles of intake. No associations were observed for green leafy vegetables, 8 botanical groups, and 17 specific fruits and vegetables. Conclusion: These results suggest that fruit and vegetable consumption during adulthood is not significantly associated with reduced breast cancer risk...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Children {{from the}} age of each person's life so that people's eating habits are formed during this period. Some studies of the {{relationship}} between TV viewing time and also how sleep quality and eating habits in children and adolescents are supported, but others do not approve of the presence of such a relationship. This study aimed to investigate the association between dietary habits and TV viewing time sleep quality in children and adolescents 10 - 18 years Minoodar Qazvin. Materials and methods: The study population of 10 - 18 year old population research center was MINOODAR. Sampling using multi-stage cluster random sampling was performed. All demographic, anthropometric and nutrition, as well as questions related to sleep quality standard questionnaire and was collected by trained personnel. Data were analyzed using spss softwareversion 16. Findings: Most of the adolescents studied food groups: grains, meat and oil more than the recommended but milk and dairy product and <b>vegetable</b> <b>group</b> were receiving less than the recommended amount. The results showed that boys compared with girls, bread and cereals (p= 0 / 005) and milk and milk products (p= 0 / 048) received more. Also, people who had low sleep quality was higher consumption of bread and cereals (p= 0 / 01). People with normal sleep omega- 3 fatty acids consumed more (p< 0 / 05). The regression analysis of sleep quality with age, gender, time of watching TV, playing video games and get the time of caffeine was no observed. Conclusions: The nutritional status of adolescents in need of reform. This study showed that eating less bread and refined grains and omega- 3 fatty acid intake may increase sleep quality in children and adolescents are more boys than girls drank milk and dairy products, so the problem of delay sleep and irregular sleep was less. Also watching TV for 2 hours a day will have no effect on quality of sleep, however, to verify the results of this study, further research is needed in this area...|$|E
40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Joan G. Fisher) Past {{research has shown that}} older adults in Northeast Georgia participating in the Older Americans Act Nutrition Program (OANP) do not consume the recommended number of servings each day of fruits and vegetables (Aspinwall 2000, Wade 2003). To address this problem, we conducted a fruit and vegetable education intervention in various Senior Centers participating in OANP throughout Georgia. Seventy-three participants completed the intervention (mean age = 76. 4 ± 1. 1 years). Food frequency questionnaires assessed participant consumption patterns of 25 fruit and vegetable groupings at pre- and post-test. A high percentage of participants reported barriers to consumption at pre-test. At post-test, increased consumption trends were evident for mean intakes of three categories of targeted fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>groups,</b> intake of targeted fruit items, and total fruit and vegetable servings per day. Intake of melon increased significantly, and more participants reported knowledge of fruits and vegetables after the intervention (p= 0. 04) ...|$|R
