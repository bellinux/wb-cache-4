40|$|A {{method of}} {{separate}} determination of two-pole sample <b>volume</b> <b>resistance</b> and contact resistance is suggested. The method is applicable to high-ohmic semiconductor samples: semi-insulating gallium arsenide, detector cadmium-zinc telluride (CZT), etc. The method {{is based on}} near-contact region illumination by monochromatic radiation of variable intensity from light emitting diodes with quantum energies exceeding the band gap of the material. It is necessary to obtain sample photo-current dependence upon light emitting diode current and to find the linear portion of this dependence. Extrapolation of this linear portion to the Y-axis gives the cut-off current. As the bias voltage is known, {{it is easy to}} calculate sample <b>volume</b> <b>resistance.</b> Then, using dark current value, one can determine the total contact resistance. The method was tested for n-type semi-insulating GaAs. The contact resistance value was shown to be approximately equal to the sample <b>volume</b> <b>resistance.</b> Thus, the influence of contacts {{must be taken into account}} when electrophysical data are analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Based on 2 -hydroxyethyl {{methacrylate}} resins formulations were developed, {{which could}} be used for the application as RFID (radio frequency identification) antenna structures. For a very fast and low cost manufacturing of these antenna structures, the process should be an offset printing or flexography printing process with an integrated curing process, here UV curing. Necessary for the antenna properties is the conductivity as high as possible. It was shown that silver filled formulations were developed, {{which could be}} fully cured by UV light and processed with offset printing and flexography. The in the offset printing process produced skips in the layer reduced the observable <b>volume</b> <b>resistance</b> to such a low value that no antenna properties could be observed, although the layers produced with a squeegee showed <b>volume</b> <b>resistance</b> up to 10 (exp - 3) Ohm/cm The flexography produced antenna structures showed a quite good <b>volume</b> <b>resistance</b> from 5 10 (exp - 4) Ohm, which means a maximum distance between emitter and receiver devices of 0. 86 m The presented formulations together with the printing processes make a cheaper and quicker production of the RFID antennas possible and therefore a big step for a broader application of this technology is done.

40|$|Development of orthostatic {{hypotension}} {{and intolerance}} in astronauts who return to earth following a spaceflight mission represents a significant operational concern to NASA. Reduced plasma <b>volume,</b> vascular <b>resistance,</b> and baroreflex responsiveness following exposure to actual and ground-based analogs of microgravity {{have been associated}} with orthostatic instability, suggesting that these mechanisms may contribute alone or in combination to compromise of blood pressure regulation after spaceflight. It therefore seems reasonable that development of procedures designed to reverse or restore the effects of microgravity on regulatory mechanisms of blood <b>volume,</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> and cardiac function should provide some protection against postflight orthostatic intolerance. Several investigations have provided evidence that a single bout of exhaustive dynamic exercise enhances functions of mechanisms responsible for blood pressure stability.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The growing demand in portable and compact consumer devices and appliances {{has resulted in the}} need for the miniaturisation of electronic components. These miniaturised electronic components are sensitive and susceptible to damage by voltages as low as 20 V. Electrically conductive styrenic thermoplastics are widely used in electronic packaging applications to protect these sensitive electronic components against electro-static discharge (ESD) during manufacturing, assembly, storage and shipping. Such ESD applications often require the optimal <b>volume</b> <b>resistance</b> range of ≥ 1. 0 x 105 to < 1. 0 x 108 Ω. The best known method to render styrenic thermoplastics conductive is by the incorporation of conductive fillers, such as carbon black but the main limitation is the difficulty in controlling the conductivity level due to the steep percolation curve. Thus the aim of this research is to develop electrically conductive styrenic thermoplastics by blending several styrenic resins with polymeric conductive additives to achieve optimal <b>volume</b> <b>resistance</b> range for ESD applications with the ease in controlling the conductivity level.
