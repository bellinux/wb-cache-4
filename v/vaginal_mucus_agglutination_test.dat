40|$|Four {{groups of}} ten heifers {{were used to}} study {{the effect of a}} {{commercial}} Vibrio fetus bacterin on the development of <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> <b>agglutination</b> (VMA) reactions and subsequent reproductive performance in the presence of active V. fetus infection. Two groups were vaccinated and one of these was infected one month later. The other two groups were not vaccinated and one of these was infected. It was found that in the absence of infection the bacterin did not produce diagnostically significant VMA reactions but in the presence of infection reactions comparable with the control group were detected. The infected control group required 4. 9 services per conception, the first service-conception interval was 126. 9 days and 50 per cent of the animals aborted. The corresponding figures in the infected vaccinates were 3. 5 services, 68. 9 days and 12. 5 per cent abortions. It was concluded that although this bacterin has a beneficial effect on reproductive performance in the presence of genital vibrosis, maximum breeding efficiency will not be obtained unless V. fetus infection is eliminated. Persistent local reactions appeared at the site of inoculation in the majority of the vaccinated animals...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} the interactions involved in bacterial adherence {{and the role of}} mucus in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections, we developed a system to study the binding of a recombinant Escherichia coli strain, HB 101 /pWRS 1 - 17, expressing type 1 pili, to <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> collected from 28 women. Bacteria bound to differing extents to all specimens examined, and preincubation of bacteria with mannose inhibited binding by 50 to 89 %. Additionally, all mucus samples showed reactivity with anti-mannose antibody, and the levels of reactivity correlated with the levels of bacterial binding, suggesting that the mannose-terminal saccharides present on these glycoproteins are the receptors for the binding of type 1 -piliated bacteria. Mucus specimens collected over periods of 5 days and 12 weeks exhibited significant variation in bacterial binding, indicating temporal differences in the ability of <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> to act as a receptor for type 1 -piliated E. coli.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of repeated oronasal treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the humoral immune responses in saliva, <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus,</b> and the plasma markers of the acute phase response in periparturient dairy cows. One hundred pregnant Holstein cows were administered either 3 increasing doses of LPS (n =  50) as follows: 1) 0. 01 µg/kg body weight (BW) on d - 28, 2) 0. 05 µg/kg BW on d - 25, and - 21, and 3) 0. 1 µg/kg BW on d - 18, and - 14, or sterile saline solution (controls; n =  50) oronasally for 3 consecutive wk starting at 28 d before parturition. Intensive sampling was conducted on thirty cows (n =  15 /group). Multiple saliva, <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> and blood samples were collected around parturition and analyzed for total immunoglobulin-(Ig) A, plasma serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), anti-LPS IgA, IgG, IgM, tumour necrosis factor(TNF) -α, and interleukin(IL) - 1. Results regarding total secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies showed greater concentrations in the saliva and an overall tendency for higher total sIgA in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> of the LPS-treated cows.

Treatments by time interactions were observed for SAA and IL- 1 with lowered concentrations of both variables in the plasma of LPS-treated cows after parturition. Overall, repeated oronasal LPS treatment clearly enhanced total sIgA antibodies in the saliva, stimulated their production in <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> shortly before calving, and lowered plasma IL- 1 around parturition, but showed limited effects on markers of the acute phase response in the plasma in dairy cows around parturition...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhile {{shedding}} {{routes of}} Coxiella burnetii are identified, {{the characteristics of}} Coxiella shedding are still widely unknown, especially in dairy cattle. However, this information is crucial to assess the natural course of Coxiella burnetii infection within a herd and then to elaborate strategies to limit the risks of transmission between animals and to humans. The present study aimed at (i) describing the characteristics of Coxiella burnetii shedding by dairy cows (in milk, <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus,</b> faeces) in five infected dairy herds, and at (ii) investigating the possible relationships between shedding patterns and serological responses. A total of 145 cows were included in a follow-up consisting of seven concomitant samplings of milk, <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus,</b> faeces and blood (Day 0, D 7, D 14, D 21, D 28, D 63, D 90). Detection and quantification of Coxiella burnetii titres were performed in milk, <b>vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> and faeces samples using real-time PCR assay, while antibodies against Coxiella were detected using an ELISA technique. For a given shedding route, and a given periodicity (weekly or monthly), cows were gathered into different shedding kinetic patterns according to the sequence of PCR responses. Distribution of estimated titres in Coxiella burnetii was described according to shedding kinetic patterns. Coxiella burnetii shedding was found scarcely and sporadically in faeces. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>mucus</b> shedding concerned almost 50 % of the cows studied and was found intermittently or sporadically, depending on the periodicity considered. Almost 40 % of cows were detected as milk shedders, with two predominant shedding patterns: persistent and sporadic, regardless of the sampling periodicity. Significantly higher estimated titres in Coxiella burnetii were observed in cows with persistent shedding patterns suggesting the existence of heavy shedder cows. These latter cows were mostly, persistently highly-seropositive, suggesting that repeated serological testings could be a reliable tool to screen heavy shedders, before using PCR assays...|$|R

40|$|Background: Single Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> {{rather than}} blood culture, is {{commonly}} employed to diagnose typhoid fever in Nigeria. We took {{another look at}} the Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> as a preferred option for diagnosis of typhoid fever by determining the specificity and sensitivity of Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> in febrile adult patients. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and seventy-one blood samples from consecutive adults (> 18 years) with febrile illness attending the General Practice Clinic of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital were tested using the Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> blood culture, and malaria parasite test on each sample to establish the diagnosis of typhoid fever. Results: Of the 271 blood samples 124 (45. 76 %) were positive following a Widal <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> 60 (22. 10 %) blood samples grew Salmonella organisms on blood culture while 55 (20. 29 %) blood samples showed a co-infection of typhoid fever and malaria.

Cross reaction studies and investigation of 102 control children to determine specificity of <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for serotype. SETTING [...] General medical ward of Medical Research Council laboratories, The Gambia. PATIENTS [...] 101 Gambian children aged between 2 months and 10 years admitted with severe pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS [...] Serum samples were boiled and treated with edetic acid, and urine samples were boiled and concentrated 25 times before testing. END POINT [...] A latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> specific for the serotype of pneumococcal antigen that is sensitive and highly specific for detecting pneumococcus in the urine of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia.

Thus, both selective use of membrane-bound antigens and their fixation are important for serodiagnosis of TE in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The {{cerebrospinal}} fluid {{of a patient}} yielded a positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> for Neisseria meningitidis groups A and Y. The latex agglutination results were not consistent with clinical and other laboratory findings. An investigation determined that the positive <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was caused by contamination of the {{cerebrospinal fluid}} with povidone-iodine during the lumbar puncture...|$|R
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} the Pastorex aspergillus antigen latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> for {{the diagnosis of}} invasive aspergillosis in patients undergoing liver or bone marrow transplantation. METHODS [...] Serum samples were taken at least twice weekly post-transplant and tested for Aspergillus antigen. Latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> results were compared with microbiological examination of respiratory, urine and bile specimens. Serum samples from liver transplant patients were also tested for antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus by counter immunoelectrophoresis. RESULTS [...] Eight of the 91 patients studied developed invasive aspergillosis. Positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained in eight of 187 (4. 3 %) serum samples from four of these eight patients. The other four patients with invasive aspergillosis gave consistently negative latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests.</b> A positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> was the first indication of invasive aspergillosis in two patients; these patients were already on amphotericin B. Positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were the only evidence of invasive aspergillosis in one patient who subsequently died of the infection. False positive latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> were obtained in five of 83 (6 %) patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis and misleading positive cultures seen in nine of 83 (10. 8 %). No antibodies were detected in three of four liver transplant patients with invasive aspergillosis. Conversely, antibodies were detected in 63 of 262 (24 %) serum samples from 43 liver transplant patients with no evidence of invasive aspergillosis; one of these patients had an antibody titre of 1 : 2 on four separate occasions. CONCLUSIONS [...] The Pastorex aspergillus antigen latex <b>agglutination</b> <b>test,</b> when used alone, lacks sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. A diagnosis was made in all patients with invasive aspergillosis when both culture and antigen tests were performed although using these criteria a false positive diagnosis would {{have been made in}} 13 of 83 (15. 6 %) patients. Microbiological and serial serological investigations for antigen should both be performed and the results considered in conjunction with radiological and clinical evidence...|$|R
