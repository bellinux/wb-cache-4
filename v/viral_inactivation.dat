The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to <b>viral</b> <b>inactivation</b> procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%.

40|$|AbstractThe viral {{infectivity}} factor gene (vif) of HIV- 1 increases the infectivity of <b>viral</b> particles by <b>inactivation</b> of cellular anti-viral factors, and supports productive viral replication in primary human CD 4 T cells and in certain non-permissive T cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that Vif {{also contributes to}} the arrest of HIV- 1 infected cells in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. Viruses deleted in Vif or Vpr induce less cell cycle arrest than wild-type virus, while cells infected with HIV- 1 deleted in both Vif and Vpr have a cell cycle profile equivalent to that of uninfected cells. Furthermore, expression of Vif alone induces accumulation of cells in the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. These data demonstrate a novel role for Vif in cell cycle regulation and suggest that Vif and Vpr independently drive G 2 arrest in HIV- 1 infected cells. Our results may have implications for the actions and interactions of key HIV- 1 accessory proteins in AIDS pathogenesis...|$|R

In the present work, we took a global approach, examining the relative contributions of each of these processes in a complex system composed of groundwater, Poliovirus 1, and a hydrophobic container (polypropylene) maintained in a dark environment at 20 °C. We demonstrated that infectious viral load fell off 2. 8 log 10 during the first 20 days. During this time, adhesion was far from negligible because it accounted for most of the decline, 1. 5 log 10.

In uterine-cervix carcinomas, where high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) plays an important role, pRb and p 53 are inactivated by E 7 and E 6 viral oncoproteins, respectively. However, little is known about the in situ expression of some of these proteins in pre-malignant and malignant cervical tissues. On the other hand, it has also been demonstrated that c-myc is involved in cervical carcinogenesis, and that pRb participates in the control of c-myc gene expression. By using immunostaining techniques, we investigated pRb immunodetection pattern in normal tissues, squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and invasive carcinomas from the uterine cervix. Our data show low pRb detection in both normal cervical tissue and invasive lesions, but a higher expression in SILs. C-Myc protein was observed in most of the cellular nuclei of the invasive lesions, while in SILs was low.

However, transfusion of blood components remains unsafe. Therefore, detecting and reporting transfusion-related complications are still essential means for both the patients’ management and the public health approach, since these measures help to adjust preventive measures to be applied in a haemovigilance purpose. Most acute transfusion-related complications occur within minutes or hours after transfusion and require urgent medical care; delayed transfusion reactions may also develop days, even months later, implying a longer follow-up. Transfusion of red blood cells is not infrequent during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Symptoms of acute transfusion-related reactions include hypotension, diffuse bleeding, hemoglobinuria and oliguria. These symptoms are identical to those that can be observed during a complicated cardiopulmonary bypass. Consequently, identification of acute transfusion-related reactions in this particular situation is quite difficult and probably leads to an under-reporting of their occurrence. In this paper, we explore how to track acute transfusion-related reactions during cardiopulmonary bypass.

Lentivirus vectors pseudotyped with the baculovirus envelope protein GP 64 {{have been shown to}} acquire more potent resistance to serum inactivation and longer transgene expression than those pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) envelope protein G. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to serum inactivation in pseudotype particles bearing the GP 64 have not been precisely elucidated. In this study, we generated pseudotype and recombinant VSVs bearing the GP 64. Recombinant VSVs generated in human cell lines exhibited the incorporation of human DAF in viral particles and were resistant to serum inactivation, whereas those generated in insect cells exhibited no incorporation of human DAF and were sensitive to complement inactivation. The GP 64 and human DAF were detected on the detergent-resistant membrane and were coprecipitated by immunoprecipitation analysis. A pseudotype VSV bearing GP 64 produced in human DAF knockdown cells reduced resistance to serum inactivation. In contrast, recombinant baculoviruses generated in insect cells expressing human DAF or carrying the human DAF gene exhibited resistance to complement inactivation. These results suggest that the incorporation of human DAF into viral particles by interacting with baculovirus GP 64 is involved in the acquisition of resistance to serum inactivation...|$|R

We have fused Staphylococcus nuclease (SN) to the C-terminal end of Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag and demonstrated that expression of this fusion protein in chronically infected chicken embryo fibroblasts resulted in its incorporation into virions and subsequent inactivation of the virus particles by degradation of viral RNA. Release of particles incorporating Gag-SN fusion proteins into the extracellular milieu activates the nuclease and results in destruction of the virion from within. By comparing the effects of incorporated SN and SN*, an enzymatically inactive missense mutant form of SN, on the infectivity of virus particles, we have clearly demonstrated that nucleolytic activity is the antiviral mechanism.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{retinoblastoma}} protein (Rb) plays {{a central role}} in the regulation of cell cycle, differentiation and apoptosis. In cancer cells, ablation of Rb function or its pathway is a consequence of genetic <b>inactivation,</b> <b>viral</b> oncoprotein binding or deregulated hyperphosphorylation. Some recent data suggest that Rb relocation could also account for the regulation of its tumor suppressor activity, as is the case for other tumor suppressor proteins, such as p 53. Results In this reported study, we present evidence that a fraction of the total amount of Rb protein can localize to the mitochondria in proliferative cells taken from both rodent and human cells. This result is also supported by the use of Rb siRNAs, which substantially reduced the amount of mitochondrial Rb, and by acellular assays, in which [35 S]-Methionine-labeled Rb proteins bind strongly to mitochondria isolated from rat liver. Moreover, endogenous Rb is found in an internal compartment of the mitochondria, within the inner-membrane. This is consistent with the protection of Rb from alkaline treatment, which destroys any interaction of proteins that are weakly bound to mitochondria. Conclusion Although a few data regarding an unspecific cytosolic localization of Rb protein have been reported for some tumor cells, our results are the first evidence of a mitochondrial localization of Rb. The mitochondrial localization of Rb is observed in parallel with its classic nuclear location and paves the way for the study of potential as-yet-unknown roles of Rb at this site. </p...|$|R

The <b>inactivation</b> of single genes was monitored by measuring {{the reduction in the}} accumulation of viral gene products in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the accumulation of viral polypeptides in infected cells was measured after reversal of a cycloheximide treatment designed to inhibit secondary transcription. Actinomycin D and a hypertonic medium were used to decrease selectively the synthesis of host cell polypeptides in infected cells. In vitro, mRNA's synthesized by irradiated viruses were analyzed by translation in cell-free systems under conditions in which the amount of each polypeptide synthesized reflected the relative abundance of the corresponding mRNA. UV target sizes were obtained for the genes coding for the HN, F 0, NP, M, L, and P polypeptides; the 47, 000 -dalton protein was not detected. A comparison of the UV target sizes with the corresponding gene sizes suggested that transcription of these genes initiated at a single promotor and proceeded in the order NP, P, (F 0, M), HN, L. These experiments were performed with Newcastle disease virus strains Australia-Victoria and B 1 -Hitchner; for both strains, two forms of the P polypeptide which differed in electrophoretic mobility were detected. Proof that the P protein is virus specific was obtained.

Both poliovirus and rhinovirus are stable to high pressure at room temperature, because pressures up to 2. 4 kbar are not enough to promote <b>viral</b> disassembly and <b>inactivation.</b> Within the same pressure range, FMDV particles are dramatically affected by pressure, with a loss of infectivity of more than 4 log units observed. The dissociation of polio and rhino viruses can be observed only under pressure (2. 4 kbar) at low temperatures in the presence of subdenaturing concentrations of urea (1 – 2 M). The pressure and low temperature data reveal clear differences in stability among the three picornaviruses, FMDV being the most sensitive, polio being the most resistant, and rhino having intermediate stability. Whereas rhino and poliovirus differ little in stability (less than 10 kcal/mol at 0 °C), the difference in free energy between these two viruses and FMDV was remarkable (more than 200 kcal/mol of particle). These differences are crucial to understanding the different factors that control the assembly and disassembly of the virus particles during their life cycle. The inactivation of these viruses by pressure (combined or not with low temperature) has potential as a method for producing vaccines...|$|R
