25|$|The {{question}} of {{priority for the}} <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and {{because he did not}} contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.|$|E
25|$|The Mini Cooper S won the Monte Carlo Rally in 1964, 1965 and 1967.

25|$|Currents induced {{into this}} winding provide the rotor {{magnetic}} field. The {{shape of the}} rotor bars determines the speed-torque characteristics. At low speeds, the current induced in the squirrel cage is nearly at line frequency and tends {{to be in the}} outer parts of the rotor cage. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency becomes lower, and more current is in the interior of the winding. By shaping the bars to change the resistance of the winding portions in the interior and outer parts of the cage, effectively a <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> is inserted in the rotor circuit. However, the majority of such motors have uniform bars.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{original}} 1971 definition, the memristor was the fourth fundamental circuit element, forming a non-linear relationship between electric charge and magnetic flux linkage. In 2011 Chua argued for a broader definition that included all 2-terminal non-volatile memory devices based on resistance switching. Williams argued that MRAM, phase change memory and RRAM were memristor technologies. Some researchers argued that biological structures such as blood and skin fit the definition. Others argued that the memory device under development by HP Labs {{and other forms of}} RRAM were not memristors but rather part of a broader class of <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> systems and that a broader definition of memristor is a scientifically unjustifiable land grab that favored HP's memristor patents.|$|E
2500|$|When Gray {{applied for}} a patent for the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> {{telephone}} transmitter, the Patent Office determined [...] "while Gray was undoubtedly the first to conceive of and disclose the (<b>variable</b> <b>resistance)</b> invention, as in his caveat of 14 February 1876, his failure to take any action amounting to completion until others had demonstrated {{the utility of the}} invention deprives him of the right to have it considered." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{valuable}} claims in Bell's 1876 [...] was claim 4, {{a method of}} producing variable electric current in a circuit by varying the resistance in the circuit. That feature was not shown in any of Bell's patent drawings, but was shown in Elisha Gray's drawings in his caveat filed the same day, February 14, 1876. A description of the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> feature, consisting of seven sentences, was inserted into Bell's application. That it was inserted is not disputed. But when it was inserted is a controversial issue. Bell testified that he wrote the sentences containing the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> feature before January 18, 1876, [...] "almost at the last moment" [...] before sending his draft application to his lawyers. A book by Evenson argues that the seven sentences and claim 4 were inserted, without Bell's knowledge, just before Bell's application was hand carried to the Patent Office by one of Bell's lawyers on February 14, 1876.|$|E

The {{objective is to}} reduce torque fluctuations and flicker emission by using a <b>variable</b> rotor <b>resistance.</b> However, the rotor resistance can only be varied within a limited range.

2500|$|Early {{examples}} of a rheostat dimmer include a salt water dimmer or liquid rheostat; the liquid between a movable and fixed contact provided a <b>variable</b> <b>resistance.</b> [...] The closer the contacts to each other, the [...] more voltage was available for the light. [...] Salt water dimmers [...] required regular addition of water and maintenance due to corrosion; exposed parts were energized during operation, presenting a shock hazard.|$|E
2500|$|Memristor {{resistance}} {{depends on}} the integral of the input applied to the terminals (rather than on the instantaneous value of the input as in a varistor). Since the element [...] "remembers" [...] the amount of current that last passed through, it was tagged by Chua with the name [...] "memristor". Another way of describing a memristor is as any passive two-terminal circuit element that maintains a functional relationship between the time integral of current (called charge) and the time integral of voltage (often called flux, as it is related to magnetic flux). The slope of this function is called the memristance M and is similar to <b>variable</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the article}} [...] "The Missing Memristor has Not been Found", {{published}} in Scientific Reports in 2015 by Vongehr and Meng, {{it was shown}} that the real memristor defined in 1971 is not possible without using magnetic induction. This was illustrated by constructing a mechanical analog of the memristor and then analytically showing that the mechanical memristor cannot be constructed without using an inertial mass. As {{it is well known}} that the mechanical equivalent of an electrical inductor is mass, it proves that memristors are not possible without using magnetic induction. Thus, it can be argued that the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> devices, such as the RRAMs, and the conceptual memristors may have no equivalence at all.|$|E

Active filters {{can be made}} to behave as <b>variable</b> <b>resistances</b> and/or inductances when they are connected in power systems; and the operating condition of the complete system can be adjusted dynamically to damp resonance. The effect of the hybrid filter configuration and the control strategy has been evaluated on the resonance damping, as well as harmonic filtering. The frequency characteristics of three parallel hybrid filters topologies are discussed. The principles are validated by simulation and key time-domain results are presented...|$|R
2500|$|To {{the extent}} that the input bias {{currents}} do not match, there will be an effective input offset voltage present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op amp offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., [...] "offset null" [...] or [...] "balance" [...] pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external voltage can be added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.|$|E
2500|$|In the past, {{one or more}} {{vacuum tubes}} were {{commonly}} used as the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance.</b> Modern designs use one or more transistors instead, perhaps within an integrated circuit. Linear designs {{have the advantage of}} very [...] "clean" [...] output with little noise introduced into their DC output, but are most often much less efficient and unable to step-up or invert the input voltage like switched supplies. All linear regulators require a higher input than the output. If the input voltage approaches the desired output voltage, the regulator will [...] "drop out". The input to output voltage differential at which this occurs is known as the regulator's drop-out voltage. Low-dropout regulators (LDOs) allow an input voltage that can be much lower (i.e., they waste less energy than conventional linear regulators).|$|E

40|$|We show that, in {{tantalum}} oxide resistive memories, activation power {{provides a}} multi-level variable for information storage {{that can be}} set and read separately from the resistance. These two state <b>variables</b> (<b>resistance</b> and activation power) can be precisely controlled in two steps: (1) the possible activation power states are selected by partially reducing resistance, then (2) a subsequent partial increase in resistance specifies the resistance state and the final activation power state. We show that these states can be precisely written and read electrically, making this approach potentially amenable for ultra-high density memories.
