40|$|Powdered {{vulcanized}} rubber waste generated {{in a factory}} was examined as a compounding additive in natural rubber compounds and in blends of natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. The cure characteristics were evaluat-ed with the Monsanto Oscillating Disc Rheometer while tensile sheets were prepared and stress-strain measurements in simple extension were used to characterize the mechanical properties of the vulcanized elastomers. In all the vulcanizates examined, the incorporation of rubber waste resulted in a slight deterioration of properties. The deterioration of properties is attributed tQ the poor interfacial bonding between the rubber waste and the virgin matrix elastomer.

30|$|In {{the present}} work, we report {{the effect of}} both {{uncoated}} and silica-coated nano CaCO 3 as filler on the property enhancement of CR nanocomposites. Actually, the silanol group of silica can able to produce strong interaction with highly electronegative chlorine atom of CR [24, 25]. This interaction occurs through hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen atom of silanol group which has a locally positive charge and chlorine atom of CR which has a locally negative charge [25]. Thus, silica coating {{on the surface of}} nano CaCO 3 will be an interesting approach to improve rubber–filler interaction of nano CaCO 3 -based CR composites. The {{purpose of this study is}} not just to report the property enhancement of CR composites in the presence of nano CaCO 3, but also to determine the efficiency of silica coating in improving the dispersion of nano CaCO 3 within the CR matrix and promoting the <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties</b> of CR nanocomposites.|$|E
40|$|Polar {{functionality}} attached onto {{natural rubber}} {{has a significant}} impact on the reinforcing efficiency of silica. Parallel studies involving various levels of epoxidation on natural rubber (ENR) in the absence of bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT) coupling agent, as well as a combination of ENRs with different loadings of TESPT, provide a better understanding of the various factors that influence the properties of silica-filled ENR compounds. Based on the overall properties, the best possible combination to optimize processability, to reduce filler–filler interaction, and improve vulcanization rate as well as <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties,</b> is to use ENR with an epoxide content in the range of 20 – 30 mol%, together with a small portion of TESPT, that is, 2 – 4 wt% relative to the silica content. This leads to a reduction of approximately 60 – 80 % of TESPT when compared with the conventional NR compounds, where the optimal loading of TESPT was 9. 0 wt% relative to the silica content...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Zinc butyl {{xanthate}} [Zn(bxt) 2] {{was prepared}} in the laboratory. The {{effect of this}} xanthate with zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate (ZDC) on the vulcanization of natu-ral rubber (NR), polybutadiene rubber (BR), and NR/BR blend has been studied at different temperatures. The amounts of Zn (bxt) 2 and ZDC in the compounds were opti-mized by varying the amount of ZDC from 0. 75 to 1. 5 phr and Zn (bxt) 2 from 0. 75 to 1. 5 phr. The cure characteristics were also studied. HAF filled NR, BR, and NR /BR blend compounds were cured at different temperatures from 60 to 150 C. The sheets were molded and properties such as ten-sile strength, tear strength, crosslink density and elongation at break, compression set, abrasion resistance, etc. were evaluated. The {{results show that the}} mechanical properties of 80 NR/ 20 BR blends are closer to that of NR <b>vulcanizates,</b> <b>properties</b> of 60 NR/ 40 BR blends are closer to BR vulcani-zates, while the 70 NR/ 30 BR blends show an intermediat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{essence of}} this {{research}} paper is to gauge the effect of particle size and particle size distribution of filler on rubber compounds. It also involves the comparison {{of the level of}} reinforcement and gauge the possibility of utilizing the low cost locally sourced filler [(rice husk and wood flour) with a commercial filler calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) ] as an alternative material in rubber compounding. Thus, the use of rice husk and wood flour as filler will in no doubt promote self employment among the teaming unemployed youths thereby reducing poverty and creating wealth for the people. Test like moisture content, pH, ash content, hardness resistance, abrasion resistance, compression set and flex fatigue were subsequently carried out on the <b>vulcanizate.</b> These <b>properties</b> were compared with that of CaCO 3 filled vulcanizate. The result reveals that at 212 um, rice husk has hardness resistance of 50 (IRHD) and flex resistance 8690 rpm and wood flour has better hardness resistance of 57 (IRHD), flex fatigue resistance of 10955 rpm (yet to fail) and abrasion resistance o...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the effect of {{conductive}} carbon black (Ensaco 350 G) on the physico-mechanical and electrical properties of chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM) rubber <b>vulcanizates.</b> The physico-mechanical <b>properties</b> like tensile strength, tear strength, elongation at break, compression set, hardness and abrasion resistance have been studied before and after heat ageing. Up to 30 parts per hundred rubber (phr) filler loading both tensile and tear strength increases beyond which it {{shows a decreasing trend}} whereas modulus gradually increases with the filler loading. Incorporation of carbon black increases the hysteresis loss of filled vulcanizates compared to gum vulcanizates. Unlike gum vulcanizate, in filled vulcanizates the rate of relaxation shows increasing trend. The bound rubber content is found to increase with increase in filler loading. Dielectric relaxation spectra were used to study the relaxation behavior as a function of frequency (100 to 106 Hz) at room temperature. Variation in real and imaginary parts of electric modulus has been explained on the basis of interfacial polarization of fillers in the polymer medium. The percolation limit of the conductive black as studied by ac conductivity measurements has also been reported...|$|R
40|$|ETHACURE&reg; 300 Curative is a high-performance, liquid {{curative}} {{being developed}} {{especially for the}} polyurethane cast elastomer industry. Testing shows that ETHACURE 300 Curative is less toxic than MOCA. MOCA [methyl-enebis(ortho-chloroaniline) ] is {{the most commonly used}} curative for TDI based prepolymers but its use has come under increased regulatory scrutiny in recent years. ETHACURE 300 Curative represents new technology and was designed from the beginning to meet selected targets including that of a safe "drop-in" MOCA replacement. This presentation introduces ETHACURE 300 Curative in terms of chemical and physical nature, processing characteristics, and <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties.</b> Advantages of ETHACURE 300 Curative over current commercial curatives, including MOCA, will also be discussed. ETHACURE 300 Curative is a mononuclear aromatic diamine. Toxicological tests to date show it to be both non-mutagenic and non-irritating. This together with the fact that ETHACURE 300 Curative is a liquid will be welcome news to the polyurethane processor. A room temperature liquid curative allows sig...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{experimentally}} {{monitored the}} physical and mechanical properties of natural rubber/car-bon black/reclaimed rubber blends vulcanized by micro-wave (MW) irradiation and conventional thermal (CT) sys-tems, and the curing mechanisms are addressed in conjunc-tion with the <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties.</b> The microwave oven for rubber blend vulcanization was specially designed and constructed in this work. The results suggested that the tensile modulus and the hardness of the vulcanizates could be enhanced by increasing the reclaimed rubber (RR) con-tent, whereas the tensile stress, elongation at break, and tear strength decreased with the RR loading. The mechanical properties of the vulcanizates from the CT method were higher than those from the MW method. The vulcanizates from the MW method had higher resistance to toluene pen-etration than those from the CT method. The differences in {{the properties of the}} vulcanizates from the CT and MW methods became smaller at higher RR contents. The sensi-tivity in property changes of the vulcanizates due to addi-tion of the RR content was greater for the CT method than for the MW method. The differences in the results between these two curing systems could be explained in terms of the density and the types of crosslinks present in the vulcani...|$|E
40|$|The rubber {{formulation}} plays {{a significant}} role in the properties of NR compounds filled with silica. In this work, the influences of various silicas, silane coupling agents and diphenylguanidine (DPG) on the properties of compounds and vulcanizates, i. e. cure characteristics, Mooney viscosity, flocculation kinetics, bound rubber content, Payne effect, tan δ at 60 °C, tensile and tear properties are investigated. The results demonstrate that compound viscosity and curing behavior, as well as <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties</b> of the silica-filled NR are much improved by incorporating silane coupling agents. Bis-triethoxysilylpropyltetrasulfide (TESPT) clearly gives better overall properties than the disulfide-based silane (TESPD), except for scorch safety. DPG acts as a synergist to sulfenamide primary accelerators, as well as activator for the silanization reaction. Highly dispersible (HD) silicas can significantly enhance the degree of dispersion, and so lead to higher filler-rubber interaction. As a consequence, the HD silicas provide better dynamic and mechanical properties for filled NR vulcanizates compared to conventional (CV) counterparts. The optimal quantities of both, silane coupling agent and DPG, required in the formulation are correlated to the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) specific surface area of the silicas. Furthermore, the results reveal that the silica structure as characterized by the dibutylphthalate (DBP) adsorption also strongly influences the reinforcing efficienc...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of zinc oxide (ZnO) as an activator for the sulfur vulcanization of rubbers enhances the vulcanization efficiency and <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties</b> {{and reduces the}} vulcanization time. The {{first part of this}} article deals with the reduction and optimization of the amount of ZnO. Two different rubbers, solution-styrene-butadiene rubber and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, have been selected for this study. The results demonstrate that the curing and physical properties can be retained when the level of ZnO (Red Seal) is reduced to 1 or 2 phr, respectively. Of particular interest is nano-ZnO, characterized by a nanoscale particle distribution. The cure characteristics indicate that with nano-ZnO, a reduction of zinc by a factor of 10 can be obtained. In the second part, model compound vulcanization is introduced to investigate the effects of ZnO during the different stages of vulcanization. Experiments are described with two models, squalene and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -butene, both with benzothiazolesulfenamide-accelerated vulcanization systems. The results demonstrate the influence of ZnO during the different stages of the vulcanization. With ZnO present, a marked decrease can be observed in the sulfur concentration during an early stage of vulcanization, along with a slight delay in the disappearance of the crosslink precursor. The crosslinked product distribution is influenced as well...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The present work was carried out to study the properties of both natural rubber composites reinforced by short polyaramid fibres and natural rubber laminates reinforced by filament polyaramid. Initial work was concentrated to obtain a suitable direct bonding agent and curing system for high modulus nylon 6, 6 which {{was used as the}} control fibre. Two different types of bonding and curing systems were established as useful for bonding polyaramid to rubbers namely resorcinol-hexamethylene tetraminesilica (HRH) and sulphur, and a blocked diisocyanate in conjunction with a diurethane-crosslinker. Each system was found to offer a different type of adhesion, the HRH formed physical bonds and the NCO/urethane chemical links between fibre and rubber. When the proportions of these bonding agents were optimised in the NR rubber compound <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties</b> were significantly improved. Investigation established that for polyaramid fibres the optimum aspect ratio of approximately 1250 was found to give maximum composite reinforcement as judged by the tensile properties of the composite. The experimentally found optimum of 4 parts of blocked diisocyanate was used for extensive investigations of composites properties with respect to fibre orientation and content. Further studies on composites with polyaramid short fibres demonstrated the necessity to optimize the proportions of blocked diisocyanate in the composite to achieve maximum strength properties, e. g. unoptimised with 30...|$|E

The amounts of the added cyclis rubber were varied from 10 to 40 phr with range of 10 phr. The rubber carpet compound was produced by using a two roll-mills (Shanghai RMW, model XK- 160, capacity 2 kg). The culcanizate properties of rubber carpet compound were tested base on SNI. 12 - 1000 - 1989 for karpet karet, and ASTM F. 1859 - 2000 for rubber sheet floor covering without backing The results showed that cyclis rubber in the compound was focused as a filler.

40|$|International audienceFluoropolymers are {{well-known}} for their good properties {{in terms of}} chemical, thermal and electrical stabilities, inertness to acids, bases, solvents and oils, and high resistance to ageing and oxidation. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is useful as a homopolymer endowed with interesting characteristics. It contains a high crystallinity rate, but is base sensitive. In addition, VDF can be co- or terpolymerized with several fluorinated monomers, rendering them suitable as elastomers and various examples of synthesis of VDF-copolymers are also presented. This review also focusses on binary and tertiary systems containing VDF. Several curing systems for these VDFcontaining copolymers have been investigated, especially diamines and their derivatives, aromatic polyhydroxy compounds, peroxides with coagents, such as triallylisocyanurate, radiations, and thiol-ene systems. The best <b>vulcanizate</b> <b>properties</b> are obtained by a two-step process. First, the material is press cured at different times and temperatures, then, it is post cured in air or under nitrogen at higher temperature and time, and under atmospheric pressure. Poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymers can react with primary, secondary or tertiary monoamines, but they are mainly crosslinked by diamines such as hexamethylene diamine (HMDA), their carbamates (HMDA-C), and derivatives. A mechanism of crosslinking is identified by Infrared and 19 F NMR spectroscopies, and was evidenced to proceed in three main steps. First, a VDF unit undergoes a dehydrofluorination {{in the presence of}} the diamine, then the Michael addition occurs onto the double bonds to form crosslinking, while HF is eliminated from crosslinks in the presence of HF scavengers. The crosslinking mechanism with bisphenols takes place also in three main steps (dehydrofluorination, then substitution of a fluorine atom by a bisphenol, and elimination of HF) ...|$|E
