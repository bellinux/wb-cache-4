5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} <b>Vedette</b> under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca <b>Vedette</b> Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca <b>Vedette</b> Versailles and, {{at the top of}} the range, the Simca <b>Vedette</b> Régence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The <b>Vedette</b> range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model caught on, Simca was able to increase production from the 150daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250cars a day.|$|E
5|$|Simca {{acquired}} the Poissy factory from Ford France (Ford Société Anonyme Française, the French {{subsidiary of the}} Ford Motor Company), along with the model line, in 1954. The <b>Vedette</b> was therefore initially still marketed as the Ford <b>Vedette.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>Vedette</b> was {{manufactured}} in Poissy until 1961 and the Ariane until 1963. After that, production continued in Brazil, where the <b>Vedette</b> finally {{evolved into the}} Simca Esplanada, following Simca's takeover by Chrysler.|$|E

5|$|The Simca <b>Vedette</b> {{is a large}} car, {{manufactured}} from 1954 to 1961 by the French automaker Simca, {{at their}} factory in Poissy, France. It was marketed with different model names according to trim and equipment levels. The <b>Vedette</b> was Simca's largest model {{at that time and}} it spawned a more economical version, the Simca Ariane.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Henri Théodore Pigozzi {{was looking to}} expand the {{manufacturing}} operations of his Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, {{where it had been}} manufacturing a large car called the Ford <b>Vedette.</b> The Poissy plant was large and there was capacity for further expansion. The <b>Vedette</b> was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.|$|E

Within a few days, Alfano tracked the thieves and restored the jewelry. The case hit the news headlines and Alfano was arrested for complicity with the thieves but was absolved.|$|E
5|$|Voltaire (1826) – won the Doncaster Gold Cup and {{finished}} second in the St. Leger in 1829. He sired Derby and St. Leger winner Voltigeur. Voltigeur's son <b>Vedette</b> was the grandsire of the undefeated St. Simon, who became Champion sire nine times. It is mainly through St. Simon that Blacklock's sire line survives today.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca <b>Vedette</b> Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, French Meccano {{has been}} the first post-war European {{manufacturer}} to introduce 1:43 scale. Initially, the scales of French Dinky Toys {{were similar to those}} of English Dinkys. The Citroën Traction Avant (24N), released in 1949, was 1:48, while the Ford <b>Vedette</b> 1949 (24Q), released in 1950, was 1:45, the same scales as used in the British 40 series. But then, in 1946 Meccano France released their first car in 1:43 scale: the Jeep (24M) (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|E

25|$|Rotation at La Vielle {{always took}} place the same way: The <b>vedette</b> {{approaches}} {{as close to}} the rocks as possible, amid the roar and swell of the waves. Once close, the crew secured the rope launched by the keepers. The rope was used to ferry a passenger back and forth. Once the passenger had secured his safety belt, he sat down with his luggage astride a kind of large ball that slid up or down the rope. In stormy weather the manoeuvre was particularly delicate and difficult; in fierce gales it was often impossible.|$|E
25|$|Zarzuela {{reached its}} peak {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. A string of front-rank composers such as Gonzalo Roig, Eliseo Grenet, Ernesto Lecuona and Rodrigo Prats {{produced}} a series of hits for the Regina and Martí theatres in Havana. Great stars like the <b>vedette</b> Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris. Some of the best known zarzuelas are La virgen morena (Grenet), La Niña Rita (Grenet and Lecuona), María la O, El batey, Rosa la China (all Lecuona); Gonzalo Roig with La Habana de noche; Rodrigo Prats with Amalia Batista and La perla del caribe; and above all, Cecilia Valdés (the musical of the most famous Cuban novel of the 19th century, with music by Roig and script by Prats and Agustín Rodríguez). Artists who were introduced to the public in the lyric theatre include Caridad Suarez, María de los Angeles Santana, Esther Borja and Ignacio Villa, who had such a round, black face that Rita Montaner called him Bola de Nieve ('Snowball').|$|E
25|$|After {{the clash}} at Boitzenburg, Hohenlohe {{knew that the}} French were on the Berlin highway, which went {{northeast}} from Zehdenick to Prenzlau. So instead of continuing on the Lychen-Boitzenburg-Prenzlau road, which intersected with the Berlin highway, he veered northeast to Schönermark-Nordwestuckermark. At 4:00 AM on 28 October and the column reached Schönermark, only eight kilometers from Prenzlau. Hohenlohe held a council of war at which the officers argued whether to march east to Prenzlau or to go north to Pasewalk. A cavalry <b>vedette</b> reported that Prenzlau was clear of the French at 6:00 AM, so the march continued, though three hours were wasted before getting underway. It {{was very difficult to}} get the column moving again and angry protests were heard from the starving soldiers. Schwerin led the column with a cuirassier regiment and a battery of horse artillery. The bulk of the infantry trailed behind Schwerin's vanguard and Oberst Prince Augustus of Prussia led the rear guard, which consisted of a cavalry regiment and an infantry battalion. Two dragoon regiments protected the right flank.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the last}} great <b>vedettes</b> in Mexico was Francis García, a {{transvestite}} artist who was the main star of the Teatro Blanquita {{for more than a}} decade.In recent years, large night centers have virtually disappeared from Mexico. Some actresses and singers perform shows of <b>vedettes</b> in other venues, such as the Palenques. Among them are figures such as Costa Rican Maribel Guardia, Mexicans Lorena Herrera, Mariana Seoane, the transgender Alejandra Bogue and Ninel Conde and the Cubans Niurka Marcos and Lis Vega.|$|R

Even so, worthy of mention are the shows offered in venues such as the Blanquita Theater or [...] "El Patio" [...] by the stars such as Sonia Furió, Ana Luisa Peluffo and Ana Bertha Lepe. In {{the midst of the}} fury of the Rock and Roll era, were famous figures like Malú Reyes and Emily Cranz.
