5|$|On 30 January 1963, a B-52E of the 6th Bomb Wing from Walker Air Force Base, New Mexico, {{crashed in}} snow-covered {{mountains}} in northern New Mexico after turbulence tore off the <b>vertical</b> <b>fin.</b> The ECM operator and tail gunner were killed {{but at least}} three crew (pilot, radio operator and one other crew member) survived. Three Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars and, later, three Douglas C-54 Skymaster transports, circled the area trying to locate survivors; the pilots reported that they saw two other survivors after the first man walked to safety.|$|E
25|$|The {{tail unit}} was of {{conventional}} design, comprising a horizontal tailplane and a single, <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> with rudder.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{convective}} heat transfer from a heated {{horizontal and vertical}} surfaces directly exposed into air which <b>vertical</b> <b>fins,</b> attached to a surface, project vertically downwards has been numerically studied. It has been assumed that the fins are everywhere at {{the temperature of the}} surface. The governing equations, written in dimensionless form, have been solved using the finite element procedure. The results show that vertical plate with <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> gives the best performance for natural cooling...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on current}} projections, III-Vs are {{expected}} to replace Si as the n-channel solution in FinFETs at the 7 nm technology node. The realisation of III-V FinFETs entails top-down fabrication via dry etch techniques. <b>Vertical</b> <b>fins</b> in conjunction with high quality sidewall MOS interfaces are required for high-performance logic devices. This, however, is difficult to achieve with dry etching. Highly anisotropic etching required of <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> is concomitant with increased damage to the sidewalls, resulting {{in the quality of}} the sidewall MOS interface being compromised. In this work, we address this challenge in two stages by first undertaking a systematic investigation of dry etch processing for fin formation, with the aim of obtaining high resolution <b>fins</b> with <b>vertical</b> sidewalls and clean etch surfaces. In the second stage, dry etch process optimisation and post-etch sidewall passivation schemes are explored to mitigate the damage arising from anisotropic etching required for the realisation of <b>vertical</b> <b>fins...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was also}} extensively redesigned, {{with a new}} shaped nose, a new <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> with twice the area and a new fuselage shape aft of the wing. Landing gear is a monowheel.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> and {{horizontal}} stabilizers were fixed cantilever structures. The design {{followed the same}} practices as the wing structure, with additional thickness {{at the leading edge}} of the stabilizers as protection from ground damage.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, 12 of an {{improved}} version, the Ka-10M were {{built for the}} Maritime Border Troops. They had a twin tail rather than the single <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> of the Ka-10 and modified rotors and control systems.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the steady-state rates of heat transfer from an array of <b>vertical</b> rectangular <b>fins</b> of 3 mm thickness and 250 mm length, protruding 60 mm perpendicularly upwards from a 250 mm x 190 mm horizontal rectangular base, is reported. For constant (to Â± 0 Â· 1 Â°C) base temperatures between 40 Â°C and 80 Â°C, in an ambient environment of 20 Â± 0 Â· 2 Â°C, the optimal separation of the parallel fins, corresponding to the maximum rate of heat loss, is 10 Â· 5 Â± 1 Â· 0 mm. The effects {{of the extent of}} the fin protrusions on the thermal performances of such <b>vertical</b> <b>fins,</b> on the same base, which was arranged to be either vertical or horizontal, have been studied. The experiments were performed with three different fin protrusions, namely 32 mm, 60 mm and 90 mm, for a base temperature of 40 Â°C above that of the ambient environment. The steady-state rate of heat dissipation from the fin array increased slightly less than linearly with the fin protrusion for both orientations, but the relationship became closer to linear as the fin spacing was increased. A comparison of the abilities to dissipate heat to the room air from the same geometrical configuration having a rectangular fin array but positioned with <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> on a <b>vertical</b> base, <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> protruding upwards from a horizontal base, or horizontal <b>fins</b> on a <b>vertical</b> base, has been made. The orientation with <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> protruding upwards from the horizontal base, is the preferred option because of the relatively high rates of heat transfer that can then be achieved. ...|$|R
50|$|Operational squadrons of the 340th Bomb Group {{utilized}} identification codes {{applied to}} the outboard sides of the <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> featuring a squadron-designated numeral, coupled with a letter for the individual aircraft: the 486th(6x), 487th(7x), 488th(8x), and 489th(9x) Bombardment Squadrons.|$|R
25|$|On the 53rd {{production}} aircraft (1963), a swept <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> and rudder were incorporated (designated WA.40A; first flying in January 1963 and receiving French certification in March 1963); all subsequent units produced continued the swept design.|$|E
25|$|The A.F.B.1 was a biplane with un-staggered, equal-span wings. They had no {{dihedral}} {{but were}} slightly swept. The tailplane was rather large, and triangular in shape – the rudder {{on the other}} hand was a rather small balanced affair, with no <b>vertical</b> <b>fin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The single bay, unequal span wings were {{identical}} {{to those of the}} B.E.2e, although the span (and thus the wing area) was increased slightly by the use of a wider upper centre section, and lower stub wings to match. The tailplane was also the same as the B.E.2e. The entirely new parts of the design were confined to the fuselage aft of the engine firewall, and the <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> and rudder.|$|E
50|$|A variant {{powered by}} an Argus As 413 unit giving {{a maximum of}} 4.000 PS (made of two Junkers Jumo 213 engines). The plane had a larger {{radiator}} and the wingtip booms had small <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> at the trailing edge.|$|R
50|$|Developed {{with the}} help of the Kayaba Industry's chief {{designer}} Shigeki Naito, the Ku-2 had a swept wing with two <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> at the end of the wings. The Ku-2 flew 262 test flights between October 1940 and May 1941 before being damaged beyond repair in a crash.|$|R
50|$|The M28 is a twin-engined high-wing {{strutted}} monoplane with an all-metal airframe, twin <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> and a tricycle fixed landing gear.If {{an engine}} fails, a spoiler {{forward of the}} aileron opens automatically on the opposite wing.This limits the wing drop to 12° in five seconds instead of 30°.|$|R
25|$|B-52 {{crews were}} sent through an {{intensive}} two-week {{course on the}} B-52D, making them eligible for duty in Southeast Asia. B-52s assigned to combat duty in Vietnam were painted in a modified camouflage scheme with the undersides, lower fuselage, and {{both sides of the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> being painted in a glossy black. The USAF serial number was painted in black on the fin over a horizontal red stripe across the length of the fin.|$|E
25|$|A new {{fuselage}} (but with {{a similar}} nose) and <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> were then developed, married to salvaged and rebuilt (wet) Queen Air wings and horizontal tails, and Twin Bonanza landing gear; this became the SA26 Merlin, more-or-less a pressurized Excalibur. Through successive models (the SA26-T Merlin IIA and SA26-AT Merlin IIB) the engines were changed to Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6, then Garrett TPE331 turboprops. These were marketed as business aircraft seating eight to ten passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} for a flying boat that would make use of {{boundary}} layer control to achieve slow speed flight. It was intended that this would enable the aircraft {{to land on the}} open ocean in rough seas and deploy a dipping sonar. Other visual features of the design were an extremely large swept <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> that, combined with the dorsal fin and rudder, would have been about half the total length of the aircraft, and a thimble nose radome.|$|E
50|$|The {{tail unit}} {{comprised}} a horizontal plane braced by struts with two <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> and rudders, also supported by diagonal bracing to the fuselage. As {{a result of}} early test results, fin area was increased; a major redesign of the tail unit was requested by John Parker and implemented at considerable cost.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the steady-state rates of heat loss from an array of <b>vertical</b> rectangular <b>fins</b> of 3 mm thickness and 250 mm length, when {{in the presence of}} an almost adiabatic horizontal shroud, situated adjacent to and above the horizontal fin tips, is reported. With the fin's horizontal base at a uniform temperature of 40 Â± 0 Â· 1 Â° C above that of the ambient environment, the optimal fin separation [...] corresponding to the maximum rate of heat loss [...] is deduced. As the ratio of the shroud height above the <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> to the fin height decreases from unity to zero, this optimal value decreases by approximately 17 %. The frictional characteristics of the air flow through the fin array have also been studied in the Reynolds number range of 4 Â· 0 x 104 to 2 Â· 0 x 105. Large streamwise pressure drops and high heat-transfer rates resulted when the fins were closely spaced and no clearance gap was present above the <b>vertical</b> <b>fins.</b> In reasing the shroud clearance resulted in smaller overall pressure drops and decreasing heat-transfer rates from the heat exchanger. ...|$|R

25|$|The fighter {{was sent}} back to the Lohner-Werke factory where repairs and {{extensive}} modification were completed. Now referred to as the Lohner 10.20A, the fuselage was again lengthened to 6.35m (20ft 10in), the I type struts were replaced with the more common twin struts with wire braces. The tail was completely redesigned with a fixed <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> and an even larger rudder. Flight testing of the 10.20A continued until 6 June 1917, when it was totally destroyed in another crash.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} flew on 7 March 1957, revealing poor {{directional stability}} {{which led to}} a taller <b>vertical</b> <b>fin,</b> and later to hexagonal auxiliary fins at the tips of the tailplane. Entering production at Zavod (factory) No.64, Voronezh in 1957, the initial three aircraft were delivered with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, due to non-availability of the Ivchenko AI-20 engines. From 1958, production aircraft were delivered with the Ivchenko AI-20A engines which boasted a longer service life and comparable performance compared to the Kuznetsov engines.|$|E
25|$|Starting on 21 October 1963, Bell began {{test flights}} with two Continental CAE J69-T-9 {{turbojet}} engines in nacelles mounted {{directly to the}} aft portion of the fuselage. The thrust from the two 920-pound (4.09kN) thrust engines caused turbulent airflow over the standard elevators, so an additional elevator was mounted on the <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> {{on the opposite side}} of the tail rotor. Following the modification, flight tests were resumed on 2 March 1964, with both wings and engines mounted. In this configuration, the Bell 533 achieved 186knots (214mph, 344km/h) using maximum auxiliary thrust.|$|E
25|$|In October 1959, eight RF-101As were {{transferred}} to Taiwan, which used them for overflights of the Chinese mainland. These ROCAF RF-101A with modified C-model <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> with air intake. The intake is used to cool the drag chute compartment and eliminates the 5-minute limit on using the afterburners on the A model. Two were reportedly shot down.|$|R
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been made}} at low speed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>fins</b> placed ahead of the vertical tail on the directional stability and damping-in-yaw characteristics of a swept-wing model under steady-state oscillatory conditions.

50|$|According to AIO (Aerospace Industries Organisation), the {{aircraft}} {{that will be}} flight tested during 2017 and will have twin, outwardly canted <b>vertical</b> <b>fins.</b> This type of a tail design has become a favoured aerodynamic feature of Iranian designers {{that dates back to}} the development of the reverse-engineered Iranian version of the Northrop F-5, the HESA Saeqeh.|$|R
25|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a swept-wing version of the earlier F9F Panther, in February–March 1948, the design was reconfigured with a T-tail and ultimately a variable-geometry wing. It featured a T-tail, with the horizontal stabilator, a small pivoting center body with a delta servo control at the nose and a larger rear delta main wing, mounted atop the <b>vertical</b> <b>fin.</b> The single turbojet engine was fed by cheek intakes. The high, shoulder-mounted wing could be moved to two positions: a 13.5° sweep for takeoff and landing and a 42.5° sweep for high-speed flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} stabilizers were seemingly undersized, {{and mounted}} {{below the line}} of the wing. The larger <b>vertical</b> <b>fin</b> was supplemented by a ventral fin for high-speed stability. This fin folded to the right, as seen from behind, during takeoff and landing to avoid hitting the ground. Two petal-style air brakes were mounted directly behind the horizontal surfaces, opening out and up at about a 45° angle into the gap between the horizontal and vertical surfaces. A provision for a braking parachute is not evident on the mock-up or the various artwork, although this was common for aircraft of the era.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage IV shares design {{features}} and a visual {{resemblance to the}} Mirage III fighter, featuring a tailless delta wing and a single square-topped <b>vertical</b> <b>fin.</b> However, the wing is significantly thinner to allow better high-speed performance and has a thickness/chord ratio of only 3.8% at the root and 3.2% at the tip; this wing was the thinnest built in Europe {{at that time and}} one of the thinnest in the world. While being significantly smaller than an expensive medium bomber proposal for the role, the Mirage IV was roughly three times the weight of the preceding Mirage III.|$|E
