5|$|Hammond console organs {{come with}} a wooden pedalboard played with the feet, for bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards {{going up to the}} G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E
25|$|The <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> of the iPlayer {{goes up to}} 11, {{apparently}} a nod to a scene about an amplifier <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> that goes up to eleven in the rock mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap (1984).|$|E
25|$|Automatic <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> or {{automatic}} {{gain control}} (AGC) is an adaptive system found in many electronic devices. The average output signal level is fed back to adjust the gain to an appropriate level {{for a range of}} input signal levels. In 1925, Harold Alden Wheeler invented the automatic <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> which remains today, a standard feature of AM radio.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} labels {{are used for}} level {{attenuation}} potentiometers (knobs) in a guitar amplifier and other guitar equipment. Electric guitars and basses have a <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> on the instrument that attenuates the signal from selected pickups. There may be two volume controls on an electric guitar or bass, wired in parallel to mix the signal levels from the neck and bridge pickups. Rolling back the guitar's <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> also changes the pickup's equalization or frequency response, which can provide pre-distortion equalization.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, Townshend mainly used Fenders, Rickenbackers and Telecaster-style models {{built for}} him by Schecter and various other luthiers. Since the late-1980s, Townshend has used the Fender Eric Clapton Signature Stratocaster, with Lace Sensor pick-ups, both {{in the studio and}} on tour. Some of his Stratocaster guitars feature a Fishman PowerBridge piezo pick-up system to {{simulate}} acoustic guitar tones. This piezo system is controlled by an extra <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> behind the guitar's bridge.|$|E
25|$|Moderate {{amounts of}} {{low-level}} waste are produced through chemical and <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> system (CVCS). This includes gas, liquid, and solid waste produced {{through the process}} of purifying the water through evaporation. Liquid waste is reprocessed continuously, and gas waste is filtered, compressed, stored to allow decay, diluted, and then discharged. The rate at which this is allowed is regulated and studies must prove that such discharge does not violate dose limits to a member of the public (see radioactive effluent emissions).|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Volume</b> <b>controlled</b> {{ventilation}} (VC) {{allows a}} set tidal volume to be guaranteed but it causes excessive airway pressures {{that may lead}} to barotrauma. Pressure controlled ventilation (PC) limits ventilator-induced lung injury but has a disadvantage of variable tidal volume delivery. Pressure-regulated <b>volume</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation is a kind of dual-control ventilation that combines the advantages of both <b>volume</b> <b>controlled</b> and pressure controlled ventilation. Objective: To compare the pressure regulated <b>volume</b> <b>controlled</b> ventilation (PRVC) versus traditional synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients suffering from acute respiratory failure. Patients and methods: This prospective study was carried on 30 COPD patients suffering from acute respiratory failure, divided in two groups: group 1 patients were ventilated using the SIMV mode and group 2 patients were ventilated using the PRVC mode. The arterial blood gas (ABG) parameters, ventilation data, complications and prognosis were compared in the two groups. Results: The ABG parameters improved better in the PRVC group after 6 and 48  h. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) values were lower in the PRVC group. There were fewer complications (33 % in group 2 versus 86 % in group 1). The prognosis was better in PRVC group as 13 patients (86 %) were weaned, 1 patient (7 %) died and 1 patient (7 %) failed to be weaned. On the other hand, 6 patients (40 %) were weaned, 3 patients (20 %) died and 6 patients (40 %) failed to be weaned in the SIMV group. Conclusion: The PRVC mode is better than the <b>volume</b> <b>controlled</b> SIMV mode in ventilating COPD patients with acute exacerbations and type II respiratory failure...|$|R

The new PRO model includes two tone and two push/pull <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> that coil split each humbucker individually. The jack has been relocated {{to the standard}} Les Paul positioning and the two humbucker pickups are covered on all models.|$|R
25|$|For older {{models of}} telephones, the headset {{microphone}} impedance {{is different from}} that of the original handset, requiring a telephone amplifier for the telephone headset. A telephone amplifier provides basic pin-alignment similar to a telephone headset adaptor, but it also offers sound amplification for the microphone as well as the loudspeakers. Most models of telephone amplifiers offer <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> for loudspeaker as well as microphone, mute function and switching between headset and handset. Telephone amplifiers are powered by batteries or AC adaptors.|$|E
25|$|According to the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, {{the risk}} of hearing damage from digital audio players depends on both sound level and {{listening}} time. The listening habits of most users are unlikely to cause hearing loss, but some people are putting their hearing at risk, because they set the <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> very high or listen to music at high levels for many hours per day. Such listening habits may result in temporary or permanent hearing loss, tinnitus, and difficulties understanding speech in noisy environments.|$|E
25|$|One type of {{device that}} {{integrates}} CobraNet {{is the audio}} DSP. As self-powered speakers became more common, Cobranet was frequently used to distribute the audio signal from the DSP. These devices typically receive audio from CobraNet (and often from other digital or analog sources simultaneously), and process the audio using digital filters and effects (for example, <b>volume</b> <b>control,</b> EQ, compression, delay, crossovers, etc.) and then output the audio via CobraNet (or other digital or analog outputs). Some DSPs even have an integral telephone hybrid, and can incorporate CobraNet and other sources into a teleconferencing application.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>controls</b> include {{separate}} <b>volume</b> <b>controls</b> {{for each}} string, a 'mute-tone', master volume and [...] "DynaFUZZ" [...] control.

25|$|The guitar was {{extensively}} {{modified by}} Gallagher. The tuning pegs are odd (5 Sperzel pegs and one Gotoh), {{and all of}} these {{have been found to be}} replacements. Second, it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times. Third, the pickguard was changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master <b>volume</b> <b>control.</b> He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage 3-way one.|$|E
25|$|During the game's release, Nintendo {{teamed up}} with Kellogg's and Nelsonic to develop and release a promotional Star Fox LCD game watch to those who bought a box of corn flakes and sent the order form to Kellogg's to receive the Star Fox game watch for free. In the game watch, there are four levels and {{the object is to}} fly towards an attack carrier and destroy it while dodging plasma balls and falling structures. The game watch also {{includes}} a pair of earphones and a headphone jack due to the game watch missing a <b>volume</b> <b>control.</b> Nelsonic later released it in stores in a different watch appearance.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Brussels, Belgium (though {{the family moved to}} Antwerp soon after his birth), the son of a judge, and {{developed}} an interest in travel and the natural world as a child. He fought in the First World War before escaping to England, where he read chemistry at Oxford University. He worked at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough on lubricating oils, and then in Belgium on coke oven technology, before moving to the USA. There, in 1926, he invented a system of automatic <b>volume</b> <b>control</b> for radio, and the royalties he received allowed him to indulge his love of travel and movie-making.|$|E
