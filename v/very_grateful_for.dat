25|$|The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had {{complete}} {{control over the}} Force at this time. There {{was a great deal}} of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting a raw deal from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853–1914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded. His brother, Frank Richardson preferred indexing the records after photographing on-site fingerprints. (He had been working in conjunction with the Home Office, London, for many years on experimenting to find the best method.) Alfred Richardson gave lectures locally on the differences between the Bertillon method and photographic fingerprinting.|$|E
500|$|Following [...] "Living for Love" [...] and [...] "Ghosttown", [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] was {{confirmed}} {{as the third}} single from Rebel Heart by Madonna on her Instagram. She also released three remixes of the song on her YouTube and Tidal accounts for streaming. The cover art of the song was also released along with the remixes; it was created {{from one of her}} images on Instagram. The majority of house remixes of [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] were produced by Rosabel, Sander Kleinenberg and Oscar G, who posted a message on his Facebook account about the collaboration, [...] "When Madonna calls you, you do exactly what she asks.

The remixes were first released on June 15, 2015, in Australia and Germany, and the next day in other nations.|$|E

500|$|Falk soon {{proved himself}} to be a capable agent with many {{innovative}} marketing ideas. [...] He allowed Nike to establish Jordan's primary image, then began splitting it up among other advertisers, including Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Wilson Sporting Goods, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. [...] Falk's ideas stretched to all areas of the marketplace, including a fragrance (called simply [...] "Michael Jordan") made by the Beverly Hills designer Bijan, which was cited as the best-marketed product of 1996 by the American Marketing Association. [...] Falk even {{came up with the idea}} of teaming Bugs Bunny and Jordan together in a feature film, and then sold the concept to Warner Bros. in 1993. [...] The ensuing film, Space Jam, was executive produced by Falk and released in 1996. [...] Perhaps most importantly, Falk [...] "set a precedent by 'opting out' Jordan from the league's licensing program, in effect reclaiming Jordan's image for his own use." [...] Jordan himself was <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> his agent's remarkable negotiating and marketing abilities, even with Falk's penchant for making powerful enemies along the way.|$|E
500|$|In December 2014 Stefani {{spoke of}} the song to Spins Brennan Carley, when she {{mentioned}} working with Furler on the record. In the interview, she stated: [...] "I’ve got a good start on the record. Sia and I did a session with Pharrell and No Doubt. She's a genius and I love working with her. There's a song on the record called [...] "Start a War" [...] that she wrote that I'm <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for.</b> I think the girls are gonna love that one." [...] Popjustice's Brad O'Mance wrote that the announcement Stefani was working with Sia was good news. However, the physical release of [...] "Baby Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "Start a War" [...] never occurred. Furthermore, Universal Music Group's official website had listed a digital release of [...] "Start a War" [...] to take place on November 9, 2015, and had assigned it a UPC code, as it had for the unreleased maxi single for [...] "Baby Don't Lie". In the week of its scheduled release, Stefani's single [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was distributed instead.|$|E
500|$|McMahon {{commented that}} the SIS {{had a history of}} [...] "furnish {{unreliable}} information on the IRA's foreign intrigues." [...] Yet, these past failures were ignored as the reports reinforced the fears of invasion. MaMahon suggested that [...] "It is even possible that the plans discovered in Holland were planted. Whether deliberate deception or not, British intelligence was well and truly deceived." [...] Historian Eunan O'Halpin argued that while the Dutch document could be seen as a British fabrication, [...] "it is now known... that German deception operations prepared in anticipation of Operation 'Sealion' included the manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack Ireland as a feint during the build up to an invasion of Southern England." [...] Nicholas Mansergh commented that [...] "Ireland had no place" [...] in the initial Sealion plans, and it was not until 3 December 1940 that German planners even looked at the possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure. In his memoirs, Carton De Wiart commented [...] "I can never believe the Germans had any intention of invading Ireland but I am <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> any reason which sent us there, for it was an ideal training ground for troops and the division improved enormously from the moment of our arrival." ...|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's <b>very</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, I kiss her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 31, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} a Bollywood version of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] in India during a Formula One after party in Greater Noida. Before the performance, she announced [...] "I feel like I've {{waited a long}} time to come here. And I feel <b>very</b> <b>grateful....</b> <b>For</b> the first time ever, I'm going to sing 'Marry the Night'." [...] She sat on the piano and played a slow version of the song, accompanied by a sitar. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards, Gaga gave her first televised performance of [...] "Marry the Night" [...] dressed as a satellite landing on the moon. Wearing a red bikini, and a large red disc around her, Gaga was perched atop a semi-circular replica of the moon which was covered in silver chains. Flames erupted around the stage as Gaga revealed another circular disc covering her face. She sang the song from that vantage point and near the end of the performance, removed the metal disc and {{performed a}} choreographed dance routine with her back-up dancers. She also performed the song at the 2011 Bambi Awards in Wiesbaden, Germany, on November 10. The stage included a vintage convertible with a keyboard built into the side of the door and Gaga also won an award later that night at the gala.|$|E
