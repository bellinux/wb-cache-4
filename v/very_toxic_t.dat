30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{international}} and national programs that are concerned with the categorization of substances that are persistent (P or very P (vP)), bioaccumulative (B or <b>very</b> B (vB)), <b>toxic</b> (<b>T),</b> or have the potential for long-range transport (LRT) [1]. The objectives of these programs are protection of the environment and humans from substances that may harm these entities, either locally or globally, by accumulation in organisms where they then exert toxic effects. The oldest of these programs is the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme [2]. Related to this convention is the recognition of the potential for long-range transboundary air pollution as another issue of relevance to POPs [3]. The objectives of the Stockholm convention on POPs have been incorporated into several other jurisdictions such as the Persistent Organic Pollutant (POP) Regulations in the European Union (EU) [4].|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} and national programs classify substances that are persistent (P or very P), bioaccumulative (B or <b>very</b> B), <b>toxic</b> (<b>T),</b> {{or have the}} potential for long-range transport. The oldest of these programs is the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. More recent programs address persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) properties for chemicals in general (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, REACH; EC 253 / 2011) and plant protection products (PPPs) (EC 1107 / 2009). However, these programs used different criteria for categorization. We critically assessed the criteria and process used in the categorization of PPPs and noted that EC 1107 / 2009, in contrast to the Stockholm Convention or REACH, offers no process for carrying out a further, more refined assessment of those pesticides that are identified as having PBT properties. Thus, in contrast to REACH, few basic screening criteria are used for final-step management decisions. Guidance on the selection of data is not provided, and the criteria used are unclear. For example, no guidance is given as to how the half-lives in soil, water, and sediment should be derived and the term ‘half-life’ is not clearly defined. Large amounts of useful data on environmental and toxicological properties are available for PPPs but most of this is not used in the categorization, for example, photolysis in water, water-sediment, and on soil, important environmental degradation processes particularly relevant to pesticides. The criteria for bioaccumulation and toxicity appear to be focused only on aquatic ecosystems and do not address the terrestrial compartment which is particularly relevant for pesticides and potentially relevant for PBT considerations. The categorization process under EC 1107 / 2009 could be made more efficient and reduce false negatives and positives if a formal weight of evidence approach was applied to multiple lines of evidence. This paper presents these ideas and how they can be incorporated into the framework for categorization to better classify plant protection products in terms of persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity.|$|R
40|$|The very {{deficient}} {{information from}} the Portuguese Pesticides Regulation Authority (AFN) and the pesticides suppliers about toxicological classification of pesticides has occurred since 2005 and is confirmed by this study concerning the 306 active ingredients (a. i.) authorized in 2011. The systematic smaller number of a. i. with dangerous toxicological classifications adopted by AFN in contrast with EFSA is always present and, in special: in 8 a. i (62 %) of 13 most <b>toxic</b> (<b>T,</b> Cat 1, 2, R 46, R 60, R 61) for EFSA, ignored by AFN; on Acute Toxicity of 22 a. i. <b>Very</b> <b>Toxic</b> by EFSA but by AFN only 2 (9 %) and of 45 a. i. Toxic with 91 % by EFSA but only 25 % by AFN; and in 53 a. i. classified R 63, EFTA consider 46 (87 %) and AFN only 29 (55 %). It is surprising the diversity of classification criterions of 124 a. i. of Carcinogenicity (41 % of 306 a. i.), being classified by: EPA – 69 %; EFSA – 46 %; and AFN – 40 %...|$|R

40|$|Peptidyl halomethylketones are {{synthetic}} proteas inhibitors {{designed to}} block the activity of cysteine or serine proteases. Recently, the cathepsin inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-phe-ala-fluoromethylketone (z-FA-FMK) with alanine and phenylalanine at the P 1 and P 2 positions, respectively, {{has been shown to}} have immunosuppressive properties in vitro and in vivo. Structure-activity relationship studies on z-FA-FMK revealed that replacing the fluorine atom with chlorine at the methylketone moiety renders the chloromethylketone (CMK) analogue, z-FA-CMK <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> to Jurkat <b>T</b> cells. Due to the highly reactive CMK moiety, peptidyl CMKs are known to be potentially toxic. However, the present study showed that peptide derived with a CMK moiety is not necessary <b>toxic</b> to Jurkat <b>T</b> cells and that almost all the structural components is crucial in z-FA-CMK toxicity, suggesting that the toxicity mediated by z-FA-CMK is rather specific. Dose-dependent studies revealed that lower concentrations of z-FA-CMK induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells whereas higher concentrations induced necrosis. Apoptosis but not necrosis induced by z-FA-CMK is readily blocked by caspase inhibitors. However, both apoptosis and necrosis were blocked by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that oxidative stress may be involved in the mechanism of z-FA-CMK toxicity. Further studies showed that toxicity of z-FA-CMK in T cells involves the depletion of intracellular glutathione, generation of reactive oxygen species, and the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. As predicted for peptidyl CMK, z-FA-CMK depleted glutathione, an effect which can cause ROS generation and oxidative stress. However, results in the present study suggested that the generation of ROS plays a more important role than glutathione depletion in the mechanism of oxidative stress induced by z-FA-CMK toxicity. In conclusion, the peptidyl halomethylketone z-FA-CMK was found to be highly toxic in the leukemic T cell line, Jurkat and exert its toxicity via oxidative stress. Compared with primary T cells (mouse thymocytes), Jurkat T cells appeared to be more susceptible to z-FA-CMK toxicity. However, this remained to be furthered investigated...|$|R
