40|$|We analyze {{in depth}} several {{engineering}} problems regarding {{the construction of}} a VanderLugt correlator. Two liquid crystal devices are used in the input and Fourier planes and the large distances involved are reduced with the help of telephoto systems. An original method to control both modulators with a single 8 -bit frame grabber and a single <b>videoprojector</b> electronics is presented. Problems related to pixel-by-pixel addressing and the phase modulation in the panels are also discussed. All the solutions proposed in this paper have been implemented and experimental correlation results using the setup have been obtained...|$|E
40|$|This Bachelorâ€™s thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} creation of a client app for theiPhone and a server program for the Mac. The app {{is meant to be}} used byvisitors at music festivals and similar events, to share what they see with othervisitors. The iPhone app uses the built in camera to take pictures that areautomatically uploaded to a local server if available. The server program thensaves the images and displays them on a large monitor or with a <b>videoprojector</b> or something similar. It uses 3 d graphics to display and changebetween the images.

40|$|In this fluid {{dynamics}} video, we present {{an overview of}} the most important results recently obtained in our group using an optical pro-filometric technique that allows for single-shot global measurement of free-surface deformations. This system consists of a high-resolution system composed of a <b>videoprojector</b> and a digital camera. A fringe pattern of known characteristics is projected onto the free surface and its image is registered by the camera. The deformed fringe pattern arising from the surface deformations is later compared to the unde-formed (reference) one, leading to a phase map from which the free surface can be reconstructed. Two examples are developed: (a) the study of water wave trapped modes and (b) the impact of a drop onto a thin layer of the same liquid. 1 a...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of micro- and nanotechnology, most {{lithography}} and fabrication tools coming from the microelectronic industry are expensive, time-consuming and may need some masks {{that have to be}} subcontracted. Such approach is not suitable for other fields that require rapid prototyping such as chemistry, life science or energy and may hinder research creativity. In this work, we present two table-top equipments dedicated to the fabrication of deterministic colloidal particles assemblies onto micro-structured substrates. We show that, with a limited modification of the optics of a standard <b>videoprojector,</b> it is possible to quickly obtain substrates with thousands of micrometric features. Then, we combine these substrates with thermodynamic colloidal assembly and generate arrays of particles without defects. This work opens the way to a simple and table-top fabrication of devices based on colloidal particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCatopsys is a {{low-cost}} projection system aiming at making mixed reality (virtual, augmented or diminished reality) affordable. It combines a <b>videoprojector,</b> {{a camera and}} a convex mirror and works in a non-specific room. This system displays an immersive environment by projecting an image onto the {{different parts of the}} room. However, the presence of an uncalibrated projector, heterogeneous materials and light inter-reflections influence the colors of the environment displayed in the room. Radiometric compensation of the projection process enables the system to reduce this problem. In this paper, we present our low-cost immersive projection system and propose a radiometric model and a compensation method which handle the projector response, surface materials and inter-reflections between surfaces. Our method works in two stages. First, the radiometric response of the projection process is evaluated. Then, this radiometric response is used to compensate the projection process in the desired environments...|$|E
