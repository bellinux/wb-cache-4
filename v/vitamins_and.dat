5|$|A typical 100-g parsnip {{contains}} 75 Calories (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars {{consist of}} about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip {{is rich in}} <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E
5|$|For most vitamins, pharmacopoeial {{standards}} have been established. In the United States, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) sets {{standards for the}} most commonly used <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> preparations thereof. Likewise, monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph.Eur.) regulate aspects of identity and purity for vitamins on the European market.|$|E

All the children received the <b>vitamin</b> <b>and</b> mineral complex (1 pill 3 times day for 3 months). The research findings showed that rational use of the <b>vitamin</b> <b>and</b> mineral complex led to the saliva saturation with minerals, such as: calcium, magnesium and phosphorus.

5|$|In {{addition}} to a commercially prepared seed mix, a balanced diet for a Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity includes a regulated variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Dark greens such as kale are rich in <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals. Wild vegetables such as yarrow, chickweed, and dandelion and raspberry leaves, are also good sources of protein that helps prevent obesity.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research to emerge from Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) on adrenal gland function. In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>vitamin</b> <b>and</b> {{minerals}} deficiencies {{are commonly}} found in people with porphyria cutanea tarda. The most frequently cited deficiencies are those of beta-Carotene, retinol, <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> C. Beta-Carotene is required to synthesize <b>vitamin</b> A <b>and</b> <b>vitamin</b> A is needed to synthesize retinol. A lack of retinol-binding protein {{is due to a}} lack of retinol which is required to trigger its production.|$|R

5|$|The parsnip {{is usually}} cooked, {{but can also}} be eaten raw. It is high in <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals, {{especially}} potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It can be cultivated in deep, stone-free soils. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, viruses, and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling.|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals to the diet.|$|E

He wrote an autobiographical fitness book, Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, published in Sweden (by Bonnier Fakta) on 9 August 2011, offering tips he learned over the years to work out in various situations (with a busy schedule and a lot of traveling). On 9 September 2014, Lundgren published Dolph Lundgren: Train Like an Action Hero: Be Fit Forever, a book which contains a detailed account of his earlier life and troubles. He cites a better quality of life as having inspired him to maintain his physical fitness.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles of some spiders in the {{families}} Anyphaenidae, Corinnidae, Clubionidae, Thomisidae and Salticidae feed on plant nectar. Laboratory {{studies show that}} they do so deliberately and over extended periods, and periodically clean themselves while feeding. These spiders also prefer sugar solutions to plain water, which indicates that they are seeking nutrients. Since many spiders are nocturnal, the extent of nectar consumption by spiders may have been underestimated. Nectar contains amino acids, lipids, <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals in addition to sugars, and {{studies have shown that}} other spider species live longer when nectar is available. Feeding on nectar avoids the risks of struggles with prey, and the costs of producing venom and digestive enzymes.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) sets Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or Adequate Intakes (AIs) {{for when}} there is not {{sufficient}} information to set EARs and RDAs. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs {{are referred to as}} Dietary Reference Intakes. The current AI for potassium for women and men ages 14 and up is 4700mg. AI for pregnancy equals 4700mg/day. AI for lactation equals 5100mg/day. For infants 0–6 months 400mg, 6–12 months 700mg, 1–13 years increasing from 3000 to 4500 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL established.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for <b>vitamins,</b> <b>and</b> their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Vitamins are {{classified}} as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. In humans there are 13 vitamins: 4 fat-soluble (A, D, E, and K) and 9 water-soluble (8 B <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> vitamin C). Water-soluble vitamins dissolve easily in water and, in general, are readily excreted from the body, {{to the degree that}} urinary output is a strong predictor of vitamin consumption. Because they are not as readily stored, more consistent intake is important. Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract with the help of lipids (fats). Because {{they are more likely to}} accumulate in the body, they are more likely to lead to hypervitaminosis than are water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamin regulation is of particular significance in cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, a fetus begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is serious deficiency {{in one or more}} of these nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|A test in 2001 {{showed that}} four jumping species take nectar, either by sucking free nectar {{from the surface}} of flowers or biting the flowers with their fangs. The spiders fed in cycles of two to four minutes, then groomed their bodies and {{especially}} their chelicerae, before another cycle. A more formal part of the test showed that 90juvenile jumping spiders, including P. fimbriata, generally prefer to suck from blotting soaked with a 30% solution of sugar rather than paper soaked with distilled water. The authors suggest that, in the wild, nectar may be a frequent, convenient way to get some nutrients, as it would avoid the work, risks and costs (such as making venom) of predation. Jumping spiders may benefit from amino acids, lipids, <b>vitamins</b> <b>and</b> minerals normally found in nectar.|$|E
