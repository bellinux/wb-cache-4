25|$|Alpine {{ecosystems}} cover 20% of the park's area at 2200–2500m and {{are dominated}} by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo). Other species in these ecosystems are green alder (Alnus viridis), Waldstein's willow (Salix waldsteiniana), common juniper (Juniperus communis), Chamaecytisus absinthioides and Festuca valida. Grass ecosystems consist primarily of perennial grasses, such as Sesleria comosa, Festuca riloensis, Agrostis rupestris, etc. A specific element of these ecosystems is the calcareous <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone</b> with species like Elyna bellardii, Carex kitaibeliana, Salix retusa, Salix reticulata, Dryas octopetala, etc.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Scania belongs to the European hardwood <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone,</b> a considerable part of which is now agricultural rather than the original forest. This zone covers Europe west of Poland and north of the Alps, and includes the British Isles, northern and central France and the countries and regions {{to the south and}} southeast of the North Sea up to Denmark. A smaller north-eastern part of Scania is part of the pinewood <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone,</b> in which spruce grows naturally. Within the larger part, pine may grow together with birch on sandy soil. The most common tree is beech. Other common trees are willow, oak, ash, alder and elm (which until the 1970s formed a few forests but now is heavily infected by the elm disease). Also rather southern trees like walnut tree, chestnut and hornbeam can be found. In parks horse chestnut, lime and maple are commonly planted as well. Common fruit trees planted in commercial orchards and private gardens include several varieties of apple, pear, cherry and plum; strawberries are commercially cultivated in many locations across the province. Examples of wild berries grown in domesticated form are blackberry, raspberry, cloudberry (in the north-east), blueberry, wild strawberry and loganberry.|$|E
40|$|A {{scheme of}} <b>vegetation</b> <b>zones</b> for Hokkaido has been {{discussed}} and proposed by several scientists, based on a phytogeographical perspective. Honda（ 1912 ）divided the natural forest zones of Hokkaido into the temperate forest zone and the boreal forest zone. Tatewaki (1958 ） proposed that <b>vegetation</b> <b>zones</b> of Hokkaido were characterized by the so-called intermediate zone （mixed forest zone） formed by coniferous and deciduous tree species. From a phytosociological standpoint, the natural <b>vegetation</b> <b>zones</b> of Hokkaido were divided into four main vegetation regions: e. g. the Saso-Fagion crenatae region, the Carpino-Quercion grosseserratae region, the Piceion jezoensis region and the Vaccinio-Pinion pumilae region （Miyawaki et al 1975, 1988 ）. Thus there are various opinions the distribution and definition of concerning natural forest <b>zones</b> or <b>vegetation</b> <b>zones</b> in Hokkaido, from both phytogeographical or phytosociological standpoints. A revised scheme of <b>vegetation</b> <b>zones</b> in Hokkaido, is here attempted in order to unify these several phytogeographical and phytosociologlcal concepts for <b>vegetation</b> <b>zones.</b> As well, a new proposed vegetation-ecological approach for classification and evaluation of the vegetation regions by means of phytosociological landscape analysis is presented...|$|R

500|$|Much of {{the ecology}} of the {{watershed}} has been affected by wildfires and forestry, and is considered to be in a seral phase. [...] The river travels through several different vegetation zones. [...] In its upper reaches, the Adams flows through the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone. [...] These forests are similar to the coastal forests of British Columbia and contain old-growth trees up to 1000 years in age. [...] Old-growth stands along the river also contain rare species of lichen, likely isolated by the last Ice Age. [...] The floodplain of the Upper Adams contains wetland species of deciduous trees such as black cottonwood as well as a dense layer of shrubs including black twinberry, red-osier dogwood, and thimbleberry. [...] The lower river is dominated by the drier Interior Douglas Fir <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone.</b> [...] Other conifer species present are Ponderosa pine, Engelmann spruce, and alpine fir. The area around the river mouth has been altered by human activities such as farming and livestock grazing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reserve is}} part of the Western Sudetes {{mountains}} stretching from south-central Poland along the northern border of the Czech Republic to eastern Germany. The mountains are located at the watershed dividing the Baltic Sea and North Sea basins. The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from submontane to alpine. The river valleys and lower layers form the sub-montane zone made up of forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), silver fir (Abies alba) and Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). The higher parts form the montane <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone</b> characterized by forested areas of Carpathian spruce (Picea Abies). Above [...] is the subalpine zone, which is marked by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo), mat-grass meadows and subarctic highmoors. There are three subapline bogs that support an extensive algal community important for migratory birds and raptors. The alpine <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone,</b> is characterized by large rocky deserts with herbaceous perennials such as Carici (rigidae)-Nardetum and Festucetum supinae.|$|E
2500|$|Yukon is in {{the northwestern}} corner of Canada and is bordered by Alaska and the Northwest Territories. [...] The sparsely {{populated}} territory abounds with natural scenic beauty, with snowmelt lakes and perennial white-capped mountains, including many of Canada's highest mountains. The territory's climate is Arctic in the north (north of Old Crow), subarctic in the central region, between north of Whitehorse and Old Crow, and has a humid continental climate in the far south, south of Whitehorse and in areas close to the BC border. The long sunshine hours in the short summer allow a profusion of flowers and fruit to blossom. Most of the territory is boreal forest, tundra being the main <b>vegetation</b> <b>zone</b> only in the extreme north and at high elevations.|$|E
