40|$|Aim of {{the work}} is to {{investigate}} changes of the somatic health and its components under the influence of training loads aimed at endurance training. Material and Methods. We have examined 54 male athletes who are engaged in different sports. In order to assess the state of the athletes we have used traditional morphofunctional methods including different anthropometric measurements and a series of tests with standard physical exercise. The evaluation of the somatic health level (SHL) was carried out according to H. L. Apanasenko method. Based on the changes of the somatic health components we have conducted the analysis of changes in the athletes' body. To assess the research results we have used the distribution-free method of statistical analysis, using which we can evaluate the Wilcoxon criteria, and percentile method analysis based on determining the individual assessments of each of the indicators, taking into consideration falling in appropriate limits of percentile ranges. Results and Discussion. The analysis of individual variants of SHL changes according to H. L. Apanasenko showed that among the athletes who trained their general endurance (EG 1) there was {{a significant increase in the}} number of people with high (5 times) and above average (almost twofold) SHL. There was an increase in variants of above average level of somatic health (more than twofold) in athletes who trained their strength endurance (EG 2). Herewith, low and lower average levels occurred in 12 % (p< 0, 05) of cases despite the fact that they decreased by half. The influence of training loads aimed at developing strength endurance on the respiratory system was confirmed by the increase in <b>vital</b> <b>index</b> to the high level in 15, 4 % of athletes from EG 2. The analysis of the individual variants revealed that the positive dynamics of <b>vital</b> <b>index</b> level was observed in one out of four athletes from both groups; at the same time there was the negative dynamics of <b>vital</b> <b>index</b> in 14, 3 % of athletes from EG 1 and in 7, 6 % of athletes from EG 2, requiring further explanation. The training loads aimed at development of the strength endurance quite often (in 38, 5 % of cases) caused deterioration in strength of hands and only in 19. 1 % of cases contributed to its enhancement. During the development of the general endurance in 32, 1 % of cases the power index (PI) improved and in 21, 4 % of cases it deteriorated. The analysis of individual variants of Robinson index level changes showed that in 50 % of athletes from EG 2 and in 42, 9 % of athletes from EG 1 the improvement of cardiovascular system economization occurred. At the sometime the negative tendency was observed in 15, 4 % of athletes from EG 1. The development of the general endurance improved significantly the training loads tolerance in 32, 1 % of athletes while the training of the strength endurance - only in 42, 3 % of athletes. On the other side, in 17, 8 % of athletes from EG 1 and in 42, 3 % of athletes from EG 2 the training loads tolerance deteriorated, which requires further investigation of these athletes' state by using instrumental, biochemical and other methods of research that allow us to clarify such dynamics. Conclusions. The investigation of the influence of training loads, aimed at the development of the general and strength endurance revealed that according to normal values of such indicators as vital capacity (VC), Robinson index (RI) and power index (PI), the increase in the level of somatic health was noted in both groups. However, the analysis of the individual variants of training loads influence on the general endurance pointed out the deterioration of SHR in 10, 7 % of cases, <b>vital</b> <b>index</b> in 14, 3 % of cases, the strength of hands in 21, 4 % of cases, Robinson index in 3, 6 % of cases and in 17, 8 % of training loads tolerance.

40|$|Despite great {{advances}} in very large scale integrated-circuit design and manufacturing, performance {{of even the}} best available high-speed, high-resolution analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is known to deteriorate while acquiring fast-rising, high-frequency, and nonrepetitive waveforms. Waveform digitizers (ADCs) used in high-voltage impulse recordings and measurements are invariably subjected to such waveforms. Errors resulting from a lowered ADC performance can be unacceptably high, especially when higher accuracies have to be achieved (e. g., when part of a reference measuring system). Static and dynamic nonlinearities (estimated independently) are <b>vital</b> <b>indices</b> for evaluating performance and suitability of ADCs {{to be used in}} such environments. Typically, the estimation of static nonlinearity involves 10 - 12 h of time or more (for a 12 -b ADC) and the acquisition of millions of samples at high input frequencies for dynamic characterization. ADCs with even higher resolution and faster sampling speeds will soon become available. So, {{there is a need to}} reduce testing time for evaluating these parameters. This paper proposes a novel and time-efficient method for the simultaneous estimation of static and dynamic nonlinearity from a single test. This is achieved by conceiving a test signal, comprised of a high-frequency sinusoid (which addresses dynamic assessment) modulated by a low-frequency ramp (relevant to the static part). Details of implementation and results on two digitizers are presented and compared with nonlinearities determined by the existing standardized approaches.

40|$|Background: Despite its wealth, {{excellent}} <b>vital</b> <b>indices</b> {{and robust}} health care infrastructure, Hong Kong has {{a relatively high}} incidence of tuberculosis (TB) (85. 4 per 100 000). Hong Kong residents have also experienced a very rapid and recent epidemiological transition; the population largely originated from migration by southern Chinese in the mid 20 th century. Given the potentially long latency period of TB infection, an investigation was undertaken {{to determine the extent}} to which TB incidence rates reflect the population history and the impact of public health interventions. Methods: An age-period-cohort model was used to break down the Hong Kong TB notification rates from 1961 to 2005 into the effects of age, calendar period and birth cohort. Results: Analysis by age showed a consistent pattern across all the cohorts by year of birth, with a peak in the relative risk of TB at 20 - 24 years of age. Analysis by year of birth showed an increase in the relative risk of TB from 1880 to 1900, stable risk until 1910, then a linear rate of decline from 1910 with an inflection point at 1990 for a steeper rate of decline. Period effects yielded only one inflection during the calendar years 1971 - 5. Conclusions: Economic development, social change and the World Health Organisation's short-course directly observed therapy (DOTS) strategy have contributed to TB control in Hong Kong. The linear cohort effect until 1990 suggests that a relatively high, but slowly falling, incidence of TB in Hong Kong will continue into the next few decades. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

50|$|Several tools {{exist to}} help {{physicians}} decide when to deprescribe and what medications {{can be added}} to a pharmaceutical regimen. The Beers Criteria and the STOPP/START criteria help identify medications that have the highest risk of adverse drug events (ADE) and drug-drug interactions. PRIMA-eds is an algorithm that takes many patient factors into its calculations and can offer medication and dosing recommendations to the provider. Parameters of PRIMA-eds include diagnoses, medications, ADEs, symptoms, body mass <b>index,</b> <b>vital</b> signs, laboratory results, and medical studies performed in the elderly.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Assess {{the effect}} of re-expansive {{respiratory}} patterns associated to respiratory biofeedback (RBF) on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and habits in individuals with functional mouth breathing (FMB). Methods: Sixty children with FMB were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was submitted to 15 sessions of re-expansive respiratory patterns associated to RBF (biofeedback pletsmovent; MICROHARD (R) V 1. 0), which provided biofeedback of the thoracic and abdominal movements. The control group was submitted to 15 sessions using biofeedback alone. Spirometry, maximum static respiratory pressure measurements and questions regarding habits (answered by parents/guardians) were carried out before and after therapy. The Student`s t-test for paired data and non-parametric tests were employed for statistical analysis at a 5 % Level of significance. Results: Significant changes were found in forced <b>vital.</b> capacity, Tiffeneau <b>index</b> scores, maximum expiratory pressure, maximum inspiratory pressure and habits assessed in FMB {{with the use of}} RBF associated to the re-expansive patterns. No significant differences were found comparing the experimental and control groups. Conclusions: The results allow the conclusion that RBF associated to re-expansive patterns improves forced <b>vital</b> capacity, Tiffeneau <b>index</b> scores, respiratory muscle strength and habits in FMB and can therefore be used as a form of therapy for such individuals.
