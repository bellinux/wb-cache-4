5000|$|<b>Vesicular</b> <b>film,</b> {{almost universally}} known as Kalvar, {{is a type}} of {{photographic}} film that is sensitive only to ultraviolet light and developed simply by heating the exposed film.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vesicular</b> <b>film</b> is sensitised with a diazo dye, which after {{exposure}} is developed by heat. Where light {{has come to}} the film remains clear, in the areas under the dark image the diazo compound is destroyed quickly, releasing millions of minute bubbles of nitrogen into the film. This produces an image that diffuses light. It produces a good black appearance in a reader, but it cannot be used for further copying.|$|E
50|$|The firm {{works with}} ANSI/AIIM {{standards}} for preservation microfilming. It has a humidity and temperature-controlled storage facility. It is a Kodak ImageGuard facility. One of its specializations is damaged microfilm recovery. It has an Extek 3441 microfilm duplicator, which duplicates at low speeds to prevent damage to Redox or Vinegar-Syndrome microfilm. It uses Kodak silver halide microfilm for master film and primary duplications. It discontinued {{the use of}} <b>vesicular</b> <b>film</b> for duplications, due to the poor quality film available from distributors. It claims to use Kodak BrownToner, a polysulfide film treatment, on every reel of silver-halide microfilm that they produce.|$|E
40|$|An altered Bausch and Lomb metallograph, in {{conjunction}} with a 150 watt high-pressure Xenon-arc lamp, was used to image 50 µm uniformly illuminated round spots on several vesicular emulsions and a silver emulsion to determine image spread characteristics with increasing exposure times. <b>Vesicular</b> <b>films</b> tested include Kalvar Types 16, 143, 163, and 164, a sample of Xidex Blue and a high resolution aerial film. It was found in all cases that image spread was more profound in <b>vesicular</b> <b>films</b> than in the silver film tested. It was also found that ten minute and twenty minute periods of time between exposure and development had varying effects on the final image size usually causing the image to shrink with increasing time interim. Many observations were made including an adjacency effect, 2 ̆ 2 latent images 2 ̆ 2 under the microscope, and what might be described as a three-dimensional view of the vesicle distribution in the image...|$|R
40|$|A general {{overview}} of microform usage in libraries is provided, emphasizing {{the impact of}} conversion of print materials to microforms on library patrons and library staff members. Diagnostic techniques are analyzed to determine the adaptability of both collections and clientele. Problems concerning the standardization of hardware, selection of the proper microform formats, {{and the use of}} silver halide, diazo, or <b>vesicular</b> <b>films</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Radiation of {{rhodamine}} 6 G is {{investigated in}} the ″photon boxes″ which are dyed polymeric samples in scattering cover of dielectric microparticles. These samples are multiple scattering media (MSM) in which {{interaction of the}} scattering microparticles with dye molecules is reduced considerably as compared to usually used MSM for random lasing (RL) what is important because of surface activity of these particles. In these samples coupled phenomenon of RL and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) was observed. Features of SRS-RL phenomenon are identical to ones observed in other investigated MSM (<b>vesicular</b> <b>films</b> and suspension of microparticles) what allow applying these samples for obtaining of dye Raman spectra. SRS efficiency in ″photon boxes″ grows under pump increase and decrease of volume ratio of its internal area and active (excited) region. The results show that ″photon boxes″ of minimal size are promising for Raman spectra studying using SRS-RL phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|A {{feasible}} {{technique for}} deriving the spread function and modulation transfer {{function of a}} <b>vesicular</b> <b>film</b> has been determined. This technique {{is based on a}} method described by R. Byer which does not require the use of a microdensitometer, but only that of a 2 ̆ 2 macro 2 ̆ 2 densitometer. The method utilizes the fact that a halftone dot will change in size as a function of exposure. The spread function of the <b>vesicular</b> <b>film</b> was approximated with a mathematical model. The results, although favorable in many ways, are not conclusive. Some of the advantages and disadvantages associated with this technique as applied to <b>vesicular</b> <b>film</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The Modulation Transfer Function and {{adjacency}} {{effects are}} important measurements of a photographic material. For <b>vesicular</b> <b>film</b> {{it is of}} interest to investigate the MTF and adjacency effects with relation to the three variable parameters, development temperature, exposure and development time. This investigation clearly shows that adjacency effects do occur in <b>vesicular</b> <b>film,</b> and that exposure and development temperature are important factors in determinating the film MTF...|$|E
40|$|The random lasing (RL) {{emission}} of dyed <b>vesicular</b> polymeric <b>films</b> in diffusive regime of light propagation was investigated under helium temperature. It represents itself the coupling effect of stimulated emission and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). Due {{to the effect}} a set of Raman lines reveal in RL spectrum. Distinguishing feature of the effect is the stimulated emission promotes the Raman lines revealing. Intensity of Raman lines have quadratic trend on pump intensity. Furthermore SRS in this condition has the more structured spectrum than spontaneous Raman one. It makes enable detection even the weak and close located spectral lines.

40|$|During {{mineralization}} of the avian eggshell, {{there is}} a sequential and orderly deposition of both matrix and mineral phases. Therefore, the eggshell is an excellent model for studying matrix–mineral relationships and the regulation of mineralization. Osteopontin, as an inhibitor of crystal growth, potently influences the formation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate biominerals. The {{purpose of this study}} was to characterize matrix–mineral relationships, specifically for osteopontin, in the avian eggshell using high-resolution transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy to gain insight into how calcite crystal growth is structured and compartmentalized during eggshell mineralization. Osteopontin was localized at the ultrastructural level by colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry. In EDTA-decalcified eggshell, an extensive matrix network was observed by TEM and SEM throughout all regions and included interconnected fibrous sheets, irregularly shaped aggregates, <b>vesicular</b> structures, protein <b>films,</b> and isolated protein fibers. Osteopontin was associated with protein sheets in the highly mineralized palisades region; some of these features defined boundaries that compartmentalized different eggshell structural units. In fractured and undecalcified eggshell, osteopontin was immunolocalized on the { 104 } crystallographic faces of calcite—its natural cleavage plane. The specific occlusion of osteopontin into calcite during mineralization may influence eggshell structure to modify its fracture resistance. (J Histochem Cytochem 56 : 467 – 476, 2008...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPhospholipid films can be {{preserved}} in vitro when adsorbed to a solidifiable hypophase. Suspensions of natural surfactant, lipid extract surfactants, and artificial surfactants {{were added to}} a sodium alginate solution and filled into a captive bubble surfactometer (CBS). Surfactant film was formed by adsorption to the bubble of the CBS for functional tests. There were no discernible differences in adsorption, film compressibility or minimal surface tension on quasi-static or dynamic compression for films formed in {{the presence or absence}} of alginate in the subphase of the bubble. The hypophase-film complex was solidified by adding calcium ions to the suspension with the alginate. The preparations were stained with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate for transmission electron microscopy. The most noteworthy findings are: (1) Surfactants do adsorb to the surface of the bubble and form osmiophilic lining layers. Pure DPPC films could not be visualized. (2) A distinct structure of a particular surfactant film depends on the composition and the concentration of surfactant in the bulk phase, and on whether or not the films are compressed after their formation. The films appear heterogeneous, and frequent <b>vesicular</b> and multi-lamellar <b>film</b> segments are seen associated with the interfacial films. These features are seen already upon film formation by adsorption, but multi-lamellar segments are more frequent after film compression. (3) The rate of film formation, its compressibility, and the minimum surface tension achieved on film compression appear to be related to the film structure formed on adsorption, which in turn is related to the concentration of the surfactant suspension from which the film is formed. The osmiophilic surface associated surfactant material seen is likely important for the surface properties and the mechanical stability of the surfactant film at the air–fluid interface...|$|R
