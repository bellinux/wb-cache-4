40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> with <b>load</b> velocity control ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional <b>load</b> control <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> to achieve <b>load</b> velocity control ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> achieve <b>load</b> velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the load velocity control ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> a fast opening feature. An actual <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good load velocity control ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R
