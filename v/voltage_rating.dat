Due to the limits of oxide growth, there is a limit on the maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of tantalum oxide for each of the presently available tantalum powders (see Figure 3).|$|E
25|$|Paper as {{carrier of}} the {{electrodes}} has {{the advantages of}} lower cost and somewhat better adherence of metallization to paper than to polymer films. But paper alone as dielectric in capacitors is not reliable enough for the growing quality requirements of modern applications. The combination of paper together with polypropylene film dielectric is a cost-effective way to improve quality and performance. The better adhering of metallization on paper is advantageous especially at high current pulse loads, and the polypropylene film dielectric increases the <b>voltage</b> <b>rating.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{capacitors}} with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of ≤ 315 volts {{the surge}} voltage is 1.15 times the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> exceeding 315 volts the surge voltage is 1.10 times the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
25|$|Capacitance of MLCC chips {{depends on}} the dielectric, the size and the {{required}} <b>voltage</b> (<b>rated</b> <b>voltage).</b> Capacitance values start at about 1pF. The maximum capacitance value {{is determined by the}} production technique. For X7R that is 47µF, for Y5V: 100µF.|$|R

For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> {{of up to}} 315V, the surge voltage is 1.15 times the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> exceeding 315V, the surge voltage is 1.10 times the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
25|$|Larger surface areas produce higher capacitance; thus high CV/g powders, {{which have}} lower average {{particle}} sizes, {{are used for}} low voltage, high capacitance parts. By choosing the correct powder type and sintering temperature, a specific capacitance or <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> can be achieved. For example, a 220μF 6V capacitor will have a surface area close to 346cm2, or 80% {{of the size of}} a sheet of paper (US Letter, 8.5×11inch paper has area ~413cm2), although the total volume of the pellet is only about 0.0016cm3.|$|E
25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt DC power supply. The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|E
25|$|Dielectric {{absorption}} is {{a property}} {{which has been}} long known. Its value {{can be measured in}} accordance with the IEC/EN 60384-1 standard. The capacitor shall be charged at the DC <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> for 60 minutes. Then the capacitor shall be disconnected from the power source and shall be discharged for 10s. The voltage regained on the capacitor terminals (recovery voltage) within 15 minutes is the dielectric absorption voltage. The size of the dielectric absorption voltage is specified in relation to the applied voltage in percent and depends on the dielectric material used. It is specified by many manufacturers in the data sheets.|$|E
30|$|At present DC line {{protection}} is mainly provided by manufacturers e.g. ABB and Siemens. The discrimination criterion {{of the single}} end protection algorithm {{is based on the}} super-imposed <b>voltage,</b> the <b>rate</b> of change of the voltage traveling wave, and the gradient of the change in the current. On 27 th August 2007, the <b>voltage</b> <b>rate</b> of change of the traveling wave protection did not operate for a high resistance fault (fault resistance 295 Ω) on the GeNan HVDC transmission line. Similarly, during the operations of the TianGuang HVDC transmission line project in recent years, the <b>voltage</b> <b>rate</b> of change of the traveling wave protection has often failed to operate for high impedance faults. Since the rate of change protection is affected by fault location and fault resistance, its operation threshold is set to ensure no mal-operation for external fault. As a result of this it can not guarantee the reliable operation for internal fault.|$|R

For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> of up to 315 V, the surge voltage is 1.15 times the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage,</b> and for capacitors with a <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> exceeding 315 V, the surge voltage is 1.10 times the <b>rated</b> <b>voltage.</b>|$|R
25|$|FETs {{often have}} a very low 'on' {{resistance}} and have a high 'off' resistance. However the intermediate resistances are significant, and so FETs can dissipate large amounts of power while switching. Thus efficiency can put a premium on switching quickly, but this can cause transients that can excite stray inductances and generate significant voltages that can couple to the gate and cause unintentional switching. FET circuits can therefore require very careful layout and can involve trades between switching speed and power dissipation. There is also a trade-off between <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> and 'on' resistance, so high voltage FETs have a relatively high 'on' resistance and hence conduction losses.|$|E
25|$|Practical devices {{capable of}} {{operating}} {{over an extended}} current range were first reported by Baliga et al. in 1982. A similar paper was also submitted by J. P. Russel et al. to IEEE Electron Device Letter in 1982. The applications for the device were initially regarded by the power electronics community to be severely restricted by its slow switching speed and latch-up of the parasitic thyristor structure inherent within the device. However, it was demonstrated by Baliga and also by A. M. Goodman et al. in 1983 that the switching speed could be adjusted over a broad range by using electron irradiation. This was followed by demonstration of operation of the device at elevated temperatures by Baliga in 1985. Successful efforts to suppress the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor and the scaling of the <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of the devices at GE allowed the introduction of commercial devices in 1983, which could be utilized {{for a wide variety}} of applications.|$|E
500|$|VFDs are {{available}} with voltage and current ratings covering {{a wide range of}} single-phase and multi-phase AC motors. Low-voltage (LV) drives are designed to operate at output voltages equal to or less than 690V. While motor-application LV drives {{are available}} in ratings of up to the order of 5or6 MW, economic considerations typically favor medium-voltage (MV) drives with much lower power ratings. [...] Different MV drive topologies (see Table 2) are configured in accordance with the voltage/current-combination ratings used in different drive controllers' switching devices such that any given <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> is {{greater than or equal to}} one to the following standard nominal motor voltage ratings: generally either 2.3/4.16kV (60Hz) or 3.3/6.6kV (50Hz), with one thyristor manufacturer rated for up to 12kV switching. In some applications a step-up transformer is placed between a LV drive and a MV motor load. MV drives are typically rated for motor applications [...] greater than between about 375kW (500HP) and 750kW (1000hp). MV drives have historically required considerably more application design effort than required for LV drive applications. The power rating of MV drives can reach 100MW, a range of different drive topologies being involved for different rating, performance, power quality, and reliability requirements.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> {{includes}} a safety margin against the electrolyte's {{breakdown voltage at}} which the electrolyte decomposes. The breakdown voltage decomposes the separating solvent molecules in the Helmholtz double-layer, f. e. water splits into hydrogen and oxide.

2500|$|As {{in other}} areas of electronics, {{volumetric}} efficiency measures the performance of electronic function per unit volume. For capacitors, the volumetric efficiency is measured with the [...] "CV product", calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> (V), divided by the volume. From 1970 to 2005, volumetric efficiencies have improved dramatically.|$|E

[...] Of the straight-blade NEMA 14 devices, only the 14-30 and 14-50 are in common use. The 14-30 {{is used for}} electric clothes dryers, the 14-50 is used for electric cooking ranges, and either may {{also be used for}} home charging of electric vehicles.

2500|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of {{electrolytic}} capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications {{it is important}} to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specify a [...] "temperature derated voltage" [...] for a higher temperature, the [...] "category voltage UC". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range TC.

[...] Two such converters are provided {{at each end of}} the scheme, which is of conventional bipolar construction. [...] Since 2007 the highest <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of a single HVDC converter has been the ±450kV NorNed scheme linking Norway to the Netherlands, which has only a single converter at each end in an arrangement that is unusual for an LCC HVDC scheme.|$|E
2500|$|An IGBT {{features}} a significantly lower {{forward voltage drop}} compared to a conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although, MOSFETS exhibit much lower forward voltage at lower current densities due {{to the absence of}} a diode Vf in the IGBT's output BJT. As the blocking <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced. However, this resultant reduction in on-state forward voltage comes with several penalties: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of {{the fuse}} must {{be equal to}} or, greater than, {{what would become the}} {{open-circuit}} voltage.

[...] If a 32V fuse attempts to interrupt the 120 or 230 V source, an arc may result. [...] Plasma inside the glass tube may continue to conduct current until the current diminishes {{to the point where the}} plasma becomes a non-conducting gas. [...] Rated voltage should be higher than the maximum voltage source it would have to disconnect. Connecting fuses in series does not increase the rated voltage of the combination, nor of any one fuse.|$|E

Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7V per [...] "cell", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often {{an extension of the}} diode's metal substrate), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require.

2500|$|Power MOSFETs have a {{different}} structure. As with most power devices, the structure is vertical and not planar. Using a vertical structure, {{it is possible for}} the transistor to sustain both high blocking voltage and high current. The <b>voltage</b> <b>rating</b> of the transistor {{is a function of the}} doping and thickness of the N-epitaxial layer (see cross section), while the current rating is a function of the channel width (the wider the channel, the higher the current). In a planar structure, the current and breakdown voltage ratings are both a function of the channel dimensions (respectively width and length of the channel), resulting in inefficient use of the [...] "silicon estate". With the vertical structure, the component area is roughly proportional to the current it can sustain, and the component thickness (actually the N-epitaxial layer thickness) is proportional to the breakdown voltage.|$|E
