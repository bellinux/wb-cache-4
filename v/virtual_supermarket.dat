40|$|Motivated {{by product}} {{detection}} in supermarkets, this paper studies {{the problem of}} object proposal generation in supermarket images and other natural images. We argue that estimation of object scales in images is helpful for generating object proposals, especially for supermarket images where object scales are usually within a small range. Therefore, we propose to estimate object scales of images before generating object proposals. The proposed method for predicting object scales is called ScaleNet. To validate the effectiveness of ScaleNet, we build three supermarket datasets, {{two of which are}} real-world datasets used for testing and the other one is a synthetic dataset used for training. In short, we extend the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods by adding a scale prediction phase. The resulted method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the supermarket datasets by a large margin. We also show that the approach works for object proposal on other natural images and it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art object proposal methods on the MS COCO dataset. The <b>supermarket</b> datasets, the <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarkets,</b> and the tools for creating more synthetic datasets will be made public...|$|R

Besides episodic memory dysfunction they show deficits in accessing contextual knowledge that further specifies a general spatial navigation task or an executive function (EF) virtual action planning. There has been only one previous work with virtual reality and the use of a <b>virtual</b> action planning <b>supermarket</b> for the diagnosis of mild {{cognitive impairment}}. The authors of that study examined the feasibility and the validity of the <b>virtual</b> action planning <b>supermarket</b> (VAP-S) for the diagnosis of patients with {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) and found that the VAP-S is a viable tool to assess EF deficits. In our study we employed the in-house platform of virtual action planning museum (VAP-M) and a sample of 25 MCI and 25 controls, in order to investigate deficits in spatial navigation, prospective memory and executive function. In addition, we used the morphology of late components in event-related potential (ERP) responses, as a marker for cognitive dysfunction. The related measurements were fed to a common classification scheme facilitating the direct comparison of both approaches. Our results indicate that both the VAP-M and ERP averages were able to differentiate between healthy elders and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and agree with the findings of the <b>virtual</b> action planning <b>supermarket</b> (VAP-S). The sensitivity (specificity) was 100 % (98 %) for the VAP-M data and 87 %(90 %) for the ERP responses. Considering that ERPs have proven to advance the early detection and diagnosis of "presymptomatic AD", the suggested VAP-M platform appears as an appealing alternative...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} recognition that supermarkets {{are an important}} environment for health-promoting interventions such as fiscal food policies or front-of-pack nutrition labeling. However, due to the complexities of undertaking such research in the real world, well-designed randomized controlled trials on these kinds of interventions are lacking. The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> is a 3 -dimensional computerized research environment designed to enable experimental studies in a supermarket setting without the complexity or costs normally associated with undertaking such research. Objective: The primary objective was to validate the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> by comparing virtual and real-life food purchasing behavior. A secondary objective was to obtain participant feedback on perceived sense of "presence" (the subjective experience of being in one place or environment even if physically located in another) in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket.</b> Methods: Eligible main household shoppers (New Zealand adults aged ≥ 18 years) were asked to conduct 3 shopping occasions in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> over 3 consecutive weeks, complete the validated Presence Questionnaire Items Stems, and collect their real supermarket grocery till receipts for that same period. Proportional expenditure (NZ$) {{and the proportion of}} products purchased over 18 major food groups were compared between the virtual and real supermarkets. Data were analyzed using repeated measures mixed models. Results: A total of 123 participants consented {{to take part in the}} study. In total, 69. 9 % (86 / 123) completed 1 shop in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket,</b> 64. 2 % (79 / 123) completed 2 shops, 60. 2 % (74 / 123) completed 3 shops, and 48. 8 % (60 / 123) returned their real supermarket till receipts. The 4 food groups with the highest relative expenditures were the same for the virtual and real supermarkets: fresh fruit and vegetables (virtual estimate: 14. 3 %; real: 17. 4 %), bread and bakery (virtual: 10. 0 %; real: 8. 2 %), dairy (virtual: 19. 1 %; real: 12. 6 %), and meat and fish (virtual: 16. 5 %; real: 16. 8 %). Significant differences in proportional expenditures were observed for 6 food groups, with largest differences (virtual - real) for dairy (in expenditure 6. 5 %, P<. 001; in items 2. 2 %, P=. 04) and fresh fruit and vegetables (in expenditure: - 3. 1 %, P=. 04; in items: 5. 9 %, P=. 002). There was no trend of overspending in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> and participants experienced a medium-to-high presence (88 %, 73 / 83 scored medium; 8 %, 7 / 83 scored high). Conclusions: Shopping patterns in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> were comparable to those in real life. Overall, the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> is a valid tool to measure food purchasing behavior. Nevertheless, it is important to improve the functionality of some food categories, in particular fruit and vegetables and dairy. The results of this validation will assist in making further improvements to the software and with optimization of the internal and external validity of this innovative methodology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Economic {{interventions}} {{in the food}} environment are expected to effectively promote healthier food choices. However, before introducing them on a large scale, {{it is important to}} gain insight into the effectiveness of economic interventions and peoples' genuine reactions to price changes. Nonetheless, because of complex implementation issues, studies on price interventions are virtually non-existent. This is especially true for experiments undertaken in a retail setting. We have developed a research tool to study the effects of retail price {{interventions in}} a virtual-reality setting: the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket.</b> This paper aims to inform researchers about the features and utilization of this new software application. Results The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> is a Dutch-developed three-dimensional software application in which study participants can shop in a manner comparable to a real supermarket. The tool can be used to study several food pricing and labelling strategies. The application base can be used to build future extensions and could be translated into, for example, an English-language version. The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> contains a front-end which is seen by the participants, and a back-end that enables researchers to easily manipulate research conditions. The application keeps track of time spent shopping, number of products purchased, shopping budget, total expenditures and answers on configurable questionnaires. All data is digitally stored and automatically sent to a web server. A pilot study among Dutch consumers (n = 66) revealed that the application accurately collected and stored all data. Results from participant feedback revealed that 83 % of the respondents considered the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> easy to understand and 79 % found that their virtual grocery purchases resembled their regular groceries. Conclusions The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> is an innovative research tool with a great potential to assist in gaining insight into food purchasing behaviour. The application can be obtained via an URL and is freely available for academic use. The unique features of the tool include the fact that it enables researchers to easily modify research conditions and in this way study different types of interventions in a retail environment without a complex implementation process. Finally, it also maintains researcher independence and avoids conflicts of interest that may arise from industry collaboration. </p...|$|E

40|$|In many {{supermarkets}} throughout Europe, it {{has become}} common practice in the fruit and vegetable department to offer options in plastic packaging. Recent trends, however, move towards the removal of packaging. The current study examines whether offering fruit and vegetables without primary packaging {{increases the likelihood that}} consumers choose these products. This is especially relevant for organic fruit and vegetables, given that plastic may be perceived as contrary to the sustainable nature of these products. A first experiment, using a student sample and an immersive 3 D <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> environment, shows that choice for organic fruit and vegetables indeed increases when organics are offered without packaging. A second experiment with the <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> generalizes these findings to a sample of supermarket patrons, additionally showing that unpacked fruit and vegetables are preferred over packed options overall, both for organic and non-organic products. We conclude that removing the primary packaging of organic fruit and vegetables appears to be a promising intervention in attempts to increase organic sales. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There is a {{need for}} {{accurate}} and precise food price elasticities (PE, change in consumer demand in response to change in price) to better inform policy on health-related food taxes and subsidies. Methods/Design The Price Experiment and Modelling (Price ExaM) study aims to: I) derive accurate and precise food PE values; II) quantify the impact of price changes on quantity and quality of discrete food group purchases and; III) model the potential health and disease impacts of a range of food taxes and subsidies. To achieve this, we will use a novel method that includes a randomised <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> experiment and econometric methods. Findings will be applied in simulation models to estimate population health impact (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) using a multi-state life-table model. The study will consist of four sequential steps: 1. We generate 5000 price sets with random price variation for all 1412 <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> food and beverage products. Then we add systematic price variation for foods to simulate five taxes and subsidies: a fruit and vegetable subsidy and taxes on sugar, saturated fat, salt, and sugar-sweetened beverages. 2. Using an experimental design, 1000 adult New Zealand shoppers complete five household grocery shops in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> where they are {{randomly assigned to one of}} the 5000 price sets each time. 3. Output data (i. e., multiple observations of price configurations and purchased amounts) are used as inputs to econometric models (using Bayesian methods) to estimate accurate PE values. 4. A disease simulation model will be run with the new PE values as inputs to estimate QALYs gained and health costs saved for the five policy interventions. Discussion The Price ExaM study has the potential to enhance public health and economic disciplines by introducing internationally novel scientific methods to estimate accurate and precise food PE values. These values will be used to model the potential health and disease impacts of various food pricing policy options. Findings will inform policy on health-related food taxes and subsidies.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} a virtual reality (VR) environment in order to investigate participants’ in-store visual search for bottles of wines displaying a prominent triangular shape on their label. The experimental task involved virtually moving along a wine aisle in a <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> while searching for the wine bottle on the shelf that had a different triangle on its label from the other bottles. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the participants identified the bottle with a downward-pointing triangle on its label more rapidly than when looking for an upward-pointing triangle on the label instead. This finding replicates the downward-pointing triangle superiority (DPTS) effect, though {{the magnitude of this}} effect was more pronounced in the first as compared to {{the second half of the}} experiment, suggesting a modulating role of practice. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that the DPTS effect was also modulated by the location of the target on the shelf. Interestingly, however, the results of a follow-up survey demonstrate that the orientation of the triangle did not influence the participants’ evaluation of the wine bottles. Taken together, these findings reveal how in-store the attention of consumers might be influenced by the design elements in product packaging. These results therefore suggest that shopping in a <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> might offer a practical means of assessing the shelf standout of product packaging, which has important implications for food marketing...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{disorientation}} is {{a prominent}} feature of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) attributed to degeneration of medial temporal and parietal brain regions, including the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). By contrast, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) syndromes show generally intact spatial orientation at presentation. However, currently no clinical tasks are routinely administered to objectively assess spatial orientation in these neurodegenerative conditions. In {{this study we}} investigated spatial orientation in 58 dementia patients and 23 healthy controls using a novel <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> task as well as voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compared performance on this task with visual and verbal memory function, which has traditionally been used to discriminate between AD and FTD. Participants viewed a series of videos from a first person perspective travelling through a <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> and were required to maintain orientation to a starting location. Analyses revealed significantly impaired spatial orientation in AD, compared to FTD patient groups. Spatial orientation performance was found to discriminate AD and FTD patient groups to a very high degree at presentation. More importantly, integrity of the RSC {{was identified as a}} key neural correlate of orientation performance. These findings confirm the notion that i) it is feasible to assess spatial orientation objectively via our novel Supermarket task; ii) impaired orientation is a prominent feature that can be applied clinically to discriminate between AD and FTD and iii) the RSC emerges as a critical biomarker to assess spatial orientation deficits in these neurodegenerative conditions...|$|E

Four interaction techniques have been designed and compared in terms of usability, performance and workload with healthy volunteer participants. These techniques go beyond the desktop paradigm by offering a more immersive and intuitive way of interaction.

40|$|Prism {{adaptation}} (PA) {{is responsible}} for an expansion of sensori-motor after-effects to cognitive domains for patients with spatial neglect. One important {{question is whether the}} cognitive after-effects induced by PA may also concern higher aspects of spatial cognition, such as navigation and topographic memory, which are critical in everyday life. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether multiple sessions of right PA can affect navigation and topographic memory. Seven right brain-damaged (RBD) patients with chronic neglect were included. We used a <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> named VAP-S which is an original paradigm, similar to the “shopping list test” during which patients had to purchase items from a list of eight products. Furthermore, in order to assess generalization of PA effects on constructing a spatial map from virtual information, each participant was then asked to draw the map of the <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> from memory. Regarding navigation performance, significant results were obtained: session duration reduction, fewer numbers of pauses and omissions, more items purchased on the left side and more items purchased over all. A long-lasting effect was noted, up to one month after PA. The representational task performance was also significantly increased for map drawing, with a reduction of the right shift of the symmetry axis of the map, more items drawn on the left side of maps and over all, and more items correctly located on the map. Some of these effects lasted for at least 7 days. These results suggest an expansion of PA benefit to a virtual environment. Crucially, the cognitive benefits induced by PA were noted for complex spatial cognition tasks required in everyday life such as navigation and topographic memory and this improvement was maintained for up to 1 month...|$|E

Objective: Assess the integrity of egocentric and allocentric heading orientation and memory in bvFTD and AD, and their clinical implications. Method: A cohort of 22 patient with dementia (11 bvFTD; 11 AD) and 14 healthy controls were assessed on the <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> task of spatial orientation and a battery of standardized neuropsychological measures of visual and verbal memory performance. Results: Judgements of egocentric and allocentric heading direction were differentially impaired in bvFTD and AD, with AD performing significantly worse on egocentric heading judgements than bvFTD. Both patient cohorts, however, showed similar degree of impaired allocentric spatial representation, and associated hippocampal pathology.

40|$|Introduction Simulating a store {{environment}} by using virtual reality techniques offers important potential advantages for research into consumer behaviour. Through {{the use of}} virtual reality, the store can be simulated in a realistic and cost-efficient way [1, 9]. This allows researchers to collect data in a tightly controlled but realistic store environment, at relatively low cost and high flexibility [3]. <b>Virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> systems {{are being used to}} study consumers’ reactions to price changes of food products [12], emotional responses to retail environments [6], and responses to emptied shelf space [4]. In order to fulfil its promise, a good understanding of which types of responses in a virtual environment resemble real-life behaviour, and which do not, is vital. Identifying areas where caution is needed can prevent unjustified generalizations of virtual reality outcomes [3]. At the same time, {{it is important to understand}} what the added realism of virtual reality has to offer, over and above the use of simpler pictorial stimulus materials. For instance, prior research has shown that an increase in visual realism can enhance spatial learning of a virtual layout [7] and effectiveness and efficiency in navigation tasks [8]. The present study builds on and extends this work by comparing a choice task using virtual reality to both a shopping trip in a real brick-and-mortar supermarket (with a similar choice task) and a choice task using product pictures. The key question is in which ways the choice behaviour of consumers is well represented in a <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket,</b> and on which variables there are deviations from reality. A few prior studies have examined how consumer choices in a virtual store environment compare to actual sales data (e. g., [2, 3]). Yet, there are many reasons why market shares may differ from choices made in a virtual environment, and not all are related to the use of virtual reality as such. Benchmarking against existing methodologies is important to gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these methods. In virtual reality, as opposed to a pictorial representation, people have a better view of individual products from all angles, have a better feel for the shelf space assigned to products and the way shelves are organized, can manoeuvre through the store, and get a better feel for the overall store atmosphere. Taken together, this should increase people’s sense of being present in the virtual store and possibly allow for more habitual consumer behaviour to occur...|$|E

The task was based on the 2010 3 D UI Grand Prize competition [2], see Figure 1. Participants started at location “AS ” and navigated the supermarket to find objects in a specific order. Once collected, items had to be placed on table at location “BS”. Finally, participants rotated each object to match the orientation of the corresponding reference item. Participants repeated this task five times for each condition...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive deficit {{presents}} {{a significant problem}} affecting the life of schizophrenia patients. Despite the variability of the deficit, which influences almost all cognitive domains, the most profound seems to be deficit in memory and executive functioning with direct impact on daily functioning of patients with schizophrenia. As the pharmacologic interventions {{do not seem to}} bring satisfying results, the cognitive remediation seems to bet the most effective way of intervention of the deficit. Efficacy of cognitive remediation approach was repeatedly confirmed on the level of structural and functional changes of the brain. Nevertheless, often discussed are the issues of ecological validity of cognitive remediation and its controversial ability of transfer of acquired abilities and skills into the real life. In this work, we present development of a new method potentially applicable in the remediation of deficit of declarative memory in schizophrenia patients designed in ecologically valid environment of <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket.</b> In the first two pilot studies, we tested the functionality of the task in the healthy volunteers and we compared their performance in the virtual task with the results in standard psychological memory tests. After considering the findings from the pilot studies, we verified the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, Virtual Reality {{technologies}} {{have emerged as}} assessment and treatment tools in neuropsychology. In this chapter, we will explore {{the possibility of using}} Virtual Reality to improve the traditional neuropsychological assessment of executive functions. First, we will discuss the advantages offered by Virtual Reality to more traditional approaches. Then, the chapter details the characteristics of the Virtual Multiple Errands Test (VMET), a virtual reality tool developed using NeuroVR ([URL] free virtual reality platform useful for the assessment and neurorehabilitation. Specifically, the VMET is an assessment protocol of executive functions, where participants are invited to navigate a <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket,</b> completing tasks that require certain rules. In the chapter, we will present the detailed description of its clinical rationale and its different phases. Furthermore, a systematic analysis of the results obtained in different studies using the VMET will be outlined. Finally, we will discuss the potentiality of the VMET for integrating the traditional neuropsychological evaluation of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Detection of early executive deficits in Parkinson’s disease could facilitate the identification of patients at risk to develop dementia, and could give the chance to develop early neurorehabilitation interventions...|$|E
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} {{supermarket}} optimization simulation model called Swarm-Moves {{is based on}} self organized complex system studies to identify parameters and their values that can influence customers to buy more on impulse in a given period of time. In the proposed model, customers are assumed to have trolleys equipped with technology like RFID that can aid the passing of products' information directly from the store to them in real-time and vice-versa. Therefore, {{they can get the}} information about other customers purchase patterns and constantly informing the store of their own shopping behavior. This can be easily achieved because the trolleys "know" what products they contain at any point. The Swarm-Moves simulation is the <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> providing the visual display to run and test the proposed model. The simulation is also flexible to incorporate any given model of customers' behavior tailored to particular supermarket, settings, events or promotions. The results, although preliminary, are promising to use RFID technology for marketing products in supermarkets and provide several dimensions to look for influencing customers via feedback, real-time marketing, target advertisement and on-demand promotions. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{access to}} healthy foods and {{beverages}} in disadvantaged communities {{is a public}} health priority due to alarmingly high rates of obesity. The <b>Virtual</b> <b>Supermarket</b> Program (VSP) is a Baltimore City Health Department program that uses online grocery ordering to deliver food to low-income neighborhoods. This study evaluates stakeholder preferences and barriers of program implementation. Methods This study assessed the feasibility, sustainability and efficacy of the VSP by surveying 93 customers and interviewing 14 programmatic stakeholders who had recently used the VSP or been involved with program design and implementation. Results We identified the following themes: The VSP addressed transportation barriers and food availability. The VSP impacted customers and the city by including improving food purchasing behavior, creating a food justice “brand for the city”, and fostering a sense of community. Customers appreciated using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to pay for groceries, but policy changes are needed allow online processing of SNAP benefits. Conclusions This evaluation summarizes lessons learned {{and serves as a}} guide to other public health leaders interested in developing similar programs. Provisions in the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Farm Bill 2014 allow for select grocers to pilot online transactions with SNAP benefits. If these pilots are efficacious, the VSP model could be easily disseminated...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether implicit measures of associations with snack foods and food consumer behaviour could be changed through a picture-picture evaluative conditioning procedure. In the experimental condition (n= 41), female participants completed a conditioning procedure in which pictures of snack foods were paired {{with images of}} negatively valenced female body shapes, and pictures of fruits were paired with images of positively valenced body shapes. In a control condition (n= 44), snack and fruit stimuli were randomly paired with positively and negatively valenced body shapes. Implicit measures of associations with high-fat snack foods were obtained by using a positive and a negative unipolar single category Implicit Association Test (sc-IAT). A <b>virtual</b> <b>supermarket</b> task {{was used to assess}} food consumer behaviour. Results indicated that participants in the experimental condition held a less positive association with high-fat foods on the positive sc-IAT and a more negative association with these foods on the negative sc-IAT as compared to control participants. Opposed to our hypothesis, no behavioural {{differences were found between the}} groups. These results imply that this form of associative learning can produce shifts in implicit measures of food evaluations, though behavioural effects were absent.
