DMABI is an organic isolator with a wide energy gap and high quantum efficiency of the photogeneration, DMABI derivatives have received also considerable attention because of its large dipole moment and optical nonlinearities. Besides, since it is a photosensitive material, its use in solar systems is very promising. The energy gap of each material and combined system was observed from the spectral dependence of the quantum efficiency of the photoconductivity and results are compared with results of oxidation and reduction potential of the materials.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} commercial supercapacitors performance (ESR, C, self-discharge, Pmax, Emax, coulumbic efficiency, etc), under different conditions. Characterization of supercapacitor performances {{as a function of}} current, voltage, frequency and thermal constraints, is carried out by constant current test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and <b>voltamperometry.</b> A comparative study of measurement techniques is conducted in detail in this work. The supercapacitor self-discharge amplitude is determined by measuring the decline of open-circuit voltage. The mechanisms of the self-discharge, leakage current and diffusion of ions at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces are modelled by a new electrical equivalent circuit. In addition, we model the electrochemical impedance of self-discharge with diffusion-controlled in frequency domain. Supercapacitor is represented by two complementary electrical equivalent circuits: two branches and non-homogeny pores. The first represents the supercapacitor time behaviour. The second represents supercapacitor dynamic behaviour. Finally, the origin and a new model of pseudoinductance are described...|$|E
40|$|We report here on {{thin films}} proton-working {{electrochromic}} devices {{based on the}} well-known tungsten oxide as the coloring electrode, and Antimony Tin Oxide (ATO) as the ion-storage counter-electrode. We show that films deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique have an apparent Sb solubility up to 70 at %, and exhibit unusual electrochromic properties. Through potentiostatic tests we'll demonstrate that depending on the composition which influences film morphology, the Sn-Sb-O films could either present a faradic or a capacitive-like behavior, associated to a color or a neutral switching {{over a wide range}} of potentials, respectively. The structural properties of ATO films are characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochromic behavior is studied by means of cyclic <b>voltamperometry</b> coupled with ex situ optical transmittance measurements in the visible range. The maximum proton-storage capacity is observed for ATO films containing 40 - 50 at % Sb, while being quasi-neutral when switching over a wide range of potentials.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of calcareous deposits processes in a marine environment results in simultaneous {{effects of the}} following parameters: temperature, polarization potential, interfacial pH, chemical composition, etc [...] The comprehension of these processes implies studies in artificial seawater and a follow-up of the parameters by <b>voltamperometry</b> and chronoamperometry. Calcareous deposits electrochemically are very often used to follow up the evolution of scale deposition in desalination circuits. Again, the scale formation is brought about by electrochemical reduction of dissolved oxygen. The hydroxyl ions formed on the metallic surface engender a rise of interfacial pH which causes calcareous deposition (CaCO 3 and Mg(OH) 2). This reaction goes with reaction of hydrogen evolution which could disrupt the formed deposit. A study is carried out in a solution of seawater ASTM without calcium and without magnesium (so that the deposit will not be formed) on a titanium rotating disk electrode monitored between 300 and 1000 rpm. Study shows that Levich criterion is checked for the four values of selected potential on the diffusion plateau and a very cathodic polarization potential and a high temperature favors hydrogen current rat...|$|E
40|$|Properties and {{behavior}} {{of a group of}} four newly synthesized derivatives of terthiophene and terthienylenvinylene was studied. All four investigated monomers bear a 1, 3 -indandione substituent at the central thiophene ring and two of them (ThIV, ThIVM) have additional vinyl bonds introduced between the thiophene rings. In addition, ThIM and ThIVM have 5 positions of the two terminal rings blocked with methyl groups. The measurements were done using cyclic <b>voltamperometry</b> (CV) in solutions of 0. 1 M Bu 4 NBF 4 in CH 2 Cl 2. It was found that ThI and ThIV polymerise easily. CV of ThI reveals a reduction peak resulting probably from the abstraction of a proton. During polymerisation of ThIV a group of peaks is observed indicating its stepwise oxidation process. The polymerisation potential of ThIV was found to be lower than that of ThI which could mean that formation of radical-cation is easier in the former. Stability measurements indicated that polymer films of ThI are electrochemically stable in CH 2 Cl 2 and films of ThIV are not. Efforts to polymerise ThIM and ThIVM failed.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the factors responsible for the poor electrochemical performances of the olivine-type LiMnPO 4, various experiments such as chemical delithiation, galvanostatic charge and discharge, cyclic <b>voltamperometry,</b> and impedance conductivity, were carried out on both LiFePO 4 and LiMnPO 4. Chemical delithiation experiments confirmed a topotactic two-phase electrochemical mechanism between LiMnPO 4 and the fully delithiated phase MnPO 4 (a = 5. 909 (5) Å, b = 9. 64 (1) Å, and c = 4. 768 (6) Å). We conclude that the limiting factor in the MnPO 4 /LiMnPO 4 electrochemical reaction is nested mostly in the ionic and/or electronic transport within the LiMnPO 4 particles themselves rather than in charge transfer kinetics or structural instability of the MnPO 4 phase. For instance, the electrical conductivity of LiMnPO 4 (σ ∼ 3. 10 - 9 S cm - 1 at 573 K, ΔE ∼ 1. 1 eV) {{was found to be}} several orders of magnitude lower than that of LiFePO 4 (σ ∼ 10 - 9 S cm - 1 at 298 K, ΔE ∼ 0. 6 eV). © 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

Nevertheless, nanotubes are difficult to handle due to electrostatic charge and agglomeration, and in this context, two routes were tested as procedures to spread and stick nanotubes on an electrode: (1) a functionalization capable of attaching gold was tested in two forms, as either using 4 nm particles or a flat gold electrode. The fixation of Au particles was confirmed by HRTEM. (2) A simpler route that consisted on drying a CH 2 Cl 2 /nanotubes solution previously spread on a glassy carbon flat electrode.

40|$|Heavy metals are {{the second}} major {{environmental}} pollutants. Especially toxic is lead, increased content of which {{in the body of}} a pregnant determines the development of pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum period complications and is potentiated by deficiency of essential trace elements - zinc and copper.

The concentration of metals in biosubstrates was determined by inverse <b>voltamperometry</b> method with the usage of АVА- 2. It is revealed, that maintenance of lead and cadmium practically in all biosubstrates of fertile men is 1, 3 - 2, 2 times higher as compared to the indices of infertile patients and in all investigated groups it exceeds normative levels by 1, 2 - 6, 4 times. Thus, sterile men have the expressed disbalance of copper in the organism, maintenance of which in the blood is 1, 7 - 2, 3 times higher against the analogous indices of fertile group and physiological level. Concentration of zinc in ejaculate of men with normal fertility is 9, 3 times higher as compared to analogous indices of sterile men and by 30, 9 times exceeds its level in blood of fertile group, this testifies to the exceptionally important role of zinc for the generative sphere of men.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the major}} {{limitations}} yet to the global implementation of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is the cathode catalyst. The development of efficient platinum-free catalysts is the key issue {{to solve the problem}} of slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and high cost. We report a promising catalyst for ORR prepared through the annealing treatment under inert conditions of the cobalt-benzotriazole (Co-BTA) complex supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The N-rich benzotriazole precursor was chosen based on its ability to complex Co(II) ions and generate under annealing highly reactive radicals able to tune the physicochemical properties of CNTs. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to follow the surface structure changes and highlight the active electrocatalytic sites towards the ORR. To achieve further evaluation of the catalysts in acidic medium, <b>voltamperometry,</b> rotating disk electrode (RDE), rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) and half-cell measurements were performed. The resulting catalysts (Co/N/CNTs) all show catalytic activity towards the ORR, the most active one resulting from annealing at 700 °C. The overall electron transfer number for the catalyzed ORR was determined to be [similar] 3. 7 with no change upon the catalyst loading, suggesting that the ORR was dominated by a 4 e− transfer process. The results indicate a promising alternative cathode catalyst for ORR in fuel cells, although its performance is still lower (overpotential around 110 mV evaluated by RDE and RRDE) than the reference Pt/C catalyst...|$|E

The considered elements included La, Pr, Sm, Nd, Er, Eu, Gd, Dy, and Ba. The multicomponent oxides were prepared following a complexation-polymerization-pyrolysis method. The materials {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction, thermal dilatometry, and electrical conductivity under different oxidant atmospheres. The obtained materials were studied as solid oxide fuel cell cathodes, preparing porous films on top anode-supported cells with a yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte and a CGO protective layer. The complete cell was characterized by direct current <b>voltamperometry</b> using air and wet H- 2 as fuel, whereas the porosity of the layer was studied by gas diffusion experiments after electrochemical testing. Oxygen conduction was investigated on gastight membranes prepared for La- and Pr-based materials under flow of air and helium (sweep) {{in the range from}} 650 to 1000 degrees C. Pure perovskite structure was not obtained for the cations with the smallest ionic radii. The materials with the best electrochemical performance at 650 degrees C contained Pr, Sm, La, and Ba. The good electrochemical performance seems to be principally related to the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties of the material (perovskite or small clusters of the single oxide) because no clear correlations of the electrochemical performance and ionic conductivity, electronic conductivity, or gas diffusivity could be found. The electrochemical performance at 650 degrees C could be correlated with the catalytic activity for methane oxidation in a fixed bed reactor in the same temperature range.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the influence of one, two or three different non-precious alloys on the degree of release of the selected ions, which are their components. An analysis of the alloys Remanium G-Weich, Remanium CS and Remanium GM 380 was made both individually or in combinations of two samples, which were prepared from these alloys.

40|$|Many {{electric}} {{components in}} Québec in operation are in underground vaults {{in contact with}} free waters. These components (such as transformers, circuit breakers, disconnecting switches, etc.) are protected by paintings which {{make it possible to}} delay corrosion. However this mild steel part of these equipments is subject to delamination of painting with time. Nevertheless, the micro-defects initially present in painting, those which are induced {{at the time of the}} installation and, the scratches make that the material of these equipments can be in contact with free waters. This research project was developed by simulating the conditions which can be found in the underground vaults, i. e. in solutions containing bicarbonates, phosphates, sulfate and chlorides. Iron was selected as a material to study the effects of these ions on it. It will be useful as a reference material in a more exhaustive study carried out in the laboratory. In order to understand the electrochemical behavior of iron in these media, several electroanalytical methods were used like the cyclic <b>voltamperometry,</b> the chronoamperometry, the chronopotentiometry, the rotating disk electrode disc, etc. The electrochemical techniques were supplemented by measurements of scanning electron microscopy, the Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, x-ray fluorescence, and inductively coupled plasma. The addition of the sulfate ions on the electrochemical behavior of iron electrodes in the presence of bicarbonate ions was examined. In solutions which contain only sulfate ions, iron shows a uniform corrosion. The addition of sulfate ions in the presence of bicarbonate ions cause pitting corrosion. At the time of the localized attack, there is formation of a passivating product of corrosion which covers the site. The various electrochemical behaviors were compared and explained by the analysis of the formation of the probable products and their physicochemical properties during electrochemical polarization. The electrochemical behavior of iron in aqueous solutions of phosphate ions was examined in the presence of chloride or of sulfate ions. It was shown that the phosphate ions behave like very effective inhibiting ions against a localized corrosion. In the presence of sulfates ions, there is a similarity with the phosphate ions in the active-passive dissolution region. The electrochemical behavior of iron electrode with respect to the localized attack induced by the presence of chloride and/or sulfate tons in aqueous bicarbonate solutions has been investigated by using full factorial design and pitting potential as an object function. It has been shown that both chloride and sulfate ions in the presence of bicarbonate ions are aggressive, but interactively with bicarbonate ions, chloride ions are aggressive and sulfate ions are inhibitive toward iron attack when these anions are present together in the solution.
