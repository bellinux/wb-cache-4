40|$|Technology is a {{major part}} of the world today. For Americans without disabilities, {{technology}} makes tasks easier. For Americans with disabilities, technology makes things possible. Without consideration of technology during the evaluation process, vocational evaluators are allowing the individual?s current functional limitations to dictate vocational options and could be considered invalid and discriminatory (Langton, 1991). Despite this, assistive technology is being underutilized in the <b>vocational</b> <b>evaluation</b> (VE) process (Langton, Smith, Lown, & Chatham, 1998). Assistive technology is considered any technology that is used during the rehabilitation process (30 th Institute on Rehabilitation Issues, 2003).

Also, the psychometric and demographic variables were included in discriminant function equations to predict the vocational potential ratings of the white, Hispanic, and black groups and of the total sample. The sample {{in this study was}} composed of 99 adult rehabilitation clients who completed comprehensive <b>vocational</b> <b>evaluations</b> between January, 1980, and July, 1983. Each case included complete psychometric and demographic data. Also, a vocational potential rating based on this data, other aptitude and ability testing, work sample performances, behavior observations, and other information obtained by the vocational evaluator was reported for each case. Analysis of variance procedures found {{no significant differences between the}} male group and the female group of the total sample on the psychometric and demographic variables, or on the cumulative vocational potential rating. Significant differences were found among the racial groups on mean performance of reading comprehension and arithmetic computation, and on years of education attained. Tukey HSD procedures specified that these differences exist between the white group and the Hispanic group on reading comprehension, between the white group and the black group on arithmetic computation, and between the white and black groups and the hispanic group on years of educaton attained. Also, no significant differences were demonstrated among the racial groups on general mental ability, age, or cumulative vocational potential ratings. Discriminant function analysis procedures applied the psychometric and demographic variables to the prediction of vocational potential ratings of the racial groups and of the total sample. Observation of the resulting prediction equations indicated that some external bias may exist in the use of these equations for predicting vocational potential in white, Hispanic, and black groups. Also, no single predictor variable was the primarily selected variable in all of the discriminant function equations of vocational potential ratings in the total sample. Overall, the predictive power of the discriminant function equations was not sufficient to recommend their use in clinical practice...|$|R

The survey requested syllabus information, nonpatient practices and lectures with introductions in programs for OT students. Respondents were asked for their current syllabus in vocational therapy and teaching methods in college in comparison to hospitals. Additionally, we asked departments of occupational therapy in major hospitals in Niigata prefecture for assessment methods for vocational rehabilitation which were usually used. Results indicated that current items of <b>vocational</b> <b>evaluation</b> for patients in hospitals were different from programs in colleges. General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) and YG Personality Index (YGPI) were used in all hospitals and colleges. Kohs Block Design Test and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) were not used in programs for students but were used in hospitals. Although Vocational Preference Inventory (VPI), Tokyo University Egogram (TEG) and Allen cognitive performance test were taught to students in college, no hospital in Niigata used these tests. The current status of education programs in vocational therapy illustrated some differences between hospitals and colleges.
