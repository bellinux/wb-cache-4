5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> impedance due to overheating of the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} <b>voice</b> <b>coil.</b> The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
25|$|By {{driving a}} current through the <b>voice</b> <b>coil,</b> a {{magnetic}} field is produced. This magnetic field causes the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> {{to react to the}} magnetic field from a permanent magnet fixed to the speaker's frame, thereby moving the cone of the speaker. By applying an audio waveform to the <b>voice</b> <b>coil,</b> the cone will reproduce the sound pressure waves, corresponding to the original input signal.|$|E

25|$|Power {{handling}} {{is related}} to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the <b>voice</b> <b>coil.</b> Some magnet designs include aluminium heat-sink rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100mm diameter <b>voice</b> <b>coil,</b> with a 12mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50mm diameter <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> with a 24mm winding height.|$|E

25|$|The image above shows {{two ways}} in which the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> is {{immersed}} in the magnetic field. The most common method is the overhung design where the height of the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> is greater than the magnetic gap's height. The underhung design which is used mostly in high-end speakers has the coil's height smaller than the gap's. The differences, advantages and disadvantages of both methods are listed below.|$|E

50|$|A form of gain {{compression}} {{also takes}} place in loudspeaker <b>voice</b> <b>coils</b> when they heat up and increase their resistance. This causes less power {{to be drawn from}} the amplifier and a reduction in sound pressure level.|$|R

25|$|In particular, it is {{commonly}} used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the readâ€“write heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of driver, {{commonly}} called a dynamic loudspeaker, uses a lightweight diaphragm, or cone, connected to a rigid basket, or frame, via a flexible suspension, commonly called a spider, that constrains a <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the <b>voice</b> <b>coil,</b> a magnetic field is created by the electric current in the <b>voice</b> <b>coil,</b> making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound {{under the control of the}} applied electrical signal coming from the amplifier. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|Full-range drivers often employ an {{additional}} cone called a whizzer: a small, light cone {{attached to the}} joint between the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing {{to keep up with}} the central <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{applications}} of this conductor revolve around weight reduction requirements. These applications include high-quality coils, {{such as the}} <b>voice</b> <b>coils</b> in headphones or portable loudspeakers; high frequency coaxial applications, such as RF antennas and cable television distribution cables; and power cables.|$|R
50|$|For {{loudspeaker}} simulation, a {{more complex}} network is more accurate, however, as actual loudspeakers are reactive and non-linear. There are many designs for loudspeaker simulators, which emphasize different characteristics of the actual speaker, such as the <b>voice</b> <b>coil's</b> inductance, mechanical suspension compliance, and cone mass.|$|R
50|$|In general, smaller dome tweeters provide wider {{dispersion}} of sound {{at the highest}} frequencies. However, smaller dome tweeters have less radiating area, which limits their output {{at the lower end}} of their range; and they have smaller <b>voice</b> <b>coils,</b> which limit their overall power output.|$|R
25|$|Note that {{telecoil}} coupling {{has nothing}} to do with the radio signal in a cellular or cordless phone: the audio signal picked up by the telecoil is the weak electromagnetic field that is generated by the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> in the phone's speaker as it pushes the speaker cone back and forth.|$|E
25|$|Many hi-fi, {{and almost}} all {{professional}} low frequency loudspeakers (woofers) include vents in the magnet system to provide forced-air cooling of the <b>voice</b> <b>coil.</b> The pumping action of the cone and dustcap draws in and expels cool air. This method of cooling relies upon cone motion, so is ineffective at midrange or treble frequencies, although venting of midranges and tweeters does provide some acoustic advantages.|$|E
25|$|Anodized {{aluminium}} {{flat wire}} may be used, providing an insulating oxide layer {{more resistant to}} dielectric breakdown than enamel coatings on other <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> wire. This creates lightweight, low-inductance voice coils, ideally suited to use in small, extended range speakers. The principal power limitation on such coils is the thermal softening point of the adhesives which bond the wire to the bobbin, or the bobbin to the spider and coil.|$|E
50|$|When testing audio amplifiers, it {{is common}} to replace the {{loudspeaker}} with a dummy load, so that the amplifier's handling of large power levels can be tested without actually producing intense sound. The simplest is a resistor bank to simulate the <b>voice</b> <b>coil's</b> resistance.|$|R
25|$|<b>Voice</b> <b>coils</b> can be {{used for}} {{applications}} other than loudspeakers, where time force linearity and long strokes are needed. Some environments like vacuum or space require specific attention during conception, in order to evacuate coil losses. Several specific methods {{can be used}} to facilitate thermal drain.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), <b>voice</b> <b>coils</b> are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see ohmic heating). <b>Voice</b> <b>coils</b> wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|R
25|$|Planar {{magnetic}} speakers (having printed or embedded conductors {{on a flat}} diaphragm) {{are sometimes}} described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> printed or mounted on it. The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets {{on either side of}} the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.|$|E
25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording â€“ increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E
2500|$|Although one-sided flux {{distributions}} {{may seem}} somewhat abstract, {{they have a}} surprising number of applications ranging from the refrigerator magnet through industrial applications such as the brushless AC motor, <b>Voice</b> <b>coils,</b> magnetic drug targeting [...] to high-tech applications such as wiggler magnets which are used in Particle accelerators and Free-electron lasers.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{comes in}} solid core, stranded, or braided forms. Although usually {{circular}} in cross-section, wire {{can be made}} in square, hexagonal, flattened rectangular, or other cross-sections, either for decorative purposes, or for technical purposes such as high-efficiency <b>voice</b> <b>coils</b> in loudspeakers. Edge-wound coil springs, such as the Slinky toy, are made of special flattened wire.|$|R

25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available {{at a reasonable}} price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a choke coil, filtering the power supply of the amplifier that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated {{by the action of}} passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedanceâ€”a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the <b>voice</b> <b>coil</b> is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E
25|$|High-pass {{filters are}} also used for AC {{coupling}} at the inputs of many audio power amplifiers, for preventing the amplification of DC currents which may harm the amplifier, rob the amplifier of headroom, and generate waste heat at the loudspeakers <b>voice</b> <b>coil.</b> One amplifier, the professional audio model DC300 made by Crown International beginning in the 1960s, did not have high-pass filtering at all, and {{could be used to}} amplify the DC signal of a common 9-volt battery at the input to supply 18 volts DC in an emergency for mixing console power. However, that model's basic design has been superseded by newer designs such as the Crown Macro-Tech series developed in the late 1980s which included 10Hz high-pass filtering on the inputs and switchable 35Hz high-pass filtering on the outputs. Another example is the QSC Audio PLX amplifier series which includes an internal 5Hz high-pass filter which is applied to the inputs whenever the optional 50 and 30Hz high-pass filters are turned off.|$|E
50|$|Unlike regular motors or <b>voice</b> <b>coils,</b> the Osci {{works like}} a reversed-engineered guitar string. Thus, it allows for a larger audio {{headroom}} {{and is able to}} produce a more accurate touch sensation, as well as real-life polyphonic experience. Another notable advantage of the Osci is that its technology is scalable, therefore it can be used in various ways: from woven inside a smart fabric into supporting larger components, even those of industrial size.|$|R
5000|$|Some early Super Reverb {{amplifiers}} {{came with}} the option of factory equipped JBL speakers instead of the Jensen, Oxford or Utah speakers widely used {{in the majority of}} Fender amplifiers. The JBL speakers had aluminum dust caps with larger magnets and <b>voice</b> <b>coils,</b> this gives a fuller response range and handles more power reducing the risk of [...] "blowing a speaker". These models also add to the overall weight of the amp, making casters (wheels) a very good option.|$|R
