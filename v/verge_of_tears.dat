5|$|By {{the end of}} 1992, Kosar's {{physical}} decline {{had long}} been apparent to Belichick, which left the coach with a difficult choice. Kosar was Cleveland's most popular athlete, a hometown boy who had forgone big money and a bigger profile to lead a struggling team back to the top. While he recognized {{it would be an}} unpopular decision, Belichick wanted to bench Kosar, and in 1992 the team picked up a potential replacement in Vinny Testaverde from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick named Kosar the starter before the 1993 season, but in the third game against the Raiders, Belichick pulled Kosar after he threw his third interception of the night. Taking over with Los Angeles ahead 13–0, Testaverde led two touchdown drives to win the game. Two weeks later, Belichick named Testaverde the starter. On the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears</b> after a loss to the Dolphins, Kosar said he was disappointed with the decision and felt he had done what he could with what was at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears</b> standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young girl could be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E

[...] At {{the time of its}} off-Broadway debut, The New York Times described it as not [...] "so much a dance enhanced by a famous story as a drama condensed by the removal of words." [...] It was further panned in a more detailed review the following week by The New York Times Jennifer Dunning, who said [...] "Mr. Bourne's [...] "Edward Scissorhands" [...] is mostly a candy-coated bore."

500|$|Mother 3 was {{released}} in Japan on April 20, 2006, where it became a bestseller.

At one point leading up to its release, the game's [...] "Love Theme" [...] would play as music on hold for the Japan Post. A limited edition Deluxe Box Set was produced with a special edition Game Boy Micro and Franklin Badge pin. The game was marketed in Japan with a television commercial that has Japanese actress Kō Shibasaki on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears</b> as she explains her feelings about Mother 3.

Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she wants to hear. He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears,</b> Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage. However, his constant swearing eventually puts enough money in the jar to purchase a dog house.|$|E
500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The Big Country (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears</b> after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The Big Country with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not for Me was made at Paramount.|$|E
50|$|The siege {{continues}} with the super-villain Scourge using the enchanted spear of Asgard's ruler, Odin, to sever the left limbs of the superhero U.S. Agent. The conflicted hero Night Thrasher {{who had been}} compelled to make a Faustian bargain with Osborn, turns on him by battling his Cabal minion the Hood. In Washington, the President orders the Secretary of State to dispatch military forces to Oklahoma to have Osborn and the Dark Avengers arrested for treason. At that moment in Asgard, Osborn is struck down by Captain America's shield, yet manages to order the Sentry to destroy the infrastructure of Asgard. Sentry, having survived a flurry of brutal blows from Thor, unscathed and on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tearing</b> Thor apart, transforms into the evil Void (which greatly multiplies his power to evolved heights) and leaves Thor. He then annihilates Asgard bringing it crashing down to Earth. Rogers finds Osborn in the wreckage and places him under arrest. Before anyone can react further, Osborn's armor, now {{under the control of}} its original inventor, Tony Stark explodes off his body on live television, revealing his face painted {{in the image of the}} Green Goblin. He begins raving that now that he is powerless, he no longer has the leverage to control the Sentry, who is now fully possessed by his nihilistic other self, the Void. Osborn is convinced that the Void is, in fact, the Angel of Death.|$|R

The Fyne dog was supposed to lead a Spartan existence on a diet of repulsive biscuits with an occasional dry, hygienic, bone thrown in. Fyne looked down gloomily at the appeased animal, I too looked at that fool-dog; and (you know how one's memory gets suddenly stimulated) I was reminded visually, with an almost painful distinctness, of the ghostly white face of the girl I saw last accompanied by that dog--deserted by that dog. I almost heard her distressed voice as if on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> resentful <b>tears</b> calling to the dog, the unsympathetic dog. Perhaps she had not the power of evoking sympathy, that personal gift of direct appeal to the feelings. I said to Fyne, mistrusting the supine attitude of the dog: ...|$|R

The minimalistic one-shot video shows Stefani on the <b>verge</b> <b>of</b> <b>tears</b> while sitting in a dark space with a white tank top. Stefani noted that the video had been filmed inside of her dressing room for her New York performance, and {{was not intended to}} be released as the track's official music video. Carolyn Menyes of Music Times remarked that [...] "though most of the video is spent near tears, Stefani sings key lyrics, just for an additional emotional trigger." [...] McKenna Aiello of E! Online emphasized that [...] "it's her ability to hold them back [...] that really reveals Stefani's strong sense of self." [...] Marc Inocencio, writing for Seacrest's website, noted that the video [...] "is simple, yet, it’s enough to tell the story behind a recent heartbreak," [...] calling it [...] "really, really heartbreaking." [...] Erin Strecker of Billboard echoed the same thought, while Joe Satran of The Huffington Post called it [...] "spare, vulnerable and raw: the exact opposite of the exuberant, even maximalist videos we've come to expect from the No Doubt frontwoman." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator described it as [...] "poignant" [...] and [...] "raw".|$|E
