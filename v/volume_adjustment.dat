25|$|The {{front of}} the iPod Shuffle had buttons for Play/Pause, Next Song/Fast Forward, Previous Song/Fast Reverse, {{and up and down}} <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment.</b> On the reverse, it had a battery level {{indicator}} light (activated by a button) and a three-position switch to turn the unit off or set it to play music in order or shuffled. It plugged directly into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to the iPod Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear the iPod Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E

50|$|There are {{multiple}} <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> for different {{inputs and outputs}} on the system. The master volume affects all of these settings. The default and recommended value is 50% for all sources, which actually equates to a 0 dB amplification (none), while a 100% value causes a 16 dB amplification.|$|R
5000|$|... iVolume {{provides}} {{the capability to}} compute <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> on a per-album basis, whereas iTunes does not. In this mode, iVolume scans all of the tracks in an album to determine the adjustment setting to apply and then it applies the same adjustment {{to each of the}} tracks in the album.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide range}} of effects and transitions. Audio effects include normalization, phase and pitch shifting, limiting, <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment,</b> reverb and {{equalization}} filters as well as others. Video effects include options for masking, blue-screen, distortions, rotations, colour tools, blurring, obscuring and others.|$|E
50|$|Sound Check background: If the iTunes Sound Check {{preference}} is activated, iTunes scans audio files {{to determine a}} per-track playback <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Sound Check is designed so that the playback of multiple tracks with inherently varied relative volume levels will be at a consistent volume level.|$|E
5000|$|... iVolume aims {{to improve}} upon Sound Check by instead {{applying}} the ReplayGain algorithm. It replaces the settings computed by iTunes with new values computed via the ReplayGain algorithm. These <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> settings supposedly result in perceptually more consistent playback volume levels than those {{produced by the}} iTunes algorithm.|$|E
50|$|The {{album is}} plagued by poor sound quality. This {{is due to}} the poor {{equipment}} that was used for many of the recordings and the lack of <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> while recording. Before releasing the album, careful remastering was done. For instance, more than 120 pops were removed and seven sections de-hissed. Still, poor sound and volume variations between tracks can easily be heard.|$|R
50|$|Apps may be {{superior}} to hour glasses, or to mechanical timers. Hour glasses are not precise and clear, and they can jam. Mechanical timers lack the customization that applications support, such as sound <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> for individual needs. Most applications will also offer selectable alarm sounds. Today, Progressive Little Ben Timer turns 18, but today is Progressive Little Ben Timer's 18th birthday and Progressive Little Ben Timer is celebrating its 18 years old on Google.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Made for iPod {{was launched}} at the Macworld Expo on 11 January 2005, although some products released {{just before the}} announcement carried a [...] "Ready for iPod" [...] label instead. It was reported {{at that time that}} Apple would be charging a 10% cut for all products with the logo, and the press described this as a [...] "tax". iPods use an extended headphone jack that allows additional control inputs like mute and <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments,</b> and licenses were available for products plugging into the jack or the dock connector.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{computer}} software also uses OSDs, especially support programs for so-called [...] "enhanced keyboards", which often had additional medias like skipping through music tracks and <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Their use outside this field is still uncommon.

40|$|AbstractThe K+ and Cl− {{currents}} {{activated by}} Ca 2 +-ionophore treatment or by hypotonic cell swelling {{have been studied}} in Ehrlich ascites tumour cells by the patch-clamp technique. A charybdotoxin-inhibitable K+ current was activated by increasing intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. In contrast, the K+ current activated by cell swelling was insensitive to charybdotoxin {{as well as to}} apamin, suggesting that channels different from those sensitive to Ca 2 + are responsible for regulatory <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> in these cells. The magnitude of the K+ and Cl− currents activated by hypotonic challenge was markedly temperature-dependent, possibly reflecting the temperature-dependence of enzymes involved in the intracellular signalling of cell volume regulation...|$|R

50|$|The Wave Blaster {{attached}} to a SB16 through a 26-pin expansion-header, {{eliminating the need for}} extra cabling between the SB16 and the Wave Blaster. The SB16 emulated an MPU-401 UART, giving existing MIDI-software the option to send MIDI-sequences directly to the attached Wave Blaster, instead of driving an external MIDI-device. The Wave Blaster's analog stereo-output fed into a dedicated line-in on the SB16, where the onboard-mixer allowed equalization, mixing, and <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment.</b>|$|E
50|$|MP3Gain first computes {{the desired}} gain (<b>volume</b> <b>adjustment),</b> either per track or per album, using the ReplayGain algorithm. It then modifies the overall volume scale factor in each MP3 frame, and writes undo {{information}} as a tag (in APEv2, or ID3v2 format) {{making this a}} reversible process. The scale factor modification can be reversed using {{the information in the}} added tag and the tag may be removed. MP3Gain does not introduce any digital generation loss because it does not decode and re-encode the file.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smart key}} is {{available}} on NavPlus and 3.6R models only. 17" [...] alloy wheels are standard on all models, as well as rain sensing automatic wipers, two position memory seat, heated exterior mirrors, glass moonroof, heated front seats, fog lights, and tilt and telescoping steering wheel. The Harman/Kardon stereo with 6 speakers and the rear-view backup camera is installed only on vehicles with the voice recognition NavPlus system. The standard stereo system uses an in-dash 6-disc CD auto-changer and automatic speed-sensing <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> that is MP3 player compatible.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the noise}} and clicks and pops have been removed, one may adjust the volume. This is usually done by a process called audio {{normalization}} whereby the loudest tone in a track is amplified right up to some specified point, usually the point of digital clipping, {{and the rest of}} the waveform is amplified accordingly. In another form of amplification called [...] "hard limiting," [...] the loudest passages are attenuated drastically after they hit a certain limit, while the quieter passages are amplified. The result is a compressed waveform that sounds considerably louder, though it may not be what the original recording engineers intended. In all of these <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments,</b> one should respect the original dynamics of a piece, and of the variation in dynamics among different tracks in the same LP.|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the share of supply from intermittent power sources changes the demand for power from traditional power plants. The power system demands more volume flexibility from traditional plants. Our goal is {{to better understand the}} impact of a reduction of flexibility in power supply on the costs of <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments.</b> We define flexibility as the capacity with which nominated power plants can adjust their output to unexpected changed in residual demand. We exploit a policy change in Spain that affected the power market. The policy, implemented in 2010, aims to provide a stimulus for producing power with domèstic coal. The policy, in combination with a year with scant rainfall in the year after the policy was implemented, decreased the amount of flexibility in power supply and we use this to examine the effect of a change in flexibility on the costs of the power System.

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{formation}} of biomimetic calcium hydroxyapatite (HAP) on the surface of different substrates. Material and Methods. Silica coated stainless steel tapes and thin polymer films (alginate, cellulose, poly lactide-co-glycolide - PLGA) deposited on hydroxyapatite scaffold were used as substrate. Supersaturated simulated body fluid (SBF) and SBF combined with Fetal Calf Serum (FCS) or Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) were used as bioactive liquid medium where biomimetic nucleation of HAP occurred. Infrared spectroscopy with Fourier transformation was used to analyze the formed phases, while scanning electron microscopy indicated the morphology of nucleated phase. Results. The results of measuring the mass with <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> done by the BET method showed that the thickness of the film of nucleated calcium hydroxyapatite depended on the time that samples spent soaked in SBF-in as well as the type of selected biomimetic medium. Conclusion. Biomimetic calcium hydroxyapatite is possible to produce by self nucleation on different substrates in the presence of simulating body fluid...|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-function}} sleep/wake button {{is located}} {{on the top of the}} device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls phone calls. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons.|$|E
5000|$|The arcade {{version of}} Hydro Thunder {{utilizes}} the same cabinet seat as San Francisco Rush and the later Offroad Thunder. It {{has the same}} steering wheel on the control panel as Cruis'n USA, minus the standard foot pedals, and adds a variable position throttle with forward, neutral and reverse directions. The game also has an unusual <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment,</b> where the regular play volume is usually set lower than the feedback volume for the subwoofer in the seat. This is intended to place the player [...] "in the game" [...] and make the player feel like an actual pilot of a powerful, high-tech speedboat.|$|E
50|$|The {{buoyancy}} compensator {{is one of}} {{the items}} of diving equipment most requiring skill and attention during operation, as control is entirely manual, and adjustment is required throughout the dive as weight reduces due to gas consumption, and buoyancy of the diving suit varies with depth. Fine buyancy adjustment can be done by breath control, reducing the amount of actual BCD <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> needed, and a skilled diver will develop the skill to adjust volume to maintain neutral buoyancy while remaining aware of the surroundings and performing other tasks. The buoyancy compensator is both an important safety device when used correctly, and a significant hazard when misused.|$|E
30|$|Imaging {{analysis}} was performed using dedicated software (TRI/ 3 D-BON, RATOC, Tokyo, Japan) to calculate volume BMD and the micro-architectural parameters of the vertebrae. First, 3 D <b>volume</b> position <b>adjustment</b> between pre-insertion (both micro-CT and MSCT) (Fig.  3 a) and post-insertion (micro-CT) (Fig.  3 b, c) images was performed, and {{the volume of the}} cancellous bone where the pedicle screw was present was extracted (Fig.  3 d, e). The cutoff value was 120 [*]mg/cm 3. The cortex was extracted before calculating the 3 D <b>volume</b> position <b>adjustment.</b> <b>Volume</b> BMD and micro-architectural parameters were calculated. The following micro-architectural parameters were assessed: bone volume fraction (bone volume/total volume: BV/TV, %), bone surface density (bone surface/total volume (BS/TV), mm− 1), trabecular thickness (mm), trabecular separation (mm), trabecular number (mm− 1), structure model index (SMI), and number of nodes per volume (NNd/TV, mm− 3) [17, 29 – 31]. SMI is a measure for the relative number of rod- and plate-like trabecular bone structures, with values ranging from 0 (ideal plate-like structure) to 3 (ideal rod-like structure), values in between representing a mixture of plates and rods [32]. In recent years, SMI has frequently been used to investigate the relationship between CT and implant fixation strength in research [17, 32]. NNd/TV, unlike SMI, indicated the complexity of trabecular bone structure from the viewpoint of the number of bonding points of the trabecular beam structure.|$|R

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} is {{a disease}} characterized by abnormalities in the epithelia of the lungs, intestine, salivary and sweat glands, liver, and reproductive systems, often {{as a result of}} inadequate hydration of their secretions. The primary defect in cystic fibrosis is the altered activity of a cAMP-activated Cl- channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. However, {{it is not clear how}} a defect in the CFTR Cl- channel function leads to the observed pathological changes. Although much is known about the structural properties and regulation of the CFTR, little is known of its relationship to cellular functions other than the cAMP-dependent Cl- secretion. Here we report that cell volume regulation after hypotonic challenge is also defective in intestinal crypt epithelial cells isolated from CFTR -/- mutant mice. Moreover, the impairment of the regulatory volume decrease in CFTR -/- crypts appears to be related to the inability of a K+ conductance to provide a pathway for the exit of this cation during the <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments.</b> This provides evidence that the lack of CFTR protein may have additional consequences for the cellular function other than the abnormal cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion...|$|R
5000|$|For the OPMs (Original Participating Manufacturers), the {{payments}} are determined {{in accordance with}} their relative market share as of 1997. The payment amount of a particular OPM is also dictated by the [...] "Volume Adjustment," [...] which compares the number of cigarettes sold in each payment year to the number of cigarettes sold in 1997. If the number of cigarettes sold by an OPM in a given year is less than the number it sold in 1997, the <b>Volume</b> <b>Adjustment</b> allows that OPM to reduce its payment to the settling states. In other words, a reduction in the amount of cigarettes sold by the OPMs results in the settling states receiving less money.|$|E
5000|$|Letting the pipette [...] "rest" [...] for {{at least}} one minute after a volume change is made. This does not apply to single-volume instruments, also called set volume or fixed volume pipettes. A change in the {{dispensed}} volume of an adjustable pipette involves modifying the internal tensioning of a spring that governs the piston's travel distance. Springs subjected to changing tensioning behave more smoothly and consistently when they are allowed to enjoy an interval of rest to settle into their new configuration. A pipette that is left idle {{for at least}} one minute after a <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> will perform more accurately than one that is pressed into service prematurely. This is especially important when calibrating a pipette.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently {{we found}} that {{cytoplasm}} of permeabilized mammalian cells behaves as a hydrogel displaying intrinsic osmosensitivity. This study examined the role of microfilaments and microtubules in the regulation of hydrogel osmosensitivity, volume-sensitive ion transporters, and their contribution to volume modulation of intact cells. We found that intact and digitonin-permeabilized A 549 cells displayed similar rate of shrinkage triggered by hyperosmotic medium. It was significantly slowed-down in both cell preparations after disruption of actin microfilaments by cytochalasin B, suggesting that rapid water release by intact cytoplasmic hydrogel contributes to hyperosmotic shrinkage. In hyposmotic swelling experiments, disruption of microtubules by vinblastine attenuated the maximal amplitude of swelling in intact cells and completely abolished it in permeabilized cells. The swelling of intact cells also triggered ~ 10 -fold elevation of furosemide-resistant 86 Rb+ (K+) permeability and the regulatory volume decrease (RVD), {{both of which were}} abolished by Ba 2 +. Interestingly, RVD and K+ permeability remained unaffected in cytocholasin/vinblastine treated cells demonstrating that cytoskeleton disruption has no direct impact on Ba 2 +-sensitive K+-channels involved in RVD. Our results show, for the first time, that the cytoskeleton network contributes directly to passive cell <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments</b> in anisosmotic media via the modulation of the water retained by the cytoplasmic hydrogel...|$|R
5000|$|Part of the {{solution}} to alleviate operator issues is to automate whenever possible. The advent of modern digital computer technology has now {{made it possible to}} install sound system components that will almost operate themselves. When upgrading or installing new sound systems, it is advantageous to install items that require as little hands-on, human operation as possible. [...] A digital mixing console can offset the lack of operator experience because it can store the settings programmed by an expert mixer. For example: A knowledgeable person can adjust all of the microphone settings, monitors, etc. for a given event. After everything is properly adjusted, that set-up is assigned a name and stored in the memory. Afterwards, a less knowledgeable operator can simply select that setting on their console or computer. [...] One can easily program many different preset configurations or [...] "snapshots," [...] into the mixing console. Default configurations that are included with the DMC are known as presets. Once a stored setting is recalled, the operator can still make manual <b>volume</b> <b>adjustments,</b> etc., without affecting the stored program. In other words, they can change a lot of stuff and all one has to do is hit the recall and the mixer automatically returns to all of the correct start-up settings.|$|R
