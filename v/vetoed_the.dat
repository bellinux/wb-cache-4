50|$|The {{federal highway}} aid bill proved contentious. The New York Times {{noted that the}} bill was unnecessary, since federal highway {{legislation}} was not due to expire until 1972. It declared the bill so flawed that it asked President Johnson to veto it. Walter Washington, mayor-commissioner of the District of Columbia, also asked Johnson to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall hinted that he found the relaxation of environmental protections so odious that he, too, would counsel Johnson to <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill. The pressure on Johnson was so intense that many observers believed the president would pocket <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill.|$|R
50|$|The {{governor}} {{can choose}} to sign or <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> legislation.

5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill, the government would not have any money to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress. However, Grant missed an opportunity to make a statement by threatening a veto.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, the {{legislature}} {{passed a resolution}} instructing Magoffin to order the Confederate forces (but not the Union forces) to leave the state. The Governor <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> resolution, but the General Assembly overrode his veto, and Magoffin gave the order. The next week, the assembly officially requested {{the assistance of the}} Union and asked the governor to call out the state militia to join the Federal forces. Magoffin also vetoed this request. Again the assembly overrode his veto and Magoffin acquiesced.|$|E

5|$|The Crusaders' {{management}} proposed {{playing a}} 2005 regular season match in Melbourne when Jade Stadium was unavailable. Although {{five of the}} seven unions within the Crusaders region supported having the regular season game in Melbourne, the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> proposal. In 2006, the Crusaders did play a pre-season match in Melbourne against the Western Force at Olympic Park Stadium. They did the same in the 2008 preseason as well, also against the Force.|$|E
5|$|The Whigs also {{maintained}} {{control of}} the General Assembly, and although Governor Powell was largely able to cooperate with his political opponents, some clashes did occur. As {{a result of the}} 1850 census, the General Assembly re-apportioned the state into ten congressional districts. Powell <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> redistricting, noting that the districts had been gerrymandered to give the fading Whig party control over the state delegation. The legislature overrode the veto. The governor was successful, however, in vetoing legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions {{had to be}} made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E

There {{are two types of}} budget bill veto: <b>the</b> line-item <b>veto</b> and <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> of <b>the</b> whole budget.|$|R
50|$|A bill must be {{approved}} by both houses of the Kansas Legislature in order to be submitted to the governor, who can sign it into law or <b>veto</b> <b>the</b> bill. State legislators can override <b>the</b> <b>veto</b> with <b>the</b> support of two-thirds majority of both houses.|$|R
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged. When the 1930 {{legislative}} session convened, they immediately {{passed a bill}} that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner, giving it to a three-person commission composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's book {{sales were}} higher than ever, and {{translations}} were being produced for the British, Spanish, and Scandinavian markets. He was receiving international press attention, with articles on his work appearing in France-Observateur, The Listener, and Times Literary Supplement. Paul Vandromme authored an un-critical book on Hergé, Le Monde de Tintin ("The World of Tintin"), published by Gallimard; Hergé <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of a proposed preface by Roger Nimier after finding its praise for his own work too embarrassing. Radio adaptations of The Adventures of Tintin were produced, as was an animated cartoon series produced by Belvision, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin. Two live-action films were also produced, Tintin and the Golden Fleece (1961) and Tintin and the Blue Oranges (1964), the former of which Hergé had been closely involved with.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 Olivier {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but Olivier himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time Olivier began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E

5|$|In early September 1861, both {{federal and}} Confederate troops entered Kentucky. Magoffin {{declared}} both sides equally guilty of violating Kentucky's neutrality {{and demanded that}} both sides withdraw. A resolution calling for immediate withdrawal by both Union and Confederate forces was defeated in the legislature. Instead, the legislature passed a resolution ordering only the Confederate troops out of the state. Magoffin <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> resolution, but his veto was overridden, and he obediently issued the order for the Confederates to withdraw. In November 1861, a self-constituted convention of southern sympathizers met at Russellville, Kentucky in order to form a provisional Confederate government for the state. Despite his southern sympathies, Magoffin denounced the actions of this convention.|$|E
5|$|In some matters Tyler was on {{good terms}} with Jackson. He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project, which Jackson {{considered}} unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain. The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832, and Jackson <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill for both constitutional and practical reasons. Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East {{and eastern}} Mediterranean, two ongoing {{international}} disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute {{turned into a}} crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both {{the effect of this}} on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid {{until the end of the}} year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress. Scalia repeatedly testified before congressional committees, defending Ford administration assertions of executive privilege regarding its refusal to turn over documents. Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{appeals for}} Hess's release were {{launched}} by his lawyer, Dr Alfred Seidl, beginning {{as early as}} 1947. These were denied, mainly because the Soviets repeatedly <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> proposal. Spandau was located in West Berlin, and its existence gave the Soviets a foothold in that sector of the city. Additionally, Soviet officials believed Hess must have known in 1941 that an attack on their country was imminent. In 1967 Wolf Rüdiger Hess began a campaign to win his father's release, garnering support from notable politicians such as Geoffrey Lawrence, 1st Baron Oaksey in Britain and Willy Brandt in Germany, but to no avail, {{in spite of the}} prisoner's advanced age and deteriorating health.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, {{the last}} day of the {{legislative}} session, the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake Oshiro. Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered a recess and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken and the bill passed with 31 to 20 votes. Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle <b>vetoed</b> <b>the</b> bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session.|$|E
