50|$|Technical {{investigation}} of Rembrandt's {{paintings in the}} possession of the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister and in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel) has been conducted by Hermann Kühn in 1977. The pigment analyses of some thirty paintings have shown that Rembrandt's palette consisted of the following pigments: lead white, various ochres, <b>Vandyke</b> <b>brown,</b> bone black, charcoal black, lamp black, vermilion, madder lake, azurite, ultramarine, yellow lake and lead-tin-yellow. One painting (Saskia van Uylenburgh as Flora) reportedly contains gamboge. Rembrandt very rarely used pure blue or green colors, the most pronounced exception being Belshazzar's Feast in the National Gallery in London. The book by Bomford (above reference) describes more recent technical investigations and pigment analyses of Rembrandt's paintings predominantly in the National Gallery in London. The entire array of pigments employed by Rembrandt can be found at ColourLex. The best source for technical information on Rembrandt's paintings on the web is the Rembrandt Database containing all works of Rembrandt with detailed investigative reports, infrared and radiography images and other scientific details.|$|E
50|$|Upperside {{very dark}} <b>Vandyke</b> <b>brown,</b> the cilia conspicuously white, the {{transverse}} white discal {{band of the}} underside showing through on both forewing and hindwing, but very plainly on the latter. Forewing with a white-centred, fulvous-ringed, median, and a similar but much smaller subapical eyespot, the latter very often absent; broad but faint and ill-defined sub-terminal and terminal white lines. Hindwing: a subtornal ocellus (eyespot) similar to those on the forewing and much more conspicuous; subterminal and terminal whitish lines. Underside: ground colour similar; basal half of wings closely irrorated (sprinkled) with pale transverse stripe; a conspicuous white discal band, inwardly sharply defined, outwardly diffused, followed by series of ocelli similar to the ocelli on the upperside, a median and two subapical on the forewing, three subapical and three tornal on the hindwing: the number of these ocelli is variable, sometimes one or more additional ocelli are present, often one or more are lacking on the hindwing; finally, the subterminal and terminal white bands as on the upperside but better defined. Antenna, head, thorax and abdomen brown; antennae annulated (ringed) with white, ochraceous at apex. Male sex-mark in form 2.|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} driers are litharge, sugar of lead, patent driers, sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid driers, such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese driers are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead driers. Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, vegetable black, ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and <b>Vandyke</b> <b>brown.</b> The term enamel paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are spirit varnishes ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying enamels oil varnishes form the vehicle.|$|E

Underside pale brown, much paler in female than in male; the basal area of the wings irrorated with transverse brown striae up to a common transverse inwardly sharply-defined discal white band; beyond this, a series of ocelli similar to the ocelli on the upperside, four on the front wing, the median ocellus being the largest, seven on the hindwing, the third from the tornus and the apical ocelli being the largest; terminal margins of wings slightly purpurescent, crossed by an inner and an outer subterminal and a terminal slender dark brown line, the subterminal lines being more or less zigzag and sinuous. Cilia of both forewing and hindwing pale. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brown; antennas ochraceous at apex. Male sex-mark in form 2, the tuft of hair overlying the specialized scales on the upperside of the hindwing black.Dry-season form. Similar. Differs in the ground colour of the underside having a more ochraceous tint, the ocelli much reduced in size or obsolescent, and the inner of the two subterminal lines being more or less obscure and faintly.|$|E
30|$|Carbon-based {{pigments}} are a {{group of}} dark-colored materials that are classified according to the starting material and the manufacturing process. They are composed by some form of elemental carbon and four groups may be distinguished: graphite, flame carbons, chars, and cokes [1 – 3]. On the other hand, black earths containing amorphous carbonaceous materials, such as <b>Vandyke</b> <b>brown</b> and Cassel earth have also been used as pigments. These humic-earth materials are composed of complex mixtures of natural organic substances derived from animal and vegetable sources with varying proportions of mineral matter [4].|$|E

30|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} is {{an ideal}} non-destructive technique for the characterization {{of a variety of}} carbonaceous materials because it is sensitive to crystalline and amorphous structures, allowing the study of highly disordered materials, such as carbon-based pigments [9, 10]. The Raman spectrum of crystalline graphite consists of a narrow band at 1, 580  cm− 1 known as G band (‘graphite’) while disordered or microcrystalline graphite presents an additional band around 1, 350  cm− 1 known as D band, often called the ‘disorder’ band. Raman spectra of amorphous carbons are characterized by broad bands around 1, 550 and 1, 350  cm− 1 and several spectral parameters of these bands such as their positions, relative intensities, and band widths provide structural information and have helped to discriminate between samples from different origins [9 – 11]. Recently, we have studied by Raman microscopy seven carbon-based pigments used in art and as references for archaeometric studies, together with a sample of commercial vegetable charcoal, in order to find relevant parameters to distinguish between the pigments [12]. These references had been selected from ten carbon-based pigments previously studied in detail by a combination of FTIR-ATR, SEM–EDS microscopy and XRD to determine their structures and compositions [13]. The selected pigments comprised graphite (crystalline carbon), lampblack and bistre (flame carbons), bitumen and ivory black (cokes), commercial wood charcoal (char), and <b>Vandyke</b> <b>brown</b> and Cassel earth (black earths). Reference carbon-based pigments from different sources showed similar Raman spectra with characteristic G and D bands in the range 1, 350 – 1, 600  cm− 1 that differed clearly in position, width and relative intensity. The combined analysis of the spectral parameters showed that Raman microscopy allowed the discrimination of most of the reference pigments as well as the identification of carbon-based black pigments in two South American colonial paintings dated from the early 18 th century [13].|$|E
