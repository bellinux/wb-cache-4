5|$|Like most arboviruses, dengue <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> {{maintained}} in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The viruses are {{maintained in}} the forests of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female Aedes mosquitoes—of species other than A. aegypti—to their offspring and to lower primates. In towns and cities, the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated A. aegypti. In rural settings the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> transmitted to humans by A. aegypti and other species of Aedes such as A. albopictus. Both these species had expanding ranges {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses cause no {{apparent}} {{changes to the}} infected cell. Cells in which the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> latent and inactive show few signs of infection and often function normally. This causes persistent infections and the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> often dormant for many months or years. This {{is often the case}} with herpes viruses.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunological}} {{relationships among}} three hamster-specific sarcoma viruses and a non-sarcomagenic <b>virus</b> <b>were</b> d t rmined by neutralization a d interference tests. These <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> all derived from hamster tumours induced originally by murine sarcoma <b>viruses</b> but <b>were</b> no longer capable of growth on mouse cells. The four viruses shared {{at least one}} envelope antigen responsible for neutralization reactions. Specific interference for the sarcoma <b>viruses</b> <b>was</b> obtained in cultures infected with the non-sarcomagenic v rus. In both assays these <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> clearly distinguishable from murine C-type viruses...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{immunofluorescence}} staining for {{herpes simplex}} <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> applied to cryostat sections of 43 specimens removed at brain biopsy. Herpes antigen {{was found in}} 10 specimens and <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> isolated from them. Antigen was found in one specimen from which <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> not isolated. Two specimens from which <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> isolated gave equivocal fluorescence. Thirty specimens gave no fluorescence or live virus. Immunofluorescence provided a diagnosis in three hr compared with 24 - 42 hr for virus isolation...|$|R
5|$|The {{common cold}} is a viral {{infection}} of the upper respiratory tract. The most commonly implicated <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronavirus (≈15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and metapneumovirus. Frequently more than one <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> present. In total over 200 viral types are associated with colds.|$|E
5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that {{protrudes}} as a spike. It binds to molecules {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> infectious. VP4 determines how virulent the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> and it determines the P-type of the virus.|$|E
5|$|A <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> a small {{infectious}} agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect {{all types of}} life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.|$|E
50|$|Marburg <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> first {{introduced}} under this name in 1967. In 2005, the <b>virus</b> name <b>was</b> changed to Lake Victoria marburgvirus, which unfortunately {{was the same}} spelling as its species Lake Victoria marburgvirus. However, most scientific articles continued to refer to Marburg virus. Consequently, in 2010, the name Marburg <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> reinstated and the species name changed. A previous abbreviation for the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> MBGV.|$|R

40|$|Markers for {{differentiating}} hog cholera and bovine viral diarrhea <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> studied using Tween 80, chloroform, trichlorotrifluoroethane and tri (n-butyl) phosphate. Attenuated A and virulent Ames {{strains of}} hog cholera <b>virus</b> <b>were</b> employed. Moreover, the NADL PK- 15 cell culture adopted strain and low cell culture passaged Purdue strain of bovine viral diarrhea <b>virus</b> <b>were</b> used. These <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> reacted with 2, 500 micrograms/ml of Tween 80 {{for one hour}} at 37 degrees C. When attenuated A and virulent Ames strains of hog cholera virus with titers greater than 10 (6) and 10 (5) plaque forming units respectively, were reacted with Tween 80 the titer of each strains was reduced by approximately 10 (4) plaque forming units of virus.

50|$|The {{family is}} {{relatively}} new, having only {{been discovered in}} 2011. The first <b>virus,</b> which <b>was</b> named Nam Dinh <b>virus,</b> <b>was</b> found in the Vietnamese province of Nam Định. The second virus, named Cavally <b>virus,</b> <b>was</b> then found in Côte d'Ivoire. These two <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> later found {{to be of the}} same species. A third member of this first species, named Dak Nong <b>virus,</b> <b>was</b> later found in Culex tritaeniorhynchus populations in Vietnam. In 2013, four more mesoniviruses were discovered in mosquito populations, all within Côte d'Ivoire, and in 2014 four mesoniviruses were discovered in mosquito populations in Australia, Indonesia, and Thailand.|$|R

40|$|Non-transforming helper <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> {{isolated}} from pools of two hamster-specific sarcoma viruses in which isolations by terminal dilution procedures {{had previously been}} unsuccessful. This presumably resulted from approximately equivalent levels of sarcoma nd helper viruses in the original pools. Helper <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> {{isolated from}} morphologically normal cells selected from tissue culture plates showing relatively few transformed colonies, and by end-point dilution from cloned transformed cells. Focus-formation by the hamster-specific sarcoma <b>viruses</b> <b>was</b> independent of the spread of virus and non-producer cell lines carrying the sarcoma <b>virus</b> genome <b>were</b> isolated; thus these <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> apparently unable to replicate independently of helper virus. Hamster-specific <b>virus</b> antigens <b>were</b> not detected in hamster cells infected productively or non-productively with a murine sarcoma virus; thus, evidence for virus activation in vitro by the sarcoma <b>virus</b> genome <b>was</b> not obtained...|$|R
5|$|HIV can infect {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used. DCs {{are one of the}} first cells encountered by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought {{to play an important role}} by transmitting HIV to T-cells when the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} {{identified}} as a new species in 2008 and is most closely related to Bayou virus, Catacamas virus, Muleshoe virus, and Black Creek Canal virus, found in other species of Oryzomys and Sigmodon. Catacamas <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> found in a different population of Oryzomys couesi, and the presence of different viruses in these two species has been used as an argument for classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E
5|$|Rinderpest, {{which is}} caused by a virus closely related to measles <b>virus,</b> <b>is</b> a disease of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which {{originated}} in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading Huns in 370. Later invasions of Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E

5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> not known, but evidence suggests that it came from bats.|$|E
5|$|The CDC {{arrives and}} soon clash with Walter, who wants some blood samples {{to take back}} to his lab at Harvard.

5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> {{its ability to}} enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).|$|E
50|$|<b>Viruses</b> that <b>are</b> {{associated}} with Entebbe Bat <b>Virus</b> <b>are</b> Sokolul <b>Virus</b> and Yokose Virus.

5|$|UCSF {{professor}} Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) violates {{orders from}} Cheever (relayed through Hextall) to destroy his samples, and identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough {{to work on}} a vaccine. Other scientists determine the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> spread by fomites, with a basic reproduction number of four when the virus mutates, with projections of one in twelve of the population being infected, and a 25-30% mortality rate.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Doomsday is a 2008 {{science fiction}} action horror film written and {{directed}} by Neil Marshall. The film takes place in the future in Scotland, which has been quarantined because of a deadly virus. When the <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> found in London, political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.|$|E
