40|$|We {{propose a}} new complex block floating-point format to reduce {{implementation}} complexity. The new format achieves wordlength reduction by sharing an exponent across the block of samples, and uses box encoding for the shared exponent to reduce quantization error. Arithmetic operations are performed on blocks of samples at time, {{which can also}} reduce implementation complexity. For {{a case study of}} a baseband quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transmitter and receiver, we quantify the tradeoffs in signal quality <b>vs.</b> <b>implementation</b> complexity using the new approach to represent IQ samples. Signal quality is measured using error vector magnitude (EVM) in the receiver, and implementation complexity is measured in terms of arithmetic complexity as well as memory allocation and memory input/output rates. The primary contributions of this paper are (1) a complex block floating-point format with box encoding of the shared exponent to reduce quantization error, (2) arithmetic operations using the new complex block floating-point format, and (3) a QAM transceiver case study to quantify signal quality <b>vs.</b> <b>implementation</b> complexity tradeoffs using the new format and arithmetic operations.

40|$|Abstract â€” Many {{digital signal}} {{processing}} and communication algorithms are first simulated using floating-point arithmetic and later transformed into fixed-point arithmetic to reduce implementation complexity. For the floating-point to fixed-point transformation, this paper describes two methods within an automated transformation environment.

The second method, a genetic algorithm for multiobjective optimization, provides a family of solutions that form a tradeoff curve for signal quality <b>vs.</b> <b>implementation</b> complexity. We provide case studies for an infinite impulse response filter. In the case study, implementation complexity is lookup table area for a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) realization.

40|$|Interpolating, dual {{resistor}} ladder D/A converters typically use the fine, LSB ladder floating {{upon the}} static MSB ladder. The {{usage of the}} LSB ladder incurs a penalty in dynamic performance due to the added output resistance and switch matrix parasitic capacitance. Current biasing of the LSB ladder addresses this issue by employing active circuitry. We propose an inverted ladder D/A converter, where an MSB ladder slides upon two static LSB ladders. While using no active components this scheme achieves lower output resistance and parasitic capacitance for a given power budget.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Channel {{shortening}} filters {{have been}} used in acous-tics to reduce reverberation, in error control decoding to reduce complexity, and in communication systems to reduce inter-symbol interference. The cascade of a channel and a channel shortening filter would produce an overall impulse response that has more of the energy in the channel impulse response compacted into fewer adjacent samples. Once designed, channel shortening filters operate on a per-sample basis. In this paper, we evaluate sparse FIR filters, which use more design complexity and less per-sample processing complexity, for channel shortening. Our contributions include (1) proposing a new sparse FIR filter design method for channel shortening, and (2) evaluating design tradeoffs in energy compaction <b>vs.</b> <b>implementation</b> complexity for sparse and non-sparse FIR filters. Our simulation results for ADSL channels show that sparse designs could achieve the same energy compaction with half as many coefficients than non-sparse FIR filters for low filter orders.
