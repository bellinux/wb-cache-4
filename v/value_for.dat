30|$|The MDB <b>values</b> <b>for</b> image {{coordinates}} of keypoints and GCPs in Case I and II were similar. MDB <b>values</b> <b>for</b> GCPs were around 10  pixels, and MDB <b>values</b> <b>for</b> keypoints that were matched in three images were {{around the same}} level, indicating that they had similar performance in outlier detectability. However, MDB <b>values</b> <b>for</b> keypoints that are matched in two images were much higher, and MDB <b>values</b> <b>for</b> GCP’s world coordinates in Case II lied on meter level. The situations of MSB <b>values</b> <b>for</b> Case I and II were complex as MSB values’ distributions inside each group were not uniform. In some cases, the correlation among the measurement contributed by keypoints were high (e.g. larger than 0.9), causing higher MSB values. However, if the correlations among the measurement were lower, MSB <b>values</b> would decrease. <b>For</b> both cases, the measurements contributed by GCPs’ {{image coordinates}} were easier to be separated with other measurements as their MSBs were lower than others.|$|R

5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions.

For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa <b>value</b> <b>for</b> use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

This paper presented the concept of integrating MMSs into established classifiers.

5|$|A {{survey in}} 2012 {{revealed}} that passengers who used Metrolink everyday for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised {{that the older}} vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated {{and the cause of}} much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, NET, Midland Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on <b>value</b> <b>for</b> money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was <b>value</b> <b>for</b> money compared to a national average of 60%.|$|E
