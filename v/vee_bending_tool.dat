Influence of <b>tool</b> geometry, <b>bending</b> angle and sheet thickness on springback in air <b>vee</b> <b>bending</b> was investigated in this paper. In order to evaluate influence of sheet material on springback, S 355 MC and DD 13 steels were used in bending experiments.

40|$|Springback is {{a serious}} problem in the air <b>vee</b> <b>bending</b> process because of its inconsistency. An on-line tool to control {{springback}} is more reliable than an analytical model which {{might not be able to}} control the stroke of the machine in real-time. Therefore, one might resort to adaptive control or use an artificial neural network (ANN) trainer, either using experimental data or analytical predictions (or both), and use it for real-time control of the machine tool. The inconsistency in springback is then reduced to within acceptable limits. Adaptive control would need several strokes to complete the job, but it is envisaged that the job could be completed in a single stroke with the ANN. The present paper discusses the development of an ANN which can be used to train and later to predict the springback, as well as the punch travel, to achieve the desired angle in a single stroke in an air <b>vee</b> <b>bending</b> process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Paper {{describes}} bending of {{sheet metal}} for angles greater than 90 degrees on simple forming <b>tools.</b> <b>Bending</b> using the bending method ‚Äûtraktrix‚Äù (in two steps) or the method ‚Äûturning of the strip‚Äù (in one step) {{can be used}} for more complicated bends, i. e., for 90 degrees or more. Design/methodology/approach: We used the principle of ‚Äútraktrix‚Äú curve known in field of deep drawing process in bending process. The bending method, based on ‚Äûtraktrix‚Äù curve for more complicated bends, i. e., for 90 o or more was developed. A sketch of 90 o bending of unknown author and unknown source existed. Findings: It‚Äôs possible to bend sheet metal for 90 degrees or more using ‚Äútraktrix‚Äù curve. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited by time and costs.

40|$|Springback in air <b>vee</b> <b>bending</b> {{process is}} {{large in the}} absence of bottoming. Inconsistency in {{springback}} might arise due to inconsistent sheet thickness and material properties. Among the various intelligent methods for controlling springback, an artificial neural network (ANN) may be used for real time control by virtue of their robustness and speed. The present work describes the development of an ANN based on backpropagation (BP) of error. The architecture, established using an analytical model for training consisted of 5 input, 10 hidden and two output nodes (punch displacement and springback angle). The five inputs were angle of bend, punch radius/thickness ratio, die gap, die entry radius, yield strength to Young's modulus ratio and the strain hardening exponent, n. The effect of network parameters on the mean square error (MSE) of prediction was studied. The ANN was subsequently trained with experimental data generated from over 400 plane strain bending experiments using combinations of two punch radii, three die radii and three die gaps and five different materials. Updating of the learning rate and the momentum term was found to be beneficial. Testing of the ANN was carried out using experimental data not used during training. It was found that accuracy of predictions depended more on the number of training patterns used than on the ANN architecture. A comparison between batch and pattern modes of training showed that the pattern mode of learning was slower but more accurate. (C) 200...|$|R
