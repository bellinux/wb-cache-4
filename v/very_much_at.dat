5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and punishment is dealt deftly, after a small town church {{is the site of}} a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E

25|$|Sciascia's work is {{intricate}} and displays {{a longing for}} justice, while attempting to show how corrupt Italian society had become and remains. His linking of politicians, intrigue, and the Mafia gave him a high profile, which was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> odds with his private self. This high-profile resulted in his becoming widely disliked for his criticism of Giulio Andreotti, then Prime Minister, for his lack of action to free Moro and answer {{the demands of the}} Brigate Rosse (Red Brigades).|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} no {{agreed-upon}} scientific method for making experiments reproducible. Indeed, many alchemists included in their methods irrelevant {{information such as}} {{the timing of the}} tides or the phases of the moon. The esoteric nature and codified vocabulary of alchemy appeared to be more useful in concealing the fact that they could not be sure of <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> all. As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated by other people, and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E
25|$|Lacrosse in Australia {{is a minor}} sport, with a {{long and}} proud history dating back to 1876, with a small but {{dedicated}} community of participants and volunteers. The established centres for the game are in the greater metropolitan areas of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth. In these cities there are organised weekend field lacrosse competitions {{for men and women}} at senior and junior levels, played over the winter months (April until September). In the off-season, there are informal box lacrosse and sofcrosse competitions, though the majority of players in Australia are mostly of the field lacrosse type. Some lacrosse is also played in Sydney, Newcastle, South East Queensland, Townsville, Cairns and Hobart, it is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the developmental level.|$|E

25|$|Doctors and {{scientists}} {{who worked with}} Genie were uncertain about {{most of her life}} from birth to 20 months. By the age of 11 months she was falling behind in her physical development, which researchers believed was due to both malnutrition and some degree of neglect, although the few medical records from the first year of her life noted no physical or mental abnormalities. In conversations with members of the research team that studied Genie, her mother said that as a baby Genie was not very cuddly and did not babble <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>At</b> times she claimed that at an undetermined point Genie said some unspecified individual words, but on other occasions said that Genie never produced speech of any kind, preventing linguists from making any definitive determinations. When Genie was 20 months old, after a pickup truck struck and killed her paternal grandmother, Genie's father decided to increase the family's isolation as much as possible, and because he believed Genie was severely retarded he believed she required a higher degree of isolation {{than the rest of the}} family.|$|E

[...] The party, held on 5 September 1987, has been {{described}} as [...] "the most incredible example of excess the Mediterranean island had ever seen", and was attended by some 700 people. A cake in the shape of Gaudi's Sagrada Família was provided for the party, although the original cake collapsed and was replaced with a 2-metre-long sponge with the notes from Mercury's song [...] "Barcelona". The bill, which included 232 broken glasses, was presented to Queen's manager, Jim Beach.|$|E
500|$|Megadeth toured {{heavily in}} support of Youthanasia. They started the tour in November 1994, with live {{performances}} in South America. The tour continued in 1995, {{with a number of}} opening acts such as Korn, Flotsam and Jetsam and Fear Factory. During this period Megadeth also visited Europe, where they stayed for eight weeks. Ellefson shared his impressions from performing in front of European fans: [...] "So far, the audiences have been really good {{and it seems to me}} that heavy metal and especially Megadeth are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the forefront of music in Europe. It seems like the attendance is better than it has ever been". The worldwide tour ended in September 1995, with the band performing at Monsters Of Rock in South America with Ozzy Osbourne and Alice Cooper as the headliners.|$|E
500|$|In September 25, 2012, Revolution {{announced}} that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 would be greenlit if their [...] Kickstarter reached $1 million. Despite Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse {{failing to meet}} the $1 million 'stretch goal', Revolution {{announced that}} the success of its crowdfunding campaign had inspired them to greenlight Beneath a Steel Sky 2. However, Revolution later clarified that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 will not necessarily be the studio's first project following Broken Sword 5 and that they would [...] "think" [...] about what their next game will be after finishing the Broken Sword game. In February 2014 it was reported that Beneath a Steel Sky 2 had never entered production, despite previous reports to the contrary. The reason cited was [...] that the Broken Sword franchise took up the sole focus of the company.

500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Madonna sells the song, due to [...] "the bass gurgles that remind of classic Massive Attack or the {{reference}} to 'Vogue.'" [...] PopMatterss Evan Sawdey enjoyed the sense of dirty fun that permeates [...] "Holy Water", writing that [...] "Madonna sounds <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> home with aggressive sentiments like 'Bitch, get off my pole' and 'Yeezus loves my pussy best', blatantly toying around with religious iconography while having a bit of provocative fun." [...] He also found the [...] "Vogue" [...] sample [...] "a rare case of Madonna acknowledging her own legacy." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song is [...] "a welcome bit of percolating electronica". Cinquemani commended {{the inclusion of the}} word [...] "genuflect" [...] in a pop song, but also felt that [...] "Madonna's Catholic baiting [...] like a reflex at this point". The reviewer believed that Madonna deliberately included provocative lyrics in the song, either to bring back her persona Dita Parlo from her 1992 studio album Erotica, or just to make a statement [...] "about women of a certain age unapologetically flexing their libidos".|$|E
500|$|To {{promote his}} {{developing}} ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 {{he addressed the}} conference, giving {{an account of the}} Cape Adare foreshore as a location where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter. He described the site as [...] "a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions", and said there were indications that in this place [...] "the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers". He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy route—a [...] "gentle slope". He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself. Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: [...] "His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration". The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that [...] "the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, in whatever way seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century".|$|E
500|$|The {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works (such as Wace's Roman de Brut) is generally {{agreed to be}} an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France. It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing [...] "Matter of Britain". There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt), and [...] "Celtic" [...] names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances. From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was {{on the role of the}} king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, Ywain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>at</b> the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's Historia itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined. His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns, whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainéant, the [...] "do-nothing king", whose [...] "inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society". Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu, whilst in Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire for a nap. Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, [...] "his prestige is never—or almost never—compromised by his personal weaknesses... his authority and glory remain intact." ...|$|E
