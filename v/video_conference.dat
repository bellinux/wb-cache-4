40|$|International audienceThe Multipoint Control Unit-based {{centralized}} architecture and Application Layer Multicast-based distributed architecture are mainly used for data distribution in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> services. With {{the contribution of}} Scalable Video Coding, the latest extension of Advanced <b>Video</b> Coding, <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> services are being further researched to support terminals' scalability.

In order to do that, a framework for evaluating SVC-based <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> service has been built; intensive simulation results have been also obtained from simulation scenarios which have been designed from the analysis models of the two scalable <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> service architectures.

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Office Management and Technology) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2004. <b>Video</b> <b>conferencing</b> {{networks}} are complex. Implementation and cross-departmental functioning requires a managerial strategy {{to ensure a}} systematic and logical implementation process. The implementation of <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> equipment is based on existing managerial strategies e. g. Process, System, Operation and Project Management in a Total Quality Management (TQM) framework. Managerial functions (planning, organising, activation/motivation and control) are applied in the concluding of an effective managerial strategy for <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation. The proposed managerial strategy for <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation was tested with <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> equipment suppliers (in-depth structured interviews) and <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> network managers (questionnaires) in Gauteng. The proposed strategy (chapter 5) as constituted from comprehensive literature studies (chapters 3 and 4) needed to be adapted. The final <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation strategy (chapter 8) indicated that the inclusion of processes and procedures {{is not sufficient to}} ensure successful implementation. The final strategy for <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation is a flexible strategy that is aligned with existing managerial (operational and implementation) strategies to ensure successful implementation. This is based on the involvement of senior, middle and lower management that also includes the appointment of project teams to ensure successful cross-departmental implementation. The formulation of quality structures and evaluation criteria ensures that strategic objectives set in the strategic plan, vision and mission statement, are achieved. The conclusion of the implemented project is by testing the project through pilot projects and finalising project documentation by means of an acceptance letter to the management team. Dissemination of data (whether the project was successful or not) has to be made to the senior management team. <b>Video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation is not just an action that takes place on an ad hoc basis. It requires a logical and systematic plan, supported by a scientific managerial strategy to ensure that the set objectives and quality standards are achieved...|$|R

40|$|By {{maintaining}} {{eye contact}} in visual communication, {{such as in}} <b>video</b> <b>conferencing,</b> the feeling of intimacy can be greatly enhanced. Unfortunately, due to the physical constraints on the arrangement of cameras and monitors, {{it is not easy}} to preserve eye contact in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing.</b> Most people have tried to solve this problem using hardware approaches, which usually lead to bulky or expensive solutions. In this paper, we propose a real-time software method for preserving eye contact in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing.</b> For each station involved in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing,</b> we use two pre-calibrated cameras to acquire a stereo view of the local participant. Then, we apply disparity-based view morphing to the acquired stereo view to generate the desired view that preserves eye contact with another participant. Our experiments demonstrate that the eye contact problem can indeed be solved in real-time by using our software approach. This is the first time a software approach has been shown to be practical for preserving eye contact in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing...</b>|$|R
