5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys and bigger catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Another {{common use}} of a ballast {{resistor}} in the automotive industry is adjusting the <b>ventilation</b> <b>fan</b> speed. The ballast is a fixed resistor with usually two center taps, and the fan speed selector switch is used to bypass portions of the ballast: all of them for full speed, and none for the low speed setting. A very common failure occurs when the fan is being constantly run at the next-to-full speed setting (usually 3 out of 4). This will cause a very short piece of resistor coil to be operated with a relatively high current (up to 10A), eventually burning it out. This will render the fan unable to run at the reduced speed settings.|$|E

Results of flow simulations show that a 17 % temperature reduction was achieved when two <b>ventilation</b> <b>fans</b> with airflow velocity of 2. 84 m/s were placed at the rear deck.

When four fans were used a further 4. 8 % temperature reduction was achieved. Increasing the airflow velocity at the four fans placed at the roof, from 2. 84 m/s to 15. 67 m/s, caused only a small reduction in the air temperature inside the passenger compartment...|$|R
