5|$|A poll in February 2014 (by RED C for RTÉ's Prime Time and The Sunday Business Post) {{showed that}} 76% of <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> vote yes to the {{introduction}} of same-sex marriage in any referendum.|$|E
5|$|In January 1960, a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} approached Carroll about leading a campaign to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to provide electricity to McCracken County. TVA could provide electricity {{at a much lower}} cost, but <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> first have to hold a public referendum on buying out Kentucky Utilities, the private power provider in the area. Carroll agreed to lead the campaign, and nine months later, voters approved the buyout by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, {{the ballot}} for Quebec {{elections}} was redesigned {{to reduce the}} size of the space where voters could indicate their choice and the rules on allowable markings were relaxed, so that Deputy Returning Officers would have fewer grounds for rejecting ballots. The Quebec government also changed the Electoral Act so that <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> need to show a Canadian passport, Quebec drivers' licence or Quebec provincial health care card at the polling station for identification purposes in future elections.|$|E

60|$|But a Liberal <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> {{stop him}} {{in the street and}} shake hands and say in a frank, cordial way.|$|R
50|$|Then, every <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> {{have the}} {{opportunity}} to cast two votes on a single issue (one regular vote and one bonus vote), and one vote on the others (one regular vote).|$|R
5|$|The Representation of the People Act {{was passed}} in 1918 which gave women {{over the age of}} 30, who met a {{property}} qualification, the right to vote. Several factors led to the passing of the Act, including the efforts of working women, the dilution of anti-suffrage rhetoric and political change in London, where Asquith had been replaced as Prime Minister by Lloyd George. The government believed that six million <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> be added by the 1918 Act, in Wales the electorate rose from 430,000 to 1,172,000.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at {{the time for a}} {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|Perot's {{performance}} {{satisfied the}} 5% popular vote threshold for third party candidates, classifying it as successful under the criterion established by scholar Walter Dean Burnham. The legitimacy of this {{success has been}} questioned by scholars who dismiss the label of Perot as a typical third party candidate, {{largely due to the}} availability of campaign funds and financing of grassroots efforts. Others dispute these claims and point out that Perot forced the other candidates to change their rhetoric on the issues to gain the votes of his supporters, indicating an issues campaign. Exit polls revealed that 35% of <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> have voted for Perot if they believed he could win. Contemporary analysis reveals that Perot could have won the election if the polls prior to the election had shown the candidate with a larger share, preventing the wasted vote mindset.|$|E

5|$|These polls were {{conducted}} before candidate details were finalised. Some show hypothetical match-ups between Zac Goldsmith and prospective Labour candidates, and others show {{the results of}} a generic question about which party a <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> support in the Mayoral election.|$|R
50|$|Note, {{that if any}} <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> set the {{threshold}} between approvals and disapprovals at any other place, the Condorcet loser L {{would not be the}} (single) Approval winner. However, since Approval voting elects the Condorcet loser in the example, Approval voting fails the Condorcet loser criterion.|$|R
5|$|The Republicans {{nominated}} Andrew T. Wood, {{a lawyer}} from Mount Sterling, who had failed in earlier elections for Congress and state attorney general. Concurrently with the gubernatorial election, the state's <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> {{decide whether to}} ratify a proposed new constitution for the state in 1891. The divided Democrats had taken no stand on the document {{as part of their}} convention's platform, and Wood spent much of the campaign trying to get Brown to declare his support for or opposition to it. About six weeks before the election, Brown, sensing strong public support for the new constitution, finally came out in favor of it. For the remainder of the race, Wood touted an alleged conspiracy between Brown and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad to thwart meaningful corporate regulations, but the issue failed to gain much traction.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body that governs the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E
25|$|A Zogby International poll {{released}} on August 15, 2008 indicated {{that more than}} 50% of Democratic and Republican <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> like to see Libertarian Party nominee Bob Barr included in the presidential debates. Almost 70% of independent <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> also {{like to see him}} included. 46% of all voters polled and 59% of independents would also like to see independent candidate Ralph Nader included.|$|E
50|$|This {{is likely}} to be a donkey vote because the National Party would have issued a how-to-vote card {{suggesting}} that voters place the Labor candidate second last behind the One Nation candidate. It is also unlikely that a National Party <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> give second and third preference to Labor and the Greens.|$|R
50|$|The {{proof is}} {{in two parts}} (Arrow, 1963, pp. 97-100). The first part {{considers}} the hypothetical case of some one voter's ordering that prevails ('is decisive') as to the social choice for some pair of social states no matter what that voter's preference for the pair, despite all other voters opposing. It is shown that, for a constitution satisfying Unrestricted Domain, Pareto and Independence, that <b>voter's</b> ordering <b>would</b> prevail for every pair of social states, {{no matter what the}} orderings of others. So, the <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> be a Dictator. Thus, Nondictatorship requires postulating that no one would so prevail for even one pair of social states.|$|R
50|$|A fourth {{problem is}} that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the {{knowledge}} necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist Larry Bartels has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices {{do not reflect the}} vote choices that a fully informed <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.|$|R
25|$|On January 20, 2007, in Topeka, he {{announced}} that he was running for President in 2008. On February 22, 2007, a poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports held that three percent of likely primary <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> support Brownback.|$|E
25|$|A Zogby poll {{released}} on August 15, 2008, indicated that most Republican and Democratic voters wanted Barr {{to be included}} in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that almost 70% of independent <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> have liked to see him included.|$|E
25|$|After {{independence}} the American {{states were}} obliged to write constitutions establishing how each would be governed. For three years, from 1778 to 1780, the political energies of Massachusetts were absorbed in drafting a charter of government that the <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> accept.|$|E
50|$|The {{referendum}} was indicative (non-binding), {{and asked}} two questions. The first question asked voters if {{they wished to}} keep the existing MMP voting system, or change to a different voting system. The second question asked which alternative voting system the <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> prefer if New Zealand were to change voting system: first past the post, preferential voting, single transferable vote, or supplementary member.|$|R
5000|$|Many jurisdictions {{around the}} world use a system called Instant-runoff voting (IRV) or [...] "ranked choice voting". Each <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> rank all (or at least some) of the {{available}} options. If one option is ranked first {{by a majority of}} voters, it wins. Otherwise, the option(s) obtaining the least number of votes is (are) eliminated, and the options ranked second by those voters get those votes.|$|R
50|$|Initially, voters {{informed}} a polling officer orally {{of their}} chosen candidate. In 1870, the secret ballot came into use, whereby each <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> mark their choice on a printed ballot {{and place the}} ballot in a sealed box; this system essentially continues in use today. The change occurred to reduce the chances of voters feeling intimidated, embarrassed, or pressured about their vote, and to reduce the chances of corruption.|$|R
25|$|The {{elections}} for the 47 seats of the National Assembly were planned {{to be held in}} two rounds: In the first round, <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> have voted for a party. The two parties with the largest share of the national vote would then have been able to field candidates in the 47 constituencies. However, as only two parties successfully registered for the election, the election was held in one round.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all of Lithuania's major {{political}} parties supported membership of the EU and opinion polls as the date approached showed about 65% of <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> vote yes. The President of Lithuania Rolandas Paksas, who once competed in aerobatics competitions, flew around Lithuania in his plane performing stunts to raise enthusiasm. The campaign was very one-sided with only a poorly organised No campaign based on milk producers, Russian speakers and right wing nationalists.|$|E
25|$|Democratic {{political}} machines, especially Tammany Hall in Manhattan, opposed woman suffrage {{because they}} {{feared that the}} addition of female <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> dilute the control they had established over groups of male voters. By {{the time of the}} New York State referendum on women's suffrage in 1917, however, some wives and daughters of Tammany Hall leaders were working for suffrage, leading it to take a neutral position that was crucial to the referendum's passage.|$|E

50|$|Fourteen {{persons are}} elected {{to be members}} of the ratifying convention. Those 14 would be elected statewide, meaning that each <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> cast votes for {{fourteen}} people, with the top fourteen vote-getters being elected. The election must take place from three to twelve months after the governor's call. The convention must begin 20 to 30 days after the election. The convention itself is held in the Senate chamber in the state capital.|$|R
50|$|If {{the project}} is turned down by the <b>voters,</b> Hermosa <b>would</b> have to pay E&B Natural Resources the full amount of the loan.|$|R
25|$|Because {{the voters}} of Store Magleby and Sengeløse were almost {{exclusively}} owner-occupiers, who voted center-rightwing, whereas Høje-Taastrup Municipality and Dragør Municipality {{to a large extent}} consisted of tenants who rented their apartments and who voted center-leftwing, there were heated debates and reluctance among {{the voters of}} Store Magleby and Sengeløse about joining the new municipalities. This was because the center-rightwing <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> be in a minority at elections for their local councils.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{had been}} held nationwide on 16 October 2005, from 8 am to 10 pm. Poll stations were mainly managed on a voluntary basis; they were hosted mainly in squares, local party quarters, schools, and even restaurants, bars, campers and a hairdresser; some polling stations were also provided outside the country for Italians abroad. Most of the party leaders claimed a result of 1 million <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> be a good success for the election, but over four million people for the occasion went {{to cast a vote}} in the primary election.|$|E
25|$|In March 2002, {{he filed}} {{to run for}} {{re-election}} to his office while the ethics case against him was still pending. Bunn was optimistic the investigation would exonerate him and that <b>voters</b> <b>would</b> focus on his record instead of the ethics issues. He ran against State Senator Susan Castillo and Rob Kremer in the May primary, and finished a distant third to Castillo with 114,203 votes to her 406,247. Castillo won enough votes to avoid a runoff in the November general election and took over for Bunn on January 5, 2003.|$|E
50|$|Postal {{voting and}} early voting are {{separate}} procedures also available to <b>voters</b> who <b>would</b> {{not be in}} their registered electoral districts on a voting day.|$|R
3000|$|First, suppose q> 1 / 2. In this case, when a voter has {{no other}} {{information}} than her prior, she thinks that policy E is the best. Now, let us consider that the voter knew {{the content of the}} two signals. If both were in favor of policy E, the <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> be reinforced in her opinion that policy E is the best. 22 If one signal indicated e and the other a, the content of the two signals would cancel out and the <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> still prefer E, her prior. 23 Lastly, suppose the two signals indicated a. Applying Bayes rule, we obtain that P(w=w_A | s_ 1 =a,s_ 2 =a)>P(w=w_E | s_ 1 =a,s_ 2 =a) if and only if (1 -q)[(1 -ε [...])^ 2 +ρε (1 -ε [...])]>q[ε ^ 2 +ρε (1 -ε [...])], which can be rewritten as q<q=(1 -ε [...])[1 -ε (1 -ρ [...])]/ 1 - 2 ε (1 -ε [...])(1 -ρ [...]). In order for the problem to be interesting, when analyzing the case q> 1 / 2, we will assume that after two a signals, the voter changes her mind and prefers A.

50|$|His {{original}} {{electoral system}} ideas included making The United Kingdom one huge electorate (1854) set the divisor as 654 {{the number of}} seats in the UK Parliament one huge electorate (later he changed this to seven or eight hundred electorates) and that each <b>voter</b> <b>would</b> sign and check his vote. By 1873, however, he had adapted his ideas {{to take account of}} the secret vote. Under Hare's method, simply dividing the vote by the number of seats constituted the quota and then the surplus was expected to be distributed 'at random'.|$|R
