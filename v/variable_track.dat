40|$|Conceptual {{and methodological}} {{problems}} related to Schmidt' (1975) motor schema theory are discussed. In particular, the motor schema is interpreted as representing {{the dynamics of the}} system being controlled, {{which may or may not}} be associated with a referent movement pattern. Furthermore, it is suggested that prior familiarity with a control system's dynamics is a critical but uncontrolled factor in tests of the theory, and largely accounts for their equivocal findings. These ideas are examined by two experiments in which subjects had to bimanually control the movement of a computer-displayed cursor along a track on a CRT screen. Different track orientations required different patterns of movement not entailing a single generalized motor program. Experiment 1 shows that <b>variable</b> <b>track</b> performance with a given control system, results in better transfer to novel tracks than does fixed practice. Experiment 2 demonstrates that altering the control system disrupts performance whether or not the required movements remain the same.

40|$|On October 25, 1995, seven {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} a train collision with {{a school bus}} crossing railroad tracks adjacent to a signalized intersection in Fox River Grove, IL. In 1996 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) : Highway/Railroad Accident Report # PB 96 - 916202 made several recommendations to the the United States Secretary of Transportation, {{one of which was}} “… the use and maintenance of railroad and highway traffic signal recording devices……. to readily determine that the highway signals and railroad-activated warning devices are coordinated and operating properly. ” To date, this particular recommendation had not been addressed. ^ This dissertation proposes (1) screening and prioritizing procedure for signalized intersection adjacent to highway-railroad crossings, (2) performance measures to evaluate track clearing effectiveness, and (3) direct measurement of highway-railroad synchronization operation. The proposed screening and prioritization procedures were applied to 595 state maintained intersections, which identified 20 intersections for future field investigation. Changes in track clearing effectiveness were used to evaluate 2802 preempt events to compare a pre/post steerable signal head installation that was installed based upon the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) Section 8 D. 07 guidance. This analysis concluded there was no impact on the effectiveness of track clearance based on the signal head change. In regards to the NTSB recommendations, this dissertation defined a procedure for assessing railroad synchronization applied it to over 7, 648 preempt events recorded on a railroad interconnected traffic signal controller. Improvements to the synchronization and transition were made based the incremental analysis of performance measures. As a result of this analysis, the fixed track clear green phase was first extended by 5 seconds, followed by a subsequent refinement implementing a <b>variable</b> <b>track</b> clear green phase that terminated when the gate was down. As a result of those improvements the frequency of gates going down after the end of track clear green was reduced from 42 % to 10 % to 0 % respectively. The effectiveness of track clear green based on post track vehicle presence was also improved reducing vehicle presence from 33 to 3 to 0 vehicles respectively. The dissertation concludes with specific recommendations regarding performance measures, new traffic signal timing techniques, and potential geometric improvements {{that can be used to}} reduce train/vehicle conflicts. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a backward Euler stabilized-based control strategy {{applied to a}} neutral point clamped (NPC) back-to-back connected five level converters. A generalized method is used to obtain the back-to-back NPC converter system model. The backward Euler stabilized-based control strategy uses one set of calculations to compute the optimum voltage vector needed to reach the references and to balance the voltage of the DC-bus capacitors. The output voltage vector is selected using a modified cost functional that includes <b>variable</b> <b>tracking</b> errors in the functional weights, whereas in classic approaches, the weights are considered constant. The proposed modified cost functional enables AC current tracking and DC-bus voltage balancing {{in a wide range}} of operating conditions. The paper main contributions are: (i) a backward Euler stabilized-based control strategy applied to a double, back-to-back connected, five level NPC converter; (ii) the use of cost functional weight varying as a function of the controlled <b>variable</b> <b>tracking</b> errors to enforce the controlled variables and to balance the DC capacitor voltages; and (iii) the demonstration of system feasibility for this type of converter topology and control strategy, ensuring a high enough computational efficiency and extending the modulation index from 0. 6 to 0. 93.

40|$|Adjuvants are {{compounds}} {{added to}} an agrochemical spray formulation to improve or modify {{the action of}} an active ingredient (AI) or the physico-chemical characteristics of the spray liquid. Adjuvants can have more than only one distinct mode of action (MoA) during the foliar spray application process and they are generally known {{to be the best}} tools to improve agrochemical formulations. The main objective for this work was to elucidate the basic MoA of adjuvants by uncoupling different aspects of the spray application. Laboratory experiments, beginning from retention and spreading characteristics, followed by humectant effects concerning the spray deposit on the leaf surface and ultimately the cuticular penetration of an AI, were figured out to evaluate overall in vivo effects of adjuvants which were also obtained in a greenhouse spray test. For this comprehensive study, the surfactant classes of non-ionic sorbitan esters (Span), polysorbates (Tween) and oleyl alcohol polyglycol ether (Genapol O) were generally considered because of their common promoting potential in agrochemical formulations and their structural diversity. The reduction of interfacial tension {{is one of the most}} crucial physico-chemical properties of surfactants. The dynamic surface tension (DST) was monitored to characterise the surface tension lowering behaviour which is known to influence the droplet formation and retention characteristics. The DST is a function of time and the critical time frame of droplet impact might be at about 100 ms. None of the selected surfactants were found to lower the surface tension sufficiently during this short timeframe (chapter I). At ca. 100 ms, Tween 20 resulted in the lowest DST value. When surfactant monomers are fully saturated at the droplet-air-interface, an equilibrium surface tension (STeq) value can be determined which may be used to predict spreading or run-off effects. The majority of selected surfactants resulted in a narrow distribution of STeq values, ranging between 30 and 45 mN m- 1. Nevertheless, all surfactants were able to decrease the surface tension considerably compared to pure water (72 mN m- 1). The influence of different surfactants on the wetting process was evaluated by studying time-dependent static contact angles on different surfaces and the droplet spread area on Triticum aestivum leaves after water evaporation. The spreading potential was observed to be better for Spans than for Tweens. Especially Span 20 showed maximum spreading results. To transfer laboratory findings to spray application, related to field conditions, retention and leaf coverage was measured quantitatively on wheat leaves by using a <b>variable</b> <b>track</b> sprayer. Since the retention process involves short time dynamics, it is well-known that the spray retention on a plant surface is not correlated to STeq but to DST values. The relationship between DST at ca. 100 ms and results from the track sprayer showed increasing retention results with decreasing DST, whereas at DST values below ca. 60 mN m- 1 no further retention improvement could be observed. Under field conditions, water evaporates from the droplet within a few seconds to minutes after droplet deposition on the leaf surface. Since precipitation of the AI must essentially being avoided by holding the AI in solution, so-called humectants are used as tank-mix adjuvants. The ability of pure surfactants to absorb water from the surrounding atmosphere was investigated comprehensively by analysing water sorption isotherms (chapter II). These isotherms showed an exponential shape with a steep water sorption increase starting at 60...|$|E
