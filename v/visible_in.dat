5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was <b>visible</b> <b>in</b> the night sky for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E

40|$|This {{synthesis}} {{project is}} motivated by the apparent neglect of <b>visible</b> minorities <b>in</b> Canadian health data and research. The main question is: Are <b>visible</b> minorities invisible <b>in</b> Canadian health data and research? To address this question, we assess the nature, extent, and range of data and research available on the health and health care access of <b>visible</b> minorities <b>in</b> Canada. Specifically, we summarize: (1) mortality and morbidity patterns for visible minorities; (2) determinants of visible minority health; (3) health status and determinants of visible minority older adult (VMOA) health; and (4) promising data sources {{that may be used}} to examine <b>visible</b> minority health <b>in</b> future research. While we reviewed a large number of publications, we note that only 5 examined population-­‐level data to specifically compare visible minorities with white Canadians and just 2 distinguished between Canadian-­‐born visible minorities and foreign-­‐born <b>visible</b> minorities. <b>In</b> addition, because of data and methodological limitations, and differences in topics examined, findings are not easily comparable to provide a clear picture of visible minorities’ health...|$|R
