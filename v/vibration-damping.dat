30|$|After {{the first}} SEM observation, the {{workstation}} was employed for FIB preparation of TEM foils. For this purpose, a manually operated, <b>vibration-damped</b> tungsten needle {{was used to}} transfer the dust particle from the dimpled quartz glass plate to a polished 12 -mm aluminum SEM stub that had been coated with a thin (< 10 μm) layer of glycol phthalate (GP). The stub with the grain resting {{on top of the}} GP layer was transferred into a glass vessel filled with acetone vapor and put to rest for 10 min to liquefy the GP layer. The latter formed a meniscus under the grain and fixed it securely to the stub. After the complete evaporation of any residual acetone, the sample stub was coated with carbon and inspected by SEM. At this point, a small adhering olivine grain (subsample RB-QD 04 - 0042 - 01) was removed from the main grain and attached to a copper FIB-TEM grid by using the internal micromanipulator of the FIB-SEM workstation in combination with Ga+ ion beam-assisted platinum deposition. After this, the surface of the main grain was covered with a platinum layer via electron beam-assisted deposition and deep trenches on three sides of the grain were milled into the aluminum stub. Undercutting of the grain left it suspended on a thin aluminum cantilever, which allowed cutting off a series of three 7 - to 8 -μm-thick sections at predetermined locations (Figure  1 b), which were protected by additional platinum layers.|$|R
40|$|Ultra-precision {{machines}} {{are the most}} accurate class of machine tools. The achievable precision is nowadays not limited by the available measuring technology, but rather by disturbance variables. The disturbances result primarily from thermal effects and vibrations as well as pulsations. Particularly {{in the case of}} the production of diffraction gratings with a structural height h < 100 nm, the ultra-precision machining gets to its limits. The challenge is growing with regard to the production of diffractive structures on curved surfaces, due to the necessary degrees of freedom and the number of involved machine axes. This limit can be shifted by means of targeted measurement and an extended knowledge of the disturbance variables. Thermal effects generate shape deviations with a low spatial frequency of several microns and a shape deviation up to several 100 nm and limit the absolute accuracy. Regarding shaping processes, vibrations transmitted into the work pieces by the tool generate ripple with a height of usually h < 20 nm with a mid/high spatial frequency in the range of k < 0. 125 μm- 1 (cutting speed f = 500 mm/min) and essentially limit the achievable minimum structure size. With smaller structures, the importance of vibration reduction increases. The causal clarification of the ripple is often not trivial, but can be supported by the use of PSD (power spectral density). The actual resulting spatial frequency caused by vibration is directly related to the hertzian frequency depending on the cutting speed. A computation of a time resolved PSD from the usually spatial resolved PSD simplifies the causal clarification. Each machine has a very specific PSD signature, which can be determined by shaping processes and WLI (white light interferometry) measurement. In the case of machines with a variety of axes, each axis configuration may have its own PSD signature. A compromise of possible degrees of freedom and resulting PSD function allows the selection of the most suitable configuration. Changes to this specific signature allow the detection of machine faults. Using the example of blazed grating structures, it is shown that this method is a powerful tool for the evaluation and optimization of ultra-precision machines. The surface-dominant frequency bands can be assigned to mechanical and electromagnetic sources, which can be eliminated in some cases. In order to eliminate mechanical and electromagnetic vibrations the method is explained on the basis of selected examples. The remaining time resolved PSD signature of a machine enables statements on the suitability of the machine for the production of specific optics. Regarding diffractive structures, it has been shown that the production of efficient blazed gratings is limited by the machine's natural frequencies, besides thermal effects. In addition, the knowledge about the frequencies gained from the time resolved PSD can also be used to shift the spatial frequencies by use of an appropriate cutting speed. The experiments were carried out on a modified, highly temperature stabilized and active <b>vibration-damped</b> ultra-precision machine LT-Ultra MMC 1100 and represent the limitations and possibilities of the production of imaging diffractive optics for spectroscopic applications...|$|R

40|$|Active Constrained Layer (ACL) {{treatment}} is a <b>vibration-damping</b> treatment {{which consists of}} a viscoelastic layer constrained by an actuator. It dissipates energy simultaneously by the shearing of the viscoelastic layer and {{by the action of}} the actuator. An example of applications for ACL treatments is the damping of vibrations on metal panels with which cars and other vehicles are built. In order to optimise the design of ACL treatments, it is necessary to understand how they function. Therefore, this work proposes experimental and theoretical tools for the investigation of ACL treatments. An accurate model of beams treated with ACL, based on the wave approach, is selected from the literature and validated with experiments. Another model based on the modal approach, less accurate but well suited for gaining insight into the physics of active-passive damping treatments, is proposed and numerically validated. A set of indexes allowing quantification of the different damping mechanisms occurring in ACL treatments is devised. Experiments on beams treated with active-passive damping treatment are carried out to validate and complete the findings from the theoretical models. It is demonstrated that the reduction of power input into the beam by the actuator, which has generally not been taken into account in the literature, is an essential mechanisms of active-passive damping treatments when feedforward control is possible. Also, the distinction between the physics and the control part of active-passive damping treatments is shown to be necessary in order to gain insight into the functioning of these treatments. It is also shown that under optimal control conditions, the vibration reduction obtained with the ACL and AC/PCL treatments depends only on the physical properties of these treatments and is the same for both treatments. Nevertheless, in this optimal situation AC/PCL treatments are better than ACL treatments because they demand a lower control effort. However, it is demonstrated that the type of treatment which is best in a given situation depends on the aims and constraints in this situation...|$|E
40|$|An organic {{polybutadiene}} (PB) rubberbased aerogel {{insulation material}} was developed {{that will provide}} superior thermal insulation and inherent radiation protection, exhibiting the flexibility, resiliency, toughness, and durability typical of the parent polymer, yet with the low density and superior insulation properties associated with the aerogels. The rubbery behaviors of the PB rubber-based aerogels are able to overcome the weak and brittle nature of conventional inorganic and organic aerogel insulation materials. Additionally, with higher content of hydrogen in their structure, the PB rubber aerogels will also provide inherently better radiation protection than those of inorganic and carbon aerogels. Since PB rubber aerogels also exhibit good hydrophobicity due to their hydrocarbon molecular structure, they will provide better performance reliability and durability as well as simpler, more economic, and environmentally friendly production over the conventional silica or other inorganic-based aerogels, which require chemical treatment to make them hydrophobic. Inorganic aerogels such as silica aerogels demonstrate many unusual and useful properties. There are several strategies to overcoming the drawbacks associated with the weakness and brittleness of silica aerogels. Development of the flexible fiber-reinforced silica aerogel composite blanket has proven one promising approach, providing a conveniently fielded form factor that is relatively robust toward handling in industrial environments compared to silica aerogel monoliths. However, the flexible silica aerogel composites still have a brittle, dusty character that may be undesirable, or even intolerable, in certain applications. Although the cross-linked organic aerogels such as resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF), polyisocyanurate, and cellulose aerogels show very high impact strength, they are also very brittle with little elongation (i. e., less rubbery). Also, silica and carbon aerogels are less efficient radiation shielding materials due to their lower content of hydrogen element. The present invention relates to maleinized polybutadiene (or polybutadiene adducted with maleic anhydride) - based aerogel monoliths and composites, and the methods for preparation. Hereafter, they are collectively referred to as polybutadiene aerogels. Specifically, the polybutadiene aerogels of the present invention are prepared by mixing a maleinized polybutadiene resin, a hardener containing a maleic anhydride reactive group, and a catalyst in a suitable solvent, and maintaining the mixture in a quiescent state for a sufficient {{period of time to}} form a polymeric gel. After aging at elevated temperatures {{for a period of time}} to provide uniformly stronger wet gels, the micro porous maleinized polybutadiene- based aerogel is then obtained by removing interstitial solvent by supercritical drying. The mesoporous maleinized polybutadiene-based aerogels contain an open-pore structure, which provides inherently hydrophobic, flexible, nearly unbreakable, less dusty aerogels with excellent thermal and physical properties. The materials can be used as thermal and acoustic insulation, radiation shielding, and <b>vibration-damping</b> materials. The organic PB-based rubber aerogels are very flexible, no-dust, and hydrophobic organics that demonstrated the following ranges of typical properties: densities of 0. 08 to 0. 255 grams per cubic centimeters, shrinkage factor (raerogel/rtarget) = 1. 2 to 2. 84, and thermal conductivity values of 20. 0 to 35. 0 mW/m-K...|$|E
40|$|Smart adaptronic Elements for Active Vibration ControlThe induced {{vibrations}} of the high-precision machine {{limit the}} achievable required accuracy, such that constrain the performance {{improvement of the}} machine specifications. The main goal {{in the design of}} high precision machines is to enhance the accuracy while increasing productivity. These two design parameters are negatively coupled, as increasing the machine dynamics leads to more induced vibrations, especially with light structure machines. The induced vibrations will limit both the productivity and the accuracy of the machine. Within the scope of this thesis the main motivated question was Could we improve the performance parameters like: precision, accuracy, productivity, and process stability; by design and produce smart adaptronic modules that will be integrated in a modular way within the high precision machines?, This main question has been split to three main tasks (motivated questions to be answered) during the different research activities: 1. When to use active vibration compensation adaptronic modules? 2. How to design the active vibration compensation adaptronic modules? And, 3. How to use the active adaptronic modules? The development of such adaptronic elements is not an easy task, as it requires an extensive knowledge for a number of different scientific fields, which will be discussed at the beginning, followed by a suggested design methodology to develop the adaptronic element. This design methodology is a series of integrated mechatronic concurrent design processes, which will be applied through the different chapters of this thesis. This design approach consists of three main concurrent design phases:· Identification of the adaptronic design problem. · Integrated design of the adaptronic elements within the mechatronic system. · Adaptronic concept validation. As a real practical applications for the different research activities in this thesis, two prototypes of developed adaptronic modules for active vibration compensation will be presented, namely the active 3 DOF stiffness element A 3 DSE (patent no. WO 2011 / 041858 A 2), and the adaptronic smart platform (European project HARCO (FP 7 - 2010 -NMP-ICT-FoF). The first prototype A 3 DSE module is ideally suited for implementing active vibration compensation in the mechanical structure of machine elements, especially struts, that are subjected to axial or/and bending disturbances. According to the used controller strategy, the A 3 DSE is an adaptronic device for active disturbance-rejection and active <b>vibration-damping</b> applications. The design idea of the A 3 DSE is based on the incorporation of three piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are assembled in an axisymmetrical configuration within a mechanical holding structure, using suitable mechanical and electronic interfaces. The second module is the adaptronic platform, which has been designed as an adaptronic modular interface between the spindle housing and the machine frame of high-precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155, to compensate the vibrations of the cutting tool, to improve the workpiece final surface quality and to reduce the lead time. The working principle is similar to the A 3 DSE, and is based on the incorporation of three powerful high voltage piezoelectric displacement actuators, each equipped with a collocated, piezoelectric force sensor in preloaded units, which are distributed in axisymmetrical configuration to connect the movable and the fixed flanges of milling machines spindle. The two developed prototypes will be experimentally tested, using suitable developed test benches, besides testing the first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform on the real high precision milling machine FIDIA DL 155. Active feedback control technique will be implemented in simple straightforward way to present it as an industrial product in the future work. For the A 3 DSE; the results proved the capability of compensating the axial and bending vibration of the active struts where the A 3 DSE module is integrated in. The dimension and maximum stroke of the used piezoelectric actuators represent the most important factors which determine the range of the compensated vibrations. The adaptronic smart platform module has been tested within developed test bench; the used control strategy depends on two different types of possible feedback measured signal. Firstly, using the collocated force feedback signals from the piezoelectric force sensors integrated in the actuating unit with the three piezoelectric actuators. Secondly, using the acceleration feedback signals from three accelerometers collocated with the three actuating units. The experimental results revealed that the two tilting modes could be successfully damped, and the stiffness at the low frequency range has been improved. The first prototype of the adaptronic smart platform has been mounted on the real FIDIA DL 155 high precision milling machine at the workshop of FIDIA s. p. a., San Mauro Torinese, Italy. The preliminary test results succeeded to compensate the tool-tip vibrations over a wide range of rotating speeds, up to 60 % tool tip vibration suppression. For future work, this research {{is considered to be a}} road map covers the full path from identification to controller synthesis and validation, where provided an integrated mechatronic design approach for adaptronic modules. This integrated approach includes: the identification of the adaptronic design problem, the integration of the adaptronic modules within the mechatronic system, and the adaptronic concept validation. It is general methodology which is suitable to apply for different adaptronic modules depend on the case study. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Are {{anti-vibration}} gloves {{the solution to}} the problem of hand-arm vibration?Vibrations from hand-held machinery are a major problem in the Swedish labour force. In 2009, 14 % of men and 3 % of women of employed in Sweden reported exposure to hand-arm vibration at least a quarter of their working time according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority (Arbetsmiljöverket 2010). It is tempting to imagine a protective glove that could reduce or even eliminate this problem. Research can validate the quality of labour protection gear available on the market and then make recommendations and suggestions for improvements. This report from the Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine in Lund and Gothenburg describes how {{anti-vibration gloves}} (AVGs) are experienced, and how they work and affect the exposure from hand-held machines. BackgroundToday, gloves labelled “anti-vibration” (AV) are advertised as “reducing vibration by 40 %”. To be marketed as “AVG”, a glove must be CE-certified and thereby comply with the requirements of International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 10819. The requirements apply only to the suppression of vibration in the palm of the hand, while in many work situations, vibration is transmitted to the fingers. However, in the ISO standard it is pointed out that AVGs provide inadequate damping of vibrations of low frequencies. Such vibrations are common in many hand-held tools and machines in industry and crafts, such as different types of grinders. Some regular protective gloves can even provide amplification of low frequencies but cannot be approved in accordance with this standard. Generally, all protective equipment disrupts work to a greater or lesser degree. Working without a helmet, protective mask, hearing protection and protective clothing is preferred in most situations. Furthermore, the availability of gloves which are supposedly AV may give rise to an ethical dilemma: the user may handle the machines more intensely and for a longer time in the belief that the hand is protected from vibration damage. But are those AV claims true and how do these gloves perform in practice? Is the experience regarding the gloves that they dampen the vibrations? To what extent do the gloves disturb the worker and interfere with the work? How much damping can be expected when using low-speed and high-speed grinders, respectively? These issues will be discussed in the following report. ImplementationNine subjects, whose work task was to deburr and grind aircraft engine components, were given the opportunity to test a specific AVG for 3 months. They all worked with a variety of rotating air-powered and vibrating machines. All had extensive experience in this work. Usage times for the individual machines varied between ½ hour and 4 hours/day. The total usage times sometimes exceeded 4 hours/day. The most commonly used rotating machines rotate at high speeds, 100 000 revolutions per minute (rpm), but other machines with low speed, 500 rpm, were also used. Only one model of AVG was tested. The back of the glove was made of porous polyester and the palm of a denser, elastic synthetic material. Approximately 7 mm thick, foam-like materials were built into the palm, thumb and fingers grip side of the glove. The glove was CE-marked and was claimed to comply with standard ISO 10819 : 1996. The test subjects tried the glove for 3 months. After this period they answered a questionnaire containing 14 questions including questions on hand temperature, grip, dexterity and self-reported vibration damping. To assess the usefulness of the AVG, the vibration level and vibration frequency spectrum were measured on the machines used by the subjects. During the measurements a skilled operator performed a typical deburring task. Results and DiscussionThe comfort in terms of hand temperature was rated mediocre. Grip was rated good while finger sensitivity was rated low. At a so-called “pencil grip”, required for handling small machinery, the gloves were uncomfortable; however, they worked well with larger machines. The majority, eight of the nine individuals, responded that the glove offered good vibration damping. As the hand’s ability to perceive vibrations varies with the frequency of vibration the possibility to self-assess whether a glove is <b>vibration-damping</b> or not largely depends on how well the person can perceive the frequency of the machine in question. With a high-revving machine of, say, 50 000 rpm, the vibration tactility is fairly low, and so is therefore the ability to self-assess the glove’s damping properties. In addition, the vibratory sense in the hand does not reflect the hand-arm weighted vibration level which needs to be measured according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s regulations (AFS 2005 : 15). With regard to the vibrations, large differences between the various machines were measured; hand-arm weighted levels according to the regulations were between 0. 8 and 8. 3 m/s 2. High-revving, ≥ 55 000 rpm, machines gave the lowest weighted vibration levels. A machine’s rotation speed was found to cause the dominant vibration frequency; however, high frequencies from high-speed machines do not increase the hand-arm weighted exposure levels. ConclusionThe vibrations from many of the machines in this study, which are used over long periods for deburring, will be damped to some extent. But it is not obvious that this damping neither can be experienced, nor give reduced daily vibration exposure in accordance with the regulations, or reduce the risk of vibration injury in the hands. So-called “AVGs” generally give insufficient reduction in vibration exposure. This is demonstrated already by the standard for CE certification of AVGs. For a glove to protect against normal, low-frequency vibrations, it would have to be too heavy and thick to be practical. Despite the limitations of the protection that the CE-marked protective gloves offer against vibrations, we still recommend the use of gloves because: 1) High-frequency vibrations, which are presumed to be harmful, will be damped. 2) The gloves will ensure that vibrations will not be amplified. 3) Gloves keep the hands warm, which is believed to reduce vibration-related disorders...|$|E
