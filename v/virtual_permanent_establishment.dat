40|$|Maiden name: Venter, MichelleThe {{continued}} growth of world commerce {{has led to}} the advance of the permanent establishment principles. These principles are, however, constantly challenged by the developments of e-commerce. This thesis considers the taxing of a permanent establishment and the influence of e-commerce on the concept of a permanent establishment. In 2000, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) developed and introduced guidelines {{on how to deal with}} e-commerce in the context of a permanent establishment. Since the OECD guidelines on e-commerce were issued, the permanent establishment principles have come under further scrutiny. The latest development came about in 2013 with the release of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Action Plan. This Action Plan addresses the intention of the OECD to deal with the taxing of the digital economy. With the development of e-commerce and the result of e-commerce creating intangible boundaries between countries, the concept of a <b>virtual</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> has emerged. This has resulted in the need to tax a presence of an enterprise in a jurisdiction where no actual physical connection can be established. Various authors have made suggestions on how to ensure that an economy in which business is being carried on is correctly compensated for in the form of taxes. The source of income is the driving force for the imposition of taxation today. The main goal of this thesis was to explore the alignment of the concepts of a permanent establishment and e-commerce in the digital economy. This study therefore examined the concepts of both permanent establishments and e-commerce, and explored authors’ views and suggestions on how to deal with the inter-related effects of these two concepts. The relevant Action Points in the OECD Action Plan were also considered...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{jurisdiction to}} tax cross-border digital commerce. The primary {{objective is to}} consider {{the reasons for the}} erosion of jurisdictional links, or nexus, between countries and taxpayers' digital activities and evaluate possible solutions for addressing such nexus erosion. Whilst it is argued that digital commerce is impossible to ring-fence due to digital technologies transcending all industries, the main focus of this research is on automated business models as case studies for the broader tax issues applicable across the entire digital economy. Using cloud computing, online advertising and e-tailing models as examples of digital commerce in the narrow sense, this thesis demonstrates that the proxies for establishing jurisdictional nexus have become increasingly fluid, thereby challenging the traditional international tax regimes for profits and consumption taxation. Numerous policy solutions have been proposed in order to rectify nexus erosion, including global and territorial tax models. Unlike the previous research in this area, this thesis focuses on the nexus elements of such proposals and assesses their viability {{in the light of the}} wider Internet governance jurisprudence. Global tax solutions, such as global e-commerce taxes and formulary apportionment, are analysed in the context of the international governance regime for the technical Internet infrastructure. Territorial virtual tax solutions, such as <b>virtual</b> <b>permanent</b> <b>establishments,</b> withholding taxes and destination cash flow taxes, are considered in the light of the Internet jurisprudence on the 'effects' and 'targeting' nexus standards. It is argued that, given the lack of technical and political infrastructure, none of the proposed routes would be viable from a practical perspective in the near future. It is concluded, therefore, that a practical solution would involve retaining the traditional profits and consumption tax models, whilst testing a narrow version of the digital targeting nexus standard as a backstop anti-abuse measure. It is envisaged that the limited anti-avoidance provision would subsequently pave the way for a comprehensive long-term solution, as digitisation continues to transform global commerce. </p...|$|R

The authorised OECD approach is that a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> is a separate and independent entity, engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions, {{taking into account the}} functions performed, assets used and risks assumed by the enterprise through the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> and through other parts of the enterprise. The approach is built on a two step analysis, the first is a functional and factual analysis and the second is determining the income of the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment.</b> The authorised OECD approach is that the Transfer Pricing Guidelines should be applied by analogy in transactions between the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> {{and the rest of the}} enterprise. The Swedish Income Tax Law has the view that the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> is a separate and independent entity. The Swedish approach is a two step analysis; the basis is the accountings of the enterprise adjusted for internal dealings, and the second step is a functional analysis. The Swedish law does not allow allocation of “free” capital to a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment,</b> nor does it allow a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> to deduct royalty payments to other parts of the enterprise.

40|$|<b>Permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> {{has been}} used as a {{principle}} or threshold to determine whether a country has taxing rights on the business profits of a non-resident taxpayer. That threshold, however, has raised many questions in the context of e-commerce. Many countries are now concerned of how to determine <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> in an e-commerce environment. Some view that the existing rule is insufficient to cope with e-commerce. This is because the existing tax rules were not designed in the era of e-commerce.

40|$|E-commerce {{challenges}} traditional taxation {{rules and}} tax authorities {{find it difficult}} to effectively tax business profits derived from cross-border commercial transactions utilising the Internet. This study analyses the fundamental principles of the concept of <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> and related international tax rules and assess the traditional requirements against the unconventional characteristics of e-commerce. Whilst the features of e-commerce ignore territorial borders and geographic locations, that is, the status of a virtual presence, the concept of <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> (still) calls for a fixed location in a country, which relates to a physical presence. Gaps and mismatches in tax rules have allowed multi-national enterprises to adopt strategies to shift profits to low or no-tax jurisdictions and prompted the OECD to launch a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative to counter tax avoidance. Today, more than 100 countries are collaborating to implement the reform measures which include actions to address the tax challenges of the digital economy and to prevent the artificial avoidance of <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> status. The research concludes that the OECD reform measures do not adequately address the issues relating to the concept of a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> in situations where enterprises conduct cross-border e-commerce based on a digital business model. Furthermore, the study submits that due to the traditional <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> (nexus) approach, cases of e-commerce may challenge a country?s taxing rights by virtue of there being no physical presence to constitute a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment.</b> Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

Originated from the Prussian time in 1845 the concept of <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> {{has been used to}} refer as space the conduct of business activity, which means permanence and location within an area rather than the physical location in one specific area.

40|$|The {{right to}} tax is {{traditionally}} based on connection to jurisdiction. Taxation is divided into international and domestic systems. An international tax system subjects its residents to tax on their income {{from all around the}} world while a domestic tax system subjects its residents to tax only on income arising out of a source within the borders of such a State. Under the international tax system, a State's {{right to tax}} firstly depends on whether the taxpayer deriving the said taxable income is a resident of that country or not. With respect to an entity or enterprise, its place of effective management or its headquarters within a State is used to establish residence of such an entity in the State hence making the entity taxable. Where the enterprise does not have a place of effective management or headquarters in a State, hence rendering such enterprise a non-resident, treaty rules have established that the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> concept be used to tax business profits. The <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> becomes the minimum criteria for establishing that such an enterprise has an economic presence within the borders of the source State. In the presence of an enterprise having cross-border transactions, it is possible for the enterprise to be subject to taxable under both the domestic tax system of the State within which it is a resident as well as under the international tax system of the source State within which it has a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment,</b> thus arising the question of double taxation. To help solve such a situation, legal instruments, arising in the form of tax treaties were created to combat double taxation of income arising out of cross-border transactions. Integral in solving this situation is the concept of <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment.</b> The <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> is a source rule; thus a basic requirement to be met before business profits of a non-resident that are attributable to its <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> in the source State are taxed in that State. However, technology developments and the rise of electronic commerce are rising problems on the application of the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> concept in relation to taxing income from international sources of such businesses. 3 The broad meaning of the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> concept, particularly its requirements, make it difficult and ambiguous during its application to enterprises that conduct their businesses electronically or via the internet...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} establish whether {{the presence or}} activities of a partner or partners in South Africa creates (or is at risk of creating) a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> for that partner, the partnership or the co-partners in South Africa. At the outset, the major legal and fiscal consequences of a partnership under South African law are investigated. The unique legal and fiscal treatment of a partnership as a mere aggregate of persons that is treated as fiscally transparent under South African law is relevant to determine the potential application of double taxation agreements to partnerships or their partners. Once {{the terms of a}} double taxation agreement are found to apply in the circumstances, the creation of a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> in terms thereof becomes relevant. The different types of partnerships and partners under South African partnership law are set out and their differentiating characteristics analysed in an effort to identify whether the activities or presence of certain partners are more at risk of giving rise to a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> than others. In a commercial context, the important distinction is drawn between ordinary and extraordinary partners as very different commercial consequences attach to these partners. In particular, whereas ordinary partners automatically derive an implied authority or mutual mandate to manage the business of the partnership as agents of their co-partners by virtue of the partnership agreement, extraordinary partners are excluded from the mutual mandate. The implied authority amongst partners becomes particularly relevant when considering one of the alternative tests for creating a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> that appear in the prevalent model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context, in terms of which the existence of authority is one of the required elements {{for the creation of a}} <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment.</b> The special rules surrounding the source of partnership income is investigated as a means of establishing jurisdiction to tax under South African domestic source rules. The impact of legislation on the South African source rules pertaining to partnerships as developed under the common law is critically analysed and the relevance of source rules in the <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> context is evaluated. It is submitted that it is premature to consider the rules surrounding the creation of a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> under the terms of a double taxation agreement before it is established that the relevant contracting state has the requisite jurisdiction to tax and furthermore that the terms of that double taxation agreement apply to the matter at hand. Finally, the relevant articles of the model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context are discussed with specific focus on the unique attributes of a partnership that may impact on the creation of a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> for the partner or partners by virtue of the presence or activities of a partner or the partners in South Africa. The risk of creating a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> by virtue of the presence or activities of an ordinary partner in South Africa is contrasted with that of an extraordinary partner. It is concluded that the activities or presence of ordinary partners (as opposed to extraordinary partners) are particularly at risk of creating a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> in South Africa, although it is acknowledged that certain requirements will have to be met on the facts of each case before a <b>permanent</b> <b>establishment</b> will be found to exist...|$|R
