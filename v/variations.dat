We estimated the long-term non-storm component of the D st <b>variation</b> by removing the short-term <b>variation</b> related to magnetic storms. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>variation</b> of the non-storm component includes not only a seasonal <b>variation</b> but also an irregular <b>variation.</b> The irregular long-term <b>variation</b> is likely to be due to an anti-correlation with the long-term <b>variation</b> of solar-wind activity. In particular, a clear anti-correlation is observed between the non-storm component of D st and the long-term <b>variation</b> of the solar-wind dynamic pressure. This means that in the long term, the D st index tends to increase when the solar-wind dynamic pressure decreases.

40|$|Abstract: Intraspecific {{morphological}} <b>variation</b> in fish {{is typically}} associated with sexual dimorphism, or one of three common environmental gradients: <b>variation</b> in intensity of predation, <b>variation</b> in water velocity, or <b>variation</b> in feeding niche. The preponderance of examples of environment-associated morphological <b>variation</b> within fish species has been documented in freshwater systems. It {{is not clear whether}} environment-associated intraspecific morphological <b>variation</b> is less common in marine fishes or whether there has just been a lack of investigation. We used geometric morphometric analysis to quantify shape <b>variation</b> in two species of South African marine fish commonly harvested for human consump-tion, Pterogymnus laniarius (panga), and Argyrosomus inodorus (silver kob). Neither species exhibited significant sexual dimorphism, but both species exhibited significant intraspecific morphological <b>variation.</b> This <b>variation</b> appears consistent with patterns expected from <b>variation</b> along the benthic-pelagic feeding niche continuum...|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that within-population phenotypic <b>variation</b> {{is caused by}} genotypic and environmental heterogeneity. Non-genotypic <b>variation</b> is thought to result from diversity of environmental conditions alone. This however contradicts experimental data showing that even when both genetic and environmental sources of phenotypic <b>variation</b> are neglected, residual <b>variation</b> still exists. This residual phenotypic <b>variation</b> is caused by deviations of developmental trajectories from the target trajectory determined for particular genotype and environment, i. e. by developmental instability. This <b>variation</b> is well-known for morphological traits where it is measured most often by fluctuating asymmetry, i. e. random deviations from perfect symmetry, which can be easily sepa-rated from the other type of phenotypic <b>variation.</b> In morphological characters which do not possess symmetry or in non-morpho-logical characters this <b>variation</b> cannot usually be separated from other type of non-genotypic <b>variation,</b> caused by environmental heterogeneity. Most researchers still believe that all non-genotypic <b>variation,</b> even under standardised experimental conditions, is caused by insufficient standardization of environment, rather than by other sources of phenotypic <b>variation.</b> When special efforts are undertaken to analyse <b>variation</b> caused by developmental instability, this <b>variation</b> contributes substantially to non-genotypic <b>variation.</b> To exemplify how <b>variation</b> caused by developmental instability can be separated from phenotypic plasticity we analysed phenotypic <b>variation</b> of resting egg formation in Daphnia pulicaria.
