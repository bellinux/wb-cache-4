40|$|The {{waterborne}} sector faces nowadays significant challenges due {{to several}} environmental, financial and other concerns. Such challenges may be addressed, among others, by optimising <b>voyage</b> <b>plans,</b> and diagnosing {{as early as}} possible engine failures that may lead to performance degradation. These two issues are addressed by the Decision Support System (DSS) presented herein, which focuses on the operation of merchant ships. For the development of <b>voyage</b> <b>plans,</b> a multicriteria decision problem is developed and handled with the PROMETHE method, while a multivariable control chart is used for the fault diagnosis problem. A MATLAB-based software implementation of the DSS has been developed adopting a modular architecture, while, in order to provide a generic software solution, the required input data are retrieved from dedicated web-services, following specific communication and data exchange protocols...|$|R

40|$|The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} {{very large and}} ships require {{a substantial amount of}} fuel. However, fuel consumption is not the only concern. Time of arrival, safety concerns, distance travelled etc. are also of importance and these objectives might be inherently conflicting. This thesis aims to demonstrate multi-objective optimization and Pareto navigation for application in <b>voyage</b> <b>planning.</b> In order to perform this optimization, models of weather, ocean conditions, ship dynamics and propulsion system are needed. Statistical methods for estimation of resistance experienced in calm and rough sea are used. An earlier developed framework is adopted to perform the optimization and Pareto navigation. The results show that it is a suitable approach in <b>voyage</b> <b>planning.</b> A strength of the interactive Pareto navigation is the overview of the solution space presented to the decision maker and the control of the spread of the objective space. Another benefit is the possibilities of assigning specific values on objectives and setting thresholds in order to narrow down the solution space. The numerical results reinforces the trend of slow steaming to decrease fuel consumption...|$|R

40|$|<b>Voyage</b> <b>planning</b> {{methods have}} {{advanced}} significantly {{in recent years}} {{to take advantage of the}} increasingly available computing power. With the aid of detailed weather predictions it is now possible to decide a route that is optimized with respect to some criterion. With the introduction of so called All Electric Ships; ships with diesel electric propulsion, varying the power production in order to adjust the propulsion has become easier. Incorporating a power management system with the <b>voyage</b> <b>planning</b> software on a ship allows for different techniques to reduce fuel consumption. In this thesis, three different approaches are developed, compared and combined. The first method handles the task of how to optimally share a load demand across a set of generators. The second is performing power production scheduling with respect to engine efficiencies, and finally in the third the potential in energy storage integration with the power management system is investigated. From the results, it is argued that the largest potential lies in the first approach where large fuel savings can be made without any large risk. The second approach shows potential for fuel reduction but this however is found to be heavily dependent on weather predictions and accuracy of the used models. Regarding energy storage it is found that while it is not economically feasible to increase the fuel efficiency, energy storage can be used to handle load transients and fulfil power redundancy requirements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{innovative}} toolkit that Danaos Corporation developed and deployed to optimize ship routing. Operations Research In Ship MAnagement (ORISMA) provides a clear {{answer to the}} conventional dilemma of least-cost voyage versus faster voyage. ORISMA maximizes revenue by using relevant information, including financial data, hydrodynamic models, weather conditions, and marketing forecasts. It considers the financial benefits after ship voyage completion to optimize the fleetwide performance instead of single-vessel performance. Using operations research and expert knowledge, we developed ORISMA to include world-class capabilities in scheduling optimization, intelligent <b>voyage</b> <b>planning,</b> ship bunkering, and chartering.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Skull base surgery (SBS) {{involves}} operative {{tasks in}} close proximity to critical structures in a complex three-dimensional (3 D) anatomy. The aim was to investigate the value of virtual <b>planning</b> (<b>VP)</b> based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for surgical planning in SBS and to compare the effects of virtual planning with 3 D contours between the expert and the surgeon in training. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. METHODS: Twelve patients with manually segmented anatomical structures based on preoperative MRI were evaluated by eight surgeons in a randomized order using a validated National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) questionnaire. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed significant reduction of workload when using VP (P. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative anatomical segmentation with virtual surgical planning using contours in endoscopic SBS significantly reduces the workload for the expert and the surgeon in training.

50|$|The {{appraisal}} stage {{deals with}} the collection of information relevant to the proposed voyage as well as ascertaining risks and assessing the key features of the voyage. This will involve considering the type of navigation required e.g. Ice navigation, the region the ship will be passing through and the hydrographic information on the route.

The third stage is {{the execution of the}} finalised <b>voyage</b> <b>plan,</b> taking into account any special circumstances which may arise such as changes in the weather, which may require the plan to be reviewed or altered. The final stage of passage planning consists of monitoring the vessel's progress in relation to the plan and responding to deviations and unforeseen circumstances.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} on the ice cover of waterways, rivers, lakes, seas and oceans by satellite remote sensing methods began {{at the end of}} the twentieth century.
