5000|$|In practice, the CW has {{a number}} of drawbacks.

And, when supplying an output current, the <b>voltage</b> <b>ripple</b> rapidly increases as the number of stages is increased. For these reasons, CW multipliers with large number of stages are used only where relatively low output current is required. These effects can be partially compensated by increasing the capacitance in the lower stages, by increasing the frequency of the input power and by using an AC power source with a square or triangular waveform. By driving the CW from a high-frequency source, such as an inverter, or a combination of an inverter and HV transformer, the overall physical size and weight of the CW power supply can be substantially reduced.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance.

A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies. Smaller chokes are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency switching transients from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input.

40|$|Abstract: Isolation {{transformers}} and bulky {{electrolytic capacitors}} {{are often used}} in power electronic converters to reduce leakage currents and <b>voltage</b> <b>ripples</b> but this leads to low power density and reduced reliability. In this paper, an auxiliary capacitor {{is added to the}} widely used conventional full-bridge converter to provide a path for, and hence significantly reduce, the leakage current. The operation of the full-bridge converter is split into the operation of a half-bridge converter and a dc-dc converter so that the ripple energy can be diverted from the dc-bus capacitor to the auxiliary capacitor. Hence, the dc-bus capacitor can be significantly reduced while maintaining very low <b>voltage</b> <b>ripples</b> on the dc bus because it is only required to filter out switching ripples. The auxiliary capacitor is designed to allow high <b>voltage</b> <b>ripples</b> because its <b>voltage</b> is not supplied to any load. Accordingly, the auxiliary capacitor can also be very small as well. As a result, the total required capacitance becomes very small. The reduction ratio of the total capacitance is significant, which makes it cost-effective to use film capacitors instead of electrolytic capacitors. The proposed converters can be also operated as an inverter without any restriction on power factor because the adopted four switches are all bidirectional in terms of power flow. Experimental results for both rectification and inversion modes are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed converter in reducing the ripples, the leakage currents, and the total capacitance needed, with comparison to the conventional bridge converter without the auxiliary capacitor...|$|R
