Software to support the Monte Carlo method generates large vectors of pseudo-random numbers and uses these as operands in complex mathematical expressions. When such software is run on standard PC-based hardware, the volume of data involved often exceeds the physical RAM available. To address this problem, vectors must be paged out to disk and paged back in when required. This paging is often the performance bottleneck limiting the execution speed of the software. Because the mathematical expressions are specified in advance of execution, predictive solutions are possible – for instance, by treating the problem similarly to register allocation. The problem of allocating scalar variables to processor registers is a widely studied aspect of compiler implementation. A register allocation algorithm decides which variable is held in which register, when the value in a register can be overwritten, and when a value is stored in, or later retrieved from, main memory. In this paper, register allocation techniques are used to plan the paging of vectors in Monte Carlo software. Two register allocation algorithms are applied to invented vector programs written in a prototype low-level <b>vector</b> <b>language</b> {{and the results are}} compared...|$|E

We compare numerically the performance of these algorithms in Matlab, Octave and Python, with that in FreeFEM++ and in a compiled language such as C. Examples show that, unlike what is commonly believed, the performance is not radically worse than that of C : in the best/worst cases, selected <b>vector</b> <b>languages</b> are respectively 2. 3 / 3. 5 and 2. 9 / 4. 1 times slower than C in the scalar and vector cases.

40|$|A {{well known}} problem when {{reasoning}} about concurrent systems {{is that of}} state explosion. One of the strategies that has been proposed to alleviate this problem is {{to make use of}} the symmetries which a concurrent system may exhibit to construct a symmetry-reduced model that reflects the behaviour of the system. The main contribution of this thesis is an investigation into the theoretical foundations of the method by considering symmetries in the context of category theory. It seems natural to do so since the morphisms that characterise each category may be thought of as a kind of simulation of behaviour. A new category of language systems is presented, together with several subcategories. Morphisms in this category are defined to preserve structure. The notion of a symmetry of a language system is defined and the quotient structure of the language system is given. The important question of behaviour preservation between the system and its symmetry-reduced model is generalised to the notion of morphism in the category. The conditions required on the morphism to ensure that it preserves behaviour are identified. These results are extended to the projection morphism that define the symmetry-reduced model by constructing a split morphism. Two specific behaviours, namely absence of deadlock and extensibility, are considered. The second contribution of this thesis is to establish a categorical relationship between the language system model and elementary nets. A <b>vector</b> <b>language</b> semantics for elementary nets is given. Functors between these categories are defined and the existence of an adjunction is proved...|$|E
40|$|Current {{advances}} in software engineering practice involve {{the adoption of}} a component- based approach in developing large-scale, complex systems. The component-based paradigm provides better structuring of systems and facilitates systematic software reuse. However, complex interactions between components, especially in concurrent and distributed applications, pose greater challenges. This thesis provides a formal framework for managing the dependencies between components, in terms of their interactions in a concurrent setting. In our approach, composites and single components are represented by a component signature, which identifies a component, and a <b>vector</b> <b>language,</b> also called component language, which describes the behaviour of a component. This language-based representation of component behaviour makes it possible to capture concurrency at both the individual component level and the composition level. The interpretation of concurrency is that of a non-interleaving model, with the notion of causal independence lifted to vectors. We describe how component languages are obtained from scenario-based specifications, typically used in an industrial context. Based on the order structure of a component language, we identify implicit or missing interactions which represent potentially faulty or simply unthought scenarios. This excludes pathological behaviour, the source of which {{can be traced back to}} inconsistencies in the sequence diagrams of the scenario specification such as race conditions, and this gives a characterisation of well-behaved components. Components are put together in our approach by matching required and provided interfaces in terms of the respective sequences of events. This builds on the concept of parallel composition in process algebras. We show that the properties that define well-behaved components are preserved under composition in the resulting composite. Well-behaved components give rise to discrete behavioural presentations which can capture concurrency and simultaneity between event occurrences on component interfaces. Well-behaved components are also associated with automata whose transition structure reflects the concurrency in the corresponding component language. This state-based description of component behaviour is graphically represented using state diagrams. This formal framework for components has been related to more conventional approaches to software design, as exemplified by strong connections to UML. It can aid designers in determining the complete set of intended behaviours before generating state models of the scenario-based specifications...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three projects that are driven by a common theme, which {{is the use of}} computational tools in aiding molecular probe and drug design. In the first project, the feasibility of using molecular docking and scoring to estimate binding affinity for small molecules labelled covalently with fluorophores was tested using several proof-of-concept experiments. The high-throughput nature of computational screening applications such as Hierarchical Virtual Ligand Screening (HierVLS) necessitate that, in order to screen these labelled compounds, there must be an automated way to generate the associated structures virtually from large databases of base compounds and fluorophores. A script was developed in MOE software using scientific <b>vector</b> <b>language</b> (SVL) that could identify key reactive functional groups in both reactive fluorophores and target base compounds, and create the appropriate labelled structures for screening. The final fluorescence-labelled database numbers 14, 862 compounds, each tagged with the ATTO 680 fluorophore. In a subsequent project, the fluorescence-tagged library was screened against carbonic anhydrase 9 (CAIX), a protein implicated as a biomarker in several cancer types. This screening was accompanied by the screening of a validation set of known CAIX ligands and appropriately chosen decoys. The best scoring protocol according to our analyses was that which used principal components analysis. Ten of the top scoring candidates are suggested for future testing as probe candidates. CAIX binding sites were compared with equivalent residues in the sequences of 24 other CA isoforms to identify sites that might confer CAIX specificity, and the top scoring ligands were ranked according to this scheme. Lastly, experimental characterization was performed on three previously identified potential ligands for a cancer-related receptor tyrosine kinase, EphB 4. Two in vitro assay formats were used: a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay and an enzyme-coupled spectrophotometric assay. One candidate, DNP-L-Arg, {{was the only one of}} the three with some experimental evidence of affecting kinase activity. The first assays suggested that DNP-L-Arg may have an activating effect on EphB 4. The plausibility of this effect discussed with respect to mechanisms found in the literature, and using predicted and experimental structures for docked ligands. The coupled assay format did not conclusively confirm this effect. The research presented underscores the ability for computational tools to be incorporated into a variety of different areas within the fields of biochemistry and drug design. Future complementary experimental work will be crucial both in evaluating and refining the suggested probe candidates and in further validating and improving the computational techniques used...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{new approach}} to the supervisory control of complex systems modelled as Multi-Agent (MA) products of finite deterministic automata. First, the centralized supervisory control problem for the MA product is considered. This differs from the standard approach to supervisory control since (i) vector languages are under consideration and (ii) each supervisor can disable only one particular component of a vector event. The notion of MA controllability is introduced and is shown to essentially constitute a necessary and sufficient condition for the synthesis of an MA supervisor. In the case when a given <b>vector</b> <b>language</b> K fails to be MA controllable, an algorithm for finding the infimal MA controllable superlanguage of K is presented. It is also shown that there exists, {{with respect to the}} inclusion partial order, a maximal MA controllable sublanguage of K. The results constitute a natural extension of the central classical supervisory control results for scalar systems to the more general MA product system case. Second, the controllability properties of component structures are investigated. It is proved that the property of MA controllability is preserved under iterative MA product construction. Moreover, it is proved that in this case the MA product of supervisors of subsystems ensures the desired behaviour of the MA product of specifications for the iterative MA product. Several examples illustrate that neither standard controllability nor the second property of MA controllability, so-called MAC 2, are preserved under projection operation. However, a sufficient condition for the standard controllability of a component in terms of the original vector specification and the MA product is given. The equality of the vector specification projected on the set of some components of an original MA product and an MA product of the projections on the corresponding components is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for the projected specification having MAC 2 property. Furthermore, a special class of specifications, namely, state trajectory specifications, for both scalar and vector automata is considered and conditions for the embedding of two specifications are presented. Third, the notion of the Graph-Relation MA product is introduced. Through this construction, we modify the connection of supervisors and vector system under consideration, and prove that the property of MA controllably remains the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a solution to the supervisory control problem. Next, an initial investigation on the MA product under partial observation is presented. The notions of MA observability and MA co-observability are formulated and it is shown that they {{play a key role in}} the solution of decentralized supervisory control problems for the MA product. Furthermore, applications to hybrid systems are explored. Finally, a line of further research on centralized and decentralized MA product is mapped out, as well as complexity studies and the generation of MA software...|$|E
