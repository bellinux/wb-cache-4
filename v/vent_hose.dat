50|$|For {{the first}} time, single-point {{refueling}} rigs were allowed. During pit stops, teams were now allowed to utilize a single combined fuel/vent hose assembly. This eliminated {{the need for}} a separate <b>vent</b> <b>hose,</b> improving safety.|$|E
5000|$|Some V-Star {{motorcycles}} come in {{what others}} may know as deepish purple (Raven) with flames. There were 2 editions made of this. The XVS65T-F and the XVS65TC-F (CA edition). CA edition is for California Only and {{is equipped with}} a canister to prevent the discharging of fuel vapor into the atmosphere. There are 3 lines to this canister. One to the fuel tank, one to the carburetor and a <b>vent</b> <b>hose.</b> Both of these models when the VIN is decoded will show up either XVS650 and XVS650A mostly because their parts are identical to these 2 models with very few exceptions if any.|$|E
50|$|The DB1R is a Factory Corsa (race), or Works, bike {{made between}} 1985 and 1986. These bikes have many {{enhancements}} including several parts made of magnesium, different triple-trees (29° vs. 25°, identical trail at 105 mm), high performance engine internals, higher rear-sets, 42 mm carburetors, open 2-into-1 exhaust and no lights {{with the oil}} cooler in {{the nose of the}} fairing. DB1R frames don't have the three fuel cell mounts, the two steering stop mounts or the keyed steering lock (like the DB1/DB1S/DB1SR/DB1SR Serie Finale strada (street) frames. The aluminum fuel cell is made into the bodywork and can be identified by the upper <b>vent</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{vacuum bell}} jar is placed on a base which is <b>vented</b> to a <b>hose</b> fitting, that can be {{connected}} via a hose to a vacuum pump. A vacuum is formed by pumping {{the air out of}} the bell jar.|$|R
