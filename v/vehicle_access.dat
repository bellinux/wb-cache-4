5|$|Richmond Park is {{enclosed}} {{by a high}} wall with several gates. The gates either allow pedestrian and bicycle access only, or allow bicycle, pedestrian and other <b>vehicle</b> <b>access.</b> The gates for motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> are open only during daylight hours, and the speed limit is 20mph. The gates for pedestrians and cyclists are open 24 hours a day apart from during the deer cull in February and November when the park is closed in the evenings. Apart from taxis, no commercial vehicles are allowed unless they {{are being used to}} transact business with residents of the park.|$|E
5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the restroom facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|The 10 man command group {{proceeded}} to drive vehicles to LZ Hotel, purposely disabling them to block <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> from {{any part of}} the city, other than the road from the Embassy to the LZ. The command group then {{proceeded to}} make contact with King Bird, an orbiting HC-130 plane of the 56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, that would control the flow of the helicopters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Now, Internal and {{external}} vehicles are artificially queried and identified by a specially-assigned person {{in most of}} schools and enterprises, so the workload of vehicle management is very heavy, what’s more the vehicles information can not be effectively preserved. So it is not convenient for <b>vehicles</b> <b>access</b> query in the furture. Using RFID intelligent sensor network technology, the intelligent monitoring and identifing of <b>vehicles</b> <b>access</b> was realized and <b>vehicles</b> <b>access</b> was better controlled. The system can provide real-time effective data for enterprises management. Through the unit LAN system, the remote transmission and perservation of the vehicle information and photos were completed, so the network management was realized and the information can be conveniently queried in the future...|$|R

5|$|In January 2014, the Benadir {{administration}} {{launched a}} citywide street naming, house numbering and postal codes project. Officially called the House Numbering and Post Code System, it {{is a joint}} initiative of the municipal authorities and Somali business community representatives. The project {{is part of the}} ongoing modernization and development of the capital. According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up on security and resolve housing ownership disputes. In March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu. The government-public partnership aims to facilitate <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> in the area. According to Karaan district commissioner Ahmed Hassan Yalah'ow, the reconstruction initiative will also make the road all-weather resistant and is slated to be completed shortly.|$|E

50|$|Whereas other GO Transit lines use low-floor <b>vehicles</b> <b>accessed</b> from {{low-level}} platforms, the Union Pearson Express {{is operated}} with high-floor vehicles necessitating high-level platforms. As a result, at Bloor and Weston stations, UP operates {{from its own}} dedicated platforms adjacent to the Kitchener line platforms.|$|R
25|$|There are camping sites at Bonnie Vale, North Era and Uloola Falls. These are {{the only}} places where camping is {{permitted}} within the park, and they are regulated with a booking/registration system, which requires pre-booking a site. The park charges a <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> fee, but is free for people on foot.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Mount Edziza {{was made}} into the Mount Edziza Provincial Park to {{preserve}} the volcanic and culture treasures unique to the northern British Columbia area. It encompasses over 230,000 hectares of the Tahltan Highland. There is no <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> to the park, and {{there are only a}} very few basic facilities.|$|E

The second line connects the mainland to the Korkeasaari Zoo. One line departs from Market Square and the other from Katajanokka.|$|E
25|$|State Highway 82 is {{the only}} major road that {{provides}} access to Aspen. There are some mountain pass roads {{that lead to the}} city, but those require all-terrain vehicles and are typically impassable during the winter. Highway 82 east of Aspen is also impassable due to persistent snow on Independence Pass, leaving Highway 82 west of Aspen as the only means of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> during the winter.|$|E
25|$|The main {{entrance}} to the park is via the Cabrillo Bridge and through the California Quadrangle. That entry is currently a two-lane road providing <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> to the park. A plan to divert vehicle traffic around {{to the south of}} the California Quadrangle, so as to restore it as a pedestrian-only promenade, was dropped after legal challenges, but was reapproved after the legal challenges failed and is scheduled for completion in 2019.|$|E

50|$|The {{park has}} almost two miles of sandy beach, {{which can be}} reached only on foot by {{climbing}} over steep sand dunes. There are many trails for hiking and cross-country skiing, but most are neither posted nor maintained. (Biking on the trails is prohibited.) The trail conditions vary from loose sand to hard packed dirt. There are lots of hills including a large sand dune that was once used for off-road <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Access</b> to the dune by large, four-wheeled vehicles has been blocked with guard rails.|$|R
25|$|A later (>1885?) {{enlargement}} of the tunnel under Fishergate (Moss, 1968) continues in use for <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> to the Fishergate Shopping Centre car park - it formerly accessed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Butler Street goods yard (Biddle, 1989). Part of a support for a bridge over Garden Street remains. A path on {{the northern edge of}} Avenham Park follows the route of the tramway, down the Avenham Incline and across a footbridge over the River Ribble {{on the site of the}} original trestle bridge. The footpath continues along the flood plain embankment to the Penwortham Incline.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, 2003, George Russell Weller {{drove his}} Buick at speeds {{of up to}} 70 miles per hour through the busy {{downtown}} Farmers Market, which was held on a city street that was closed to vehicular traffic by temporary signage at each end. The 86-year-old driver killed 10 that day and injured 63, stopping only due the Buick's engine and transmission being clogged with body parts. The city vigorously fought against accepting its responsibility in causing the death and injuries of market patrons through {{the lack of any}} barricade. In the wake of numerous civil lawsuits filed against the City of Santa Monica and the company organizing the Farmer's Market, a new policy was adopted requiring portable concrete barricades to reliably block <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> for pedestrian street events.|$|E
25|$|The city {{suffers from}} traffic {{problems}} {{largely due to}} this radial street pattern, {{making it difficult for}} Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities. Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on <b>vehicle</b> <b>access</b> to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (Zona a Traffico Limitato (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has {{led to the creation of}} night-time ZTLs in those districts.|$|E

50|$|Since 2009, the Urban {{community}} of Vesoul, then chaired by Alain Chrétien, Prime Deputy Vesoul, has undertaken important work {{in order to}} give a new face to the area of the lake, resulting in lifting improving the overall functioning spaces (path pedestrians, cyclists, traffic <b>vehicles,</b> <b>access</b> to the restaurant and camping) while preserving the natural beauty of the site, but also brought a lot of new things: pedestrian square, playground for children, terrace restaurant, expansion of parking, camping enhancement. Lake Vaivre now offers a perfect place to relax and rejuvenate.|$|R
