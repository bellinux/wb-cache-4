With some trouble I saw Mr. Cole, who, suffering from fever, was declared to be “not at home.” His dragoman did by no means admire my looks; in fact, the general voice of the household was against me. After some fruitless messages, I sent up a scrawl to Mr. Cole, who decided upon admitting the importunate Afghan. An exclamation of astonishment and a hospitable welcome followed my self-introduction as an officer of the Indian army. Amongst other things, the Vice-Consul informed me that, in divers discussions with the Turks about the possibility of an Englishman finding his way en cachette to Meccah, ...|$|E

Bedford's Little Italy feel is enhanced by a wide variety of Italian bars, restaurants and social clubs throughout the town, as well as a large number of delis and grocery shops selling Italian and continental produce - and by the large Italian mission church run by the Scalabrini Fathers order.

50|$|She {{was born}} in 1867 in Almeria to a middle-class family, in which her father owned a gold mine. Her father José de Burgos Cañizares and her uncle Ferdinand {{were in charge of}} the <b>vice-consulate</b> of Portugal in Almeria. Her mother, Nicosia Segui Nieto, had come to the {{marriage}} with a substantial inheritance. She escaped her family when she met Arturo Asterz Bustos. He was fifteen years older than her; he was a poet, writer, and an alcoholic. Her new husband earned money as a typesetter on the family's newspaper, but she quickly discovered that this was to be her work. She and Arturo were unhappily married for 17 years, having four children - of whom only one survived. In 1898 her infant son died and she enrolled at the local college to obtain a teaching certificate. She quickly advanced, and within a year she was qualified to teach primary. By the end of 1898, she was qualified to teach secondary school and by 1900 she was qualified to teach teachers. Armed with her new achievements, she could anticipate employment for life. She and her remaining daughter left her abusive and unfaithful husband and they set up their own house in Guadalajara where her first book was written. During this time she had learnt how to write for a living, she had earned her independence and she had developed a contempt for the institution of marriage. Burgos regarded herself as a feminist but her gender meant that her writings were not included when evaluations were made of Spanish (male) modernism.|$|E
40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study is}} based on the author’s PhD thesis. It aims at rescuing from the Sands of Time the spirit of the destination under analysis, basing itself on the data collected from 1930 s newspapers, besides contemporary approaches to that decade in the fields of Political History, War, Tourism, and Leisure. In 1910 the Figueiredos were led to Estoris due to the microclimate, and by 1914 the entrepreneur invested on a local project meant to erect Portugal’s 1 st international resort built from scratch. The plan was accomplished even after the Republican regime made way for the military and civilian dictatorships, for as Hall defends authoritarian regimes do not repel tourists. Estoril was then propelled by the Gambling Law and, as Gibbons wrote in 1936, it soon attracted the mighty and the fallen, mainly of British and Spanish origins. This recollection begins with a summary of the delicate Iberian context between 1910 and 1939, and then refers the Sunny Coast as the unofficial stage of the Spanish Civil War, for since 1931 characters like General Sanjurjo settled as refugees. These visitors were pampered thanks to a <b>Vice-Consulate</b> (Cascais), a hotel managed by Galician partners (Monte Estoril), a multitude of leisure delights (Estoril), and Parede’s Radio Club. The Sunny Coast’s support to Franco soon led to rumours that drove tourists away, hence the reference to the strategies applied to overcome them. One shall finish by mentioning the current reality of equipments and the weak historic memory, whose proper recovery might allow to create a new cultural offer linked to the contemporary ‘Cascais’ destination for this neighbouring niche market...|$|E
