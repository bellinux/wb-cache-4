5000|$|The Brickfielder {{is a hot}} and dry wind in {{the desert}} of Southern Australia that occurs in the summer season. It blows in the coastal regions of the south from the outback, where the sandy wastes, bare of {{vegetation}} in summer, are intensely heated by the sun. This hot wind blows strongly, often for several days at a time, defying all attempts to keep the dust down, and parching all vegetation. It is in one sense a healthy wind, as, being exceedingly dry and hot, it destroys many injurious germs. The northern brickfielder is almost invariably followed by a strong [...] "southerly buster," [...] cloudy and cool from the ocean. The two winds are due to the same cause, viz. a cyclonic system over the Australian Bight. These systems frequently extend inland as a narrow <b>V-shaped</b> <b>depression</b> (the apex northward), bringing the winds from the north on their eastern sides and from the south on their western. Hence as the narrow system passes eastward the wind suddenly changes from north to south, and the thermometer {{has been known to}} fall 15 F in twenty minutes.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause <b>V-shaped</b> <b>depressions</b> on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|R

This study aims to assess the influence of an abandoned delta lobe on present-day coastal dynamics in a micro-tidal environment. Detailed mapping of the relict Sol de Riu lobe also showed a set of bedforms interpreted as footprints of human activities: seasonal <b>V-shaped</b> <b>depressions</b> on the middle shoreface due to boat anchoring and old trawling marks between 16 and 18 m water depth. Estimations of the mobility of bottom sediment showed that the shallowest shoreface (i. e. less than 7 m depth) is the most dynamic part of the relict lobe, while the middle shoreface experienced significant morphological changes since the lobe was abandoned. The deepest shoreface (i. e. water depth in excess of 15 m), which corresponds {{to the front of}} the lobe, is defined by a very small potential for morphological change. Simulations showed that while the relict lobe does not significantly affect the typical short period waves (T p ˜ 4 s) in the study area, it does interfere with the most energetic wave conditions (T p = 7 s) acting as a shoal leading to the concentration of wave energy along the shoreline northwest of the lobe. The consequence of such modification of the high-energy wave propagation pattern by the relict lobe is an alteration of the wave-induced littoral sediment dynamics with respect to a situation without the lobe...|$|R
40|$|The {{lowermost}} 100 – 300 km of the Earth's mantle commonly {{regarded as}} the thermal boundary layer (TBL) of mantle circulation is characterized by its complex physical properties. Beneath the Caribbean this so-called D″ layer features relatively high velocities and abrupt impedance increase at the top (designated as the D″ discontinuity). These seismic characteristics {{have been attributed to}} the accumulation of ancient subducted slab material and the phase transition in the major lower mantle mineral of pervoskite. Geodynamic models predict that the blanketing cold slabs may trap enough heat from core to be buoyantly destabilized, and eventually broken apart and entrained {{into the bottom of the}} convection cell. Here we explore the D″ structure with unprecedented resolution through modeling traveltimes, amplitudes, and waveform shapes from the USArray. We find an east-to-west asymmetrical undulation of the D″ discontinuity with a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>depression</b> of ∼ 70 – 160 km over a lateral distance of 600 km beneath northern South America. The shear velocity perturbations vary in the same trend showing the most pronounced reduction of ∼ 3 – 4 % below the thinnest D″ layer in close proximity to an intermittently undetected discontinuity. The strong correlation between the D″ topography and velocity variations indicates the phase transition boundary has been perturbed or even disrupted by the large lateral temperature gradient of slab material which has been reheated from the core over extended periods of time...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{cases of}} {{pipeline}} failures are documented every year, triggering new problems {{for research and}} the need for re-examination of already established design guidelines and standards. The problem of soil/pipeline interaction has been thoroughly researched over the years; however, further investigation is required in some areas. This thesis presents an investigation. using numerical modeling to simulate the installation of a steel pipeline in overconsolidated clay. Some factors related to the site geometry (sloping ground) and construction methods (fill compaction), as well as the stiffness of the pipeline section, are also investigated. This study shows that the reaction of the soil mass to the trench excavation continued for as long as four years after backfilling. In addition, the following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this thesis: (1) When the pipeline is installed in a trench, {{at the base of a}} <b>v-shaped</b> <b>depression,</b> a higher total stress acts at the base and crown of the pipeline with level ground and smaller ground slopes causing more deformation in the pipeline section than with steep ground slopes. (2) A static, surcharge-type compaction for a reasonable duration is found to reduce damaging stresses at the base and crown of the pipeline, during and after surcharge loading. (3) A less rigid pipeline section would carry less of the weight of overlying fill material and will cause more of the load to be carried by the fill material on either side of the pipeline. This results in higher lateral pressure (in the pipeline section and slower dissipation of pore water pressure around the pipeline...|$|E

A light-tight box 20. 5 cm. wide x 22. 5 cm. long x 20. 5 cm. high was constructed with one of the sides 20. 5 cm. x 20. 5 cm. detachable. Through the length of the box a spindle was in-serted, which projected through a bearing at one end so as to carry a variable pulley on the outside. The other bearing for the spindle was carried on the detachable side. The dimensions were so arranged that a Palmer’s drum could be put on the spindle so as just to clear the top of the box and the detachable side be then fixed in place.

Volcanic edifices on the Oki-Daito Ridge and the Minami-Daito Basin to the north have geochemical characteristics similar to ocean island basalt (OIB) and have an estimated age of 44 to 48 Ma (Ishizuka et al. 2013). By contrast, alkali basalt dredged at the southeastern bathymetric high on the Oki-Daito Ridge has an age of 65 Ma and formed through undetermined volcanic activity (Okino and Kato 1992). As a result, these data indicate that volcanic activity has occurred on at least two separate occasions in this region.|$|R
40|$|Bone retouchers are {{the most}} ancient osseous tools of the European Palaeolithic. They are very {{frequent}} on Mousterian sites and persist throughout the Upper Palaeolithic. Several functional analyses have been devoted to them and the most commonly accepted hypothesis proposed is their use for lithic tool retouching by percussion. However, this hypothesis is based mainly on studies of Mousterian pieces while few functional analyses have been undertaken on Upper Palaeolithic bone retouchers. The persistent presence of these “ ad hoc” tools makes their study important. This article {{presents the results of}} a techno-functional analysis devoted to the Early Aurignacian bone retouchers from Abri Castanet at Sergeac (Dordogne), northern and southern sectors (layer A and US 131 and below), Grotte des Hyènes at Brassempouy (Landes, complex 2) and Gatzarria at Suhare (Pyrénées-Atlantiques, layer cbcf). These unworked bone tools, including many specimens identified a posteriori among faunal remains, represent {{a significant part of the}} studied assemblages’ osseous equipment. There are two categories of retouchers : those on raw bone fragments and those on technical objects. The former, most numerous, are mainly long bone shaft fragments recovered after food operations and used just as they were, without modification. The latter correspond to the use of finished objects like smoothers and awls as well as manufacturing by-products. They bear diagnostic traces of utilisation in the form of linear, deep, short <b>depressions,</b> <b>v-shaped</b> in cross section. These depressions are similar to those that have been described in previous work involving microscopic observation and are compatible with use for lithic tool retouching by percussion. However, unlike Middle Palaeolithic retouchers, where the depressions are perpendicular to the main axis of the piece, Early Aurignacian depressions are often vertical (in combination or not with horizontal ones). This is a characteristic feature of Upper Palaeolithic retouchers related to their positions during use. The vertical depressions imply that the main axis of the retoucher is oriented parallel to the lithic edge during use. Quite obviously, this change in the functioning of retouchers must be linked to changes in flint-knapping processes. To understand this relationship, we explored the effects of changing the orientation of retouchers. One notable difference is their curvature in the transverse and longitudinal axes. The latter is clearly more pronounced than the former, meaning that the retouchers offer a greater overall surface area when used in a parallel orientation. We hypothesized that this orientation was preferred to increase the active surface of retouchers for the retouching of blade products. Indeed, during the Early Aurignacian, the manufacture of blade tools, scrapers in particular, often involved retouching very convex and narrow ends. Orienting the retoucher parallel to the lithic edge would have been a technical solution to compensate for the decrease in the active surface presented by the strong convexity of blade ends. However, within the Early Aurignacian lithic industry, blade ends are not the only items to show strong convexity : the fronts of carinated and nosed scrapers also display them. The use of retouchers in bladelet knapping has not so far been considered, but constitutes a second hypothesis that could explain the particular orientation of Early Aurignacian retouchers during use. T hese two assumptions have been tested by experimental replication. Results show that bone retouchers are effective tools for both blade retouching and bladelet knapping, provided that the weight of the retoucher is adjusted to suit the type of lithic product. In addition, lithic and bone tools produced experimentally fall within the range of variation observed in the archaeological assemblages studied. Finally, although this has not always been necessary, experimentation confirms the usefulness of parallel retoucher orientation to adapt the active surface areas to strong lithic convexity. To date, strong convexity of lithic products is the main factor likely to explain the change in retoucher orientation that occurred at least as early as the Early Aurignacian. Thus, retouchers of this period attest to the duration of an ancient technical process, involving the use of bone for stone knapping. Specimens bearing vertical depressions thus illustrate the adaptation of the retouchers to “ new” lithic technologies. The important role played by retouchers in retouching Mousterian tools and their number within the assemblages studied leave little doubt as to their use in retouching Upper Palaeolithic blade products. However, it is still difficult to determine whether they were in fact used in bladelet knapping. The traces of utilisation on experimental retouchers are quite similar to those on specimens used in blade retouching. An expanded experimental program and analysis of the bone tools with high magnification should facilitate the assessment of morphometric changes in use-wear traces based on activity. In addition, a comparison of technical and functional characteristics of archaeological and experimental lithic products should help clarify the array of hammers used during the Aurignacian. Les retouchoirs en os représentent le plus ancien outillage en matières dures animales du Paléolithique européen. Ils se rencontrent très fréquemment au sein des ensembles moustériens et perdurent tout au long du Paléolithique supérieur. Plusieurs études fonctionnelles leur ont été consacrées et l’hypothèse la plus communément admise est celle de leur emploi dans la retouche de tranchants lithiques. Cette hypothèse repose toutefois principalement sur l’étude de pièces moustériennes alors que les exemplaires du Paléolithique supérieur, en particulier ceux de l’Aurignacien ancien, présentent des caractéristiques légèrement différentes. À partir de l’étude de plusieurs séries de l’Aurignacien ancien (l’abri Castanet en Dordogne, la grotte des Hyènes dans les Landes et la grotte Gatzarria dans les Pyrénées-Atlantiques) et d’une reconstitution expérimentale, nous montrons que les retouchoirs de cette période témoignent d’une évolution de leur mode de fonctionnement, liée aux changements opérés dans le domaine lithique. Nous envisageons également la possibilité de leur emploi dans le débitage lamellaire. Tartar Elise. Réflexion autour de la fonction des retouchoirs en os de l’Aurignacien ancien.
