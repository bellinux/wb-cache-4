40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to efficiently execute learning (model training) of modern machine learning (ML) applications. The recent explosion in data has led to the emergence of data-intensive ML applications whose key phase is learning that requires significant amounts of computation. A unique characteristic of learning is that it is iterative- convergent, where a consistent view of memory does not always need to be guaranteed such that parallel workers are allowed to compute using stale values in intermediate computations to relax certain read-after-write data dependencies. While multiple workers read-and- modify shared model parameters multiple times during learning, incurring multiple data communication between workers, most of the data communication is redundant, due to the stale value tolerant characteristic. Relaxing coherence for these learning applications has the potential to provide extraordinary performance and energy benefits but requires innovations across the system stack from hardware and software. While considerable effort has utilized the stale <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> on distributed learning, still inefficient utilization of the full performance potential of this characteristic has caused modern ML applications to have low execution efficiency on the state-of-the-art systems. The inefficiency mainly comes from the lack of architectural considerations and detailed understanding of the different stale <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> of different ML applications. Today’s architecture, designed to cater to the needs of more traditional workloads, incurs high and often unnecessary overhead. The lack of detailed understanding has led to ambiguity for the stale <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> thus failing to take the full performance potential of this characteristic. This dissertation presents several innovations regarding this challenge. First, this dissertation proposes Bounded Staled Sync (BSSync), hardware support for the bounded staleness consistency model, which accompanies simple logic layers in the memory hierarchy, for reducing atomic operation overhead on data synchronization intensive workloads. The long latency and serialization caused by atomic operations {{have a significant impact on}} performance. The proposed technique overlaps the long latency atomic operation with the main computation. Compared to previous work that allows stale values for read operations, BSSync utilizes staleness for write operations, allowing stale- writes. It reduces the inefficiency coming from the data movement between where they are stored and where they are processed. Second, this dissertation presents StaleLearn, a learning acceleration mechanism to reduce the memory divergence overhead of GPU learning with sparse data. Sparse data induces divergent memory accesses with low locality, thereby consuming a large fraction of total execution time on transferring data across the memory hierarchy. StaleLearn trans- forms the problem of divergent memory accesses into the synchronization problem by replicating the model, and reduces the synchronization overhead by asynchronous synchronization on Processor-in-Memory (PIM). The stale <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> makes possible to clearly decompose tasks between the GPU and PIM, which can effectively exploit parallelism be- tween PIM and GPU cores by overlapping PIM operations with the main computation on GPU cores. Finally, this dissertation provides a detailed understanding of the different stale <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> of different ML applications. While relaxing coherence can reduce the data communication overhead, its complicated impact on the progress of learning has not been well studied thus leading to ambiguity for domain experts and modern systems. We define the stale <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> of ML training with the effective learning rate. The effective learning rate can be defined by the implicit momentum hyperparameter, the update density, the activation function selection, RNN cell types, and learning rate adaptation. Findings of this work will open further exploration of asynchronous learning including improving the findings laid out in this dissertation. Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{the concept}} of {{tolerance}} has increased in recent years. One of the reasons is due to the refugee flows that characterize the society and therefore constitute ground for diversity. National governing documents as well as international conventions denotes tolerance as a positive value that should be implemented in school. In order to meet differences and be able to cooperate with them, tolerance is needed. But the word also includes a repressive meaning and can in fact be perceived as contradictory. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to examine teachers' conceptions regarding tolerance as a democratic value. The material for this survey consists of scientific articles and a doctoral dissertation which sets ground as previous research. A qualitative method has been carried out in the survey through semi structured interviews with teachers.

This study was designed to assess the diagnostic <b>value,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and procedural time of a single-stage isoproterenol tilt table protocol. METHODSA single-stage isoproterenol tilt table test was compared with the passive tilt table test. The study was prospectively designed in a randomized and crossover fashion. RESULTSThe study population consisted of 111 patients with a history of syncope (mean age 55 ± 20 years). Of the total, 62 patients (56 %; 95 % confidence interval, 46 % to 65 %) had a positive vasovagal response during isoproterenol tilt table testing and 35 (32 %; 23 % to 41 %) during passive tilt table testing (p = 0. 002). The mean procedural times of the study population were 11. 7 ± 3. 6 min and 36. 9 ± 13. 3 min for isoproterenol and passive tilt table testing, respectively (p < 0. 001). All patients tolerated single-stage isoproterenol testing. In the 23 control subjects (mean age 34 ± 11 years), the apparent specificities were 91 % (72 % to 99 %) and 83 % (61 % to 99 %) for passive and single-stage tilt table testing, respectively. CONCLUSIONSThe single-stage isoproterenol tilt table test was more effective in inducing a positive vasovagal response in an adult population than the standard passive tilt table test, and it significantly reduced the procedural time. The increase in positive yield was associated with a moderate decrease in apparent specificity. These observations support the conclusion that single-stage tilt table testing could be a reasonable diagnostic option in patients undergoing syncope evaluation...|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} presents {{a series of}} papers which {{have been designed to}} test the TMT contention that mortality concerns precipitate intergroup bias and prejudice. In addition the research also examined whether terrorism salience produces similar effects. The paper presented in Chapter 2 (Study 1) first illustrated that terrorism salience manipulations. constructed' from media coverage of the events of September 11 th 2001 induced mortality salience. Furthennore this paper (Study' 2) demons~tes that mortality salience, but not terrorism salience, precipitated less favourable attitudes towards a racially proud Black outgroup member. However neither mort~lity salience nor terrorism salience was found to influence ratings of a racially proud Arabic out-group member or a racially proud White ingroup member. It is proposed that the null fmdings with regard to the Arabic author might be attributable to the fact that. exposure to this target evoked mortality salience, and empirical evidence in support of this view is presented (Study 3). The paper presented in Chapter' 3 explores whether mortality salience and / or terrorism salience influence contemporary measures of prejudiced attitudes. Study 1 found no evidence that mortality salience or terrorism salience impact upon prejudiced attitudes towards 'foreigners' as measured by th,e subtle and blatant prejudice scales (pettigrew & Meertens, 1995). Study 2 however, revealed that mortality salience lead those participants who <b>value</b> <b>tolerance</b> to express'more favo. urable attitudes towards 'asylum seekers' as measured by the mod~m racism scale (McConahay, 1986). No such effects were found for terrorism salience and it is proposed that this may be attributable to the terrorism sali~nce manipulation used. The paper presented in Chapter 4 therefore used media based coverage of the July 7 tD. 2005 London bombings to manipulate terrorism salience. Accordingly, Study 1 illustrated that exposure to this manipulation served to induce mortality salience. Study 2 employed an, implicit measure of attitude and demonstrated that terrorism salience led to less positive attitudes towards Arabic out-group members. This effect however was onlYfound among participants who did not place a high value on tolerance and no such effects were found in conditions of mortality salience. The limitations of these fmdings, and the implications of them for TMT, terrorism salience and intergroup relations are discussed in the final chapter.
