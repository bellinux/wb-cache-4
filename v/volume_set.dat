40|$|An explicit, {{detailed}} {{evaluation of}} the classical continuum limit of the axial anomaly/index density of the overlap Dirac operator is {{carried out in the}} infinite <b>volume</b> <b>setting,</b> and in a certain finite <b>volume</b> <b>setting</b> where the continuum limit involves an infinite volume limit.

An analogous result for the fermionic topological charge, given by the index of the overlap Dirac operator, is then established for a class of topologically non-trivial fields in the aforementioned finite <b>volume</b> <b>setting.</b> Problematic issues concerning the index in the infinite <b>volume</b> <b>setting</b> are also discussed.

5|$|Once the {{recording}} sessions {{got off the}} ground, Priestess encountered another problem – {{this time with the}} law. The band were working in a house in a neighborhood, and the close proximity to other houses meant that they had to keep the amount of noise generated to a minimum. They had been assured that the house had not previously been served with noise violations of any kind, but after they had finished recording drums and many of the guitar parts, they learned that they had the <b>volume</b> <b>set</b> too high when working on the bass guitar tracks; law enforcement came to the door and forced them to take their work elsewhere because they were shaking neighboring houses with the noise they were generating. The band did so with no objection, quickly moving their equipment to another studio, although they recalled the incident rather humorously later. Schiffman was able to arrange for the group to use another facility as early as the following day, and the band moved production to that new location the night of the incident. The sessions were completed in November 2008.|$|E

Given a <b>volume</b> data <b>set</b> defined over a regular three-dimensional grid, a polymerized <b>volume</b> data <b>set</b> (PVDS) {{can be defined as}} follows: edges between adjacent vertices of the grid are labeled 1 (active) or 0 (inactive) to indicate the likelihood that an edge is contained in (or spans the boundary of) a common underlying object, adding information not in the original <b>volume</b> data <b>set.</b> This edge labeling ??polymerizes?? adjacent voxels (those sharing a common active edge) into connected components, facilitating segmentation of embedded objects in the <b>volume</b> data <b>set.</b> Polymerization of the <b>volume</b> data <b>set</b> also aids real-time data compression, geometric modeling of the embedded objects, and their visualization. To construct a polymerized <b>volume</b> data <b>set,</b> an adjacency class within the grid system is selected. Edges belonging to this adjacency class are labeled as interior, exterior, or boundary edges using discriminant functions whose functional forms are derived for three local adjacency classes. The discriminant function parameter values are determined by supervised learning. Training sets are derived from an initial segmentation on a homogeneous sample of the <b>volume</b> data <b>set,</b> using an existing segmentation method. The strategy of constructing polymerized <b>volume</b> data <b>sets</b> is initially tested on synthetic data sets which resemble neuronal volume data obtained by three-dimensional microscopy. The strategy is then illustrated on <b>volume</b> data <b>sets</b> of mouse brain microstructure at a neuronal level of detail. Visualization and validation of the resulting PVDS is shown in both cases. Finally the procedures of polymerized <b>volume</b> data <b>set</b> construction are generalized to apply to any Bravais lattice over the regular 3 D orthogonal grid. Further development of this latter topic is left to future work...|$|R
