40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} price signaling in a model of vertical relationship between a manufacturer and a retailer who share the same information about quality, unlike consumers who do not observe it a priori. We show that delegating the price setting task to a retailer and controlling it through a vertical contract (two-part tari¤) helps drastically {{reduce the number of}} price signaling equilibria available to the retailer. The outcome of a unique price charged to consumers obtains without invoking the consumer sophistication usually required by selection criterions. The vertical contract turns to be the most e¢ cient way for the <b>vertical</b> <b>chain</b> to <b>tie</b> its hands on a unique ?nal price. This price may disclose or not information to consumers depending on their initial optimism about quality. We prove that there also exists circumstances where consumers prefer ex ante not to learn the true quality through price...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we present a {{numerical}} method for simulating the sedimentation of circular particles in two-dimensional channel filled with a viscoelastic fluid of FENE-CR type, which is generalized from a domain/distributed Lagrange multiplier method with a factorization approach for Oldroyd-B fluids developed in [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 156 (2009) 95]. Numerical {{results suggest that the}} polymer extension limit L for the FENE-CR fluid has no effect on the final formation of <b>vertical</b> <b>chain</b> for the cases of two disks and three disks in two-dimensional narrow channel, at least for the values of L considered in this article; but the intermediate dynamics of particle interaction before having a <b>vertical</b> <b>chain</b> can be different for the smaller values of L when increasing the relaxation time. For the cases of six particles sedimenting in FENE-CR type viscoelastic fluid, the formation of chain of 4 to 6 disks does depend on the polymer extension limit L. For the smaller values of L, FENE-CR type viscoelastic fluid can not bring them together like the case of these particles settling in a <b>vertical</b> <b>chain</b> formation in Oldroyd-B fluid; but two separated chains of three disks are formed. Similar results for the case of ten disks are also obtained. The numerical results of several more particle cases suggest that for smaller values of L, the length of the <b>vertical</b> <b>chain</b> is shorter and the size of cluster is smaller.

We focus on the fair trade concept in the coffee supply chain as an example. We analyze a three level <b>vertical</b> <b>chain</b> gathering perfectly competitive farmers upstream who offer their raw product to manufacturers who then sell finished products to a downstream retailer. Without fair trade, all the raw product is sold on the spot market. When a sub-group of farmers benefit from a guaranteed minimum price contract offered by a fair trade certifier, we show that farmers outside of this fair trade agreement may also benefit from a higher spot market price in cases of a limited overproduction.
