25|$|The {{match was}} {{broadcast}} {{live in the}} United Kingdom by both ITV and BT Sport. ITV provided the free-to-air coverage and BT Sport 1 was the pay-TV alternative.

25|$|Granada {{was in a}} poor {{financial}} {{state and}} closed the Granada Studios Tour in 2001, citing decreasing visitor figures. The real reason was the decision to increase production of episodes for Coronation Street to five per week. Without access to that set, {{the highlight of the}} tour, the Granada Studios Tour venture was no longer viable. The company also closed Granada Film. The emergence of digital television cut ITV's <b>viewing</b> <b>share,</b> decreasing advertising revenue, which was already suffering from competition with the internet. The failure of ITV Digital cost Granada and Carlton losses estimated at over £1 billion reducing the company's value from 2001 to 2003.|$|E
25|$|The Broadcasting Act of 1990 instigated the 1991 {{franchise}} auction round, {{in which}} companies had {{to bid for}} the regions. Mersey Television, a company producing the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside, bid £35m compared to Granada's £9m but Granada won as Mersey's package {{did not meet the}} 'quality threshold' applied by the Independent Television Commission. This requirement disadvantaged companies with no previous franchise experience. Granada owned popular television series such as Coronation Street, which it threatened to sell to satellite TV if the franchise was lost. The government responded by relaxing the regulatory regime, so that ITV contractors could take over other companies, and Granada bought several companies. Some at the company considered ITV could survive only as a single merged entity to have sufficient resources to produce big-budget programmes, a concern that increased when BSkyB began to take ITV's <b>viewing</b> <b>share,</b> leading to less advertising revenue, the source of ITV's income.|$|E

The cup final ratings, a record low, were defended by the FA spokesman Paul Newman: [...] "We are very pleased because the final peaked at 7.4m which is pretty good for a hot Saturday {{in the middle of a}} bank holiday weekend." [...] A list compiled by the London Evening Standard showed the 2002 final came bottom in the season's top 10 viewed football matches.|$|E
