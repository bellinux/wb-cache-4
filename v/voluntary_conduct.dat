The science of morals, or the <b>voluntary</b> <b>conduct</b> of men in relation to themselves or others, dates from this epoch. How inexpressibly bolder and more pure were the doctrines of those great men, in comparison with the timid maxims which prevail in the writings of the most esteemed modern moralists!

40|$|The central aim of {{this article}} is to set out and justify the {{contention}} that automatism is never a defence, not even exceptionally. Where D is not at fault for her lack of voluntariness, the term ‘automatism’ is simply a shorthand explanation that D does not satisfy an essential element of every offence: <b>voluntary</b> <b>conduct.</b> Where D is at fault for her lack of voluntariness, the automatism rules (within the current law) become an inculpatory tool through which to substitute the missing offence elements and construct liability. Having recognised that automatism plays an inculpatory role within the law, we analyse this role and conclude that it is defective: prior fault automatism lacks the equivalent blameworthiness necessary to fairly substitute for even missing basic intent offence elements. It is from here that we discuss the possibility of a new automatism offence, to recognise the criminal blameworthiness of D’s conduct in certain cases, but to do so in a coherent manner that appropriately criminalises and labels the defendant. Looking at the outline of the potential new offence we are in a much better position to evaluate the future role of automatism in the criminal law. If we do not believe that such an offence is deserving of criminalisation, then the current law must be changed to prevent prior fault automatism constructing liability under any circumstances. If we do believe that such an offence has a place within the criminal law, then the current law should be changed to reflect this more clearly, and we must focus on exactly how it should be defined...|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{research}} on service innovation rapidly increased {{since the start of}} the third millennium, likely due to the continuous diversification of manufacturing companies into the service sector and the decline of manufacturing in the traditional industrial western countries compared to the World’s emerging economies. Service innovation, furthermore, has received significant attention from academics and practitioners alike and has been increasingly perceived as a means of creating competitive advantage. Arguably, this is due to the growing competition between service companies to reach unconventional levels which led to higher customer expectations of continuous improvement of services. This study investigated the nature and impact of service employees’ innovative behaviour leading to initiating innovation within the sub-sector of personal-interactive services, where the hotel sector was investigated respectively. In doing so, the study also critically reviewed the established literature relevant to service innovation and added further insight to previous research underpinning service employees’ role in initiating innovation. A qualitative case-study research strategy, which compared between three cases, was applied to achieve the objectives of the study. The application of qualitative case-study research allowed closer assessment and observation while the researcher was directly present within the service delivery environment. The combining of qualitative research methods, such as semi-structured interviews, focus groups and direct observation, was applied to congregate evidence of employees’ innovative behaviour patterns from multiple perspectives. The expected limitations of the applied research methods are classically associated with qualitative case-study research such as access barriers, high volume of data outcome and also the complications associated with data collection and analysis. The research findings contributed to the general body of knowledge by highlighting the nature and impact of service employees’ innovative behaviour. A novel classification of six innovative behaviour patterns was established under the three main categories of mandatory, quasi-mandatory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>conduct.</b> The research findings further revealed the significant impact of service employees’ innovative behaviour in initiating innovation, where 49 out of 70 innovative ideas were realised as innovations through employees’ innovative behaviour.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Public Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. BATTERED WOMAN SYNDROME AND CRIMINAL LIABILITY. The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} abuse {{on a woman}} has been labelled as "learned helplessness". The theory of learned helplessness presupposes that {{a woman who is}} continuously abused by her partner will eventually accept her abuse as unavoidable and will develop a feeling of helplessness. Therefore the theory of learned helplessness gives an explanation for the psychological helplessness that battered women experience. Later the concept of learned helplessness was developed into the battered woman syndrome. The term "battered woman syndrome" refers to the physical and psychological characteristics found in the victims of prolonged abuse between intimate partners. The theory of "learned helplessness" supports the cycle of violence theory by giving an explanation for the failure of battered women to leave their abusers and to act in order to better their situation. However, when a battered woman acts and kills her abuser, the question that arises is whether her abuse can influence the general requirements of unlawfulness, conduct and fault. By successfully relying on private defence, the unlawfulness of a battered woman's conduct can be excluded. The imminence-requirement in the case of private defence can complicate a battered woman's reliance on the defence. An expansion of the imminence-requirement to accommodate murderous battered women carries the risk that battered women may misuse private defence. Battered women's reliance on private defence should therefore be restricted to cases where their abusers' attack is imminent. A battered woman can only be criminally liable for her <b>voluntary</b> <b>conduct.</b> Involuntary conduct (automatism) excludes criminal liability and is also connected to incapacity. A battered woman can rely on non-pathological incapacity as a defence. In order to be successful she will have to lead evidence which indicates that she temporarily acted involuntary {{at the time of her}} abuser's killing. A battered woman's years of abuse, her helplessness and her emotional and psychological run down state of mind can also be taken into account in finding that her capacity during the killing of her abuser was diminished and that she deserves a more lenient sentence. Capacity is a prerequisite for fault. A battered woman who does not have criminal capacity will not possess any fault and will therefore not be criminally liable for the killing of her abuser. Recently some criminal law developments took place in Australia, England and Wales. These developments specifically address the situation in which battered women find themselves. The question, therefore, is whether South Africa can learn something from these developments. It appears as if South Africa will not be able to learn something from the developments in Australia. In the case of private defence, the imminence requirement was expanded in Victoria and Western Australia to accommodate battered women. It has, however, already been shown that such an expansion can lead to a misuse of private defence by battered women in South Africa. South Africa will also not be able to learn much from the reform of provocation in the Northern-Territory. The reason for this is that the South African position with regard to the defence of provocation is more advantageous than the reform of the defence in the Northern-Territory. In South Africa diminished responsibility is only taken into account for purposes of sentencing. The South African criminal law can therefore be benefited by the creation of a defence of diminished responsibility in a similar manner than the reform of diminished responsibility in England and Wales. Diminished responsibility will then constitute a complete defence which can lead to a complete acquittal for battered women who kill their abusers. To determine whether a separate defence can be created for battered women in South Africa, an investigation into suggested defences in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was launched. Arguments for the creation of a separate defence are, however, overshadowed by the arguments against the creation of such a defence. Therefore, the creation of a separate defence for battered women is not recommended for the South African law. By accepting the battered woman syndrome as a separate defence, the South African law also runs the risk of being impaired, rather than helped. It is therefore advisable for South African courts to rather carry on treating murderous battered woman in accordance with existing, recognized grounds of justification. Master...|$|E
40|$|No presente trabalho, de natureza conceitual e didático-experimental, encontra-se uma pesquisa que procura compreender quais são as contingências, situações ou momentos que constituem a base formativa para a emergência do sujeito. O marco inicial para o referido estudo são as teses dos autores da reconhecida Escola de Vigotski, e outros que estejam afinados com as concepções marxistas. Para isso, a partir de uma revisão de literatura, foi realizado um epítome teórico daquilo que se considera uma definição de sujeito, bem como a caracterização do mesmo. O que se procurou evidenciar foi uma crescente sistematização de conceitos que permitam a compreensão da constituição do sujeito no sentido do gênero humano. Os estudos foram organizados por etapas, sendo que a primeira consta da delimitação conceitual do que envolve o homem {{cultural}} adulto segundo uma visão dialética de mundo e de sujeito. Nesse percurso, estão explanadas as condições pelas quais o homem nasce na condição de indivíduo e, aos poucos, se torna sujeito. Tal mudança de status, qualitativa, ocorre somente quando o homem passa a ser possuidor das características de pensamento teórico e consciência de classe. Ainda, subjacente a esse processo, se encontram as características típicas do humano que são a capacidade de planejamento e de orientar a ação no mundo de modo intencional. A tese da emergência do sujeito será demonstrada na história, num experimento didático e na emergência do sujeito pesquisador. Num primeiro momento, procura-se demonstrar, de forma contigua, ao longo do trabalho, a forma e as condições que fizeram com que os sujeitos emergissem ao longo da história do desenvolvimento da humanidade, com suas respectivas visões de mundo (conhecimento e consciência do mundo). Para isso, se faz uma caracterização das condições histórias no sentido temporal e, de forma mais minuciosa e resenhada, a caracterização do pensamento dos autores selecionados. O intuito é mostrar o condicionamento da percepção de mundo, da consciência ou visão de mundo dos sujeitos pelas condições materiais de vida dos mesmos, ou seja, o condicionamento do indivíduo pela atividade na qual está inserido tese de Leontiev, o que equivale dizer, Teoria da Atividade. Observou-se, num experimento didático, que os indivíduos inseridos na atividade pedagógica, conduzida de forma planejada e intencional, dentre outras características, emergem como sujeitos após determinado período de vivência coletiva e prática na qual lhe são possibilitadas as condições de apropriação de um modo geral de ação. A apropriação desse modo geral de ação dá aos investigados, estagiários do Clube de Matemática, consciência o bastante para, por sua vez, agirem na atividade pedagógica de forma planejada e intencional, isto é, dominando e guiando a própria conduta. Por fim, analisando a emergência do sujeito pesquisador é possível dizer que o indivíduo se torna sujeito em atividade e, tanto a sua consciência, quanto a sua ação no mundo estão condicionadas pelo processo formativo que acontece sob o direcionamento intencional e planejado dos membros da coletividade a qual participa. Somente depois de se tornar sujeito é que o indivíduo adquire características como conduta voluntária, ação intencional e/ou ação planejada. Tal posição permite não somente compreender os problemas de formação no processo escolar como históricos, mas, inclusive, indicar possibilidades práticas para o enfrentamento do processo formativo. In {{this paper}} of natural concept and experimental-educational, within there´s a research {{that aims to}} understand which contingence, situation or moments that build the formative base for the rising of the subject. The initial landmark for {{this study is the}} theses of authors of the well-known Vygotski School and others that are tuned with the Marxist concepts. For that, from a literature review, a theory summary was made of what was considered as a definition of the subject, as well as the characterization itself. What was tried to bring to attention was an increasing systemization of concepts that allowed a comprehension of the constitution of the subject in a human sense. The studies were organized by steps. Within the first one is the concept delimitation that revolves around the grown adult man according to the dialectic view {{of the world and the}} subject. Through this path the conditions by which the man is born as an individual and slowly becomes a subject is explained. This chance of status only occurs when the man possesses the theory thought and class consciousness. Subjacent to this process, there are the typical human characteristics that are the planning capability and intentionally guiding the action in the world. The rising of the subject theses will be demonstrated in history, in an educational experiment and in the rising of the researcher subject. At first, the intention is to demonstrate throughout this paper the means and conditions that made the subjects rise throughout the history of the development of the humanity, with their own visions of the world (knowledge and conscious of the world). Therefore there is a characterization of the historical conditions in a time way and in a more minimalist and detailed description of the characterization of the thoughts of the selected authors. The goal is to show the conditioning of the perception of the world, the conscious or the vision the subject has of the world through the material condition of their life, which means individual conditioning through the activity in which he is inserted Leontievs theses, which also means, Activity Theory was observed in a educational experiment that the inserted individuals in the pedagogical activity, conducted in a planned and intentional structure, within other characteristic rise as subjects after certain periods of group experience and also practice in which it is given the possibility to make an assumption of a general model of action. The assumption of this general model of action gives the ones investigated, interns of the Mathematics Club enough conscious to act on the pedagogical activity in a planned and intentional way, which means to dominate and guide their own conduct. At last the analyzing the rising of the researcher subject it is possible to say that the individual becomes a subject in the activity and not only his consciousness but also his actions in the world are conditioned by the formative process that happens under the intentional guiding and planning of all the members of the group in which he is inserted. Only after becoming a subject the individual acquires some characteristics such as <b>voluntary</b> <b>conduct,</b> intentional action and/or planned action. This position not only allows the understanding the formation problems in the scholastic process such as historical but also indicates the practical possibilities to face the formative process...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Private defence is {{the civilized}} {{remnant of the}} ancient system of private vengeance as redress for wrong done. The Romans, in {{permitting}} self-help formulated the principle moderatio inculpatae (moderation in self-defence) which the European jurists later relied upon to develop a coherent doctrine of private defence. Certain types of intentional killings were no longer regarded as unlawful and therefore are not punished as murder. South African recognizes that killing is justifiable and therefore not murder. Despite the sound rationale underlying the defence, namely the upholding of justice theory where people acting in private defence perform acts where they assist in upholding the legal order, {{and despite the fact}} that the defence is established in both criminal law legal theory and practice, there are threshold problems with this rationale which has been subject to much academic criticism. Such criticism must be seen in the context of the wider debate surrounding the circumstances in which battered women kill their abusers - normally in circumstances where the threat is not imminent and therefore the need to uphold justice is not necessary. The purpose of this enquiry is to examine the development and functioning of the defence and more particularly to do so in light of a comparison with the means currently utilized to criminalize conduct falling outside the bounds of self-defence: one of the parent systems of South African law, namely English law and the United States, where battered woman syndrome originated and a profound influence on the way in which the elements of the defence are interpreted in that jurisdiction. For instance, in American law subjective tests for self-defence have been developed such as the particularizing standard. This standard asks whether a reasonable person with the accused’s particular non-universal characteristics would have both perceived the situation as the accused perceived it and would have reacted to that perception by committing the accused’s self-defensive act. If the answer is yes, then the act is considered reasonable. It assumes that individuals freely choose how to perceive and respond to a threatening situation but also acknowledge that certain kinds of nonuniversal characteristics (such as battered woman syndrome) exercise such a powerful causal force on individuals perceptions and actions that it would violate the voluntary act requirement when holding that individual who possess such a characteristic to a standard of conduct that does not take that characteristic into account. The study concludes with an assessment of the form the defence ought to take. In South African law the defence consists of the conditions relating to an attack which includes: an attack, and protected interest and the attack must be unlawful. In respect of the conditions relating to the defence, the defence must be reasonably necessary to avert the attack and the defence must be directed against the attacker. Aspects of these elements have proved to be controversial. In particular, the condition of reasonably necessary to avert the attack has been called into question. Furthermore the requirement of imminence has been rendered especially controversial especially when viewed from the battered woman’s perspective where battered woman syndrome plays a role i. e. the woman’s internal makeup having an influence on the way she views the situation as opposed to an objective test is used to establish if the threat was imminent. While the English and American law elements of the duty to retreat, proportionality and reasonableness approximate the equivalent condition of reasonably necessary to avert the attack, the focal point of this defence in these jurisdictions has similarly been the imminence requirement and the test utilized for self-defence i. e. objective or subjective standard. Prior to evaluating the utility of these elements, the various rationales posited as a justification for the defence will be examined. It is submitted that while various rationales have been posited to form the basis of selfdefence, the autonomy theory (narrowly circumscribed) should be followed in South African law and that the traditional elements for self-defence should remain in force. Regarding the requirement that the attack be reasonably necessary, it is submitted that the traditional mechanism for distinguishing justified from unjustified self-defensive acts should remain an objective test. This is so because by taking account of the knowledge the defender has of her attacker the legal requirements of private defence will eventually be equated with those required for putative self-defence. If putative selfdefence goes to the issue of culpability, which is seen as a particular mental attitude or state of mind - South African law will be evincing a move toward a normative concept of fault. Such an approach has not proved unproblematic in South African law. Both early and modern common law as well as modern case law has expounded a coherent statement of the elements of self-defence which include imminence as a core feature. The problem is that traditional imminence rules do not cater adequately for the battered woman’s situation and for this reason theorists have advocated its abolition. The obvious problem with such a recommendation is that something must stand in its stead to distinguish legitimate cases from illegitimate cases of self-defence. In respect of the imminence requirement, the problems created by this standard cannot be solved by replacing imminence with necessity or by claiming priority for necessity or by demanding that imminence means pacifist rather than the libertarian version of necessity. These positions pose the question but do not answer it. Furthermore, if the imminence question cannot be answered by assuming one side of the necessity debate, then it cannot be answered by referring to the distinction between justification and excuse. It is submitted that “instead of viewing objectivity as not being able to account for battered woman’s situation – the opposite conclusion should be reached – that by rethinking certain situational factors as a set of relatively innocuous and perhaps necessary normative propositions then the abused woman’s situation is consistent with some very standard propositions in the law of self-defence. If the abused women is being attacked and the threat is imminent (in the traditional sense), then she should be able to avail to herself of self-defence, although it should be noted that the court should also consider the fact that the battered women placed herself in this dangerous situation. However, the court would also have to take into consideration the difficulty that the abused woman faced in extricating herself from this position. On the basis of a discussion of the various construals that inform the question of whether proportionality should form a necessary requirement for self-defence, including (i) the liberal aspiration to neutrality, (ii) constitutional norms and (iii) a duty of social solidarity to the state, it is submitted that proportionality should form an integral part of the requirements for self-defence. The test can be set out as follows: not only must the defence be necessary but also the means used by the accused for the purpose of averting the attack must be reasonable in the circumstances. This is in accordance with the autonomy theory. Therefore, would an “ordinary, intelligent and prudent person in the accused’s situation would react to establish if the self-defence claim was justifiable. However, it is submitted that not all the characteristics of the accused should be taken into account. Only those “characteristics which have the most (or direct) bearing on the accused’s situation” should be considered. Despite the rationales underlying self-defence, it has not been entirely clear whether an abused woman is expected to flee. It is submitted that there should be a duty to retreat. In the case of the abused woman, her situation is adequately catered for within the reasonableness neutrality perspective. In respect of the defence of provocation, Roman and Roman-Dutch law did not regard anger, jealousy or other emotions as an excuse for criminal conduct, but only as a factor which might mitigate sentence, if the anger was justified by provocation. South African law with its parent system in Roman-Dutch law might have followed this lead had it not result of the Transkei Penal Code of 1887, it envisaged a type of a partial excuse: even if been for the introduction of the mandatory death penalty for murder in 1917. In 1925 as a killing was intentional, homicide which would otherwise be murder maybe reduced to culpable homicide. The test for provocation was thus an objective one. By 1949 in R v Thibani it was held that provocation was not a defence but a special kind of material from which in association with the rest of the evidence the court should decide whether the accused had acted involuntary or without intent to kill. This introduced a subjective test for provocation. But a number of crucial issues remained unresolved; could intense provocation or emotional stress serve to exclude criminal capacity or <b>voluntary</b> <b>conduct.</b> After the decision in Chretien, the question arose, if severe intoxication could exclude these basic elements of liability then could it not also exclude provocation or emotional stress. At this point, the notion of criminal capacity came to the fore. This notion was unknown in South African common law and was adopted from Continental Legal systems, specifically Germany. The notion took hold with the Rumpff Commission of Inquiry into the Responsibility of Deranged Persons and Related matters, the recommendations of which gave rise to the provision of section 78 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act. In S v Mahlinza set out that criminal capacity of actor is an essential requirement necessary to establish criminal liability. Criminal capacity consists of cognitive component i. e. ability to distinguish between right and wrong and conative capacity i. e. the ability to act in accordance with the distinction. If either was lacking no liability would ensue. In S v Van Vuuren, the court expressed in unequivocal terms that the accused could not be held liable where failure to comprehend what he is doing is attributable to a combination of factors such as provocation or emotional stress. The very idea of allowing provocation to function as a defence excluding an accused’s criminal liability is inherently controversial. From a moral and ethical perspective people are expected to control themselves, even under provocation or emotional stress. To allow it to function as a complete defence as opposed to mitigating factor means that it gives credence to the belief that retaliation is justified in the eyes of the law and this is the very thing criminal law guards against. Despite the well established nature of the defence of non-pathological incapacity, the law has been thrown into flux by the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in S v Eadie which constituted a serious erosion of the notion of criminal capacity, with a concomitant “ripple effect” on other topics within the general principles of criminal law. The question this case has highlighted for South African law of non-pathological incapacity is whether the boundaries of the defence have been inappropriately extended. This is so since the court held not only that there is no distinction between the defence of automatism and nonpathological incapacity, and that it would have to be established that the accused acted involuntarily in order for her defence of lack of capacity to prevail, but furthermore held that the court should assess the accused persons evidence about his state of mind by weighing it against his actions and surrounding circumstances, thereby introducing an objective test. Theorists such as Burchell have considered this move “bold” and “encouraging” for its emphasis on objective norms, and the fact that it brings it into line with both the English and American jurisdictions, where not only is an objective element introduced into the enquiry, but where loss of self-control is not totally excusable since the law assumes that provoked party was not totally incapable of controlling anger. If an accused was unable to control himself, a full excuse would be defensible. The notion of capacity has its approximate equivalent in the English and American law of provocation where the jury must consider the subjective question of whether the accused was actually provoked to lose self-control, the defence requires that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have lost-self control and acted as the accused did. The South African notion of capacity is examined with reference to the way provocation is treated in these jurisdictions. Should non-pathological incapacity be equated with automatism, the established precedent in provocation and other cases of non-pathological incapacity would have to be revised by implication, and would have serious implications for the principle of legality and restricting the scope of the defence for battered women. Furthermore, it is submitted that a move towards an objective test should not be followed. This is so since such an approach does not extend to encompass the battered woman’s mental and emotional characteristics including recognized psychological disorder symptoms. This results in the court not having any meaningful way to determine whether the battered woman lost self-control and furthermore it will lead to increasing attention being directed at how far the objective test be tailored to fit the capacity of the accused. The problem with the capacity test is that it has created via the Criminal Procedure Act a new element of liability by drawing from both the general physical and the mental liability enquiries. Therefore, by duplicating the voluntary act requirement under mens rea, the courts have asked the same question twice. Once the accused is shown to be acting voluntarily, there will be a measure of goal-directed conduct. Where goal-directed conduct is present, it necessarily implies that here must be a level of capacity present in the case of the defence of non-pathological incapacity. In other words, the question is not whether capacity is present, but to what extent it is present. This point is not acknowledged by our courts: the concept of psychological fault underlying South African law offers no explanation for the fact that culpability is capable of gradation. The effects of battering could be used to support a defence of diminished capacity, which focuses not on mitigating circumstances of the act, but rather on the actor’s inability to form the requisite mens rea for the offence charged. However, the introduction of such a defence could only be achieved by returning to the rules relating to provocation followed in South Africa prior to 1971. According to the specific intent doctrine, policy considerations require that an accused should not be completely acquitted. However, these considerations require that an accused should not be completely acquitted. However, these considerations also require that an accused not be convicted of murder but of culpable homicide. This compromise solution (of culpable homicide) can only be reached by treating provocation as a special defence, one which is not strictly adjudicated in terms of the general principles relating to culpability (mens rea). Furthermore, it is submitted that a subjective test must be applied, since Snyman’s objective-subjective test leads to an illogical confusion between the subjective and objective elements...|$|E
