5000|$|Lovie-Kitchin {{obtained}} {{her first}} {{degree from the}} Department of Optometry at the University of Melbourne in 1973 and got her master's three years later at the same place, {{under the guidance of}} Professor Ian Bailey, who had been the first optometry clinician to work at the Kooyong Low Vision Clinic in Melbourne. [...] In 1976, she and Bailey created the Bailey-Lovie <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart,</b> which is now used worldwide, particularly in research settings. The chart was described in 2009 as the most popular redesign of the Snellen chart.|$|E
50|$|Since the Howard-Dolman test {{described}} above is cumbersome, stereoacuity is usually measured using a stereogram in which separate panels are shown to each eye by superimposing {{them in a}} stereoscope using prisms or goggles with color or polarizing filters or alternating occlusion (for a review see http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/04/09/rspb.2010.2777.long). A good procedure is a chart, analogous to the familiar Snellen <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart,</b> in which one letter in each row differs in depth (front or behind) sequentially increasing in difficulty. For children the fly test is ideal: {{the image of a}} fly is transilluminated by polarized light; wearing polarizing glasses the wing appears at a different depth and allows stereopsis to be demonstrated by trying to pull on it.|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} aspects of <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> with monovision correction. Binocular distance <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> with monovision was approximately equal to monocular <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> for addition powers (monocular defocus) of + 1. 00 to + 2. 50 D, using both {{high and low}} contrast logMAR <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts.</b> Neither the eye chosen to be defocused (dominant or nondominant) or pupil size (3. 5, 5 and 7 mm) affected the binocular <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> loss with monovision for high contrast charts. We also investigated the effect of induced residual astigmatism (+ 0. 50, + 1. 00, and - 1. 00 D) on binocular distance <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in monovision correction. Residual astigmatism caused a significantly greater reduction of binocular <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in the monovision condition {{than it did in}} normal binocular conditions. This effect appears to be related to a process of meridional interocular suppression. It may therefore be of clinical importance to correct low amounts of residual astigmatism in monovision corrections to provide optimum binocular <b>visual</b> <b>acuity...</b>|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} a new color pediatric <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> and its clinical application. METHODS:The color pediatric <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> was designed based on principle of visual angle. The optotype on the color chart had graphics. The progression rate of optotype size between 2 lines was 10 (10) 1 / 2 and 1. 2589. A regular geometric progression of optotype sizes and distribution was employed to arrange 8 lines with 11 optotype on the color chart. The testing distance was 3 m. The visual acuity score could be recorded as logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution notation or decimal notation. The reliability of naked distant measurements with this new chart was tested in one eye of 100 children(4 ～ 6 years old) taking the Chinese national standard logarithm <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> standard. RESULTS: The color pediatric <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> and logarithmic chart controls, visual acuity test results that {{in the two groups}} had no significant difference(t = 1. 2671, P > 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of amniotic membrane for treatment of partial limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Methods: Medical records of four patients with partial LSCD who underwent pannus resection and amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) were reviewed for ocular surface stability and improvement in <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> Clinico-histopathological correlation {{was done with the}} resected pannus tissue. Results: All the eyes exhibited stable corneal epithelial surface by an average of 7 weeks postoperatively with improvement in subjective symptoms. Best corrected <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> improved from preoperative (range: 6 / 9 p- 6 / 120) to postoperative (range: 6 / 6 p- 6 / 15) by an average of 4. 5 lines on Snellen <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts.</b> Histopathological examination of excised tissue showed features of conjunctivalisation. Conclusion: Amniotic membrane transplantation appears to be an effective means of reconstructing the corneal epithelial surface and for visual rehabilitation of patients with partial limbal stem cell deficiency.

40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} a new specialized <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> for amblyopic children aged 3 - 5 years old and its clinical applications. METHODS: The new <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> and notations were designed based on Weber-Fechner law. The optotypes were red against a white background and were specially shaped four basic geometric symbols:circle, square, triangle，and cross. A regular geometric progression of the optotype sizes and distribution was employed to arrange in 14 lines. The progression rate of the optotype size between two lines was 1. 2589 and the testing distance was 3 m. Visual acuity score could be recorded as logMAR notation or decimal notation. Age-stratified diagnostic criteria for amblyopia established by consensus statement on diagnosis of amblyopia (2011) {{among members of the}} Strabismus and Pediatric Ophthalmology Group, Ophthalmology Society, Chinese Medical Association (SPOGOSCMA) were illustrated in the new <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> RESULTS: When assessing visual acuity in children aged 3 - 5 years old, this new <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> that consists of four symmetrical shapes (triangle, square, cross, and circle) overcame an inability to recognize the letters of the alphabet and difficulties in designating the direction of black abstract symbols such as the tumbling ‘E’ or Landolt ‘C’, which the subjects were prone to lose interest in. The visual acuity score may be recorded in different notations:decimal acuity and logMAR. These two notations can be easily converted each other in the new eye chart. The measurements of this new chart not only showed a significant correlation and a good consistency with the international standard logarithmic <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> (r = 0. 932, P < 0. 01), but also indicated a high test-retest reliability (89 % of retest scores were within 0. 1 logMAR units of the initial test score). CONCLUSION: The results of this study support the validity and reliability of distance visual acuity measurements using the new eye chart in children aged 3 to 5 years over a wide range of visual acuities, and the new eye chart is great for early detection of amblyopia. It can be applied in various clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} visual evoked potentials(VEP) of 189 eyes {{subjected}} to traumatic injury, {{and to explore}} the feasibility and method to applying VEP technology to the evaluation of visual acuity after eye trauma. METHODS: All the objects were volunteers who were grouped according to a random examination with the international standard <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> The study determined spatial frequency in stimulation mode, P 100 amplitude and latency. Then, the lowest spatial frequency(LSF) was analyzed and its relationship with visual acuity were studied. Finally this study discussed about the way to evaluate visual acuity with VEP and also compared the VEP evaluation results with the <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> RESULTS: The LSF of 22 ', 11 ', 5 ', and 3 ' corresponded respectively to vision of 0. 1 - 0. 2, 0. 3 - 0. 5, 0. 6 - 1. 0, 1. 2 - 1. 5. There {{was a significant difference}} in P 100 amplitude between eyes with different visual acuity, but {{there was no significant difference}} in P 100 latency between these eyes.

40|$|The afferent {{visual system}} may be {{affected}} by neuro-degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) based on observations of visual function impairment and retinal inclusions on histopathology in ALS patients. To test the hypothesis that <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is impaired in ALS, we compared three measures of <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in ALS patients (n = 25) attending a multidisciplinary ALS clinic and age matched control subjects (n = 25). Bilateral monocular and binocular <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> were assessed using high contrast (black letters on white background) and low contrast (2. 5 %, 1. 25 % grey letters on white background) <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts</b> under controlled lighting conditions following refraction. Binocular summation was calculated as the difference between binocular and best monocular acuity scores. There were no associations between binocular or monocular high contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> or low contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis (generalized estimating equation models accounting for age). Binocular summation was similar in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control subjects. There was a small magnitude association between increased duration of ALS symptoms and reduced 1. 25 % low contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> This study does not confirm prior observations of impaired <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and does not support this particular measure of visual function for use in broad scale assessment of visual pathway involvement in ALS patients...|$|R

Objetive: to determinate test retest reliability and the agreement of two tests used to assess elementary school children <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> Methods: we evaluated 61 visual healthy children (122 eyes) ages 7 through 10 enrolled in elementary school of Pereira. <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (VA) was measured with Snellen letters chart and LEA symbols chart by two evaluators. Results: the average of VA was 0. 0 of logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), the mean difference between the test was - 0. 05 (CI 95 % - 0. 064 to - 0. 037) logMAR; the coefficient of repeatability (COR) was better for LEA symbols and Snellen chart (± 0. 08 and 0. 12) than those reported in previous papers (± 0. 15). Conclusion: the coefficient correlation Intraclass (CCI) has indicated a moderate concordance (0. 493) and the 95 % limits of agreement showed a wider difference between the both charts measurements as while <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> was better.

40|$|Aims: Gujarati is {{the main}} spoken {{language}} of {{a large proportion of}} the population of India. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new Minimum Angle of Resolution (logMAR) <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> in the Gujarati language. Materials and Methods: A new Gujarati <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> was designed to logMAR specifications using Gujarati optotypes experimentally selected to have similar relative letter legibility under spherical and cylindrical defocus. The chart validation study was carried out using 153 adult subjects in a large clinical setting in India. Subjects who were literate in English and Gujarati participated in the study. Visual acuity was measured with the new Gujarati logMAR chart and a modified Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study-(m-ETDRS) logMAR chart. The method of presentation was randomized between the charts. Repeat visual acuity was measured on a subsequent day with a second version of the Gujarati logMAR chart. Results: The Gujarati chart correlated highly with the m-ETDRS logMAR chart (r 2 = 0. 974). The mean visual acuity difference (Gujarati - m-ETDRS logMAR) was equal to three letters (- 0. 06 logMAR). The Gujarati logMAR chart also proved to be highly repeatable (r 2 = 0. 994, test-retest) with 95 % CI of ± 0. 04 logMAR. Conclusions: The new Gujarati logMAR <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> provides a valid and repeatable tool for the measurement of visual acuity in native Gujarati language speakers...|$|E
40|$|Purpose:To {{evaluate}} the equivalence of a smartphone-based <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> {{with a standard}} 6 metre Snellen <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> Methods: firstly a review of available Snellen chart applications on iPhone was performed to determine the most accurate application based on optotype size. A prospective comparative study was performed by measuring conventional 6 metre Snellen visual acuity (6 SVA) and then iPhone visual acuity using the 'Snellen' application on an Apple iPhone 4 {{in a sample of}} 88 patients from general medical and surgical wards in a tertiary hospital. Single-letter scoring was employed for both charts by converting Snellen chart line acuity measurements to logMAR score. Paired sample t-test was used to compare the logMAR score of two charts. Results: there was no significant mean difference in logMAR visual acuity between the two charts (mean difference= 0. 02 logMAR, 95 % CI - 0. 017 to 0. 057 logMAR, p= 0. 293). Overall, there was less than one line mean difference in acuity between the two charts. The largest mean difference in logMAR acuity was noted in the subgroup of patients with 6 SVA worse than 6 / 18 (n = 5), who had an approximate difference of 2 Snellen visual acuity lines (0. 276 logMAR). ConclusionThe 'Snellen' application on the iPhone 4 is comparable within one line accuracy to a 6 metre Snellen <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> for use at the bedside in a general hospital setting. Further validation is required for assessment of acuity in patients with severe vision impairment...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> is an {{essential}} estimate to assess ability of the visual system and is used {{as an indicator of}} ocular health status. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the consistency of acuity estimates from three different clinical <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts</b> under two levels of ambient room illumination. Materials and Methods: This study involved thirty Malay university students aged between 19 and 23 years old (7 males, 23 females), with their spherical refractive error ranging between plano and − 7. 75 D, astigmatism ranging from plano to − 1. 75 D, anisometropia less than 1. 00 D and with no history of ocular injury or pathology. Right eye <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (recorded in logMAR unit) was measured with Snellen letter chart (Snellen), wall mounted letter chart (WM) and projected letter chart (PC) under two ambient room illuminations, room light on and room light off. Results: <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> estimates showed no statistically significant difference when measured with the room light on and with the room light off (F 1, 372 = 0. 26, P = 0. 61). Post-hoc analysis with Tukey showed that <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> estimates were significantly different between the Snellen and PC (P = 0. 009) and between Snellen and WM (P = 0. 002). Conclusions: Different levels of ambient room illumination had no significant effect on <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> estimates. However, the discrepancies in estimates of <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> noted in this study were purely due to the type of letter chart used...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} large-letter contrast sensitivity, high-contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity,</b> and <b>visual</b> field defects in patients with glaucoma. METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, or ocular hypertension whose <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> was 20 / 40 (logMAR = 0. 3) on better {{were included in the}} study. <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> was measured using the Lighthouse <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts.</b> Contrast sensitivity was measured using the Pell-Robson (PR) chart. The mean depression (MD) score from the most recent Humphrey visual field was used to quantify the visual field defect. RESULTS: A total of 120 eyes were studied. The PR contrast sensitivity score correlated more strongly with the MD of the visual field (r =. 589, P <. 001) than did the logMAR <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> (r =. 193, P =. 035). When just the eyes with open-angle glaucoma were considered (N = 54), the correlation was even greater for the PR score (r =. 638). In ocular hypertensive eyes (N = 25), the correlations to PR and logMAR were not that different (r =. 394 for PR, r =. 303 for logMAR). Pseudophakic eyes did not show as strong a correlation (r =. 335) as did phakic eyes (r =. 591). CONCLUSION: For glaucomatous eyes with <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of 20 / 40 or better, a decrease in the contrast sensitivity correlates with increased visual field loss. We speculate that this decrease in contrast sensitivity in glaucoma patients may account for their complaints of poor vision despite normal or near normal <b>visual</b> <b>acuity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Data on 117 {{subjects}} {{over seven}} years of age were obtained {{to determine whether there}} is a difference in the results obtained from <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts</b> that use only letters with lateral symmetry and those that use a combination of letters with and without this symmetry. Subjects with acuities of 6 / 9 or better were used to overcome the problems associated with difference in letters on the 6 / 60 to 6 / 18 lines, such as the number of letters, their spacing on a line, and the spacing between lines. The results showed a highly significant statistical difference (p= 0. 0001) between the two charts, with the charts that use only letters with lateral symmetry giving a better result of on average, 0. 49 letters. This means that on approximately every second test, an eye tested on a chart with lateral symmetry would read one more letter than one tested on a chart with letters with and without symmetry. It is unlikely that clinical decisions would be based on this small difference. These findings should only be generalised to subjects with good <b>visual</b> <b>acuity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This study {{characterized}} {{the degree of}} change in health-related quality of life (HRQL) associated with change in visual acuity among patients with diabetic retinopathy. Methods Data are from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of ruboxistaurin for vision loss in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Visual acuity was quantified as letters on the ETDRS <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> HRQL was assessed with the 25 -Item Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ- 25) and the SF- 36. Patients were categorized into groups based on visual acuity change from baseline to month 18. HRQL change of these groups was compared using general linear models. Regression analyses examined visual acuity change defined continuously. Results Patients (N = 535) were primarily Caucasian (81. 9 %) and male (64. 1 %); mean age = 59. 3 years. Compared to patients whose visual acuity did not change, the group with > 10 letters vision loss had significantly greater decreases in all VFQ- 25 subscales except ocular pain. SF- 36 change scores did not correspond as closely to change in vision. Change in visual acuity defined continuously {{was significantly associated with}} change in all VFQ- 25 scales except ocular pain (p Conclusion Change in visual acuity was associated with corresponding changes in HRQL among patients with diabetic retinopathy. Previous research has often defined vision loss as a loss of at least 15 letters on the ETDRS <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> In the current study, however, a loss of at least 10 letters was associated with substantial declines in HRQL domains such as driving, dependency, role limitations, and mental health. These findings suggest that patients who experience vision loss of at least 10 letters may be appropriate targets of future research and clinical intervention. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{construct}} a <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> and find its effectiveness at screening visual acuity deficits. Materials and Methods: Two phases were involved in this study. Construction of the screener: Ten Sloan letters (C, D, H, K, N, O, R, S, V, and Z) were selected and the letters were constructed and reduced to 0. 2 logMAR acuity size (6. 92 mm) for viewing at 3 m. The screener contains three lines with seven letters in each. Few combinations of the seven letter sequences were chosen based on the row legibility scores. Three seven letter combinations close to the median of all combinations were selected, such that maximum difficulty score difference between the lines are < 1 %. Finding {{the effectiveness of the}} screener: 100 literate subjects with unaided visual acuity better than or equal to 6 / 60 were recruited for the study. Unaided visual acuity was tested using both the newly constructed Pocket Vision Screener and a logMAR <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> and the time taken to measure the visual acuity using both the charts was noted. Results: The mean age of the subjects was 43 ± 17 years. Subjects were classified as normal or deficient based on the logMAR visual acuity measurement. The screener was found to have 81 % sensitivity, 94 % specificity. The positive and negative predictive values were found to be 91 % and 87 %, respectively. A significant difference (P < 0. 001) was found in the time taken to record visual acuity using both the charts.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{inclusion}} {{for rehabilitation}} of visually impaired children is partly {{based on the}} measurement of near vision, but guidelines for near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> assessment are currently lacking. The twofold purpose of this systematic review was to: (i) {{provide an overview of}} the impact of the chart design on near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured, and (ii) determine the method of choice for near vision assessments in children of different developmental ages. METHODS: A literature search was conducted by using the following electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE. The last search was run on March 26 th 2016. Additional studies were identified by contacting experts and searching for relevant articles in reference lists of included studies. Search terms were: vision test(s), vision assessment(s), <b>visual</b> <b>acuity,</b> <b>chart(s)</b> and near. RESULTS: For children aged 0 - 3 years the golden standard is still the preferential looking procedure. Norms are available for this procedure for 6 - 36 month old children. For 4 - 7 year olds, we recommend using the LEA symbols, because these symbols have been properly validated and can be used in preliterate children. Responses can be verbal or by matching the target symbol. In children aged 8 - 13 years, the recommended method is the ETDRS letter <b>chart,</b> because letter <b>acuity</b> is more predictive for functional vision and reading than symbol acuity. In 8 - 13 year olds, letter acuity is 0. 1 - 0. 2 logMAR poorer than symbol <b>acuity.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Chart</b> design, viewing distance, and threshold choice have a serious impact on near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measurements. Near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with symbols is lower than near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with gratings, and near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with letters is lower than near <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> measured with symbols. Viewing distance, chart used, and letter spacing should be adapted to the child's development and reported in order to allow comparisons between measurements...|$|R

The average logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) monocular <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> with Lea symbols (0. 17 ± 0. 13) was better than the Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart (0. 22 ± 0. 14). The mean difference between Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart and Lea symbol chart was 0. 05 ± 0. 12 in logMAR units. A second analysis eliminating outliers showed the same result but lower differences (n = 43, 0. 05 ± 0. 05 logMAR units). <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> results between the two charts in children aged 3 - 4 years showed a significant difference (p = 0. 000), but not for children aged 5 - 6 years (p = 0. 059). Inter-eye differences between the two charts was not statistically significant (p = 0. 77). Conclusion: Bailey-Lovie tumbling E chart is comparable to the Lea symbols chart in pre-school children. But preference should be given to Lea symbols for children aged 3 - 4 years as the symbols are more familiar than a directional test for this age group...|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{analyze the}} {{accuracy}} and the influencing factors of LAMBDA 100 retinometer {{in predicting the}} visual acuity of cataract patients with high axial myopia after phacoemulsification. METHODS: The retinal visual acuity was measured in 91 patients with 91 cataract eyes by LAMBDA 100, and compared with the best corrected visual acuity 2 wk after operations. If differences of predictive visual acuity and postoperative visual acuity between the two logarithmic <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart</b> was within 2 lines, it was considered consistent. RESULTS: The total compliance rate was 62 %, the false positive rate was 2 %,the false negative rate was 36 %. The predictive accuracy was affected by lens opacity, the deeper opacity, the lower accuracy. The predictive accuracy of eye with axial length ≥ 32 mm was significantly {{lower than that of}} eye with axial length P P CONCLUSION: LAMBDA 100 can be used as an assistant tool for predicting postoperative visual acuity in immature stage cataract of patients with high myopia. The eye axial length, the degree of visual acuity and lens opacity can influence the predicting accuracy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{observe the}} effect of {{pressing}} auricular points on myopia in children. MethodsMyopic children aged 8 – 9 years {{were divided into two}} groups. The Chinese herb Semen Vaccariae was used to stimulate the auricular points of CO 10, LO 5, TF 4, CO 15, CO 12, and CO 13 for three treatment courses for the experimental group (n = 39), while the same therapy was not given to the control group (n = 33). Binocular naked vision of the experimental group and the control group before and after the intervention was measured using a standard E <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart.</b> ResultsThere was no difference in the binocular naked vision between the experimental group and the control group before the intervention. In contrast, there was significant improvement in binocular naked vision in the experimental group after the intervention compared with the control group (P < 0. 05). ConclusionWhen combined with external medical application, non-invasive auricular therapy could improve the function of myopia in children. Auricular pressing was well received by the children...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Evaluation of {{anterior}} corneal surface aberrations {{according to}} normal corneal topography is important. In this study, aberrations of corneal anterior surface in eyes with normal topographic pattern, was comparatively investigated. Methods: In this comparative study, 165 eyes of 97 patients (20 - 30 years old), which had normal corneal topographic pattern, were evaluated. Data collection tools were Pentacam topographer, Tomey topographer, standard Snellen <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>chart,</b> and slit-lamp. Data {{were analyzed using}} Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Tukey post-hoc tests. Results: Based {{on the results of}} the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the distribution of all data was normal (0. 058 <p) HOAs) were higher in asymmetric bow-tie and irregular group compared to the other groups, and spherical aberration was significantly higher in the irregular pattern group compared to the other groups (p< 0. 001), except round pattern group (p= 0. 089). </p Conclusion: The {{results of the present study}} showed that there is a significant relationship between corneal topographic patterns and corneal anterior surface aberrations, and according to the difference of some aberration components in subjects with normal topographic pattern, aberration analysis is essential to achieve higher visual quality after refractive surgery...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the potential links between thinning of retinal ganglion cell axons in eyes {{of patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS) without past optic neuritis (ON) and MS-related inflammatory damage of the posterior visual pathway. Methods: Temporal retinal nerve fiber layer (tRNFL) thickness was analyzed in eyes with no history of ON (NON) from 53 patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Fifty normal age- and sexmatched controls were examined with optical coherence tomography. Low-contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts</b> were used for functional assessment of vision. The optic tract (OT) and optic radiation (OR) were identified using probabilistic tractography, and volume of T 2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesions and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) indices were measured within both structures. Cross-sectional diameter of the OT was also calculated. Results: tRNFL thickness was significantly reduced in NON eyes and was associated with reduced low-contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity.</b> Lesions within the OR were detected {{in the majority of}} patients. There was a significant correlation between thinning of the tRNFL and OR lesion volume (adjusted for non-OR lesion volume, age, sex, and disease duration). tRNFL thickness also correlated with OR DTI indices. No OT lesions were identified in any of the patients and no relationship between retinal nerve fiber layer loss and potential markers of OT lesions was found. Conclusion: The results demonstrate a strong tract-specific association between loss of tRNFL fibers and MS-related inflammation within OR. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To compare {{white matter}} (WM) {{injuries}} associated with vision loss in multiple sclerosis (MS) and optic neuritis (ON). Methods. Twenty-three patients with clinically definite relapsing- remitting MS and chronic unilateral ON and 14 neurologically healthy volunteers were monocularly tested with Sloan 100 %, 2. 5 %, and 1. 25 % contrast <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts.</b> Primary <b>visual</b> pathway and whole-brain WM injury were assessed with {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). OCT and DTI correlates of high- and low-contrast visual impairment were identified using correlation analyses. Results. The MS patients displayed significantly reduced retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and altered optic nerve and radiation DTI measures compared with the controls. In the patients, 2. 5 % and 1. 25 % contrast letter acuity in the unaffected eye correlated significantly and independently with optic nerve and optic radiation DTI measures. <b>Visual</b> <b>acuity</b> in affected eyes did not correlate with optic nerve or optic radiation DTI measures, but did correlate with DTI measures in prefrontal and temporal brain regions that were shown to connect structurally to visual cortices. Conclusions. In unaffected eyes, visual impairment was associated with WM injury in the visual pathway. In contrast, irrecoverable visual impairment after ON was associated with injury to frontal WM, which potentially impairs the capacity for remapping visual processing. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE In May 2012 UK visual {{standards}} for driving changed, {{in order to}} comply with European laws. Drivers need to have both a <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of 6 / 12 AND {{be able to read}} a number plate at 20 metres. Previously the number plate test was the only <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> test. METHODS Four different distance <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>charts</b> were used (Snellen, logMAR letter-similar to ETDRS, logMAR Landolt ring, distance reading acuity- similar to MNRead chart) and were presented at 6 m. 120 drivers were tested binocularly without refractive correction. Participants were taken outside to perform the number plate test at 20 m. A second study was conducted, with 38 participants whose vision was impaired to approximately 6 / 12 using simulation spectacles. RESULTS Differences between the <b>visual</b> <b>acuities</b> as measured by the charts were statistically but not clinically significant. For all charts there is an overlap zone within which participants may pass only one of the two tests, outside this range, participants pass or fail both tests. The 6 / 12 cut-off provides reasonable sensitivity and specificity for Snellen and logMAR letter <b>charts.</b> A poorer <b>acuity</b> cut-off was needed with the Landolt chart to maximize the relationship with the number plate test. CONCLUSIONS The 6 / 12 visual cut-off and the number plate test will not always pass or fail the same drivers. Snellen and logMAR letter charts are recommended to be used to measure the <b>visual</b> <b>acuity</b> of drivers, but not Landolt rings. Fifteen percent of the sample could read a number plate at 20 m, but was not able to achieve either 6 / 12 or + 0. 30 logMAR. The overlap zone is a helpful tool to identify those people who need advice from Eye Care Practitioners...|$|R
