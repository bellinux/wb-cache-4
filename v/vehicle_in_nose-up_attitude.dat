25|$|No {{mechanical}} defects, {{other than}} the inoperative fuel pump, were reported. The aircraft {{was found to be}} <b>in</b> a high <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> at impact.|$|R
500|$|In late 1963 {{the project}} was named Tagboard; the Q-12 was re-designated D-21 while the A-12 version {{launcher}} became M-21 (D- for [...] "daughter" [...] and M- for [...] "mother"). Two of the original 18 A-12 aircraft were designated as M-21s with serial numbers 60-6940 and 60-6941. The M-21 was a two-seat version of the A-12, with a pylon on the fuselage centerline between the vertical stabilizers to carry the drone <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude.</b>|$|R
50|$|It {{was badly}} damaged on February 14, 1902 when {{superheating}} {{of the hydrogen}} caused the airship, already <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> to pitch up even further, causing some of the wires supporting the gondola to break. Some of these then began to get entangled with the propeller. Santos-Dumont was forced to stop the motor {{and in order to}} prevent himself being blown out to sea, vented hydrogen to bring the airship down in the sea.|$|R

50|$|On 13 September 1906 Aéro-Club de France {{observers}} {{gathered to}} witness {{an attempt to}} make a prize-winning flight. The aircraft failed to take off during a first attempt, but during the second it lifted and flew between 4 and 7 m at an altitude of about 70 cm. The aircraft then landed <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> breaking the propeller and bringing an end to the day's experiments. This brief flight did not qualify for any prize, but earned Santos-Dumont an ovation from the crowd.|$|R
25|$|The Camel {{proved to}} have better {{manoeuvrability}} than the Albatros D.III and D.V and offered heavier armament and better performance than the Pup and Triplane. Its controls were light and sensitive. The Camel turned more slowly to the left, which resulted <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> due to the torque of the rotary engine, but the torque also resulted {{in being able to}} turn to the right quicker than other fighters, although that resulted in a tendency towards a nose-down attitude from the turn. Because of the faster turning capability to the right, some pilots preferred to change heading 90° to the left by turning 270° to the right.|$|R
50|$|Although {{airships}} rely on {{the difference}} in density between the lifting gas and the surrounding air to stay aloft they can also generate {{a certain amount of}} aerodynamic lift by using their elevators to fly <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude.</b> Similarly, by flying nose-down down-force can be generated: this may be done to prevent the airship rising above its pressure height. Typically airships start a flight with their gasbags inflated to about 95% capacity: as the airship gains height the lifting gas expands as the surrounding atmospheric pressure reduces. The height at which the internal pressure of the gasbags equals external atmospheric pressure is called the pressure height: if the airship climbs beyond this it is necessary to vent gas in order to prevent the gasbags rupturing.|$|R
50|$|After landing, the {{aircraft}} veered off the runway on its damaged landing gear {{and came to}} a halt. Evacuation commenced from the front due to a failure to broadcast the evacuation order over the cabin address system (it was erroneously broadcast over the radio), the order being given by one of the flight crew exiting the cockpit and noticing that evacuation had not commenced. During this time, {{the aircraft}} settled aft, resting on its tail <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude.</b> The four forward slides were unsafe for use due to the greater elevation and high winds. Most passengers evacuated from the rear six slides. Eight passengers using the forward slides sustained serious back injuries and were hospitalised. Other passengers suffered minor injuries such as abrasions and sprains.|$|R
5000|$|The Vengeance was uniquely {{designed}} to dive vertically without lift from the wing pulling the aircraft off target. To this end, {{it had a}} 0° angle of incidence on the wing to better align {{the nose of the}} aircraft with the target during the dive. This resulted in the aircraft cruising <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> giving a poor forward view for the pilot, particularly during landing. It had an unusual, [...] "W"-shaped wing planform. This resulted from an error in calculating its centre of gravity. Moving the wing back by [...] "sweeping" [...] the centre section was a simpler fix than re-designing the wing root. This gives the impression of an inverted gull wing when seen from an angle, when in fact the wing has a more conventional dihedral on the outer wing panels.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the flight}} voice {{recorder}} {{revealed that the}} co-pilot and a third pilot on the flight deck had made relatively subtle suggestions to the pilot– once the stick-shaker warning commenced– that he must {{deal with the fact}} that the plane was still <b>in</b> a speed-draining <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> protocols and training were reinforced to establish a greater willingness of junior flight-deck staff to be more forceful in similar situations. [...] (In the Birgenair crash, it had even been revealed that the co-pilot chose not to use his own, active, stick to counter the pilot and try to bring the nose down.) ...|$|R
50|$|On 21 July 1948 after {{completing}} a run to 30000 ft east of Lake Mead, Captain Robert M. Madison {{and the crew}} began a descent and leveled out just over 300 ft above the surface of Lake Mead. The crew described the lake as looking like a mirror, with the sun reflecting brightly off the surface. These conditions make judging height above a surface considerably more difficult. The aircraft then slowly began to descend below 100 ft until it struck the surface at 250 mi/h km/h and started skipping along it. Three of the aircraft's four engines were ripped from its wings and the fourth burst into flames. The aircraft managed to gain around 250 ft but then settled back onto the water's surface <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> and slowly skiing to a stop. The five-man crew then evacuated into two liferafts and watched the aircraft sink.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was descending through {{an altitude of}} [...] when the stick shaker activated and sounded for 3 seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the stick shaker sounded again. The aircraft continued to descend below the glide slope until it collided with a stand of trees <b>in</b> a high <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude.</b> It came to rest upright in a commercial building, [...] short of the runway. After the impact, a fire started {{in or near the}} left engine, which spread {{to the rest of the}} aircraft. At least four of the passengers survived the crash, however, only three escaped before the {{aircraft was}} fully engulfed in flames.|$|R
50|$|The taildragger {{configuration}} {{has its own}} advantages, and {{is arguably}} more suited to rougher landing strips. The tailwheel makes the plane sit naturally <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> when on the ground, which is useful for operations on unpaved gravel surfaces where debris could damage the propeller. The tailwheel also transmits loads to the airframe in a way {{much less likely to}} cause airframe damage when operating on rough fields. The small tailwheel is much lighter and much less vulnerable than a nosewheel. Also, a fixed-gear taildragger exhibits less interference drag and form drag in flight than a fixed-gear tricycle aircraft whose nosewheel may sit directly in the propeller's slipstream. Tailwheels are smaller and cheaper to buy and to maintain, and manhandling a tailwheel aircraft on the ground is easier. Most tailwheel aircraft are lower in overall height and thus may fit in lower hangars. Tailwheel aircraft are also more suitable for fitting with skis in wintertime.|$|R
5000|$|At around 7:05 p.m., {{while on}} {{approach}} to Runway 33 at Johnstown-Cambria County Airport, the plane descended below the lowest safe approach slope, then stalled, {{at which point}} the pilots lost control. The plane clipped the top of a bank of elevated approach lights, soared over a highway (U.S. Route 219) and, while <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up,</b> wings-level <b>attitude,</b> slammed into the top of a steep embankment approximately 100 yards short of the runway. [...] "It was a matter of five feet, and he would have been clear," [...] Warren Krise, an Air East official, said afterward.|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{controls}} {{the rate of}} climb, and the airspeed during the climb by {{the combination of the}} pitch attitude and power setting. He will choose the pitch-power settings according to the amount of altitude gain required or how quickly it is desired to climb, or if a constant airspeed is desired. Every aircraft type has limits on the pitch-power settings {{that can be used for}} climbing flight. Typically it is the pitch attitude which is the more limiting factor. Somewhat like an automobile, if the [...] "slope" [...] is made too steep, by an excessive increase (nose up) in pitch-attitude, the aircraft will lack sufficient power to climb, and <b>in</b> an extreme <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> the airspeed may decrease to the point where the aircraft will stall. (Some aircraft have a duration limit for a particular power setting) ...|$|R
5000|$|The worst fatal {{accident}} in Scottish Airlines' history occurred on 18 February 1956, {{when one of}} the company's Avro 685 York C.1 airliners (registration: G-ANSY) crashed on its way from Egypt to the United Kingdom after taking off from Luqa Airport, Malta, killing all 50 occupants (45 service personnel and five crew). Following takeoff from Malta Luqa for London Stansted, the boost enrichment capsule in the carburettor of the no. 1 engine failed shortly after the aircraft had become airborne. This set the no. 1 engine on fire. Accident investigators presumed that this engine stopped producing power after only 30 seconds of flight. The flightdeck crew did not feather the engine's propeller as the aircraft was still slowly climbing to 700-800 feet above mean sea level (amsl)/300-400 ft above ground level (agl), with a [...] "crabbing" [...] or [...] "yawing" [...] motion to the left. The aircraft stalled and dove to the ground while still <b>in</b> a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> at very low flying speed shortly after retracting the flaps. Although the failure of the aircraft's no. 1 engine was established as the accident's probable cause, loss of speed and consequent loss of control through an error of judgement of the pilot in command were considered important contributory factors.|$|R
5000|$|The second death {{occurred}} 9 May 1981 at Hill AFB, Utah, when Captain David [...] "Nick" [...] Hauck flying Thunderbird No. 6 (T-38A) crashed {{while performing}} the hi-lo Maneuver. Capt Hauck crashed {{while attempting to}} land his ailing T-38 after an engine malfunctioned and caught fire. With black smoke billowing from the exhaust and the aircraft losing altitude <b>in</b> a high <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> the safety officer on the ground radioed Capt Hauck: [...] "You’re on fire, punch out!" [...] To that, he responded: “Hang on... we {{have a bunch of}} people down there.” The aircraft continued to stay airborne for about half a mile before hitting a large oak tree and a barn, then sliding across a field and flipping as it traversed an irrigation canal—ultimately erupting into a fireball just a few hundred feet from the runway's end. No one on the ground was injured, even though the accident occurred adjacent to a roadway packed with onlookers.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{airships}} {{often make}} use of aerodynamic lift by using their elevators to set a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> so that {{the main body of}} the airship provides some lift as it flies along; however, this is typically done to counteract minor out-of-trim conditions, and it is as likely that the nose may need to be pointed down to reduce lift.|$|R

25|$|Eyewitnesses (including a Mr Russell) {{state that}} at 3:05pm the Avro Tudor was {{approaching}} runway 28 of Llandow aerodrome at an abnormally low altitude with the undercarriage down. The pilot attempted {{to correct the}} descent by increasing {{the power of the}} engines and brought the plane up. The aircraft rose steeply to 100m (300ft) attaining a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> of 35 degrees to the vertical, and then the aircraft stalled.|$|R
50|$|The captain {{noticed the}} {{reduction}} in engine power, {{but he did not}} realize the source of the problem. Therefore, he started a rapid descent as a precaution. At that time, the airspeed was already near stall speed, and the autopilot had kept a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> to maintain a constant height. When the airliner was pummeled by a sudden updraft, it finally entered a stall condition and the crew mishandled it. Although the cockpit voice recorder picked up the first officer correctly diagnosing the situation as a stall and attempting twice to communicate this to the captain, the captain was likely confused by the unusual behaviour of the engines, due to the anti-ice system and probably the air flow disruption caused by the updraft. The captain thought he was struggling with an engine flameout, which he told the first officer to communicate to the ground controller, and did not recognise the deep stall situation; he then mishandled the stall by maintaining <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> which further decreased speed and deepened the stall until the plane eventually crashed.|$|R

50|$|According to the {{official}} investigation report, the crash {{was a result of}} pilot error, arising from a lack of skill to recover from an excessive <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> during a go-around procedure. The pilots’ deficiencies were caused by a deficiency in the airline's safety management and a lack of regulatory oversight. One member of the commission filed an alternative opinion report, however, claiming that the commission had ignored the possible malfunction of the aircraft's elevators' controls.|$|R
50|$|After takeoff, White Knight and SpaceShipOne {{ascended to}} the launch altitude, {{planned to be}} around 14 km. At 08:09 SpaceShipOne was released, glided for 6 s, then went into <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> and the rocket motor was ignited. The rocket motor was capable of burning for {{approximately}} 87 s, having been upgraded since the previous flight. It was planned to shut off the motor {{at an altitude of}} 345,000 feet (105 km), presumably to avoid pushing the envelope too far.|$|R
50|$|The vehicle started encountering more {{significant}} air density {{in the lower}} thermosphere at about 400000 ft, at around Mach 25, 8200 m/s. The vehicle was controlled {{by a combination of}} RCS thrusters and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> would cause the descent angle to flatten-out, or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the heat-shield glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By {{the end of the last}} turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete. The vehicle leveled its wings, lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the French Armée de l'Air {{was left}} with two primary {{transport}} aircraft: the Junkers Ju 52, built in France {{after the end of}} the war, and the Douglas C-47, received from US surplus. While both had given good service, they were no longer modern, and they suffered from a common set of flaws: a tailwheel landing gear which gave them a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> when at rest complicating cargo stowing, restrictive side-loading doors and limited payload.|$|R
25|$|By 16:10:32 (122 seconds), the leading-edge devices had stowed {{fully into}} the wing. The speed was , and height {{above the ground}} was , with the {{aircraft}} still held into its usual climb attitude. Key continued to hold the <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> {{when there was a}} second stick shake and stick push in the following two seconds. A third stick push followed 127 seconds into the flight but no recovery was attempted. One second later, the stall warning and recovery system was over-ridden by a flight crew member.|$|R
5000|$|Rafale M: Carrier-borne {{version for}} the French Naval Aviation, which entered service in 2001. For carrier operations, the M model has a {{strengthened}} airframe, longer nose gear leg {{to provide a}} more <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> larger tailhook between the engines, and a built-in boarding ladder. Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about 500 kg more than the Rafale C. It is the only non-US fighter type cleared to operate from the decks of US carriers, using catapults and their arresting gear, as demonstrated in 2008 when six Rafales from Flottille 12F integrated into the [...] Carrier Air Wing interoperability exercise.|$|R
50|$|During this phase, {{there was}} a sharp <b>nose-up</b> pitch <b>attitude</b> change, with the {{aircraft}} at low altitude, seeming to be losing speed. It then dived with a slight angle {{to the right and}} crashed. The landing gear was extended.|$|R
50|$|The {{water was}} only 20 ft deep, yet only 60 {{percent of the}} {{wreckage}} was recovered because the breakup was so extensive. The flight data recorder tape was too damaged to help the investigation. Instead, investigators used the maintenance records of the crashed aircraft and of other DC-8s, {{to conclude that the}} pilots had trimmed the horizontal stabilizer to the full nose-down position, to counter the excessive <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> that, <b>in</b> turn, was caused by a malfunctioning pitch trim compensator that had extended too far. Once the upset occurred, {{it was not possible to}} trim the horizontal stabilizer back to the nose-up position, because of the severe G-forces generated by the crew's pulling back on the yoke after the upset.|$|R
50|$|Elevator trim {{balances}} the control force {{necessary to maintain}} the correct aerodynamic force on the tail to balance the aircraft. Whilst carrying out certain flight exercises, a lot of trim could be required to maintain the desired angle of attack. This mainly applies to slow flight, where a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> is required, <b>in</b> turn requiring a lot of trim causing the tailplane to exert a strong downforce. Elevator trim is correlated {{with the speed of}} the airflow over the tail, thus airspeed changes to the aircraft require re-trimming. An important design parameter for aircraft is the stability of the aircraft when trimmed for level flight. Any disturbances such as gusts or turbulence will be damped over {{a short period of time}} and the aircraft will return to its level flight trimmed airspeed.|$|R
