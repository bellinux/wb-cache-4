50|$|In 1971, Scoles {{moved to}} the University of Waterloo, Canada as Professor of Chemistry and Physics. There, he set up the first {{successful}} crossed molecular beam laboratory in Canada. He help establish the Waterloo Centre for Molecular Beams and Laser Chemistry, the Centre for Surface Science in Technology, {{as well as the}} weekly chemical physics seminars and annual Symposium on Chemical Physics, both of which continue to this day. He was the initial (Acting) Director of the Guelph-Waterloo Centre for Graduate Work in Chemistry, the first true inter-university graduate program in Canada. Scoles performed crossed beam differential scattering cross-section studies of atom-atom, atom-molecule and molecule-molecule interactions, using his bolometer detector. He also began using helium atom diffraction to study the structure of surfaces, both of pure crystals which often undergo change from the bulk structure (reconstruction) and also the structure of overlayers of atoms and molecules absorbed on surfaces. With Terry Gough and then graduate student Roger Miller, Scoles introduced the technique of bolometer-detected optothermal spectroscopy of molecular beams where vibrational excitation of a beam of molecules is detected by the bolometer. They used this technique to studies <b>vibrational</b> <b>dissociation</b> of a complex of two or more molecules held together by Van der Waals forces. By the early 1980s, Scoles began the first studies of the spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed in or on clusters of rare gas atoms.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{accomplishment}}s of the project were as follows: (1) From an overall standpoint, the primary accomplishment {{of this research was}} the development of a complete gasdynamic-radiatively coupled nonequilibrium viscous shock layer solution method for axisymmetric blunt bodies. This method can be used for rapid engineering modeling of nonequilibrium re-entry flowfields over a wide range of conditions. (2) Another significant accomplishment was the development of an air radiation model that included local thermodynamic nonequilibrium (LTNE) phenomena. (3) As part of this research, three electron-electronic energy models were developed. The first was a quasi-equilibrium electron (QEE) model which determined an effective free electron temperature and assumed that the electronic states were in equilibrium with the free electrons. The second was a quasi-equilibrium electron-electronic (QEEE) model which computed an effective electron-electronic temperature. The third model was a full electron-electronic (FEE) differential equation model which included convective, collisional, viscous, conductive, vibrational coupling, and chemical effects on electron-electronic energy. (4) Since vibration-dissociation coupling phenomena as well as vibrational thermal nonequilibrium phenomena are important in the nonequilibrium zone behind a shock front, a vibrational energy and vibration-dissociation coupling model was developed and included in the flowfield model. This model was a modified coupled <b>vibrational</b> <b>dissociation</b> vibrational (MCVDV) model and also included electron-vibrational coupling. (5) Another accomplishment of the project was the usage of the developed models to investigate radiative heating. (6) A multi-component diffusion model which properly models the multi-component nature of diffusion in complex gas mixtures such as air, was developed and incorporated into the blunt body model. (7) A model was developed to predict the magnitude and characteristics of the shock wave precursor ahead of vehicles entering the Earth's atmosphere. (8) Since considerable data exists for radiating nonequilibrium flow behind normal shock waves, a normal shock wave version of the blunt body code was developed. (9) By comparing predictions from the models and codes with available normal shock data and the flight data of Fire II, it is believed that the developed flowfield and nonequilibrium radiation models have been essentially validated for engineering applications...|$|E

The collision velocities investigated exhibit probabilities of less than unity by means of the N-state method.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{atmospheric}} pollution by CO 2 (by transport and industrial applications), CO 2 {{can be used as}} a source, instead of stocking it as a product. The case considered is the reaction between CO 2 and H 2 producing methanol: The reaction for the formation of methanol: CO 2 + 3 H 2  CH 3 OH + H 2 O is strongly exothermique with an activation barrier needed to be surpassed and proceeds at high pressure and temperature with the use of a catalyst. The use of a non-thermal plasma namely a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) can generate energetic electrons which can initiate, excitation reactions (<b>vibrational,</b> electronic), <b>dissociation,</b> formation of radicals and ionization. Thus the activation of reactants (CO 2 and H 2) by the plasma can dramatically enhance the conversion of CO 2. The aim of this work is to simulate this reaction associating electrical discharges and heterogeneous catalysis. The first step of the simulation in this work presents a 1 D model in Matlab (Poisson equation, conservation of electrons and ions), obtaining an average electron and ion density. This electron density is then introduced in a gas phase kinetic model for the <b>vibrational</b> excitation and <b>dissociation</b> of H 2 /CO 2 via electron collisions in the discharge region. The adsorption of radicals, produced in the gas phase, in the catalyst, is simulated using the commercial code COMSOL.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} <b>vibrational</b> excitations and <b>dissociations</b> of nitrogen undergoing a nonequilibrium relaxation process upon {{heating and cooling}} is reported. The rate coefficients for collisional induced vibrational transitions and transitions from a bound vibrational state into a dissociative state have been calculated using {{an extension of the}} theory originally proposed by Schwarz (SSH) et al. (1952). High-lying vibrational states and dissociative states were explicitly included but rotational energy transfer was neglected. The transition probabilities calculated from the SSH theory were fed into the master equation, which was integrated numerically to determine the population distribution of the vibrational states as well as bulk thermodynamic properties. The results show that: (1) the transition rates have a minimum near the middle of the bound vibrational levels, causing a bottleneck in the <b>vibrational</b> relaxation and <b>dissociation</b> rates; (2) high vibrational states are always in equilibrium with the dissociative state; (3) for the heating case, only the low vibrational states relax according to the Landau-Teller theory; (4) for the cooling case, vibrational relaxation cannot be described by a rate equation; (5) Park's (1985, 1988) two-temperature model is approximately valid; and (6) the average vibrational energy removed in dissociation is about 30 percent of the dissociation energy...|$|R
