25|$|Economics per se, as {{a social}} science, is {{independent}} of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization, however, many policymakers or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other people's lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and rhetoric as vehicles to legitimize agendas and <b>value</b> <b>systems,</b> and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities. The close relation of economic theory and practice with politics is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} constraints {{gave way}} to more liberal conditions for women. Patriarchy faded as an ideal; young people had more freedom to choose their spouses and more often used birth control to regulate {{the size of their}} families. Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b> There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{composition}} of the emerging international <b>value</b> <b>system,</b> including its hierarchical components. It also contrasts this fragile international <b>value</b> <b>system</b> with the more strongly developed European <b>value</b> <b>system</b> (European public order), as concretized by the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. It first argues that international human rights norms constitute the ‘core content’ of a constantly evolving and layered international <b>value</b> <b>system.</b> Within this <b>value</b> <b>system,</b> a special but fragile hierarchical status is granted to those human rights norms that qualify as jus cogens and/or erga omnes norms. Thereafter it explores {{the manner in which the}} European Court of Human Rights has concretized the normative superiority of obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights for member states vis-à-vis other norms of public international law, to the extent that a conflict between these norms arises. It concludes by examining whether these developments could also strengthen the international <b>value</b> <b>system</b> through a spill-over effect via the work of international human rights bodies and national courts. This, in turn, would strengthen the ability of the international <b>value</b> <b>system</b> to determine the outcome of conflicts between international obligations stemming from different international regimes...|$|R

25|$|That project aims at {{registering}} {{a complete}} {{range of values}} with which people identify, {{to which they are}} attracted or which they reject as abhorrent. The notion of wisdom is explored as a way, an art, of dealing with value dilemmas. For instance, Complexity: understanding <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> is a text that looks at values through a positive interpretation, a negative interpretation, a paradoxical negative interpretation of the positive, and a paradoxical positive interpretation of the negative. Another text, Insights: wisdom and requisite variety, gives a list of several sources of wisdom which, in interrelation, may be required in a value system to ensure the long-term viability of a complex society.|$|E
25|$|Émile Durkheim {{wrote in}} The Division of Labour in Society that as society becomes more complex, {{the body of}} civil law {{concerned}} primarily with restitution and compensation grows {{at the expense of}} criminal laws and penal sanctions. Over time, law has undergone a transformation from repressive law to restitutive law. Restitutive law operates in societies {{in which there is a}} high degree of individual variation and emphasis on personal rights and responsibilities. For Durkheim, law is an indicator of the mode of integration of a society, which can be mechanical, among identical parts, or organic, among differentiated parts such as in industrialized societies. Durkheim also argued that a sociology of law should be developed alongside, and in close connection with, a sociology of morals, studying the development of <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> reflected in law.|$|E
25|$|While many Americans cite {{income as}} the prime {{determinant}} of class, occupational status, educational attainment, and <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> are equally important variables. Income is in part determined by the scarcity of certain skill sets. An occupation that requires a scarce skill set which is attained through higher educational degree, and which involves higher autonomy, responsibility and influence, will usually offer higher economic compensation. Qualifying for such higher income often requires that individuals obtain the necessary skills (e.g., by attending law, medical, or postgraduate school) and demonstrate the necessary competencies. There are also differences between household and individual income. In 2005, 42% of US households (76% among the top quintile) had two or more income earners; as a result, 18% of households but only 5% of individuals had six-figure incomes. To illustrate, two nurses each making $55,000 per year can out-earn, in a household sense, a single attorney who makes a median of $95,000 annually.|$|E

500|$|To {{literary}} theorist Michael LeMahieu, Barth's {{first two}} novels confront a logical positivist [...] "separation {{of facts and}} values" [...] common in postwar American fiction. [...] The End of the Road displays [...] "aesthetic resistance to the philosophical realism it desires results {{in a state of}} narrative, logical, affective, and ethical exhaustion {{at the end of the}} book". [...] The narrative conflict echoes an ethical conflict between the characters' <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> that Joe insists is inevitable.|$|E
500|$|The {{unreliable}} {{narrator is}} not immediately aware that Tyler Durden originated {{in him and}} is being mentally projected. He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs {{as a way to}} feel powerful, though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires [...] "real experiences" [...] of actual fights like the Narrator at first, he manifests a nihilistic attitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b> His impulsive nature, representing the id, conveys an attitude that is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing; he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinese re-education camps. The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and in the end, he arrives at a middle ground between his two conflicting selves.|$|E
500|$|Benitez {{considers}} the poem {{to highlight the}} tensions between the [...] "monadic and autonomous subjectivity" [...] of European culture and the [...] "social subjectivity" [...] of adat, or tradition, with the character of Siti Akbari [...] "a site of instability that makes manifest both the possibilities of social transformation, {{as well as the}} anxiety over the possibility of social reproduction gone awry". As an individual, she is able to fight her enemies and reclaim her husband. Ultimately, however, she chooses to return to her polygamous relationship with Abdul Moelan, an affirmation of tradition over modernism. In opposition to Siti Akbari, the trader Safi Oedin refuses to live in accordance with the local customs while he is in a foreign land and ultimately dies. Benitez writes that this [...] "may be read as a warning to those who refuse to live in accordance with local adat." [...] Koster notes that– as usual with syairs– Siti Akbari works to increase awareness of adat and traditional <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E

A SASO policy manifesto produced in July 1971 defined this ideology as [...] "an attitude of mind, a way of life. The basic tenet of Black Consciousness is that the Blackman must reject all <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> that seek {{to make him a}} foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity." [...] Black Consciousness centred on psychological empowerment, through combating the feelings of inferiority that most black South Africans exhibited. Biko believed that, as part of the struggle against apartheid and white-minority rule, blacks should affirm their own humanity by regarding themselves as worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities. It applied the term [...] "black" [...] not only to Bantu-speaking Africans, but also to Indians and Coloureds. SASO adopted this term over [...] "non-white" [...] because its leadership felt that defining themselves in opposition to white people was not a positive self-description. Biko promoted the slogan [...] "black is beautiful", explaining that this meant [...] "Man, you are okay as you are. Begin to look upon yourself as a human being." ...|$|E

Przedstawiają wyniki badań dotyczących przekonań i systemu wartości terapeutów. Starają się odpowiedzieć na pytanie, w jakim stopniu i w jaki sposób system wartości terapeutów wpływa na światopogląd pacjentów oraz na przebieg terapii. Przedstawiają różne stanowiska dotyczące postępowania terapeuty w sytuacji widocznych różnic pomiędzy systemami wartości ich samych i pacjentów. In current {{discussions on}} ethical issues in psychotherapy, it is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that it is not}} possible that psychotherapist’s <b>value</b> <b>system</b> does not influence the process of therapy and the professional relationship. The authors ask the following questions: how do therapists understand the standard of neutrality? What are the values identified by the therapists? How does the therapist’s <b>value</b> <b>system</b> influence that of the client? How can the therapist involve his/her <b>value</b> <b>system</b> in order to achieve an improvement in therapy? What should the therapist do, when his/her <b>value</b> <b>system</b> differs from the client’s? When does the therapist cross the ethical boundaries, trying to influence and change the <b>value</b> <b>system</b> of the client? Who is the guardian of the client’s right to his/her <b>value</b> <b>system</b> not being undermined?

2500|$|Recent feminist {{critiques of}} Human Security often find {{difficulties}} {{with the concept}} and categorization of [...] "Human". This categorization is made {{under the influence of}} certain <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> which are inherently exclusive by their nature. For instance, the liberal definition of [...] "human" [...] is: someone that is independent and capable of making decisions for themselves. This definition is problematic because it excludes persons who are not independent, such as persons with disabilities, from human security rights. If Human Security was to be entirely inclusive it would need to challenge the current definition of [...] "human" [...] on which it operates and acknowledge that different abilities also require rights.|$|E
