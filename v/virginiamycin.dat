40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{tested the}} efficacy of a single drench of <b>virginiamycin</b> for protecting sheep against grain poisoning (lactic acidosis). In Expt 1, 80 penned sheep (30 ± 0. 4 kg) were drenched with 0, 40, 80, or 160 mg of <b>virginiamycin</b> in 10 mL of water, then fed wheat ad libitum. Eleven sheep that received no <b>virginiamycin</b> and one receiving 40 mg <b>virginiamycin</b> were withdrawn from the trial due to inappetence after eating wheat. Sheep drenched with 80 or 60 mg <b>virginiamycin</b> were heavier (P < 0. 05) than control sheep at 20 days after drenching, and none was withdrawn. Rumen pH was higher (P < 0. 05) in sheep drenched with <b>virginiamycin</b> than in control sheep. In Expt 2, 100 sheep (62 ± 0. 7 kg) were either gradually introduced to a standing wheat crop by restricting {{the length of time}} they had access to the crop, or drenched with 160 mg of <b>virginiamycin</b> then given unlimited access to the crop. Sheep receiving <b>virginiamycin</b> lost more weight {{in the first week of}} the experiment, but thereafter gained weight faster than the sheep gradually introduced to wheat.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a single drench of <b>virginiamycin</b> (2. 6 mg/kg liveweight) can prevent mortalities due to lactic {{acidosis}} in sheep. It was proposed that the most important feature of a successful drench of <b>virginiamycin</b> is the length of time that lactate production in the rumen is suppressed. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the likely effective dose prior to testing the technique on cattle exposed to grain feeding and therefore prevent mortalities. This was achieved by drenching both sheep and cattle with equivalent doses of <b>virginiamycin</b> and taking periodic rumen samples which were incubated with glucose in vitro to determine potential lactate production. Drenching with <b>virginiamycin</b> decreased L-lactate in both sheep and cattle. D-lactate was increased in sheep but was variable in cattle. Rumen L-lactate levels were suppressed for 4 - 5 days in sheep when they were drenched with <b>virginiamycin</b> at 2. 6 mg/kg and twice that dose did not appear to increase the period of L-lactate suppression.

40|$|Two {{regulatory}} genes encoding a Streptomyces antibiotic {{regulatory protein}} (vmsS) and a response regulator (vmsT) of a bacterial two-component signal transduction system {{are present in}} the left-hand region of the biosynthetic gene cluster of the antibiotic <b>virginiamycin,</b> which is composed of <b>virginiamycin</b> M (VM) and <b>virginiamycin</b> S (VS), in Streptomyces virginiae. Disruption of vmsS abolished both VM and VS biosynthesis, with drastic alteration of the transcriptional profile for <b>virginiamycin</b> biosynthetic genes, whereas disruption of vmsT resulted in only a loss of VM biosynthesis, suggesting that vmsS is a pathway-specific regulator for both VM and VS biosynthesis, and that vmsT is a pathway-specific regulator for VM biosynthesis alone. Gene expression profiles determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR on the <b>virginiamycin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster demonstrated that vmsS controls the biosynthetic genes for VM and VS, and vmsT controls unidentified gene(s) of VM biosynthesis located outside the biosynthetic gene cluster. In addition, transcriptional analysis of a deletion mutant of vmsR located in the clustered regulatory region in the <b>virginiamycin</b> cluster (and which also acts as a SARP-family activator for both VM and VS biosynthesis) indicated that the expression of vmsS and vmsT is under the control of vmsR, and vmsR also contributes to the expression of VM and VS biosynthetic genes, independent of vmsS and vmsT. Therefore, coordinated <b>virginiamycin</b> biosynthesis is controlled by three pathway-specific regulators which hierarchically control the expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster...|$|E

40|$|BarA of Streptomyces virginiae is a {{specific}} receptor protein for virginiae butanolide (VB), one of the γ-butyrolactone autoregulators of the Streptomyces species, and acts as a transcriptional regulator controlling both <b>virginiamycin</b> production and VB biosynthesis. The downstream gene barB, the transcription of which is under the tight control of the VB-BarA system, {{was found to be}} transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA with its downstream region, and DNA sequencing revealed a 1, 554 -bp open reading frame (ORF) beginning at 161 bp downstream of the barB termination codon. The ORF product showed high homology (68 to 73 %) to drug efflux proteins having 14 transmembrane segments and was named varS (for S. virginiae antibiotic resistance). Heterologous expression of varS with S. lividans as a host resulted in <b>virginiamycin</b> S-specific resistance, suggesting that varS encoded a <b>virginiamycin</b> S-specific transport protein.

40|$|<b>Virginiamycin</b> S (VS, a type B synergimycin) {{inhibits}} {{peptide bond}} synthesis in vitro and in vivo. The attachment of <b>virginiamycin</b> S {{to the large}} ribosomal subunit (50 S) is competitively inhibited by erythromycin (Ery, a macrolide) and enhanced by <b>virginiamycin</b> M (VM, a type A synergimycin). We have previously shown, by fluorescence energy transfer measurements, that <b>virginiamycin</b> S binds {{at the base of}} the central protuberance of 50 S, the putative location of peptidyltransferase domain [Di Giambattista et al. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 3540 - 3547]. In the present work, the ribosomal protein components at the <b>virginiamycin</b> S binding site were affinity labeled by the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester derivative (HSE) of this antibiotic. Evidence has been provided for (a) the association constant of HSE-ribosome complex formation being similar to that of native <b>virginiamycin</b> S, (b) HSE binding to ribosomes being antagonized by erythromycin and enhanced by <b>virginiamycin</b> M, and (c) a specific linkage of HSE with a single region of 50 S, with virtually no fixation to 30 S. After dissociation of covalent ribosome-HSE complexes, the resulting ribosomal proteins have been fractionated by electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose, and the HSE-binding proteins have been detected by an immunoenzymometric procedure. More than 80 % of label was present within a double spot corresponding to proteins L 18 and L 22, whose Rfs were modified by the affinity-labeling reagent.

However, when added at a level of 40 mg/kg <b>virginiamycin</b> tended to produce a better condition of sows which resulted in a significant reduction of replacement rate (P < 0 · 05), even though the proportion of gilts culled in the treated and untreated groups was high. The most evident result was a significantly shorter weaning-to-conception interval for the <b>virginiamycin</b> group {{at the end of the}} second reproductive cycle (first period, 5 · 9 days less than the control group, 2 · 5 days less than the 60 mg/kg group; second period, - 9 · 5 days v. control group, P < 0 · 05, and - 7 · 1 days v. 60 mg/kg group, P < 0 · 05), allowing a numerical improvement in productivity. Piglet performance was not significantly improved by the use of <b>virginiamycin</b> even though there was an evident trend in favour of the 40 mg/kg group which presented a higher proportion of heavier piglets (P < 0 · 05) and a reduction of pre-weaning mortality. A significant quadratic regression was found for weaning-to-conception interval and numeric productivity, indicating that the dosage more efficient to improve these parameters was 32 mg/kg.

40|$|Cattle feed lots {{are based}} on an {{expensive}} infrastructure and rely on high levels of grain and sophisticated feeding systems to achieve rapid growth rates. The use of <b>virginiamycin</b> removes the risk of acidosis associated with grain feeding and may {{provide a basis for}} developing simplified grain feeding systems which provide more flexibility for cattle producers. The use of <b>virginiamycin</b> removes the need for a gradual introduction to grain-based diets and makes it safe to feed grain and hay separately. It is also makes it possible to feed restricted amounts of grain at weekly intervals and this has application in feeding grain to grazing cattle. Supplementing the diet of grazing cattle with grain allows utilisation of paddock feed which is cheaper, and often of a better quality, than hay and straw used in feedlot diets. <b>Virginiamycin</b> applied at 20 g/t grain has been shown to provide good protection against acidosis, even when wheat is fed.

40|$|The M {{component}} of <b>virginiamycin</b> inhibited growth of Plectonema boryanum under both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions.

Cells incubated with suitable concentrations of either M or M + S stopped growing and lysed. Loss of the colony-forming capacity occurred {{quickly in the}} presence of M + S and slowly {{in the presence of}} M alone. <b>Virginiamycin</b> M inhibited protein synthesis in autotrophically and heterotrophically growing Plectonema. This effect was very rapid and could be reversed by removing the antibiotic. The S component did not block the incorporation of amino acids into proteins, but prevented the reversibility of the inhibitory effect of M. <b>Virginiamycin</b> M or S did not affect the photosynthetic oxygen development (Hill's reaction) in Plectonema. Moreover, carbon dioxide photoassimilation and formation of chlorophyll were inhibited only after an appreciable lag. Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was blocked virtually without delay by <b>virginiamycin</b> M.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of antibiotic growth promoters, such as <b>virginiamycin,</b> at subtherapeutic levels in poultry feeds {{has a positive}} effect on health and growth characteristics, possibly due to beneficial effects on the host gastrointestinal microbiota. To improve our understanding of the chicken gastrointestinal microbiota and the effect of <b>virginiamycin</b> on its composition, we characterized the bacteria found in five different gastrointestinal tract locations (duodenal loop, mid-jejunum, proximal ileum, ileocecal junction, and cecum) in 47 -day-old chickens that were fed diets excluding or including <b>virginiamycin</b> throughout the production cycle. Ten libraries (five gastrointestinal tract locations from two groups of birds) of approximately 555 -bp chaperonin 60 PCR products were prepared, and 10, 932 cloned sequences were analyzed. A total of 370 distinct cpn 60 sequences were identified, which ranged in frequency of recovery from 1 to 2, 872. The small intestinal libraries were dominated by sequences from the Lactobacillales (90 % of sequences), while the cecum libraries were more diverse and included members of the Clostridiales (68 %), Lactobacillales (25 %), and Bacteroidetes (6 %). To assess the effects of <b>virginiamycin</b> on the gastrointestinal microbiota, 15 bacterial targets were enumerated using quantitative, real-time PCR. <b>Virginiamycin</b> was associated with increased abundance of many of the targets in the proximal gastrointestinal tract (duodenal loop to proximal ileum), with fewer targets affected in the distal regions (ileocecal junction and cecum).

Methods Eighty crossbred beef steers (298. 2 ± 6. 3 kg) were used in a 152 -d performance evaluation consisting of a 28 -d adaptation period followed by a 124 -d growing-finishing period. During the 124 -d period steers were fed either a lesser energy dense (LED, 2. 10 Mcal/kg NEm) or higher energy dense (HED, 2. 22 Mcal/kg NEm) diet. Diets were fed with or without 28 mg/kg (dry matter [DM] basis) <b>virginiamycin</b> in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Four Holstein steers (170. 4 ± 5. 6 kg) with cannulas in the rumen (3. 8 cm internal diameter) and proximal duodenum were used in 4 × 4 Latin square experiment to study treatment effects on characteristics of digestion. Results Neither diet energy density nor <b>virginiamycin</b> affected average daily gain (p> 0. 10). As expected, dry matter intake and gain efficiency were greater (p 0. 10) ruminal or total tract digestion. Ruminal (p = 0. 02) and total tract digestion (p< 0. 01) of organic matter, and digestible energy (p< 0. 01) were greater for HED vs LED. Ruminal microbial efficiency was lower (p< 0. 01) for HED vs LED diets.

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an antibiotic, <b>virginiamycin,</b> on the development of anti-body responses. Chickens were fed diets containing no antibiotics, along with either subtherapeutic (11 ppm) or prophylactic (22 ppm) doses of <b>virginiamycin.</b> Chick-ens were then immunized with keyhole limpet hemo-cyanin (KLH) and sheep red blood cells systemically, and with BSA and KLH orally.

To clarify the in vivo function of BarA in the VB-mediated signal pathway that leads to virginia-mycin biosynthesis, two barA mutant strains (strains NH 1 and NH 2) were created by homologous recombi-nation. In strain NH 1, an internal 99 -bp EcoT 14 I fragment of barA was deleted, resulting in an in-frame dele-tion of 33 amino acid residues, including the second helix of the probable helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. With the same growth rate as wild-type S. virginiae on both solid and liquid media, strain NH 1 showed no ap-parent changes in its morphological behavior, indicating that the VB-BarA pathway does not participate in morphological control in S. virginiae. In contrast, <b>virginiamycin</b> production started 6 h earlier in strain NH 1 than in the wild-type strain, demonstrating {{for the first time}} that BarA is actively engaged in the control of <b>virginiamycin</b> production and implying that BarA acts as a repressor in <b>virginiamycin</b> biosynthesis. In strain NH 2, an internal EcoNI-SmaI fragment of barA was replaced with a divergently oriented neomycin resistance gene cassette, resulting in the C-terminally truncated BarA retaining the intact helix-turn-helix motif. In strain NH 2 and in a plasmid-integrated strain containing both intact and mutated barA genes, <b>virginiamycin</b> pro-duction was abolished irrespective of the presence of VB, suggesting that the mutated BarA retaining the intac...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate effects of <b>virginiamycin</b> and monensin plus tylosin on ruminal fermentation characteristics in steers fed dry rolled corn-based finishing diets with or without wet corn gluten feed. Ruminal pH was higher, concentrations of volatile fatty acids were lower, and ciliated protozoal numbers were higher in steers fed diets with wet corn gluten feed. Including <b>virginiamycin</b> or monensin plus tylosin had few effects on the ruminal fermentation characteristics we measured.

Acquired resistance to bacitracin, narasin, tylosin, and <b>virginiamycin</b> was seen for both species, and for E. faecium, resistance to avilamycin and avoparcin was also seen, Drawing the distinction between susceptibility and resistance based on frequency distributions of MICs was easy with avoparcin, avilamycin, and tylosin but difficult with <b>virginiamycin</b> {{and to some extent}} also with bacitracin and narasin...|$|E
40|$|Animals on pasture {{generally}} show higher {{feed efficiency}} {{as a result}} of the use of antibiotics. This study evaluated the effect of the antimicrobials salinomycin and/or <b>virginiamycin</b> on production and the ruminal parameters of supplemented dairy cows grazing on Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania. Twelve Holstein/Zebu multiparous cows were used, distributed in three Latin squares, one for the evaluation of ruminal parameters, and the others for production parameters. Cows on pasture were fed 50 % of their estimated intake with corn silage and concentrate supplements containing salinomycin, <b>virginiamycin</b> or a combination of additives, in doses of 120 and 150 mg kg− 1, respectively. There were no differences in milk production and composition, energy and nitrogen balance, dry matter digestibility and feeding behavior. However, salinomycin and <b>virginiamycin</b> each reduced pasture and total dry matter intake by about 14 % and 10 %, with a consequent improvement in feed efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{findings}} suggest {{the location of}} the central loop of domain V of 23 S rRNA within the peptidyltransferase domain of ribosomes. This enzymatic activity is inhibited by some antibiotics, including type A (<b>virginiamycin</b> M or VM) and type B (<b>virginiamycin</b> S or VS) synergimycins, antibiotics endowed with a synergistic action in vivo. In the present work, the ability of VM and VS to modify the accessibility of 23 S rRNA bases within ribosomes to chemical reagents has been explored. VM afforded a protection of rRNA bases A 2037, A 2042, G 2049 and C 2050. Moreover, when ribosomes were incubated with the two <b>virginiamycin</b> components, the base A 2062, which was protected by VS alone, became accessible to dimethyl sulphate (DMS). Modified reactivity to chemical reagents of different rRNA bases located either in the central loop of domain V or in its proximity furnishes experimental evidence for conformational ribosome alterations induced by VM binding...|$|E

Both BMD and <b>virginiamycin</b> significantly increased (P< 0. 01) the body weight gains as compare to the control and also improve the feed conversion ratio. The carcass characteristics showed the highest edible weight was recorded in treatment IV where <b>virginiamycin</b> @ 500 g/MT feed was incorporated (76. 86 %), followed by treatment III (71. 92 %), treatment II (71. 41 %) and the lowest (70. 68) in control (T-I).
