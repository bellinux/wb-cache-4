40|$|The Egnatia Motorway {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} infrastructure projects currently under construction in Europe. It is 680 km long and the total cost of works amounts to € 4. 3 bn. The main objective regarding the planning and management of this project is the completion of the motorway in accordance with predetermined technical and qualitative specifications without cost overrun and within the approved time schedule. This paper presents reliable data for the realization of the Egnatia Motorway project concerning the three aspects of “time – cost – quality”. In particular, cost data are presented for completed sections in flat, semi-mountainous and mountainous areas as well as more specific data for bridges and tunnels. 1. THE PROJECT AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE The Egnatia Motorway is part of the Trans-European Transport Network and {{is one of the}} fourteen priority projects of the European Union. It also acts as a collector route of the Paneuropean Corridors?V (Vienna – Thessaloniki), IX (Helsinki – Alexandroupolis) and? (Berlin – Thessaloniki). It connects the main cities of Northern Greece serving 5 ports and 6 airports. It is a project of a great geopolitical significance in the Balkans and Southeast Europe. This project is financed by national and community resources, i. e. the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Investment Bank and the Community Budget of the Trans-European Transport Network of a total budget of € 3. 5 bn (<b>VAT</b> <b>excluded).</b> Alternative funding scenarios are being examined, with the participation of private capital, for the 10 % of the project that remains unfunded.

Current taxes on income are made up of: taxes on income and other current taxes. Taxes on income consist of tax on personal income and the tax on the revenue or profit of companies. Indirect taxes consist of: taxes on production and imports, which in turn are composed of taxes on production and other taxes on production. The taxes on production consist of: Value Added Tax, taxes on imports <b>excluding</b> <b>VAT</b> and taxes on production <b>excluding</b> <b>VAT</b> and duties.
