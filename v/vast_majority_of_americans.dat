25|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006. From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines. However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world. Public opinion polls conducted over the years have found that the <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> favor broader sex education programs over those that teach only abstinence, although abstinence educators recently published poll data with the opposite conclusion.|$|E
