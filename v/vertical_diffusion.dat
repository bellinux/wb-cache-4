The global oceanic sink due to eddy diffusion for PFOA is high, with accumulated removal fluxes over the last 40 years of 664 t, with the Atlantic Ocean accounting for 70 % of the global oceanic sink. The global oceans have removed 13 % of all PFOA produced to a depth greater than 100 m via vertical eddy diffusion; an additional 4 % has been removed via deep water formation.

50|$|Developing well-constructed models (accounting for {{variables}} such as oil type, salinity and surfactant) are necessary to select the appropriate dispersant in a given situation. Two models exist which integrate the use of dispersants: Mackay's model and Johansen's model. There are several parameters which must be considered when creating a dispersion model, including oil-slick thickness, advection, resurfacing and wave action. A general problem in modeling dispersants is that they change several of these parameters; surfactants lower {{the thickness of the}} film, increase the amount of diffusion into the water column and increase the amount of breakup caused by wave action. This causes the oil slick's behavior to be more dominated by <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> than horizontal advection.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies addressing the turbulent diffusion in the stratosphere and mesosphere {{during the last two}} decades. The motivation for such studies was the need for an understanding of the thermal and constituent structure of the middle atmosphere. Observational estimates of the horizontal and/or <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> were obtained using chemical release, rocket vapor trail, aircraft, balloon, and radar techniques. During the same period, a number of theoretical studies were performed to infer the level of <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> needed to account for observed constituent profiles. There appears to be a discrepancy between the level of <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> required for the dissipation of gravity wave and tidal motions {{on the one hand and}} for the maintenance of observed temperature and constituent profiles on the other.

40|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> of trace {{pollutants}} is a {{very important}} physical process that influences pollutant concentrations. However, there are large uncertainties in the numerical modeling of this process, which could affect model predictions of pollutant levels and their responsiveness to emission controls. Uncertainties could result from the formulation of <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> schemes or from errors in eddy diffusivity and dry deposition velocity parameters associated with this process. Inter-comparisons between different model configurations and sensitivity analysis of model parameters can be used to help quantify these uncertainties. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of two <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> schemes, EDDY and ACM 2, was performed by comparing ground-level concentrations and vertical profiles generated using the CMAQ model with measurement data from the Texas Air Quality Study II. In addition, new capabilities of conducting sensitivity analysis to dry deposition velocity and eddy diffusivity were implemented into the CMAQ-DDM model. The results show that the ACM 2 scheme tends to predict larger secondary pollutant concentrations and smaller primary pollutant concentrations at the surface compared to the EDDY scheme. Differences between the two <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> schemes and uncertainties in dry deposition velocity may cause temporal variations in the responsiveness of ozone to both NOx and VOC control respectively...|$|E
40|$|Possible {{dynamical}} {{influences on}} the diurnal behavior of ozone are investigated. A time dependent one-dimensional photochemical model is developed for this purpose; all model calculations are made at 70 deg N during summer. It is shown that the <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> can vary as much as 1 order of magnitude within a day {{as a result of}} large changes in the zonal wind induced by atmospheric thermal tides. It is found that by introducing a dissipation time scale for turbulence produced by breaking gravity waves, the agreement with Poker Flat echo data is improved. Comparisons of results from photochemical model calculations, where the <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> is a function of height only, with those in which the <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient is changing in time show large differences in the diurnal behavior of ozone between 70 and 90 km. By including the dynamical effect, much better agreement with the Solar Mesosphere Explorers data is obtained. The results are, however, sensitive to the background zonally averaged wind. The influence of including time-varying <b>vertical</b> <b>diffusion</b> coefficient on the OH densities is also large, especially between 80 and 90 km. This suggests that dynamical effects are important in determining the diurnal behavior of the airglow emission from the Meinel bands...|$|E
