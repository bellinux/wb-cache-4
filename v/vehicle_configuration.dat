25|$|UMTRI {{houses the}} Center for National Truck and Bus Statistics. For many years, {{it has worked}} collaboratively with FMCSA and NHTSA to {{maintain}} the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents (TIFA) and Buses Involved in Fatal Accidents (BIFA) databases. Starting with cases identified in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) (the U.S. national database of road traffic fatalities based on police crash reports), UMTRI researchers collect detailed data on <b>vehicle</b> <b>configuration,</b> cargo type, hours of driving, and other variables. In addition, TIFA and BIFA data collection protocols are easily adapted to address emerging issues. Other strengths of the UMTRI program include vehicle engineering, crash avoidance systems such as collision warning systems and stability control, biomechanics, and risk factors such as distraction, fatigue, and medical conditions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} about the Aurora reusable space launcher concept study that was initiated in late- 2015 /early- 2016. Within the Aurora study, several spaceplane-like <b>vehicle</b> <b>configurations</b> with different geometries, propulsion systems and mission profiles will be designed, investigated and evaluated {{with respect to}} their technical and economic feasibility. The first part of this paper will discuss the study logic and the current status of the Aurora studies and introduces the first <b>vehicle</b> <b>configurations</b> and their system design status. As the identification of highly efficient structural designs is of particular interest for Aurora, the structural design and analysis approach will be discussed in higher level of detail. A special design feature of the Aurora <b>vehicle</b> <b>configurations</b> is the utilization of the novel thin-ply composite material technology for structural mass reductions. Therefore, the second part of this paper will briefly discuss this technology and investigate the application and potential mass savings on vehicle level within simplified structural analysis studies.

50|$|For each <b>vehicle</b> <b>configuration,</b> a {{look-up table}} is applied: each speed {{corresponds}} to a certain value of resistance (reverse torque applied to the drive wheels).

A fan is coupled to the roller bench to provide the vehicle air intakes with an airflow matching the current speed. Many more tests can be performed during vehicle development with this arrangement than with conventional road tests.|$|E
50|$|An AAMV is an Aerodynamically Alleviated Marine Vehicle, a {{high speed}} marine <b>vehicle</b> <b>configuration</b> that uses aerodynamically {{generated}} forces (lift) to ‘alleviate’ its weight.

The vehicle is in constant contact with the water, therefore the aerodynamic surfaces operate in ground effect. The name derives from the '‘Aerodynamic Alleviation Concept’', presented by L.J. Doctors to illustrate the positive effect of using a wing-like superstructure on a catamaran configuration.|$|E
