The worry of getting into this problematical situation compels the software of the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> to operate in a watchful mode- it constantly makes efforts to minimize the use of memory space; otherwise a larger flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> will be needed; however a larger flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> can be very problematic because flight <b>data</b> <b>recorders</b> have very rigorous requirements; therefore an enlargement is very expensive and costly. In this paper it is suggested to send the data to a remote cloud, so the flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> memory device will be in actual fact unbounded...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Extensive {{enlargement}} {{and safety}} of Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> memory. Design/methodology/approach – Moving the memory of Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders</b> from an internal embedded device to a cloud. Findings – Our implementation has made the embedded memory device of Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorder</b> effectively unlimited and hence much more information can be stored. Research limitations/implications – The possibility of a flight <b>data</b> <b>recorder</b> to be damaged or lost in a crash is not so high, but our implementation can be very helpful in cases such as aerial disappearances. Practical implications – Larger and protected memory for Flight <b>Data</b> <b>Recorders.</b> Social implications – Faster finding of reasons for crashes and enabling to take immediate actions so as to remedy the failures.
