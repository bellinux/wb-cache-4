40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} hepatitis B and C chronicity from a virological perspective. Work de-scribed in the literature and our in vitro studies of HBV polypeptide morphogenesis lead us to speculate about a role for HBsAg complex formation in immune evasion that may be especially important during the initial period of infection. Briefly, although viral structural proteins do eventually provide epitopes recognized by the host, we suggest that these HBs Ag complexes, which may themselves be refractory to proteasomal degra-dation, are an important way by which the <b>virus</b> <b>shields</b> its epitopes and evades early recognition by the cel-lular immune system. This suggests a central strategy by which the virus has evolved, structurally, to enable the establishment of persistent infection of its host. The concept offers {{an explanation for the}} nearly unidi-rectional and rapid kinetics whereby HBV proteins form multimers and generate a surplus of viral structures that have not been thought to serve any useful structural purpose. 16...|$|R
40|$|The fourth conserved region (C 4) in the HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoprotein (Env) gp 120 is a structural element {{that is important}} for its function, as it binds to both the receptor CD 4 and the co-receptor CCR 5 /CXCR 4.

It is the target of a number of antibodies in animal studies, which are called CD 4 -blockers. However, the mechanism by which the <b>virus</b> <b>shields</b> itself from such antibody responses is not known. Here, we determined the crystal structure of R 53 in complex with its epitope peptide using a novel anti-C 4 rabbit monoclonal antibody R 53. Our data show that although the epitope of R 53 covers a highly conserved sequence (433) AMYAPPI(439), it is in the gp 120 trimer and in the CD 4 -bound conformation. Our results suggest a masking mechanism to explain how HIV- 1 protects this critical region from the human immune system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — While {{technology}} {{advances have}} brought many benefits to society {{there have also}} been technological abuses. In today's generation, {{with the help of the}} Internet and the rapid growth of the personal computer in the average household, we are able to talk to and share information with people from all sides of the globe. Unfortunately this transformation of data has opened the doors for a new era of high tech crime- the computer virus. The Internet is now a complex gateway for transgression and immoral activities where often the perpetrators of the crime are far removed from the scene of the criminal activity and hidden behind maze of double speak. Today a properly engineered virus can have a devastating effect on the Worldwide Internet showing just how sophisticated and interconnected human beings have become. For example, the Melissa Virus, which became a global phenomenon in March 1999, was so powerful that it forced Microsoft and a number of other very large companies to completely turn off their e-mail systems until the virus could be contained. Viruses have also provided a weapon for those members of society who wish to harm others for a variety of reasons. As technology is proceeding, programmers are recurrently creating <b>virus</b> <b>shielding</b> software with live updates and enhanced fortification for the most recent viruses. However, the virus protection software’s can not always offer 100 percent protection from all the dangerous and insecure material on the Internet. In conclusion, we can only be assiduous in our use of the World Wide Web and hope to turn clear from these perilous prevailing vulnerabilities...|$|R

40|$|Oligomannosides prevalently {{exist as}} cell surface antigens. They play {{important}} roles in diseases such as viral infection and cancer, {{and they have been}} shown to be useful as candidates for vaccines. HIV, one of the most devastating modern diseases, has a high content of mannose sugars on its envelope glycoprotein gp 120. Oligomannosides of the HIV virus, also called Man 9, which are found on the glycoprotein gp 120, have been shown to play a protective role for the HIV <b>virus,</b> <b>shielding</b> highly conserved protein domains of gp 120 from proteolytic attacks. Thus gp 120 plays an important role in HIV infection of cells, being responsible for the attachment and penetration of cells to be infected and is thus the target for immunotherapy or vaccine development. The synthesis of complex oligomannosides is still very challenging as numerous methods have been reported but not all are very reproducible. The use of sonication as a new methodology tool for the synthesis of oligomannosides was investigated. A convenient sonication-mediated protocol applicable to glycosylation was developed. The synthesis of oligomannosides such as Man 3, Man 6, and Man 9, was achieved under sonication conditions. The use of less reactive or so-called 2 ̆ 2 disarmed 2 ̆ 2 mannopyranosyl donors, such as acyl and thiophenyl donors, was investigated and interestingly the results gave good yields. These disarmed donors are easy to synthesize but it is difficult to perform glycosylation using traditional methods (low yields and longer reaction time). A fast and convenient method for the synthesis of this compound will be very beneficial in this field. Also, the investigation of the solid phase synthesis of carbohydrates under sonication conditions was conducted and the preliminary results were good. The research investigated a new methodology for the synthesis of complex oligomannosides and oligosaccharides in general and also to improve the glycosylation process where necessary by using sonication methodology and thus establishing an accessible route for the solid phase synthesis of these compounds...|$|R

2500|$|Glycosylation is {{the process}} by which a {{carbohydrate}} is covalently attached to a target macromolecule, typically proteins and lipids. [...] This modification serves various functions. [...] For instance, some proteins do not fold correctly unless they are glycosylated. [...] In other cases, proteins are not stable unless they contain oligosaccharides linked at the amide nitrogen of certain asparagine. The influence of glycosylation on the folding and stability of glycoprotein is twofold. Firstly, the highly soluble glycans may have a direct physicochemical stabilisation effect. Secondly, N-linked glycan mediate a critical quality control check point in glycoprotein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Glycosylation also plays a role in cell-cell adhesion (a mechanism employed by cells of the immune system) via sugar-binding proteins called lectins, which recognize specific carbohydrate moieties. Glycosylation is an important parameter in the optimization of many glycoprotein-based drugs such as monoclonal antibodies. Glycosylation also underpins the ABO blood group system. It is {{the presence or absence of}} glycosyltransferases which dictates which blood group antigens are presented and hence what antibody specificities are exhibited. This immunological role may well have driven the diversification of glycan heterogeneity and creates a barrier to zoonotic transmission of viruses. [...] In addition, glycosylation is often used by <b>viruses</b> to <b>shield</b> the underlying viral protein from immune recognition. A significant example is the dense glycan shield of the envelope spike of the human immunodeficiency virus.|$|R

40|$|Hawaii virus (HV), from a 1971 family {{outbreak}} of gastroenteritis, is serotypically distinct from Norwalk virus (NV), recently {{identified as a}} human calicivirus by molecular analysis, About 2600 consecutive nucleotides of the HV genome (including those encoding the viral capsid pro-tein) {{and part of the}} polymerase region of three other viruses (MDV 1, MDV 6, and SV 7) were sequenced, Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the capsid protein of HV with NV and other human caliciviruses (Toronto virus [TV 24], Desert <b>Shield</b> <b>virus</b> [DSV 395], and Southamp-ton virus [SHY]) demonstrated the existence of two major genetic groups (genogroups) typified by HV and NV.

In addition, comparison of part of the polymerase protein of HV with other human caliciviruses also showed that there were these two genogroups. The large genetic diversity between the capsid sequence of HV and NV is consistent with their serotypic distinctiveness.

40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} A viruses (IAV) {{originate from}} pandemic IAV and have undergone changes in antigenic structure, including addition of glycans to the viral hemagglutinin (HA). Glycans {{on the head}} of HA promote <b>virus</b> survival by <b>shielding</b> antigenic sites, but highly glycosylated seasonal IAV are inactivated by soluble lectins of the innate immune system. In 2009, human strains of pandemic H 1 N 1 [A(H 1 N 1) pdm] expressed a single glycosylation site (Asn(104)) {{on the head of}} HA. Since then, variants with additional glycosylation sites have been detected, and the location of these sites has been distinct to those of recent seasonal H 1 N 1 strains. We have compared wild-type and reverse-engineered A(H 1 N 1) pdm IAV with differing potential glycosylation sites on HA for sensitivity to collectins and to neutralizing Abs. Addition of a glycan (Asn(136)) to A(H 1 N 1) pdm HA was associated with resistance to neutralizing Abs but did not increase sensitivity to collectins. Moreover, variants expressing Asn(136) showed enhanced growth in A(H 1 N 1) pdm-vaccinated mice, consistent with evasion of Ab-mediated immunity in vivo. Thus, a fine balance exists regarding the optimal pattern of HA glycosylation to facilitate evasion of Ab-mediated immunity while maintaining resistance to lectin-mediated defenses of the innate immune system.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) {{glycoprotein}} C (gC) blocks complement activation, and glycoprotein E (gE) {{interferes with}} IgG Fc-mediated activities. While evaluating gC- and gE-mediated immune evasion in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) -HSV- 1 -coinfected subjects, we noted that antibody alone was more effective at neutralizing a strain with mutations in gC and gE (gC/gE) than a wild-type (WT) virus. This result was unexpected since gC and gE are postulated to interfere with complement-mediated neutralization. We used pooled human immunoglobulin G (IgG) from HIV-negative donors to confirm the results and evaluated mechanisms of the enhanced antibody neutralization. We demonstrated that differences in antibody neutralization cannot {{be attributed to the}} concentrations of HSV- 1 glycoproteins on the two viruses or to the absence of an IgG Fc receptor on the gC/gE mutant virus or to enhanced neutralization of the mutant virus by antibodies that target only gB, gD, or gH/gL, which are the glycoproteins involved in virus entry. Since sera from HIV-infected subjects and pooled human IgG contain antibodies against multiple glycoproteins, we determined whether differences in neutralization become apparent when antibodies to gB, gD, or gH/gL are used in combination. Neutralization of the gC/gE mutant was greatly increased compared that of WT virus when any two of the antibodies against gB, gD, or gH/gL were used in combination. These results suggest that gC and gE on WT <b>virus</b> provide a <b>shield</b> against neutralizing antibodies that interfere with gB-gD, gB-gH/gL, or gD-gH/gL interactions and that one function of virus neutralization is to prevent interactions between these glycoproteins...|$|R

40|$|Influenza A is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} respiratory virus whose surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) constantly obtains mutations at its five antigenic sites. These mutations occasionally lead to acquisition of new N-linked glycosylation sites that may alter the antigenicity and virulence of influenza <b>virus</b> by <b>shielding</b> the major antigenic epitopes. Glycosylation sites 71, 142, 144, 172, 177 and 179 {{have occurred in the}} HA globular head of the natural seasonal H 1 N 1 influenza A strains and become fixed over time. The immunomodulatory role of these single and multiple additional N-linked glycosylation sites in the recombinant pandemic A/Netherlands/ 602 / 09 H 1 N 1 (rWT) background was assessed. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays were performed with mouse and ferret antisera to evaluate the effect of these additional glycosylations on the breadth of humoral immune response. Poor HI activity was observed with antisera from mice infected with the rWT and the recombinant virus glycosylated at site 144 against 14 natural seasonal H 1 N 1 isolates that occupy variable glycosylations and are antigenically distant from the pandemic strain. It was shown that mouse antisera elicited by viruses containing an additional glycosylation at site 144 or 144 - 172 were capable of cross-reacting with the rWT and a panel of recombinant mutant viruses with single or multiple additional glycosylations. Conversely, antiserum from mice infected with the rWT had a considerable loss in cross-reactivity against the viruses glycosylated at sites 144 or 144 - 172. However, antisera from ferrets infected with the 144 -glycosylated or 144 - 172 -glycosylated viruses showed narrowed cross-reactivity against a panel of glycosylation mutant viruses and were not capable of neutralising the rWT, as measured by microneutralisation assays. Based on the observations with mouse antisera, most of the polyclonal activity seems to be directed against the antigenic site Sa, efficiently masked by glycosylation at site 144. This alters the antigenicity of the 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 virus by redirecting the focus of polyclonal response to multiple sites around the site Sa. The broad cross-reactivity was shown to be unique to site 144, since the breadth of polyclonal response elicited by other mutant viruses with single or multiple glycosylation sites was narrowed below homologous titres, having no activity against the viruses containing the site 144. Broadening the humoral immune response by incorporation of additional glycosylation sites provides an approach for universal, broadly reactive influenza vaccines. However, further validation is warranted in both animal models.

40|$|AbstractIdentifying the {{earliest}} neutralizing antibody specificities that are elicited following infection or vaccination by HIV- 1 {{is an important}} objective of current HIV/AIDS vaccine research. We have shown previously that transplantation of HIV- 1 V 3 epitopes into an HIV- 2 envelope (Env) scaffold provides a sensitive and specific means to detect and quantify HIV- 1 V 3 epitope specific neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in human sera. Here, we employ this HIV- 2 /HIV- 1 V 3 scaffolding strategy to study the kinetics of development and breadth of V 3 -specific Nabs in longitudinal sera from individuals acutely infected with clade C or clade B HIV- 1 and in human subjects immunized with clade B HIV- 1 immunogens. HIV- 2 /HIV- 1 chimeras containing V 3 sequences matched to virus type (HIV- 2 or HIV- 1), subtype (clade B or C), or strain (autologous or heterologous) were used as test reagents. We found that by 3 – 8  weeks post infection, 12 of 14 clade C subjects had a median IC 50 V 3 -specific Nab titer of 1 : 700 against chimeric viruses containing a heterologous clade C V 3. By 5  months post-infection, all 14 subjects were positive for V 3 -specific Nabs with median titers of 1 : 8000 against heterologous clade C V 3 and 1 : 1300 against clade B V 3. Two acutely infected clade B patients developed heterologous clade B V 3 -specific Nabs at titers of 1 : 300 and 1 : 1800 by 13  weeks of infection and 1 : 5000 and 1 : 11000 by 7  months of infection. Titers were not different against chimeras containing autologous clade B V 3 sequences. Each of 10 uninfected normal human volunteers who were immunized with clade B HIV- 1 Env immunogens, but none of five sham immunized control subjects, developed V 3 -specific Nabs titers as high as 1 : 3000 (median 1 : 1300; range 1 : 700 – 1 : 3000).
