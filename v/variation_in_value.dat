5000|$|Homogeneity {{tests for}} CRMs follow planned {{experimental}} designs. Because the experiment {{is intended to}} test for (or estimate the size of) <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> between different CRM units, the designs are chosen to allow separation of variation in results due to random measurement error and variation due to differences between units of the CRM. Among the simplest designs recommended for this purpose is a simple balanced nested design (see schematic). [...] Typically 10-30 CRM units are taken from the batch at random; stratified random sampling is recommended so that the selected units are spread across the batch. An equal number of subsamples (usually two or three) is then taken from each CRM unit and measured. Subsamples are measured in random order. Other designs, such as randomized block designs, have also been used for CRM certification.|$|E

And, is it feasible to use the value information obtained for specific sites and/or activities to estimate the benefits of improving marine water quality? The literature establishes that some measures of pollution reduce the values of trips to beaches and that improved fishing success is valued by recreational anglers. However, there is substantial <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> measures across studies. Welfare estimates can be sensitive to model specification and estimation. In the case of marine recreational fishing, the links between pollution control policy and the attributes of the activity that people value (catch rate) have not been established.

The results indicate a systematic <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> of walk time in different physical environments and it is more dependent of the physical environment for women than for men. This paper thereby contributes to the literature by showing that results by social sciences can be verified using methods and theories traditionally used in transport and welfare analysis and may therefore be incorporated in standard CBA. A contribution of this study is the insight that the perception of insecurity involved in accessing the public transport system is a welfare loss that can be quantified...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} specicity in {{linguistics}} is notoriously non-specic. We con-sider here various distinctions {{within the realm}} of noun phrase semantics that are relevant to specicity. The common thread uniting these distinc-tions is the notion of <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> assignments for the variable in-troduced by the noun phrase. The distinctions concern the nature of the variation involved. The rst part of the paper (Section 2) is devoted to the de nite/indenite divide and proposes a dynamic parameter of 'determinacy of reference ' which attempts to capture what is common to uniqueness and familiarity approaches to deniteness. Section 3 is devoted to a typology of indenites in terms of constraints imposed on evaluation properties of the variable they introduce. Based on properties of special indenites dis-cussed in the literature on Hungarian, Lillooet Salish and English, I argue that a constraint based account of special indenites is to be preferred over ambiguity-based approaches. 1...|$|E

40|$|This study uses {{comparative}} {{data from the}} European Social Survey to investigate the influence of self-transcendence and conservation values on {{public support for the}} welfare state. The results firstly show that these value dimensions are strongly related to welfare state support in the majority of the countries investigated. The main contribution of this study however, is that it evidences striking differences between countries regarding which values drive welfare attitudes, and the strength of the association between values and attitudes. Moreover, we show that the between-country <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> effects is systematically related to contextual factors. Self transcendence values are found to be a strong predictor of welfare state support in countries with high levels of social expenditure. In the less generous welfare states of Eastern Europe, the effects of self-transcendence values are weaker or absent. In Eastern European countries, conservation rather than self-transcendence values drive attitudes to the welfare state. Outspoken cohort differences in value effects in Eastern European countries as well as persisting differences between East and West Germany confirm our interpretation that the particular Eastern European pattern can be ascribed to the unique experiences of ‘authoritarian egalitarianism’ under communism. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Coral reefs {{are highly}} {{productive}} ecosystems {{that provide a}} variety of valuable goods and services, including recreational opportunities. The open-access nature and public good characteristics of coral reefs often result in them being undervalued in decision making related to their use and conservation. In response to this, there now exists a substantial economic valuation literature on coral reefs. For the purposes of conducting a meta-analysis of this literature, we collected 166 coral reef valuation studies, 52 of which provided sufficient information for a statistical meta-analysis, yielding 100 separate value observations in total. Focusing on recreational values, we use US $ per visit {{as the dependent variable}} in our meta-analysis. The meta-regression results reveal a number of important factors in explaining variation in coral reef recreational values, notably the area of dive sites and the number of visitors. Different valuation methods are shown to produce widely different values, with the contingent valuation method producing signifi-cantly lower value estimates. Using a multi-level modelling approach we also control for authorship effects, which proves to be highly significant in explaining <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>value</b> estimates. We assess the prospects for using this analysis for out-of-sample value trans-fer, and find average transfer errors of 186 %.
