5|$|In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation's film {{regulatory}} body, was established. An {{adjunct to}} the federal Ministry of Information and National Guidance, it {{grew out of the}} Ministry's <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> arm. The SFA's duties included overseeing the importation, distribution and censorship of movies in the country. It later also oversaw the production of both long and short films. Most of the imported films were brought in from Egypt, Italy, the Soviet Union and East Germany. To facilitate processing and post-production, the SFA also forged a working partnership with British Films LTD, a British movie company. From 1979 to 1983, the Somali film producer and director Ali Said Hassan served as the SFA's representative in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{training}} period was for six weeks; {{later it was}} changed to eight weeks. General in scope, the program was designed to give cadets an overall view of the USCG. Academic study included: administration, correspondence, communications, history, organization, personnel, public speaking, ships, and special lectures and <b>visual</b> <b>aids.</b> The regimental part of {{the training}} was designed to help cadets adjust to military life, and to acquaint them with their responsibilities as officers.

40|$|Orthographic {{projection}} drawings are {{the primary}} communication media of engineers, architects and other designers. While learning how to create this type of drawing, students often struggle in correctly placing the individual views of the object within the orthographic layout so that the drawing can convey its full meaning. In this study a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> based on a bowl was added to a unit on orthographic drawing to find whether students found this alternative <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> helpful. It was found that many students in this investigation responded positively to the Bowl <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> with some reporting it more helpful than the hinged glass box <b>visual</b> <b>aid.</b> It was also found {{that many of the}} students who found this alternative <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> helpful predominantly shared two common spatial visualization deficiencies that were easy to identify with simple spatial visualization pre-tests.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} an experiment conducted to measure human's haptic sensitivity {{and the effects}} of haptic training with and without <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> on a needle insertion task. The haptic training protocol consisted of a needle insertion task using dual-layer silicon samples. A <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> was provided as a multimodal cue for haptic perception. Results show that for a novices' group, training with a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> inhibited haptic perception. Hence, haptic skills must be trained differently from visuo-motor skills...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{developed}} a new slide-show type <b>visual</b> <b>aid,</b> in which five-photographs of two plants（Veronica persicaand Lamium purpureum ）and an anthropod（Armadillidium vulgare ）are presented {{in the order of}} decreasing magnification. Our new <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> was used in science class to one experimental group of third graders at a public elementary school. Theconventional photographs taken from a textbook were used to the other control group of the same grades. The results fromquestionnaires against pupils and analysis of protocol in the science class revealed the following four points. 1 ） Our new visualaid grew pupils wills to learn much more about plants and insects. 2 ） The sketches of pupils became finer, as such leaf hairsand veins were depicted, after the lecture using our new <b>visual</b> <b>aid.</b> 3 ） The talks of pupils are scientific in the experimentalgroup, while those are based on their experiences in the control group. 4 ） Almost all pupils in the experimental group thoughtthat our new <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> is useful to them, because pupils pointed out our <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> is easy to understand and our new visualaid is attractive with the first experience in their life. It is thus suggested that our new <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> is an effective teaching toolfor pupils to learn how to observe plants and insects...|$|R
5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by any group of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The reading is accompanied by <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> {{in the form of the}} symbolic foods on the Passover Seder Plate. A festive meal is part of the ritual. While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem was}} navigation. As night-flying aids {{in a day}} fighter were rudimentary, an {{elaborate}} system of <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> to navigation had to be established, encompassing light beacons, searchlight patterns, flak guns firing combinations of various tracer colours through the clouds and parachute flares. To {{make up for the}} lack of <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at night. Another navigation aid was simply the Allied bombing target; a city illuminated as it burned would guide the fighters to their target.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} that consumers could differentiate between levels of claims and clarify how a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> influences consumer understanding of the different claim levels. We interviewed 2, 000 consumers in 13 shopping malls on their perception of and confidence in different levels of health claims using seven point scales. The average confidence scores given by participants were 4. 17 for the probable level and 4. 07 for the possible level; the score for the probable level {{was significantly higher than}} that for the possible level (P < 0. 05). Scores for confidence in claims after reading labels with and without a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> were 5. 27 and 4. 43, respectively; the score for labeling with a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> was significantly higher than for labeling without a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> (P < 0. 01). Our results provide compelling evidence that providing health claims with qualifying language differentiating levels of scientific evidence can help consumers understand the strength of scientific evidence behind those claims. Moreover, when a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> was included, consumers perceived the scientific levels more clearly and had greater confidence in their meanings than when a <b>visual</b> <b>aid</b> was not included. Although this result suggests that consumers react differently to different claim levels, it is not yet clear whether consumers understand the variations in the degree of scientific support...|$|R

25|$|Studies {{indicate}} that children carrying the disease genotype benefit from presymptomatic counseling {{in order to}} prepare for the physical and social implications associated with progressive vision loss. While the psychological prognosis can be slightly alleviated with active counseling the physical implications and progression of the disease depend largely on the age of initial symptom manifestation and the rate of photoreceptor degradation, rather than access to prospective treatments. Corrective <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> and personalized vision therapy provided by Low Vision Specialists may help patients correct slight disturbances in visual acuity and optimize their remaining visual field. Support groups, vision insurance, and lifestyle therapy are additional useful tools for those managing progressive visual decline.|$|E
25|$|In 610 {{after the}} Sui dynasty (581–618) united a {{politically}} divided China, Emperor Yang of Sui {{had all the}} empire's commanderies prepare gazetteers called 'maps and treatises' (Chinese: tujing) so that {{a vast amount of}} updated textual and visual information on local roads, rivers, canals, and landmarks could be utilized by the central government to maintain control and provide better security. Although the earliest extant Chinese maps date to the 4th century BC, and tujing since the Qin (221–206 BC) or Han dynasties, this was the first known instance in China when the textual information of tujing became the primary element over the drawn illustrations. This Sui dynasty process of providing maps and <b>visual</b> <b>aids</b> in written gazetteers—as well as the submitting of gazetteers with illustrative maps by local administrations to the central government—was continued in every subsequent Chinese dynasty.|$|E

The Mediterranean theatre's troop carrying aircraft had been drawn down by the requirements of OVERLORD, and the XII Troop Carrier Command (Provisional) had been disbanded. All that remained was the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, albeit at full strength following the return of a detachment from China Burma India Theater. General Eisenhower agreed to send the 50th Troop Carrier Wing and 53rd Troop Carrier Wing {{with a total of}} 416 aircraft. In addition, 12 pathfinder planes were sent, bringing with them radar and <b>visual</b> <b>aids,</b> and pathfinder teams from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. The planes flew from the United Kingdom to Italy via Gibraltar or Marrakech and moved to recently captured airfields in the Rome area. They brought with them 225 glider pilots. To provide co-pilots for the gliders, another 375 despatched by the Air Transport Command. Only about 140 gliders were on hand, but the US War Department agreed to ship another 350 on the next convoy. They had to be given special priority in order to clear the congested port of Naples, but by 9 August, 327 gliders had been delivered and assembled.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to visual effects, {{other forms of}} physical effects were produced. In [...] "Hero", there was a scene where the camera appeared to be shot from inside a water tank. Instead, a water tank was placed between the camera and the actors, where Alka-Seltzer was placed at the bottom to simulate bubbles. Wood previously used this technique in the first-season episode [...] "Requiem" [...] {{as well as in}} Stargate Atlantis. The Adjuster comic books {{at the end of the}} episode were designed by artists who occasionally work for DC Comics. Dunne wore a mullet and a white eye contact lens in [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] for Will's alternate self in a dystopian future. The vampire squid-related effects for [...] "Next Tuesday" [...] were made possible by <b>visual</b> <b>aids.</b> For the shots where the squid swims on the water surface, the production crew used a radio-controlled boat to mimic a wake. When the squid erupts from the water, they placed a beach ball underwater and released it to mimic the splash. To make the helicopter sway during the battles between the squid and sea scorpion, an air pump was placed below it. However, doing so added the side effect of strong currents, proving difficult for the cast to swim towards the helicopter.|$|E
