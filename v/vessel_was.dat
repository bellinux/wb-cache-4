5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> set on fire at about 3 am {{to prevent it from}} falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E

In June 1973, the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on Guamblin Island, accidentally releasing 30,000 tons of oil. After the rescue of the crew, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters {{in an effort to}} burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> {{captured by the}} Italians and served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, she was scuttled by her crew as she had insufficient fuel on board to reach an Allied port.|$|E
5|$|El Sol {{settled on}} the bottom at a 45° angle with only the tops of her masts {{protruding}} above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag—a blue house flag with a red M inside a white star—still fluttered in the breeze.

50|$|If a <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> adrift and {{not being}} {{propelled}} by any instrument or device, {{it is said to}} be underway, not making way. The concept of whether a <b>vessel</b> <b>is,</b> or is not, underway has important legal ramifications. For example, in many jurisdictions a child must be wearing a personal flotation device at the time the <b>vessel</b> <b>is</b> underway.|$|R
5|$|Emerald {{was between}} St Lucia and Martinique on 24 June, when she {{captured}} the 16-gun French privateer Enfant Prodigue after a 72-hour chase.

The Royal Navy took Enfant Prodigue into service as HMS St Lucia.|$|E
5|$|MF Skarnsund II was {{the same}} size as Ytterøy, had placed for 30 cars and was bi-directional. She cost NOK27 million and was in service from 1987 to 1991, when she was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK23 million. The 330tonne <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> built by Trønderverftet.|$|E
5|$|Nerpa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Komsomolsk-on-Amur {{shipyard}} in 1993, but its completion was delayed {{for nearly a decade}} {{due to a lack of}} funds caused by the economic crisis of the early 1990s. The partly constructed <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> mothballed until 2004, when Rosprom (the Federal Agency for Industry) signed an agreement with the Indian government to complete the submarine and lease it to the Indian Navy. The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> intended to be completed by 2007, but underwent further delays. In 2007, it was transferred to the Vostok shipyard in the closed city of Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai, for fitting-out. It was launched in October 2008 for sea trials, following which it was due to be handed over to the Russian Defence Ministry. Reports in the Indian media suggest that the resumption of construction was underwritten with Indian funding.|$|E

5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station <b>Vessel,</b> <b>was</b> a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E
5|$|After her {{delivery}} to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), George Washington {{was used to}} transport 250 members of the American Legion to France as guests of the French Government in 1921. The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> then reconditioned by USSB for transatlantic service, and chartered by the U.S. Mail Steamship Company, for whom she made one voyage to Europe in March 1921. The company {{was taken over by}} the government August 1921 and its name changed to the United States Lines. In 1930, she transported the first group of American Gold Star Mothers to France to visit the graves of their sons. George Washington served the Line on the transatlantic route until 1931 when she was laid up in the Patuxent River, Maryland.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as the V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea. They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action. In 1915, the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse {{was used as a}} depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that Caprivi began {{ordering}} new protected cruisers, he also authorized the construction of smaller unprotected cruisers for use in Germany's overseas colonies. The first of these, the , were laid down in 1886 and 1887. A further six vessels of the , which were improved versions that were larger and faster than their predecessors, followed over the next five years. A final, much larger <b>vessel,</b> , <b>was</b> laid down in 1892; her design was based on contemporary protected cruisers like Kaiserin Augusta. She represented another attempt to merge the colonial cruiser and fleet scout, which was unsuccessful. As a result, the German naval designers began work on the , which provided the basis for all future German light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Built by Blohm & Voss {{at their}} yard in Hamburg, Derfflingers keel was laid in January 1912. She {{was to have}} been {{launched}} on 14 June 1913, but the wooden sledges upon which the ship rested became jammed; the ship moved only 30–40 centimeters. A second attempt was successful on 12 July 1913. A crew composed of dockyard workers took the ship around the Skagen to Kiel. In late October, the <b>vessel</b> <b>was</b> assigned to the I Scouting Group, but damage to the ship's turbines during trials prevented her from joining the unit until 16 November.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vessels</b> <b>were</b> {{built by}} the Azovskiy Shipyard, Rybinsk Shipyard and Vladivostok Shipyard.
