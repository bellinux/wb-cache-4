40|$|Abstract Background The {{demand for}} {{complementary}} medicine (CM) is growing worldwide {{and so is}} the supply. So far, there is not much insight in the activities in Dutch CM practices nor in how these activities differ from mainstream general practice. Comparisons on diagnoses and <b>visit</b> <b>length</b> can offer an impression of how Dutch CM practices operate. Methods Three groups of regularly trained physicians specialized in CM participated in this study: 16 homeopathic physicians, 13 physician acupuncturists and 11 naturopathy physicians. Every CM physician was asked to include a maximum of 75 new patients within a period of six months. For each patient an inclusion registration form had to be completed and the activities during a maximum of five repeat visits were subsequently registered. Registrations included patient characteristics, diagnoses and <b>visit</b> <b>length.</b> These data could be compared with similar data from general practitioners (GPs) participating in the second Dutch national study in general practice (DNSGP- 2). Differences between CM practices and between CM and mainstream GP data were tested using multilevel regression analysis. Results The CM physicians registered activities in a total of 5919 visits in 1839 patients. In all types of CM practices general problems (as coded in the ICPC) were diagnosed more often than in mainstream general practice, especially fatigue, allergic reactions and infections. Psychological problems and problems with the nervous system were also diagnosed more frequently. In addition, each type of CM physician encountered specific health problems: in acupuncture problems with the musculoskeletal system prevailed, in homeopathy skin problems and in naturopathy gastrointestinal problems. Comparisons in <b>visit</b> <b>length</b> revealed that CM physicians spent at least twice as much time with patients compared to mainstream GPs. Conclusions CM physicians differed from mainstream GPs in diagnoses, partly related to general and partly to specific diagnoses. Between CM practices differences were found on specific domains of complaints. <b>Visit</b> <b>length</b> was much longer in CM practices compared to mainstream GP visits, and such ample time {{may be one of the}} attractive features of CM for patients. </p...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the applicability and usefulness of a scale to measure the presence and extent of shared {{decision making}} in clinical decisions in psychiatric practice. Methods: A coding scheme assessing shared decision making in general medical settings was adapted to mental health settings, and a manual for using the scheme was created. Trained raters used the adapted scale to analyze 170 audio-recordings of medication check-up visits with either psychiatrists or nurse practitioners. The scale assessed the level of shared decision making based on the presence of nine specific elements. Interrater reliability was examined, and the frequency with which elements of shared decision making were observed was documented. The association between <b>visit</b> <b>length</b> and extent of shared decision making was also examined. Results: Interrater reliability among three raters on a subset of 20 recordings ranged from 67 % to 100 % agreement for the presence of each of the nine elements of shared decision making and 100 % for the agreement between provider and consumer on decisions made. Of the 170 sessions, 128 (75 %) included a clinical decision. Just over half of the decisions (53 %) met minimum criteria for shared decision making.

Collectively, the three hornbill species consumed fruits from 59 tree and liana species, and likely provided dispersal for 56 of them. Hornbill-dispersed tree species composed 22 % of the known tree flora of the site. Hornbill <b>visit</b> <b>lengths,</b> <b>visit</b> frequencies, and seed passage times indicated that few seeds were deposited beneath parent trees; in five hornbill/tree species pairings studied, 69 – 100 % of the seeds ingested were deposited away from the parent trees. Germination trials showed that hornbill gut passage is gentle on seeds. Of 24 tree species tested, 23 germinated after passage by hornbills; of 17 planted with controls taken directly from trees, only four species showed evidence of inhibition of germination rate, while seven experienced unchanged germination rates and six experienced enhanced germination rates. Results suggested that Ceratogymna hornbills rank among the most important seed dispersers found in Afrotropical forests, and they deserve increased conservation attention.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during autumn 2014. A sample of 540 patients who referred to the outpatient clinics of Sheikh Al Raeis of Tabriz Province (North West of Iran) were randomly selected and surveyed. Data were collected by the collection tools and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: The average visit time and standard deviation were 8. 52 min and 3. 14 respectively, which is significantly lower than the minimum average of 15 min approved by the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Educations (MOHME). Average of waiting time was 101. 57 min for patients.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Characteristics of patients (n = 209), families (n = 149), and ICU workers (n = 43) were collected. ICU workers reported their perceptions of unrestricted visitation, and family members completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Daily severity scores (Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Logistic Organ Failure) and a workload score (Nine Equivalents of Nursing Manpower) were computed. Maximum median <b>visit</b> <b>length</b> was 120 mins per patient per day and occurred on days 4 and 5. No correlations were found among severity of illness, workload, and <b>visit</b> <b>length.</b> For 115 patients, both nurse and physician questionnaires were available; although several differences were noted, neither nurses nor physicians perceived open visitation as disrupting patient care. The median rating for delay in organizing care was "never" for physicians and "occasionally" for nurses. Nurses perceived more disorganization of care than physicians (p =. 008).

To understand this interaction, we observed 16 Well Child Visits with 8 families and 2 pediatricians over the course of 3 months, conducted interviews and a focus group with parents and pediatricians, and surveyed 43 parents. We discuss the fundamentals of the visits, including <b>visit</b> <b>length</b> and wait times, topics discussed, and the people involved. Our results show that parents and pediatricians perceive one another favorably, but there are still a number of tensions and inequalities which could be addressed by technology. We also provide a discussion of the major issues and design opportunities for interactive technology to improve pediatric care...|$|E
40|$|Both biotic and {{abiotic factors}} can affect soil quality, which can {{significantly}} impact plant growth, productivity, {{and resistance to}} pests. However, the effects of soil quality on the interactions of plants with beneficial arthropods, such as pollinators, have not been extensively examined. We studied the effects of vermicompost (earthworm compost, VC) soil amendment on behavioral and physiological responses of pollinators to flowers and floral resources, using cucumbers, Cucumis sativus, as our model system. Results from experiments conducted over three field seasons demonstrated that, {{in at least two}} out of three years, VC amendment significantly increased <b>visit</b> <b>length,</b> while reducing the time to first discovery. Bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) workers that fed on flowers from VC-amended plants had significantly larger and more active ovaries, a measure of nutritional quality. Pollen fractions of flowers from VC-grown plants had higher protein compared to those of plants grown in chemically fertilized potting soil. Nectar sugar content also tended to be higher in flowers from VC-grown plants, but differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, soil quality enhancement, as achieved with VC amendment in this study, can significantly affect plant-pollinator interactions and directly influences pollinator nutrition and overall performance...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects}} of Medicaid managed care (MMC) on obstetric service use and program costs in California. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Longitudinal administrative data on Medi-Cal enrollment and claims and encounters related to pregnancy and delivery services were gathered from three counties [...] two long-standing MMC counties and one traditional fee-for-service Medicaid county [...] in California between 1987 and 1992. STUDY DESIGN: We studied Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) beneficiaries with live singleton vaginal deliveries with associated hospital stays of 14 days or less. Effects of managed care were examined with respect to prenatal <b>visits,</b> <b>length</b> of stay for delivery, maternal postpartum readmission rates, and total program expenditures. Multivariate analyses examined how the relative effect of managed care on service use and program expenditures in each MMC county evolves over time in comparison to fee-for-service. We controlled for length of Medi-Cal enrollment prior to delivery, data censoring, and individual characteristics such as race and age. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Prenatal care use is consistently lower in the MMC counties, although all three counties' prenatal care provision is well below the national standard. Drastic increases in one-day-stay deliveries were found: up to almost 50 percent of deliveries in MMC counties were one-day stays. Program cost savings associated with MMC enrollment are unambiguous. CONCLUSIONS: MMC cost savings might have {{come at the expense of}} reduced provision of prenatal care and shorter delivery length of stay. Future studies should verify any possible causal link and the effects on maternal and infant health outcomes...|$|R

Using data on 295 {{patients}} entering Medicare home health care at discharge from Medicare hospital stays, we explain receipt of Medicare home health nursing, PT and OT <b>visits,</b> and <b>length</b> of stay. Care reflected need, but other factors also affected service allocation. Medicare program requirements, as well as variation in provider structure and case load, appear to introduce inequities. Critical in light of recurrent proposals to change Medicare coverage and benefits, findings underline the need to reconsider Medicare home health policies that lead to denial of needed services, inequitable allocation of benefits, and premature termination of care. peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{species have}} come to the {{forefront}} of conservation biology as a major threat to native biodiversity. Habitats dominated by shrub honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.) in the United States have been characterized as "ecological traps" by ecologists. Here we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of shrub honeysuckles on the nesting ecology of native birds in seven study sites in central Pennsylvania, USA. We examined how the abundance of shrub honeysuckles influenced the selection of nesting substrates and habitat for a community of common songbirds, and the parental-care behavior and nestling development of gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis). We found that birds had a strong bias towards nesting in honeysuckle shrubs, but not necessarily for nesting in honeysuckle-dominated habitats. Nest predation rates were affected by the density of nests in a habitat, but not by the overall abundance of honeysuckles in such habitats. Honeysuckle abundance in the habitat did show significant effects on some parental-care behavioral parameters: catbirds had higher nest visitation rates and shorter <b>visit</b> <b>lengths</b> in areas of high honeysuckle density. On average, Gray catbirds fed fruit 12 %± 0. 31 s. e. of their nestling-feeding bouts, mostly fruits of shrub honeysuckles. Nestlings in sites with high honeysuckle density also showed higher mass:tarsus ratios, suggesting a good (possibly better) physiological condition of catbird nestlings at the time of fledging. Our study shows that honeysuckle-dominated habitats could have equivocal effects on nesting parameters of common species of native birds. We advise more caution in the widespread denomination of novel plant communities with high densities of honeysuckle as "ecological traps" as effects can be null or positive on native birds in certain localities...|$|R
