40|$|Carrot (Dascus carota L.) {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{commonly}} used vegetables of human nutrition. It is rich in beta carotene, ascorbic acid, tocopherol and classified as <b>vitaminized</b> food. Combination of carrot juice and yoghurt produce a nutritionally balanced food. The aim of this study is to determine the best combination of carrot juice concentration and was fermentation duration. soyghurt was prepared in the laboratory scale production from soymilk and carrot juice was fermented with Streptococcus thermophillus and Lactobacillus bulgaris. Carrot soyghurt was prepared by blending soymilk with 10, 15 and 20 % carrot juice before fermentation 14, 16 and 18 hours.

40|$|Positive {{results were}} {{obtained}} when <b>vitaminized</b> peanut butter was fed in small doses of 4. 2 and 8. 4 I. U's. of vitamin A per rat daily. Body weight increases served as criteria. For the same peanut butter, on chemical tests an average value of 69 I. U's. of vitamin A per gram {{was found at}} {{the initial stages of}} the biological tests. The doses were calculated on the chemical findings and on this basis doses of 2. 1 I. U's were too small, whilst doses of 4. 2 I. U. were adequate; and doses of 8. 4 also allowed a small storage in the liver within 21 days of feeding. The above findings support the views of Goss and Guilbert (1939) who advocated a minimum level of vitamin daily of 18 - 22 I. U. per Kgm. weight in rats, which, calculated on the average weight of the rats in this experiment is equivalent to 2. 5 - 3. 9 I. U. vitamin A per dose per rat daily.

40|$|Solubility of ▫$alpha$▫-tocopherol in CO 2 and propane was {{determined}} at temperatures 303, 313, 333 and 353 K {{and over a}} pressure range from 79 to 286 bar for CO 2 and 16 to 112 bar for propane. A static-analytic method was applied. The solubility of ▫$alpha$▫-tocopherol in dense CO 2 under the conditions investigated was {{in the range of}} 0. 2 - 17. 0 mg/g CO 2. The maximal solubilities of ▫$alpha$▫-tocopherol in propane were approximately up to ten times higher than in CO 2 and were in the range from 38. 9 to 171. 9 mg/g propane. Phase equilibrium data for Milk Thistle seed oil in supercritical CO 2 were determined at temperatures 313, 333 and 353 K and pressures ranging from 100 to 300 bar. The oil was previously additionally <b>vitaminized</b> and contained 1. 9 wt. % of ▫$alpha$▫-tocopherol and 1. 7 wt. % of free fatty acids (FFA). The solubility of oil in CO 2 was in the range from 1. 3 to 17. 9 mg/g CO 2. The distribution coefficients of ▫$alpha$▫-tocopherol and FFA between light and heavy phase were determined on a solvent free basis. The obtained separation factors increased with temperature and pressure to approximately 160 - 200 bar and decreased with a further increase of pressure...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studiesl- 8 have {{provided}} {{evidence that the}} mineral content of a diet may affect its cariogenicity. It may have been such investigations as these which led Rozeik, Cremer, and Hannover 9 {{to consider the possibility}} that the minerals in the cacao bean might account for some of the results obtained in the Vipeholm experiments. ' 0 In these experiments the subjects who ate 8 toffees daily between meals over a 2 -year period had an increase in caries activity more than twice that of those who ate almost the same amount of sugar between meals in the form of milk chocolate. In experiments by Rozeik, Cremer, and Hannover on sialoadenectomized white rats, there was considerably less dental caries in the animals fed a diet containing cacao-bean ash than in those on the control diet. These observations led the authors to conclude that the ash of the cacao bean is caries-inhibitory. It should be noted, however, that there were several differences in the composition of the control and test diets, apart from the ash content of the latter. The control diet consisted of 200 gm. barley groats, 100 gm. fish meal, and 100 gm. powdered sugar. The test diet was composed of 100 gm. barley groats, 100 gm. fish meal, 100 gm. powdered sugar, 66 gm. <b>vitaminized</b> mar...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} devoted to the new technical facilities for food production, which technological chain of production process includes computer hardware {{as a part of the}} equipment used for body of semi-processed food preparation, blancher for hydrobionts and abrasive blender. For the whole group of the necessary equipment the principal schemes are designed, and the abrasive blender was tested during the experimental approbation to reveal the optimal design. The culinary fish pastes have already been produced in the enterprises in many countries for many years and they are particularly popular in Japan, Germany, Scandinavian and other country. In Poland the mixtures of fish pasted have become widely spread, and are used for production of portioned meals. These pastes may be blended into larger or smaller pieces. The aromatization process of such pastes is conducted with adding the liquid smoke, natural or synthetic fragrances. There is an increasing popularization of the use of flaxseed as a source of alpha-linoleic acid, high-quality protein, phenolics, fiber and minerals. Products with flax meal can be recommended for inclusion in the diet to make up for the deficit of polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary fiber. In this regard, it is appropriate to use the semi-finished product formulations for the respective housings extruded snack food. The results of the conducted research could be used in the production of domestic extruded snacks, which have the form of the cushions with <b>vitaminized</b> dough body and hydrobionts stuffing if setting the special extrusion modes...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{priority}} directions of state {{policy in the}} field of healthy food is the development and integration of enriched foodstuffs with an increased expiration date into production. The purpose of researches is the study of effect of bar processing on the periods of storage of boiled sausages enriched with vitamin premix. The test samples of boiled sausages were processed under the pressure of 800 MPa within 3 minutes at a temperature of 0 [...] . + 4 degrees C by means of a hydrostat {{after the end of the}} technological process. The control samples of boiled sausages were not processed under pressure. The safety of boiled sausages was estimated by organoleptic and microbiological indicators and pH, the content of vitamins in the product was researched in 8 and 16 days of storage. It has been established that in 16 days of storage the control samples of sausages did not conform to the requirements of regulating documentation; the shift of [...] to the alkaline side, the increase in the quantity of mesophilic aerobic and facultative and anaerobic microorganisms has been noted. After 16 days of storage the content of PP and C vitamins in the control samples of sausages authentically decreased by 17. 6 % and 93. 4 % while the decrease in the test samples was 4. 1 % and 12. 0 %. The antioxidant activity of test samples of sausages is authentically 71. 3 % higher than that of the control samples (0. 12 +/- 0. 04 mol equiv/dm(3)). Against a background of use of <b>vitaminized</b> sausages an authentic increase in the antioxidant activity of catalase and ceruloplasmin is noted in the blood of students of the test group. Thus, it is established that the processing of boiled sausages enriched with vitamins, under high pressure has a bactericidal effect on microbic cells, prevents proteolysis, saves vitamins and, respectively, increases the expiration date of a foodstuff. The calculations for design of a high pressure hydrostat for foodstuff processing have been performed...|$|E
