In 1993 he composed a Jewish requiem for victims of terror, Nishmat Tzedek (Soul of Righteousness). In 1995 he premiered an oratorio, [...] "Liberation: A Choral Symphony", commemorating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camps, at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. The performance featured the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the Los Angeles Master Chorale, and soloists.|$|E

40|$|The Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) can {{be defined}} as a {{methodology}} for the design of complex engineering systems where collaboration and abilities to mutually interacting between different disciplines are fundamental. In this thesis, Virtual Aircraft Design and Optimization fRamework (<b>VADOR),</b> a distributed, object-oriented, component-based framework enabling MDO practice at Bombardier Aerospace is introduced. The purpose of the <b>VADOR</b> framework is to enable the seamless integration of commercial and in-house analysis applications in a heterogeneous, distributed computing environment, and allow the management and sharing of the data. The <b>VADOR</b> distributed environment offers visibility to the process, permitting the teams to monitor progress or track changes in design projects and problems. Documentation of the MDO process is vital to ensure clear communication of the process within the team defining it and in the broader design team interacting with it. <b>VADOR</b> is implemented in Java, providing an object-oriented, platform-independent framework. The concepts of design pattern and component-based approach are used along with multi-tiered distributed design to deliver highly modular and flexible architecture.

The purpose of the <b>VADOR</b> framework is to enable the seamless integration of commercial and in-house analysis applications in a heterogeneous, distributed computing environment, and to allow the deployment of automatic design optimization algorithms based on the framework.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distribution and remote execution protocol for computationally intensive analysis applications. This protocol, {{developed in the}} context of the <b>VADOR</b> project, aims to encapsulate data transfers and remote execution of commercial and in-house applications used for aeronautic design optimization at Bombardier Aerospace. While a companion paper describes the overall framework architecture of the <b>VADOR</b> project, this paper concentrates on distribution aspects of applications involved in the analysis processes. Execution of analysis processes are mediated through a framework-specific execution server, that launches execution through the invocation of services provided by distributed CPU server machines. The CPU servers take care both of the data transfers involved in each invocation, and of the execution of the application. Data transfers are performed using standard tools and web-based protocol. Application execution and control, on the other hand, is taken in charge by custom “wrapper servers” running on each CPU. This paper discusses design considerations of the “wrapper servers”, which include the flexible and adaptable wrapping of legacy and commercial applications in use at Bombardier. The paper centers around communication issues between the execution and wrapper servers, and data transfer issues, which involve peer transfers servers at each end of the communication stream. Error handling and scalability will be specifically addressed {{in the context of}} the large-scale computations involved by the analysis processes. Security considerations will be discussed as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a modern {{airplane}} brings together many disciplines: structures, aerodynamics, controls, systems, propulsion with complex interdependencies and many variables. Recent aircraft programs, such as Bombardier’s Continental Jet program (Figure 1) use participants located {{around the world and}} selected for their cost, quality and delivery capability. These participants share the risk on the program and must therefore be fully implicated in the design. A big challenge is to provide information on current design configuration simultaneously to all disciplines and all participants in the appropriate format. Another challenge of multidisciplinary optimization is to bring together technologies and methodologies of various disciplines {{in a way that is}} both practical and inclusive of the expertise that must accompany these individual technologies. This paper discusses progress made to address these challenges, streamline the aircraft design process and implement multidisciplinary optimization in an effective manner [1]. Initiatives include: implementation of the Bombardier Engineering System (BES) and of an MDO software environment (<b>VADOR),</b> linking of aerodynamic and structural design and analysis codes, validation of advanced wing design methods and calibration of viscous flow analysis and drag prediction methods.

40|$|Several major {{earthquakes}} {{have affected}} El Salvador, Central America, during the Past 100 yr {{as a consequence}} of oblique subduction of the Cocos plate under the Caribbean plate, which is partitioned between trench-orthogonal compression and strike-slip defor- mation parallel to the volcanic arc. Focal mechanisms and the distribution of the most destructive earthquakes, together with geomorphologic evidence, suggest that this trans- current component of motion may be accommodated by a major strike-slip fault (El Sal- <b>vador</b> fault zone). We present field geological, structural, and geomorphological data col- lected in central El Salvador that allow the constraint of the kinematics and the Quaternary activity of this major seismogenic strike-slip fault system. Data suggest that the El Salvador fault zone consists of at least two main E-W fault segments (San Vicente and Berlin segments), with associated secondary synthetic (WNW-ESE) and antithetic (NNW-SSE) Riedel shears and NW-SE tensional structures. The two main fault segments overlap in a dextral en echelon style with the formation of an intervening pull-apart basin. Our original geological and geomorphologic data suggest a late Pleistocene–Holocene slip rate of 11 mm/yr along the Berlin segment, in contrast with low historical seismicity. The kinematics and rates of deformation suggested by our new data are consistent with models involving slip partitioning during oblique subduction, and support the notion that a trench-parallel component of motion between the Caribbean and Cocos plates is con- centrated along E-W dextral strike-slip faults parallel to the volcanic arc...|$|E
