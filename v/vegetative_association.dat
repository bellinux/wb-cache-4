30|$|A {{possible}} {{explanation of the}} absence of key groups of predominantly mangrove-associated gastropod species in both study areas in Dam Bay may be due to differences in the types of <b>vegetative</b> <b>associations</b> in Dam Bay and Nha Phu. In Dam Bay, the mangrove trees comprise small monospecific associations, while at Nha Phu the mangrove association has more complex vegetation structure, which is also much larger than both associations in Dam Bay and experiences a wider range of hydrological conditions. This confirms the statement of Macintosh et al. (2002) about the correlation between the diversity of mangrove vegetation and mangal-associated fauna.|$|R

40|$|Chromosome {{arrangement}} in spread nuclei of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied by fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} with probes to centromeres and telomeric chromosome regions. We found that during interphase centromeres are tightly clustered in a peripheral region of the nucleus, whereas telomeres tend to occupy the area outside the centromeric domain. In vigorously growing cultures, centromere clustering occurred in ∼ 90 % of cells and it appeared to be maintained throughout interphase. It was reduced when cells were kept under stationary conditions for an extended period. In meiosis, centromere clusters disintegrated before the emergence of the earliest precursors of the synaptonemal complex. Evidence for the contribution of centromere clustering to other aspects of suprachromosomal nuclear order, in particular the <b>vegetative</b> <b>association</b> of homologous chromosomes, is provided, and a possible supporting role in meiotic homology searching is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{mortality}} {{to wildlife}} due to prescribed fire {{is of concern}} to land managers using fire as a management tool. The ability of individual animals to escape fire {{is critical to the}} long-term survival of species inhabiting fire-maintained systems. Many wildlife species in Florida are both adapted to and dependent upon periodic fire to maintain suitable habitat (Myers and Ewel 1990. Ecosystems of Florida. University of Central Florida Press, Orlando, Florida. 765 pp.). However, species not adapted to survive in pyrogenic landscapes might suffer directly from fire-induced mortality; consequently fire might be a limiting factor. Long-term fire exclusion in many of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s forests, habitats that historically burned regularly under natural conditions (lightning ignition), have undergone shifts in vegetation composition, fuel loads (higher), and leaf litter accumulation (higher), essentially altering the <b>vegetative</b> <b>associations</b> (Myers and Ewel, op. cit.). Likewise, the suite of wildlife species that inhabit these systems might also shift over time (Myers and Ewel, op. cit.). We hypothesize that one such change could favor fossorial species that utilize the litter for cover and foraging. Without normal woodland fire return intervals, non-fire adapted species may be able to augment their populations to a 2 ̆ 2 pseudo-elevated 2 ̆ 2 status resulting in denser populations than were historically present. However, data concerning historical population levels of many species are often lacking and the documentation of wildlife mortality as a result of fire can be difficult...|$|R
40|$|Paleoecological sources {{indicate}} that the location and extent of Si- erra Nevada rangelands have varied significantly during the last 20, 000 years. Modern <b>vegetative</b> <b>associations</b> are recent, with mon- tane wet meadows appearing during the last 3, 000 years. A late Pleis- tocene sagebrush grassland existed where montane and subalpine forests occur today. In the central Sierra a pattern of deglaciation and vegetative response was repeated at different times depending on location, from alpine grassland to a diverse mixture of conifer and shrub species in an open forest structure. The Holocene began with a decline in mesic species and increased charcoal and oak pollen, indicating a warming trend. A cooler, wetter climate followed as mesic conifers reappeared and evidence of fire decreased. Historical accounts {{indicate that}} highly productive rangelands ex- isted when Europeans arrived. Large ungulate populations were present, and perennial grasses dominated foothill rangelands. Nu- merous observers reported severe overgrazing by livestock in the late 1800 s, {{due in part to}} a lack of regulation of the common range- lands. Livestock management contributed to annual grassland con- version on the west side and to juniper woodland expansion {{on the east side of}} the range. The abundance of a diverse assemblage of large grazing mam- mals at the end of the Pleistocene indicates that Sierra Nevada range- lands were highly adapted to intense grazing pressure and that animal disturbance was an integral part of this highly productive system. This evidence argues for a recognition that well-managed animal dis- turbance is as vital as well-managed fire to ecosystem health and sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the Study: I {{propose that}} water deficit {{is a factor}} that {{influences}} vegetation patterns. In order to investigate this hypothesis I located an especially diverse area of approximately 4 km 2 on Mt. Tamalpais where a mosaic of forest, grassland. chaparral and serpentine communities occur. Procedure: To test the hypothesis, vegetation and physical factor information was acquired. The vegetative mosaic was sampled with a plotless method. Cluster analysis of the vegetative structure, total vegetative cover, and floristics enabled associations to be defined. Predicted associations were deduced from these types and from the presence of tree saplings. The physical factors soil depth, porosity, topography, irradiance, wind, precipitation, cloudiness, temperature, humidity, presence of serpentine, and fire history were studied. Serpentine is a soil that is inhospitable to most plants. The variable, "water deficit," was derived as an overall measure of plant water relations. It {{is defined as the}} difference between the water needed by plants and the water that is available in the soil. The relationships between the factors and the <b>vegetative</b> <b>associations</b> were then quantified {{in the context of a}} model. Multiple regression and discriminant analysis were used to determine path coefficients in this model. Findings: No measures of water deficit were significant for distinguishing associations except as mechanisms for less abstract factors. The model could not be disproved; however, it should be revised to better account for the relationships. Amount of serpentine was the most prevalent factor for distinguishing the vegetative types. Factors distinguishing high serpentine vegetative types could not be studied because not enough of these sites were sampled...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze male gamete {{behavior}} from mature pollen to pollen tube {{growth in the}} bicellular pollen species Alstroemeria aurea. For mature pollen, pollen protoplasts were examined using flow cytometry. The protoplasts showed two peaks of DNA content at 1 C and 1. 90 C. Flow cytometry of pollen tubes at different developmental stages that were cultured in vitro revealed changes in the nuclear phase at 9 h and 18 h after culture. Sperm cell formation occurred at 6 – 9 h after culture, indicating that the first change {{was due to the}} division of the generative cells into sperm cells. After sperm cell formation, the number of <b>vegetative</b> nucleus <b>associations</b> with sperm cell showed a tendency to increase. The association was suggested as male germ unit. When sperm cells, vegetative nuclei, and partial male germ units were separately collected from pollen tubes cultured for 18 h and analyzed using a flow cytometer, the sperm cells and vegetative nuclei contained 1 C DNA, while the DNA content of partial male germ units was counted as 2 C. Therefore, the second change in the nuclear phase, which resulted in an increase in 2 C nuclei, was possibly related to the formation of male germ units...|$|R
40|$|Vegetative (noncohesive) D. discoideum {{cells and}} cells at several stages during the {{development}} of cohesiveness were fixed with glutaraldehyde, and their agglutinability by purified carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) from slime molds and plants was determined. The two purified lectins from D. discoideum, called discoidin I and II, were poor agglutinins of fixed vegetative D. discoideum cells and potent agglutinins of fixed cohesive D. discoideum cells. The increased agglutinability of D. discoideum cells by discoidin I or discoidin II with differentiation paralleled discoidin appearance in cell extracts and development of cohesiveness. The lectin of another slime mold, Polysphondylium pallidum (pallidin) and the lectin of Ricinus communis (RCA-I) were also more potent agglutinins of fixed differentiated D. discoideum cells than of fixed vegetative D. discoideum cells. However, wheat germ agglutinin was much more potent with fixed <b>vegetative</b> cells. The <b>association</b> constant (Ka) of discoidin I and discoidin II for fixed differentiated D. discoideum cells was {{in the range of}} 10 (9) M- 1, more than twenty-fold higher than the Ka of these lectins for fixed vegetative cells. The Ka of discoidin I and discoidin II for fixed differentiated P. pallidum cells was an order of magnitude lower than for fixed differentiated D. discoideum cells. The Ka of pallidin for fixed differentiated P. pallidum cells was about 4 X 10 (9) M- 1 and was an order of magnitude lower for fixed differentiated D. discoideum cells. Since previous studies showed that the lectin of each of these slime mold species is detectable on the surface of cohesive cells, the observation of species-specific receptors on the surface of cohesive cells suggests a basis for species-specific cohesion...|$|R
40|$|Subthreshold {{symptoms}} of depression (defined as symptoms that do not meet full criteria for the disorder) are a significant concern, associated {{with a range of}} behavioral and emotional problems, raising the risk of adolescents developing more severe depression later. Yet research on subthreshold depression is lacking, and the relationship between affective and somatic symptom improvement has not been adequately studied. Prior research with adult samples lend credence to the hypothesis that {{symptoms of}} mood/motivation respond faster to psychotherapy (Rush, Beck, Kovacs, Weissenburger, and Hollon, 1982) than pharmacotherapy with the opposite response for vegetative symptoms such as sleep and appetite (DiMascio, Weissman, Prusoff, and Neu 1979). The current study was built upon prior research that found Interpersonal Psychotherapy Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST) to be an efficacious prevention intervention for adolescents with subthreshold depression, as compared to school counseling (Young, Mufson and Gallop, 2010). In this investigation, we sought to compare the trends in symptomatic improvement among 32 participants treated with IPT-AST over eight weeks. Clusters of mood/ motivation and vegetative symptoms were followed from baseline to the end of treatment. The results suggest that mood symptoms improved significantly before vegetative symptoms, within the first four weeks of preventive treatment. Significant improvement in vegetative symptoms was found to occur later between weeks 6 and 8. Thus adolescents receiving IPT-AST preventive treatment demonstrated faster reduction in mood/motivation symptoms than vegetative symptoms. Analyses revealed that fewer participants were identified as having not improved on the mood/motivation cluster than on the vegetative cluster indicating a better response for adolescents with mood symptoms than vegetative symptoms. Although, no relationships in improvements in mood/motivation and vegetative clusters were found controlling for baseline mood/motivation and <b>vegetative</b> symptoms; positive <b>associations</b> were found between cluster variables (mood, vegetative and total depression) over time. Gender was also not found to moderate the relationship between improvement on mood and vegetative symptoms over time indicating no significant differences in the improvement between males and females. Overall, findings from the current investigation strengthen the results from previous studies regarding the timeline of symptom improvement with IPT-AST...|$|R
40|$|O fen?meno da urbaniza??o, bem como as modifica??es ambientais a ele associadas, criam novas restri??es e oportunidades para as plantas que permanecem em remanescentes florestais segregados pela matriz urbana. A fim de clarificar os efeitos resultantes deste processo, este estudo explorou o impacto da perturba??o antropog?nica sobre a flor?stica e a fenologia de comunidades arb?reas na paisagem fragmentada da cidade de Manaus, AM. Quatro ?reas foram selecionadas para levantamentos flor?sticos e monitoramento fenol?gicos: a Reserva Florestal Adolpho Ducke (RFAD), as florestas do Acariquara e do Coroado, situadas no Campus da Universidade Federal do Amazonas, e o fragmento florestal do Clube dos Trabalhadores do Servi?o Social da Ind?stria (SESI). Estas ?reas refletem um gradiente crescente de perturba??o antr?pica, no sentido RFAD ? Acariquara ? Coroado ? SESI. Os levantamentos flor?sticos abrangeram parcelas de 10 x 250 m, incluindo plantas com DAP >= 5 cm, num total de um hectare para cada ?rea de estudo. Os monitoramentos fenol?gicos abrangeram seis anos de observa??es sobre a ocorr?ncia de diferentes fenofases (i. e. flora??o, frutifica??o, produ??o de folhas, perda de folhas) em cada planta incluinda no levantamento flor?stico. Dados climatol?gicos da cidade de Manaus incluindo precipita??o acumulada, umidade relativa do ar e temperatura m?dia foram obtidos em uma base mensal, e suas poss?veis rela??es com o comportamento fenol?gico das comunidades foram investigadas atrav?s de modelos lineares generalizados (GLMs). Uma an?lise de gradiente direta revelou que a composi??o flor?stica em n?vel de fam?lia varia fortemente entre as ?reas. RFAD, Acariquara e Coroado possuem conjuntos taxon?micos progressivamente menos inclusivos, nesta ordem; SESI apresenta uma flora predominantemente distinta das demais ?reas. ?ndices de dissimilaridade de Jaccard calculados entre cada par de locais corroboraram este mesmo resultado em n?vel de esp?cie. Al?m disto, o n?mero de esp?cies declinou em fun??o da maior antropiza??o. Nas quatro ?reas de estudo, o maior n?mero de indiv?duos em flora??o ocorreu no fim da esta??o seca e no in?cio da esta??o chuvosa, e o maior n?mero de indiv?duos com frutos, durante a esta??o chuvosa. Todas as ?reas apresentaram picos de emiss?o de folhas e de perda de folhas na esta??o seca. As tr?s vari?veis ambientais tratadas neste estudo explicaram, independentemente, por??es relativamente pequenas da varia??o no n?mero de indiv?duos em cada uma das fenofases. Em geral, a correspond?ncia fenol?gica entre as s?ries de observa??es fenol?gicas tendeu a ser maior no caso das fenofases vegetativas, enquanto que entre as fenofases reprodutivas, a correspond?ncia variou amplamente. Foram detectadas associa??es tanto negativas quanto positivas entre precipita??o acumulada e o n?mero de ?rvores florindo, emitindo e perdendo folhas, enquanto que apenas rela??es positivas foram observadas com n?mero de ?rvores frutificando. A temperatura m?dia teve efeitos geralmente positivos sobre a express?o das fenofases. J? a umidade relativa do ar apresentou efeitos tanto positivos quanto negativos sobre o n?mero de ?rvores com folhas, flores e frutos, e positivo sobre o n?mero de ?rvores perdendo folhas. Al?m disto, a frutifica??o foi principalmente determinada pela flora??o em meses anteriores nas quatro ?reas de estudo. Em geral, estes resultados discrepantes est?o de acordo com sugest?es anteriores de que os mecanismos adaptativos de ?rvores tropicais deveriam se refletir em fracas associa??es da fenologia com o clima. Fatores como as constitui??es gen?tica e fisiol?gica das plantas, a demografia das popula??es nas comunidades e intera??es ecol?gicas a como poliniza??o podem tomar parte na varia??o fenol?gica n?o explicada pelos modelos. Sugere-se que, em estudos futuros, tente-se integrar as contribui??es relativas de fatores tanto abi?ticos quanto bi?ticos na regula??o da fenologia de comunidades arb?reas. A compreens?o da fenologia vegetal em ambientes tropicais sob antropiza??o crescente ? {{fundamental}} para a conserva??o e manejo racional das fun??es ecol?gicas de remanescentes florestais urbanos. Urbanization, as well {{as environmental}} changes related to it, creates both new restrictions and opportunities for plants that remain in forest patches segregated by the urban matrix. In order to {{shed some light on}} the resulting effects of this process, this study explored the impact of antropogenic disturbance on the floristic and phenology of tree communities in the fragmented landscape of Manaus city, Amazonas state, Brazilian Amazonia. Four areas were selected for floristic survey and phenological monitoring: Adolpho Ducke forest reserve (RFAD), Acariquara and Coroado forests, both located in the campus of the Federal University of Amazonas, and the forest fragmented owned by the Brazilian Industry Social Service (SESI). These areas reflect a gradient of rising antropic disturbance: RFAD ? Acariquara ? Coroado ? SESI. Floristic surveys were carried out on 10 x 250 m plots, totalizing one hectare for each study area, and all plants with DBH >= 5 cm were marked. Phenological observations were made or seven years, and the occurrence of phenophases (i. e. flowering, fruiting, leaf flushing and leaf fall) in each marked plant were recorded throughout that time. Climate data from Manaus (i. e. cumulative rainfall, air relative humidity and average temperature) were obtained monthly, their relations to community-level phonological patterns were investigated by means of generalized linear models (GLM). Direct gradient analysis revealed that floristic composition strongly varies between areas. RFAD, Acariquara and Coroado have family assemblages progressively less inclusive, in this order; SESI has a predominantly dissimilar flora in relation to the others. Pair-wise comparisons between areas with Jaccard?s dissimilarity indices confirmed this result at the level of species. Besides, species number declined as a function of greater antropization. In all study areas, the greatest number of flowering individuals occurred between the end of the dry season {{and the beginning of the}} wet season; the greatest number of fruiting individuals coincided with the wet season. Peaks of leaf flushing and leaf fall occurred during the dry season in all areas. Environmental variables explained relatively little of the observed variation in each of the phenophases. In general, phenological correspondence between areas was greater for <b>vegetative</b> phenophases; <b>association</b> between reproductive phenophases in different areas was highly variable. Both positive and negative relations were found between cumulative rainfall and the number of trees in each phenophase, whereas only positive relations were observed with the number of fruiting trees. In general, average temperature had positive effects on the expression of all phenophases, but air relative humidity has both positive and negative effects on the number of trees with new leaves, flowers and fruits; only positive effects were found on leaf fall. Besides, fruiting was mainly determined by flowering in earlier months. These discrepant results are accord with previous suggestions that adaptive mechanisms of tropical trees should render them weakly responsive to climate. Factors such as genetic constitution, physiological state, demography and ecological interactions may take part in the remaining, unexplained phonological variation. It is suggested that future studies should integrate the contributions of both abiotic and biotic factors to the regulation of tree community phenology. The understanding of plant phenology in tropical environments under rising antropization in fundamental for the adequate conservation and management of ecological functions in urban forest remnants...|$|R
