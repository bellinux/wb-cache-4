5|$|Buena <b>Vista</b> {{features}} an early architectural style that {{differs from that}} at Motul de San José, consisting of platforms built from unworked stone, with wide front stairways and probably without superstructures. They {{were built in the}} Middle to Late Preclassic periods and then reused in the Late Classic. The differences in style between Buena <b>Vista</b> and Motul probably results from differing epochs of construction.|$|E

5|$|By 1947, US395 ran {{concurrently}} {{along the}} portion of SR78 from <b>Vista</b> to Escondido before continuing along Santa Fe Avenue to Bonsall and Fallbrook and rejoining its alignment during the 1970s. At this time, all of SR78 that existed had been paved. Before the present-day freeway was built, SR78 was routed on the <b>Vista</b> Way Freeway (which was an expressway) from Oceanside east to downtown <b>Vista.</b> After this, it followed Santa Fe Avenue and Mission Road east (now signed as CR S14), continuing onto Grand Avenue in Escondido. Following the intersection with US395, SR78 turned south on Ash Street and rejoined the current alignment of the highway. In 1949, the rerouting of SR78 from US395 to US99 was listed as a priority by local officials. The road was known for its curves, even though it went over relatively flat terrain; this reduced its efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{considered}} {{releasing the}} film's soundtrack {{around the time}} of the film's roadshow release, but this idea was not realized. The soundtrack was first released as a mono three LP set and a stereo 8-track tape in sixteen countries by Disneyland and Buena <b>Vista</b> Records in 1957, containing the musical pieces without the narration. A stereo edition LP was issued by Buena <b>Vista</b> Records in 1961. Disney was required to obtain permission from Stokowski, who initially rejected its sale unless the Philadelphia Orchestra Association received a share of the royalties.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the 36-year-old QE2 was {{replaced}} on the North Atlantic by Queen Mary 2. Caronia was sold and QE2 continued to cruise {{until she was}} retired in 2008. In 2007 Cunard added a large cruise ship, Queen Victoria. She is not a sister for the QM2, being ordered by Carnival as a <b>Vista</b> class cruise ship for the Holland America Line. To reinforce Cunard traditions, the QV has a small museum on board. Cunard commissioned a second <b>Vista</b> class cruise ship, Queen Elizabeth, in 2010.|$|E

5|$|SR78 {{begins in}} Oceanside as a {{continuation}} of <b>Vista</b> Way. As it encounters a traffic signal and crosses over I-5, the route becomes a suburban freeway traveling east through Oceanside. The freeway loosely parallels Buena <b>Vista</b> Creek before entering the city of <b>Vista.</b> Turning southeast, SR78 continues into the city of San Marcos near California State University San Marcos and enters Escondido, where it has an interchange with I-15. A 2011 Caltrans study estimated that the average commuter encountered a delay of 10minutes on the portion from I-5 to I-15. After passing the Center City Parkway (I-15 Business) interchange, the freeway abruptly ends at the intersection with Broadway. SR78 then makes a turn south onto Broadway and continues through downtown Escondido by turning east onto Washington Avenue and south onto Ash Street, which becomes San Pasqual Valley Road.|$|E

5|$|SR78 was {{originally}} formed {{along with the}} originally signed state highways in California (Sign Routes) in 1934; however, it only extended to what was then US99 near Kane Springs. In the North County, SR78 was legislatively designated as Route196 from then-US 101 (present-day I-5) to <b>Vista,</b> and as Route77 from <b>Vista</b> to US 395 in Escondido. SR78 was legally known as Route197 from Escondido to Ramona, and Route198 from Ramona to US99, which is now SR86. From the eastern junction of SR86 to the Riverside county line, the route was designated as Route146 in 1959.|$|E

Excavations have revealed evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.|$|E

5|$|As with zoneinfo, a user of Microsoft Windows configures DST by {{specifying the}} name of a location, and the {{operating}} system then consults a table of rule sets that must be updated when DST rules change. Procedures for specifying the name and updating the table vary with release. Updates are not issued for older versions of Microsoft Windows. Windows <b>Vista</b> supports at most two start and end rules per time zone setting. In a Canadian location observing DST, a single <b>Vista</b> setting supports both 1987–2006 and post-2006 time stamps, but mishandles some older time stamps. Older Microsoft Windows systems usually store only a single start and end rule for each zone, so that the same Canadian setting reliably supports only post-2006 time stamps.|$|E
