40|$|Introduction To {{protect the}} (possibly) injured spine, trauma {{patients}} are immobilized on a backboard, with an extrication collar, lateral headblocks, and straps. Although pressure ulcers are {{typically associated with}} older adults and chronic illness, of all patients in a hospital environment, these trauma patients may be particularly at risk for developing (device-related) pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers are a serious health complication that develop {{as a result of}} pressure alone or pressure in combination with shear force. Trauma patients (with suspected spinal injury) have traumatic injuries, are immobile, and exposed to immobilizing and medical devices; these are all factors that increase the risk to develop pressure ulcers. Methods The thesis focuses primarily on the development of pressure ulcers in trauma patients with suspected spinal injury. We defined general research questions that served as a fundament for our studies: 1. What is the incidence of pressure ulcers in trauma patients, immobilized with a backboard, extrication collar and headblocks due to suspected spinal injury? 2. Which risk factors play a role in pressure ulcer development in trauma patients with suspected spinal injury? To answer these questions, we performed a systematic literature review (n= 13), an experimental study (n= 54), and three prospective observational studies (n= 342, n= 254, n= 254). Furthermore, we wrote a discussion paper, covering the current discussion on preventive spinal immobilization. Results In the systematic literature review we found only four studies that included trauma patients, nine studies included healthy volunteers. The described incidence of pressure ulcers related to the cervical collar varied widely and risk factors for pressure ulcer development from immobilizing devices were related to the type of device, length on/in the device and the severity of illness. No studies were found that described the occurrence of pressure ulcers related to the application of backboards, <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattresses</b> or headblocks. In the experimental study with emergency nurses and physicians, we found that pressure ulcer identification and classification skills improved significantly after an educational intervention. In the prospective observational studies, we focused on the acute phase (the emergency department) and the follow-up phase (hospital admission). In the acute phase, we found very high incidence figures on pressure ulcer development (75. 4...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> {{consists}} of a sealed air-tight (typically polymer) bag enclosing small beads (typically polystyrene balls) and fitted {{with one or more}} valves.

50|$|The scoop {{stretcher}} can be {{used for}} patient transport, provided the patient is strapped. However, the ninth edition of the ATLS Student Course Manual advises against using scoop stretchers for patient transport.

50|$|A vacuum splint is {{a device}} {{like a small}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> that is used in {{emergency}} medicine as a temporary splint. Vacuum splints operate by extracting air from the splint itself to enable the thousands of polystyrene balls inside the splint to mold around the injured body part similar to an orthopedic cast. Vacuum splints are primarily used by paramedics to splint trauma-related injuries, joint dislocation, subluxation, and extremity fractures.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{particularly}} important in trauma cases where spinal injury is suspected to immobilize the cervical spine, or back. Failure to do so can cause permanent paralysis or death. In the field, spinal stabilization involves moving the person's back as a single unit {{with as many as}} five rescuers assisting, then applying a cervical collar (which can be improvised from duct tape and cardboard), and securing victims to a solid-backed stretcher, long spine board, or a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress.</b>|$|E
50|$|A spinal {{board is}} {{primarily}} indicated for judicious use to transport {{people who may}} have had a spinal injury, usually due to the mechanism of injury, and the attending team are not able to rule out a spinal injury.

For comfort and safety reasons, it is recommended to transfer the patient to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> instead, in which case a scoop stretcher or long spine board is just used for the transfer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> {{is put on}} a {{stretcher}} or possibly on a long spine board. The straps are put under the mattress, along its side, so they do not reach the ground. Then, the polystyrene balls are distributed evenly through the mattress by shaking its surface. (A section with fewer balls would be less rigid, conversely if balls are concentrated at any given point this becomes more rigid.) A sheet is put on the mattress, folded {{so it will be}} possible to pull it to wrap the casualty into using an S-fold and finally a team member should double-check the pump (manual or electrical) is set to either pump air out of the bag.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the stability and comfort afforded by the long spinal board (backboard) and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress.</b> Methods: Nine volunteers wearing standardised clothing and rigid neck collars were secured on to a backboard and <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> using a standard strapping arrangement. An operating department table was used to tilt the volunteers from 45 degrees head up to 45 degrees head down, and addition-ally 45 degrees laterally. Movements of the head, sternum, and pubic symphysis (pelvis) from a fixed position were then recorded. The comfort level during the procedure was assessed using a 10 point numerical rating scale (NRS) where 1 =no pain and 10 =worst pain imaginable. Results: The mean body movements in the head up position (23. 3 v 6. 66 mm), head down (40. 89 v 8. 33 mm), and lateral tilt (18. 33 v 4. 26 mm) were significantly greater on the backboard than on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> (p< 0. 01 for all planes of movement). Using the NRS the <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> (mean score= 1. 88) was significantly more comfortable than the backboard (mean score= 5. 22) (p< 0. 01).

30|$|In young {{children}} the main disadvantage {{of the use}} of MRI is the long scan time during which the patient has to remain immobile. This leads to the need for general anaesthesia (intubation) or sedation in {{young children}}. Other approaches, such as immobilisation with for example a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> or a feed and swaddle protocol, have been advocated, thus obviating the need for general sedation [29]. For older children having enough time and patience to make the child feel comfortable and cooperative is mandatory. Adaptations to the environment, {{such as the use of}} an open MRI, the presence of parents or distraction during imaging, can also be helpful.|$|E
40|$|Objectives Clinical PET/MR {{requires}} {{the use of}} patient positioning aids to immobilize and support patients {{for the duration of the}} combined examination. Ancillary immobilization devices contribute to overall attenuation of the PET signal, but are not detected with conventional MR sequences and, hence, are ignored in standard MR-based attenuation correction (MR-AC). We report on the quantitative effect of not accounting for the attenuation of patient positioning aids in combined PET/MR imaging. Methods We used phantom and patient data acquired with positioning aids on a PET/CT scanner (Biograph 16, HI-REZ) to mimic PET/MR imaging conditions. Reference CT-based attenuation maps were generated from measured (original) CT transmission images (origCT-AC). We also created MR-like attenuation maps by following the same conversion procedure of the attenuation values except for the prior delineation and subtraction of the positioning aids from the CT images (modCT-AC). First, a uniform 68 Ge cylinder was positioned centrally in the PET/CT scanner and fixed with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> (10 cm thick) and, in a repeat examination, with MR positioning foam pads. Second, 16 patient datasets were selected for subsequent processing. All patients were regionally immobilized with positioning aids: a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> for head/neck imaging (nine patients) and a foam mattress for imaging of the lower extremities (seven patients). PET images were reconstructed following CT-based attenuation and scatter correction using the original and modified (MR-like) CT images: PETorigCT-AC and PETmodCT-AC, respectively. PET images following origCT-AC and modCT-AC were compared visually and in terms of mean differences of voxels with a standardized uptake value of at least 1. 0. In addition, we report maximum activity concentration in lesions for selected patients. Results In the phantom study employing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> the average voxel activity in PETmodCT-AC was underestimated by 6. 4 % compared to PETorigCT-AC, with 3. 4 % of the PET voxels being underestimated by 10 % or more. When the MR foam pads were not accounted for during AC, PETmodCT-AC was underestimated by 1. 1 % on average, with none of the PET voxels being underestimated by 10 % or more. Evaluation of the head/neck patient data showed a decrease of 8. 4 % ([68 Ga]DOTATOC) and 7. 4 % ([18 F]FDG) when patient positioning aids were not accounted for during AC, while the corresponding decrease was insignificant for the lower extremities. Conclusion Depending on the size and density of the positioning aids used, a regionally variable underestimation of PET activity following AC is observed when positioning aids are not accounted for. This underestimation may become relevant in combined PET/MR imaging of patients with neuropsychiatric indications, but appears to be of no clinical relevance in imaging the extremities...|$|E

He was positioned on a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> (BodyFIX BlueBAG, Elekta, Crawley, UK) to limit movement and maximise the respiratory surface motion on the skin surface and asked to perform several respiratory manoeuvres, in the supine and prone positions. During these manoeuvres, the mean depth measurements were recorded and a Jaeger Masterscope with spirometry software (SentrySuite V 2.13, CareFusion, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to measure the respiratory level. The spirometer was calibrated using a 3 L calibration syringe. Local ambient temperature, humidity and air pressure were updated in the system. The respiratory manoeuvres consisted of a complete inspiration, resulting in a peak in both signals to temporally align them, and several tidal volumes. The volume and inverted mean distance measurements for the supine and prone positions were superimposed plotted in graphs and assessed visually.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{consequences}} of spinal injury {{as a result}} of trauma can be devastating. Spinal immobilisation using hard trauma boards and rigid cervical collars has traditionally been the standard response to suspected spinal injury patients even though the risk may be extremely low. Recently, adverse events due to the method of immobilisation have challenged the need for motion restriction in all trauma patients. International guidelines have been published for protection of the spine during transport and this article brings those guidelines into the South African context. Recommendations: Trauma patients need to be properly assessed using both an approved list of high and low risk factors, as well as a thorough examination. They should then be managed accordingly. Internationally validated assessment strategies have been developed, and should be used as part of the patient assessment. The method of motion restriction should be selected to suit the situation. The use of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> is the preferable technique, {{with the use of a}} trauma board being the least desirable. Conclusion: The need for motion restriction in suspected spinal injury should be properly evaluated and appropriate action taken. Not all trauma patients require spinal motion restriction...|$|E
30|$|The Kinect has {{the added}} benefit of being a {{generally}} available, low-cost system. Several groups have analysed the feasibility of using the Kinect camera to monitor respiratory motion for respiratory gated or four-dimensional CT-based continuous radiotherapy [3 ‚Äì 5]. Though the results seem promising, to our knowledge, no clinical studies utilising the Kinect have been published yet. The Kinect-based respiratory motion monitoring systems are mostly compared with the RPM Gating System (Varian Medical System, Palo Alto, CA, USA), a clinically available respiratory motion tracking system that utilised the movement of a marker box placed on the patient‚Äôs chest to gate radiation therapy. This system is not suitable for interventional procedures because the box has to be placed on disinfected skin and can easily be knocked out of place. As it only tracks the movement of a single marker, it {{would not be able to}} detect a change in breathing pattern either. During interventional procedures, patients are more likely to alter from thoracic to abdominal breathing, or vice versa, rendering the tracking inaccurate. The value of skin surface motion tracking in combination with a tightly positioned <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> is that all respiratory movement can be visualised and thus be used as patient feedback.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{principal}} {{aspects of the}} immediate management of patients suffering from spinal injury. An understanding of the pathophysiology of primary and secondary spinal cord injury enables appropriate initial care to be provided, thereby avoiding exacerbation and/or progressive deterioration of the lesion. It includes protective measures, restoration of vital functions to maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation, as well as pharmacological prevention of secondary injury. Protective measures include proper immobilisation of the spine with a semi-rigid collar and tape on a long backboard, or on <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress,</b> taking great care to avoid deleterious in-line compression forces on the spinal column. The combination of cervical spine instability, a full stomach, unopposed vagal reflexes, hypoxia and hypercarbia makes airway management of these patients difficult. Tracheal intubation under fibroscopic control, with insertion of the tube only after topical anaesthesia of the airways under titrated intravenous sedation, offers safety and comfort to the patient. However, in cases of severe deterioration of vital functions, intubation must be performed without any delay {{at the site of}} the accident or in the emergency room. Three options are available: blind naso-tracheal intubation with spontaneous breathing, modified rapid sequence induction with orotracheal intubation under double protection, and immediate surgical airway if these techniques fail. Patients with cervical spine injury may demonstrate severe hypotension requiring sympathomimetic agents and careful fluid loading to avoid pulmonary oedema. To prevent aggravation of the spinal cord injury by systemic factors, the goal of initial resuscitation is to restore an adequate perfusion pressure of at least 60 mmHg, a PaO 2 > 100 mmHg, and to keep PaCO 2 below 45 mmHg.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{protect the}} (possibly) injured spine, trauma {{patients}} are immobilized on backboard or <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress,</b> with a cervical collar, lateral headblocks, and straps. Several studies identified pressure ulcer (PU) development from these devices. The {{aim of this}} literature study was to gain insight into the occurrence and development of PUs, the risk factors, and the possible interventions to prevent PUs related to spinal immobilization with devices in adult trauma patients. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL for the period 1970 to September 2011. Studies were included if participants were healthy volunteers under spinal immobilization or trauma patients under spinal immobilization until spine injuries were diagnosed or excluded. Outcomes of primary interest included occurrence, severity, and risk for PU development as well as prevention of PU development related to spinal immobilization devices. RESULTS: The results of included studies show an incidence of collar-related PUs ranging from 6. 8 % to 38 %. Described locations are the occiput, chin, shoulders, and back. The severity of these PUs varies between Stages 1 and 3, and one study describes PUs requiring surgical debridement, indicating a Stage 4 PU. Described risk factors for PU development are high pressure and pain from immobilizing devices, {{the length of time}} in/on a device, intensive care unit admission, high Injury Severity Scores (ISSs), mechanical ventilation, and intracranial pressure monitoring. Preventive interventions for collar-related PUs include early replacement of the extrication collar and regular skin assessment, collar refit, and position change. CONCLUSION: The results from this systematic review show that immobilization with devices increases the risk for PU development. This risk is demonstrated in nine experimental studies with healthy volunteers and in four clinical studies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Systematic review, level III...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2015, the National Protocol Ambulance version 7 (LPA 7) {{revised to}} version 8 (LPA 8). The patient profile, {{including}} criteria to assess which patient {{is suspected of}} having spinal injury, was too strict in LPA 7. Therefore, the patient profile in LPA 8 includes less strict criteria. It is unclear whether criteria in LPA 8 indicate the correct patients suspected of having spinal injury. Moreover, complications occurred after using spinal immobilization methods and devices in LPA 7. Therefore, other methods and devices are included in LPA 8. Objectives: To describe the patient profile according to LPA 7 and the diagnosis of spinal (cord) injury in trauma patients with suspected spinal injury admitted to the trauma room of the emergency department and to evaluate used spinal immobilization methods and devices as applied by paramedics according to the LPA 8. Methods: During observations at the trauma room of the emergency department, a questionnaire, designed by the researcher, was completed by the researcher or trauma nurses for adult trauma patients admitted to an academic hospital. Results All 31 patients included, met ‚â• 1 criteria in LPA 7. In five patients, not immobilized during transport, spinal injury was not present. Patients were immobilized lying or half-sitting with devices as the backboard, <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress,</b> stretcher, head blocks and/or a C-collar. For 24 patients, extra devices were applied at the emergency department. Conclusion: Although all patients met ‚â• 1 criteria in LPA 7, not every patient was immobilized during transport. Spinal injury was not present in patients without immobilization. Moreover, varying immobilization methods are used and discrepancies in immobilization between the pre-hospital and hospital phase are showed. Implications of key findings: Discrepancies between the pre-hospital and hospital phase should be reduced to prevent confusion between health care professionals. Moreover, research according to specificity and sensitivity of criteria inLPA 8 is recommended...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{accuracy}} of combined clinical examination (CE) and chest radiography (CXR) (CE + CXR) vs thoracic ultrasonography in the acute assessment of pneumothorax, hemothorax, and lung contusion in chest trauma patients is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study involving 119 adult patients {{admitted to the}} ED with thoracic trauma. Each patient, secured onto a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress,</b> underwent a subsequent thoracic CT scan after first receiving CE, CXR, and thoracic ultrasonography. The diagnostic performance of each method was also evaluated in a subgroup of 35 patients with hemodynamic and/or respiratory instability. RESULTS: Of the 237 lung fields included in the study, we observed 53 pneumothoraces, 35 hemothoraces, and 147 lung contusions, according to either thoracic CT scan or thoracic decompression if placed before the CT scan. The diagnostic performance of ultrasonography was {{higher than that of}} CE + CXR, as shown by their respective areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC-ROC) : mean 0. 75 (95 % CI, 0. 67 - 0. 83) vs 0. 62 (0. 54 - 0. 70) in pneumothorax cases and 0. 73 (0. 67 - 0. 80) vs 0. 66 (0. 61 - 0. 72) for lung contusions, respectively (all P <. 05). In addition, the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography to detect pneumothorax was enhanced in the most severely injured patients: 0. 86 (0. 73 - 0. 98) vs 0. 70 (0. 61 - 0. 80) with CE + CXR. No difference between modalities was found for hemothorax.

40|$|Objectives: To compare paramedics‚Äô {{ability to}} {{minimize}} cervical spine motion during patient transfer onto a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> with two stabilization techniques (Head Squeeze vs. Trap Squeeze) and two transfer methods (log roll with one assistant (LR 2) vs. 3 assistants (LR 4)). Methods: We used a cross-over design to minimize bias. Each lead paramedic performed 10 LR 2 transfers and 10 LR 4 transfers. For {{each of the}} 10 LR 2 and 10 LR 4 transfers, the lead paramedic stabilized the cervical spine using the Head Squeeze technique five times and the Trap Squeeze technique five times. We randomized {{the order of the}} stabilization techniques and LR 2 / LR 4 across lead paramedics to avoid a practice or fatigue effect with repeated trials. We measured relative cervical spine motion between the head and trunk using Inertial Measurement Units placed on the forehead and sternum. Results: On average, total motion was 3. 9 ¬∞ less with three assistants compared to one assistant (p= 0. 0002), and 2. 8 ¬∞ less with the Trap Squeeze compared to the Head Squeeze (p= 0. 002). There was no interaction between the transfer method and stabilization technique. When examining specific motions in the six directions, the Trap Squeeze generally produced less lateral flexion and rotation motion but allowed more extension. Examining within paramedic differences, some paramedics were clearly more proficient with the Trap Squeeze technique and others were clearly more proficient with the Head Squeeze technique. Conclusion: Paramedics performing a log roll with three assistants created less motion compared to a log roll with only one assistant, and using the Trap Squeeze stabilization technique resulted in less motion than the Head Squeeze technique. However, the clinical relevance of the magnitude remains unclear. However, large individual differences suggest future paramedic training should incorporate both best evidence practice as well as recognition that there may be individual differences between paramedics...|$|E
40|$|Aims & Objectives The {{aim of this}} {{treatment}} planning study is to compare the techniques of 3 D conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) and IMRT to determine the feasible advantages for prostate cancer patientsof using a new direct step & shoot (DSS) IMRT module. For the optimisation of the IMRT, Nucletron offers {{as a part of}} the optimising process their IM-optimisation software or their new module DSS. The earlier IM-optimisation software searches first for the ideal fluence for each beam, and this is then followed by the segmentation. The new DSS module integrates the segmentation into the optimisation process. Materials & Methods Between March 2006 and November 2006, four patients with a mean age of 71 years were enrolled for primary EBRT for localised prostate cancer. Three of these patients received antiandrogen therapy either before or during radiotherapy. All four patients had 3 D CT treatment planning with a slice thickness of 5 mm and with immobilisation in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>mattress</b> (BlueBAG BodyFIX, Medical Intelligence). As an initial step, it was planned (using Oncentra MasterPlan) to deliver 60 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV), calculated using data for a Siemens Primus linear accelerator (15 MV photons, with multileaf collimator leaf width of 1 cm at the isocentre). The preselected gantry angles were 25, 90, 120, 240, 270 and 335 degrees. The rectal volume and urinary bladder were delineated as organs at risk (OARs). Additional structures were also contoured in order to help (we term them ‚ÄòHelp Contours‚Äô) avoid hot spots in normal tissues surrounding the PTV to a distance of 1 cm. The dose-volume objectives were defined by two schemes. After optimisation the plans were re-normalised to the average of PTV, giving 30 fractions with a fractional dose of 2 Gy. The 3 DCRT plan used identical gantry angles with the beams weighted by experience. Results Both IMRT optimisation schemes reduced the doses received by the OARs when compared to the 3 DCRT plan. Using the Nucletron IM-optimisation software the first weighting scheme of the objectives resulted in satisfactory dose-volume histograms (DVHs) for the OARs, and an obviously 'softened' DVH for the PTV (when compared to the 3 DCRT plan). The DSS optimisation produced a steeper DVH for the PTV, but worse results for the OARs when compared to the IM-optimisation. Scheme 2 improved the DVHs for the OARs using the DSS process, to about the same level as the IM-optimisation with scheme 1, the PTV DVH staying nearly unchanged. The IM-optimisation produced the worst DVH for the PTV of the five different plans we considered. In Figure 1 the DVHs are shown of a characteristic 3 DCRT plan, the IM plan (Scheme 1) and the DSS plan (Scheme 2). Table 1 presents the mean values, averaged over the four patients, for the PTV and for the two OARs. Conclusions In every case the DSS optimisation resulted in a steeper DVH for the PTV than found using the IM process. The DVHs for the OARs are worse with scheme 1 but improve to about the same level with scheme 2. The patients benefit from IMRT by reduced doses to the OARs, keeping a very steep DVH for the PTV with the DSS optimisation. The user should note that weighting schemes based on the experience with IM-optimisation are not retained for the new DSS optimiation without control. ...|$|E
