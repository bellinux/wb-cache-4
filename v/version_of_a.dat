5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (not unique to the Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jaw harp). The Pa'pelle is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|After Ellis {{defeated}} the Reds by {{a score of}} 1-0 in a 1973 game, Joe Morgan claimed that Ellis threw a spitball. Anderson had the umpire check Ellis, but found no evidence.

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able to create a circularly permuted <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein by chemically ligating the termini to create a cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{discovery}} of post-translational circular permutations and {{the suggestion of}} a possible genetic mechanism for evolving circular permutants, it was not until 1995 that the first circularly permuted pair of genes were discovered. Saposins are a class of proteins involved in sphingolipid catabolism and antigen presentation of lipids in humans. Chris Ponting and Robert Russell identified a circularly permuted <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saposin inserted into plant aspartic proteinase, which they nicknamed swaposin. Saposin and swaposin were the first known case of two natural genes related by a circular permutation.|$|E
5|$|Farhan Akhtar {{conceived}} {{the idea to}} remake the iconic 1978 film {{of the same name}} after listening to a remixed <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> song from the original film. In early 2005, media started reporting that Akhtar was planning to remake the film, but rather than confirming the news, he revealed that though he was writing the screenplay based on the film, he would take the final decision after completing the script. The director co-wrote the film with his father, Javed Akhtar, who had also written the original film with Salim Khan.|$|E

The 28-year-old tinkerer immediately set upon building his own improved <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flying machine.|$|E
40|$|Reciprocal transformations mix {{the role}} of the {{dependent}} and independent variables to achieve simpler versions or even linearized <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> nonlinear PDEs. These transformations help in the identification <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plethora <b>of</b> PDEs available in the Physics and Mathematics literature. Two different equations, although seemingly unrelated, happen to be equivalent <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> same equation after a reciprocal transformation. In this way, the big number of integrable equations could be greatly diminished by establishing a method to discern which equations are disguised <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common underlying problem. Then, a question arises: Is there a way to identify different <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underlying common nonlinear problem? Other useful applications of reciprocal transformations are subsequently discussed and illustrated with examples...|$|R

5|$|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, an Indologist, dates the Pune <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{manuscript}} {{of the text}} to about the 13th or 14th century CE, and notes that {{this version of the}} Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts. He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya; rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to the theory that the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text.|$|E
