The power gained by clipping at audio frequency and at narrowband was calculated and compared with previously published data. Repeaking due to component rejection was investigated for clipping at audio and narrowband.

While the other five RRN stations began offering programming on June 6, 1948, WVBN did not begin operating until mid-October of that year. Another complication {{at that time was}} the lack of utility power on Gomer Hill; two Smith-Meeker 15 kW Diesel generators and a 45 kL (12,000 gal) fuel tank had to be installed on site before any broadcast equipment could be turned on.

A rapid {{evaluation of the}} distribution of such surface contamination cam be obtained by an aircraft mounted detector.

The data are continuously compensated to the reading that would be obtained if the measurements were taken at three feet from thc ground surface. It will record the ground radiation field intensities from 0. 01 mr/hr to 1000 r/hr. The Telepulse Coding Unit converts this information to a signal suitable for transmission to a plotting center via a standard <b>voice</b> radio <b>transmitter.</b> The transmitted signal is decoded by a Telepulse Receiving Unit and is automatically recorded on a strip chart.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new type of {{coherent}} demodulator, the unique-word (UW) -reverse-modulation type demodulator, for burst signal controlled by <b>voice</b> operated <b>transmitter</b> (VOX) in mobile satellite communication channels. The demodulator has three individual circuits: a pre-detection signal combiner, a pre-detection UW detector, and a UW-reverse-modulation type demodulator. The pre-detection signal combiner combines signal sequences received by two antennas and improves bit energy-to-noise power density ratio (E(sub b) /N(sub 0)) 2. 5 dB to yield 10 (exp - 3) average bit error rate (BER) when carrier power-to-multipath power ratio (CMR) is 15 dB. The pre-detection UW detector improves UW detection probability when the frequency offset is large. The UW-reverse-modulation type demodulator realizes a maximum pull-in frequency of 3. 9 kHz, the pull-in time is 2. 4 seconds and frequency error is less than 20 Hz. The performances of this demodulator are confirmed through computer simulations and its effect is clarified in real-time experiments at a bit rate of 16. 8 kbps using a digital signal processor (DSP) ...|$|R

When Birmingham took over forecasting duties in 1997 the <b>voice</b> on this <b>transmitter</b> was changed to a computer-generated voice, in part to speed up the warning transmission process.

30|$|Lag synchronization, {{defined as}} {{the state of the}} drive system is delayed by a {{positive}} constant in comparison with that of the response system, is an interesting phenomenon and has been observed in neural models, electronic circuits and lasers [3, 8 – 11]. In many practical situations, due to the finite transmission speed of signals, it is more reasonable to require the response system to synchronize with the drive system at a time lag rather than at exactly the same time [12 – 15]. For example, in a telephone communication system, the voice one hears on the receiver side at time t is the <b>voice</b> from the <b>transmitter</b> side at time t-τ [12, 13]. Therefore, how to effectively make two chaotic systems achieve lag synchronization is an important issue which deserves detailed investigation. Additionally, in implementation of neural networks, time delays always exist in the signal transmission among neurons owing to the finite switching speed of neurons and amplifiers, which will affect the dynamical behaviors of neural networks [13, 16 – 18]. Hence, time delays should be taken into account when exploring the dynamics of neural networks. In the light of these facts, many efforts have been made devoted to the study of lag synchronization of delayed chaotic systems and delayed neural networks in recent years [11 – 15, 19 – 23]. For instance, the problem of lag synchronization control for memristor-based coupled delayed neural networks with parameter mismatches was explored in [11]. In [12], the effect of parameter mismatch on lag synchronization of coupled delayed systems was investigated by periodically intermittent control. In [13], the exponential lag synchronization for neural networks with mixed delays was considered via periodically intermittent control. In [21], the lag synchronization for competitive neural networks with mixed delays and uncertain hybrid perturbations was studied via adaptive control. In [23], the adaptive lag synchronization of Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with discrete delays was discussed.|$|R
