40|$|Valves {{are widely}} used for fluid flow control, not only for {{conventional}} fluid like water, gas and oil, but also for hydrogen under high pressure and so forth. Under these new conditions, the response time and energy consumption of valves {{are closely related to}} the whole performance of the piping system. Pilot-control globe valve (PCGV) is a novel quick response valve, which can utilize the pressure difference before and after the <b>valve</b> <b>core</b> to control the open/close states of the main valve. In this paper, the effects of spring stiffness inside PCGV on the flow and the <b>valve</b> <b>core</b> movement are carried out, respectively.

40|$|A novel pilot-control globe valve, {{which can}} be used in {{vertical}} pipelines with a lower driving energy consumption, is proposed. A governing equation for <b>valve</b> <b>core</b> motion is obtained through a theoretical analysis of the forces applied on the <b>valve</b> <b>core.</b> A 3 D simulation of <b>valve</b> <b>core</b> motion is conducted in Fluent by using User Defined Function (UDF) to involve different spring stiffness, steady state displacements, impact speeds and transient state displacements. The results show that there are different opening modes for different spring stiffness. For smaller spring stiffness, the valve is subject to a quicker response to flow to ensure it can work properly; however, this can more easily result in a higher impact speed. With the increasing of spring stiffness, the steady displacement of the core reduces especially beyond a turning point. Besides, the numerical transient displacements with 0. 9 and 1. 1 times the spring stiffness show good agreement with those obtained from a theoretical analysis. It is found out that the real spring design point should have 0. 9 times the spring stiffness determined by the theoretical analysis.

40|$|Core {{flooding}} is {{a commonly}} used experimental procedure in the petroleum industry. It involves pressurizing a reservoir rock and flowing fluid through {{it in the}} laboratory. The cylindrical rock, called a core, can be cut from the reservoir during a separate core drilling operation or a formation outcrop. A core flooding apparatus suitable for matrix acidizing was designed and assembled. Matrix acidizing is a stimulation technique in which hydrochloric acid (HCl) is injected down the wellbore below formation fracture pressure to dissolve carbonate (CaCO 3) rock creating high permeability streaks called wormholes. The main components of the apparatus include a continuous flow syringe pump, three core holders, a hydraulic hand pump, two accumulators, a back pressure regulator, and two pressure transducers connected {{through a series of}} tubing and valves. Due to the corrosive nature of the acid, the apparatus features Hastelloy which is a corrosion resistant metal alloy. Another substantial feature of the apparatus is the ability to apply 3000 psi back pressure. This is the pressure necessary to keep CO 2, a product of the CaCO 3 and HCl reaction, in solution at elevated temperatures. To perform experiments at temperature, the core holder is wrapped with heating tape and surrounded by insulation. Tubing is wrapped around a heating band with insulation to heat the fluid before it enters the core. A LabVIEW graphical programming code was written to control heaters as well as record temperature and pressure drop across the core. Other considerations for the design include minimizing footprint, operational ease by the user, vertical placement of the accumulators and core holders to minimize gravity effects, and air release <b>valves.</b> <b>Core</b> floods can be performed at varying injection rates, temperatures and pressures up to 5000 psi and 250 degF.
