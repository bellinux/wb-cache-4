40|$|Professional experience, {{as well as}} a {{great deal}} of {{published}} research (e. g. Gass & <b>Varonis,</b> 1991; <b>Varonis</b> & Gass, 1985 a), suggests that even successful users of English as a second language unwittingly give rise to communication problems when encoding and decoding certain features of language, both linguistic and pragmatic. Among the latter is the issue of referring (for example, by pronouns or lexical substitution) to people, places and objects not in the immediate context. This paper, based on a wider study, outlines a procedure in which teachers were asked, via stimulated recall sessions, to reflect on previously-recorded pair work interactions and to discuss occasions where problematic communication occurred, or did not occur. Close analysis of transcript data reveals that potentially significant misleading stimuli may not eventuate in any failure of communication, while apparently trivial slips could cause considerable misunderstanding. It is suggested that teacher-researchers might usefully adapt a procedure such as that used in the study jar their own professional development, for use in class, and as the basis jar action research projects...|$|E
40|$|Although a {{preference}} for self-repair over other-repair has been observed in both native speaker (NS) discourse (e. g., Schegloff, Jefferson, & Sacks, 1977) and nonnative speaker (NNS) discourse (e. g., Firth, 1996), researchers note that other-repair still often occurs, especially in interactions with NNSs (e. g., <b>Varonis</b> & Gass, 1983). The present study examines conditions under which other-repair occurs and the response to other-repair in natural NS/NNS conversations in Japanese.

The subjects were 32 female undergraduates with high and low proficiency in ESL. A within-subject repeated measures concurrent nested QUAN-qual (Creswell, 2003) mixed methods approach was used. Interactions between the subjects in mixed ability dyads in face-to-face (F 2 F) and synchronous computer-assisted (SCA) environments provide the data. The unit of analysis was negotiation of meaning (<b>Varonis</b> & Gass, 1985) which is the key construct that is claimed to promote second language acquisition (SLA). The evidence indicates that opportunities for SLA for low proficiency learners are enhanced with the occurrences of negotiation of meaning in both SCA and F 2 F environments.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} type of digital medium on language learner communication, this study examines negotiation of meaning during interaction between native speakers and non-native speakers of English in a task-based advanced second language classroom via two forms of real-time one-to-one computer-mediated communication: video calling and instant chat-messaging. It investigates the nature, scope, and possible patterns of negotiated interaction in both types of digital communication modes. Dyadic groups consisting of non-native speakers and native speakers from two different universities collaborated in a series of one-to-one digital real-time interchanges. The digital discourse produced during the telecollaboration sessions was analysed {{within the framework of the}} negotiation of meaning theory, following the <b>Varonis</b> and Gass model of non-understandings (1985). It was found that negotiation of meaning episodes occurred in both types of real-time interaction but that they yielded their own distinct patterns of negotiated interaction.

40|$|From both interactionist and sociocultural {{perspectives}} on second language acquisition (SLA), learner-learner interactions {{provide opportunities for}} negotiation of meaning, which may facilitate their second language learning. There is yet a paucity of studies on learners' multimodal interaction and collaborative language learning investigating the effect of task design in web conferencing-based environments. This empirical research has a dual aim: 1) to explore how the teacher and learners use multiple modes (video, audio, text chat, voting, raised-hand function, emoticons and whiteboard) to make meaning in a web conferencing environment, and 2) to examine whether learners engage in negotiation of meaning in the completion of tasks in the web conferencing environment. In this study, a group of elementary level Chinese students conducted two online sessions - one jigsaw task and one information-gap task - delivered by a web conferencing platform (Blackboard Collaborate). A mixed methods approach was adopted in that a) the teacher's and learners' multimodal interactions were recorded and analysed quantitatively in order to illustrate participation patterns, b) <b>Varonis</b> and Gass's (1985) model was used to identify instances of negotiation of meaning in learner-learner interactions through an interpretive analysis of the data. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to find {{whether there}} are {{significant}} differences between the comprehension of native English accents among young Dutch students of English and if familiarity with these accents might influence comprehensibility. Many researchers found that a speaker’s accent has effect on listening assessment scores (Eisentein and Berkowitz, 1981;Anderson-Hsieh and Koehler, 1988; Bilbow, 1989; Derwing and Munro, 1997) and {{that there might be a}} connection between a degree of familiarity and comprehensibility of an accent (Gass and <b>Varonis,</b> 1984; Bradlow and Brent, 2008; Adank, Evans, Stuart-Smith and Scott, 2009; Okay and French 2014). Three native English accents were included in the test, namely British, American and Australian. By means of a listening test, corresponding to the students’ listening level, and a survey, students’ listening comprehension and familiarity with the accents were assessed. The listening test included 15 multiple choice questions and the survey consisted of four Likert scale questions. Findings include: (1) No {{significant differences between the}} assessment scores were found, each accent was equally comprehensible; (2) neither male nor female students performed significantly different; (3) there was no correlation found between the familiarity and comprehensibility of an accent...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{increased}} global interaction, {{difficulties in}} communication due to cultural differences and language proficiency must be negotiated (<b>Varonis</b> and Gass, 1985 a; 1985 b). Therefore {{the present study}} looked at how native and non-native English speakers interacted, with a particular focus on native/native conversations. Using a within-subjects design, native/native, non-native/native and non-native/non-native pairs undertook a map task where one participant directed the other along a predetermined route, negotiating ambiguous stimuli. Each participant then completed a questionnaire rating their own and their partner’s English proficiency. It was predicted that non-native/non-native pairs would take the longest and negotiate the most, whilst native/native pairs would do the opposite. The timings and number of words used per group and per director/matcher were analysed using ANOVAs, and proficiency ratings were assessed also. Finally, the checking for understanding data (Pica, Young & Doughty, 1987) was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The {{results showed that the}} non-native pairs took the longest to negotiate, whilst the non-native/native pairs took the least time and used the fewest words. Furthermore, non-native directed pairs checked for understanding more often. Although the proficiency and checking for understanding data were not significant, qualitative analysis revealed interesting differences between the three conditions nonetheless, and presented ideas for future research for facilitating such conversations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} different types of conversational interaction and SLA. Long's (1996) updated version of the interactionist hypothesis claims that implicit negative feedback, which can be obtained through negotiated interaction, facilitates SLA. Similar claims for the benefits of negotiation {{have been made by}} Pica (1994) and Gass (1997). Some support for the interaction hypothesis has been provided by studies that have explored the effects of interaction on production (Gass & <b>Varonis,</b> 1994), on lexical acquisition (Ellis, Tanaka, & Yamazaki, 1994), on the short-term outcomes of pushed output (see Swain, 1995), and for specific interactional features such as recasts (Long, Inagaki, & Ortega, 1998; Mackey & Philp, 1998). However, other studies have not found effects for interaction on grammatical development (Loschky, 1994). The central question addressed by the current study was: Can conversational interaction facilitate second language development? The study employed a pretest-posttest design. Adult ESL learners (N = 34) of varying L 1 backgrounds were divided into four experimental groups and one control group. They took part in task-based interaction. Research questions focused on the developmental outcomes of taking part in various types of interaction. Active participation in interaction and the developmental level of the learner were considered. Results of this study support claims concerning a link between interaction and grammatical development and highlight the importance of active participation in the interaction...|$|E
40|$|It {{is claimed}} that the {{augmented}} use of electronic communication has fully embraced and hampered Generation Y interactions (Wei Liu, 2012, Punitha 2008). Due to prolonged use of high technology tools (Punitha, 2008), leading them to rely on e-communication as a preferred tool of communication and somehow isolate them to a new environment (Black, 2010), an environment away from social and learning activities. It rather seems that face to face interaction tend to occur less frequent than e- communication. This study analyses the linguistic output produced by high proficiency ESL learners during face-to-face interaction, focusing on the Generation Y participants born {{in the year of}} 1990 – 1996 who have just completed secondary or higher secondary schools. Generation Y consists of those who were born in the year of 1980 – 2000 and are also known as ‘digital natives’ (Prensky, 2001). They are labelled as ‘digital natives’ (Prensky, 2001) because they are the first generation who grew along with the evolvement of high technology, naturally perceptive of digital language (Black, 2010) and highly involved in interacting with advanced technology tools and are used to interacting with their peers within a computer – mediated environment. Currently there are limited studies on negotiation of meaning that have focused on this particular group of learners (Kotter, 2003; Tam, 2009; Bower & Kawaguchi, 2011). Because of this less is known about the patterns of interaction of this particular group of ESL learners in face to face environment. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap (patterns of interaction) by analysing how high proficiency Gen Y learners negotiate meaning. whether gender plays a role in the interaction. iv The participants involved in the study were 15 females and 15 males, 30 in total and paired in a single – gender matched dyads and mixed – gender dyads. Studies have suggested that the familiarity of participants with each other could affect the output of the interactional patterns (Boulima, 1999; Robinson, 2000; <b>Varonis</b> & Gass, 1985 b). For this study the familiarity among the participants are considered moderate as they were in their first 6 months of their course and are constantly engaged in group activities. A decision making two – way tasks were utilized to elicit the data and the analysis of the data was based on a framework by <b>Varonis</b> and Gass (1985 b) and Pica et. al’s (1989) schema on negotiation routines. The results revealed that the males took greater advantage of the conversation by producing semantic modification as in more ‘talk’ for comprehensible output especially in a mixed – gender dyads as opposed to in the single matched dyads. In terms of number of words and number of turns within the negotiation routines, the males again tended to produce more than the females in both dyads setting. The females, however, have been shown to utilize the conversation for comprehensible input. The evidence points out that the females have greater tendency to acquire the language in signalling during the negotiation of meaning. Hence it can be concluded that the males from Generation Y tend to dominate the language through comprehensible output whereas the females prefer to request for more input in the conversation...|$|E
40|$|Learning the {{vocabulary}} of a language {{is one of the}} essential components of learning of a second language (L 2). In a language classroom, time factor prompts most of the teachers to conduct explicit vocabulary teaching which requires the learners to memorise a large amount of vocabulary (Alemi, Sarab & Lari, 2012). But, according to Cervatiuc (2008), although the students try to recite the new vocabulary repeatedly, it is impossible to memorise a large amount of vocabulary. Thus, the negotiation of meaning is recognised as a good alternative method in learning vocabulary (Smith, 2003; <b>Varonis</b> and Gass, 1985). The mixed-method design (Creswell, 2014) in this study utilises the quantitative method to investigate the effectiveness of synchronous computer-mediated and face-to-face interactions in English vocabulary acquisition, whilst the qualitative method is used to explore the nature of negotiation of meaning in this study. The pretest, immediate and delayed post-tests were administered to 8 synchronous computermediated dyads and 8 face-to-face dyads of participants. The dyads negotiated in Facebook or face-to-face to complete information gap tasks. The results of the post-tests indicated that although both synchronous computer-mediated and face-to-face interactions facilitate vocabulary acquisition, the 3 weeks delayed post-test shows a downward trend in the face-to-face group. In terms of negotiation of meaning, the synchronous computer-mediated environment produces slightly higher production compared to the face-to-face environment. The discourse features employed by the synchronous computer-mediated group were different from the face-to-face group during the negotiation of meaning. The findings in this study provide helpful insights for educators in terms of vocabulary teaching when designing the interactive tasks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{examines}} how trainee-teachers, during synchronous webconferencing-supported interactions, use different multimodal semiotic resources whilst offering reactive negative feedback {{so that the}} feedback is not too face-threatening for their learners (Goffman, 1972; Brown et Levinson, 1978, 1987; Kerbrart-Orecchioni, 1992). The pedagogical context is the ISMAEL telecollaboration project during which 12 trainee-teachers of French as a foreign language met for online sessions with 18 undergraduate Business students from an Irish university. The participants met for seven 40 -minute online sessions via the webconferencing platform Visu (Bétrancourt, et al., 2011). Each session was thematic and focused on Business French. During the interactions, that {{took the form of}} a ‘pedagogical conversation’ (Guichon & Drissi, 2008), the trainee-teachers were asked to give feedback on their learners’ oral productions whilst both managing the interaction and maintaining an atmosphere conducive to learning. Reactive negative feedback is offered when the trainee-teachers wish to highlight differences between the target language and a learner’s output (Long, 1996). It may be more or less intrusive depending on whether it is explicit, in the case of overt error correction, or implicit, due to communication breakdown. We use a qualitative approach to explore how verbal softeners are employed during feedback sequences alongside other semiotic resources (Jewitt, 2009 : Kress, 2010) in order to counteract the potential face damage of the feedback. Of relevance to the present study are the webcam recordings of two sessions for which multimodal transcriptions were made using ELAN (Sloetjes & Wittenburg 2008). Speech and text chat turns were transcribed, a collection of feedback sequences was delimited (cf. <b>Varonis</b> & Gass, 1985) and then multimodal resources under investigation (gaze, gestures, facial mimics [...] .) were annotated. The study enables {{a better understanding of the}} interplay between the different semiotic resources in synchronous videoconferencing interactions and offers suggestions to enhance the content of teacher-training programmes for teachers...|$|E
40|$|Pausing effects {{how well}} {{listeners}} understand and attend to meaning in discourse. This study investigates {{the effects of}} three different pause treatments (irregular placement, increased frequency, and longer length) on comprehensibility ratings. <b>Varonis</b> and Gass (1982) found that a complex interaction of factors affected comprehensibility ratings. These included pronunciation, grammar, familiarity and fluency. While many of these features have been investigated (Anderson-Hsieh, Johnson, 2 ̆ 6 Koehler, 1992; Derwing 2 ̆ 6 Munro, 1997; Hahn, 2004; Isaacs 2 ̆ 6 Trofimovich, 2012; Kang, 2010; Munro 2 ̆ 6 Derwing, 1995), pausing has received little attention. In this study, an extended NNS speech sample with native-like pausing was manipulated, creating three experimental recordings, one with irregularly placed pauses, one with increased pause frequency, and one with longer pauses. Forty-three undergraduates in four different class groups listened {{to each of the}} pause treatments and rated them for comprehensibility. In addition to comprehensibility measures, participants also rated each treatment for fluency based on Griffiths 2 ̆ 7 (1991) proposition that pausing is often tied to fluency. This allowed for a comparison of the effects of pausing on comprehensibility to those on fluency. Additionally, this study investigated the strength of Kang 2 ̆ 7 s (2010) revised comprehensibility instrument. The results showed that irregular pause placement was the greatest detriment to comprehensibility, followed by pause frequency. These results may be explained by the psycholinguistic model of language processing which assumes we process language in chunks. When NNSs pause irregularly, NS listeners must process each word individually to make meaning instead of processing the chunk through expected phrasing. This, in turn, causes lower comprehensibility ratings. These results advocate for the teaching of formulaic language in the ESL/EFL classroom so that attention to pause placement in conjunction with work on fluency facilitates more comprehensible speech...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of {{authentic}} subtitled similar task videos (ASSTVs) {{and their relationship to}} second language negotiation of meaning and language production among non-native speakers of English in an online task-based language learning (TBLL) environment. Over the course of two weeks, twenty intermediate nonnative speakers (NNSs) of English from the English Language Institute at Texas A&M University engaged in four communicative tasks in pairs using an online TBLL environment designed specifically for this study, and a chat tool in WebCT Vista, a course management system provided by the university. ASSTVs were videotaped and integrated into the online TBLL environment. Participants were divided into two groups, each of which consisted of five dyads, to test the effects of ASSTVs. Five dyads were provided with the ASSTVs and the remaining five dyads were not provided with them before the task completion process. The first section of this study examines the effects of ASSTVs on negotiation of meaning, and the second section examines the effects on language production. The amount of negotiation of meaning was calculated through the negotiation of meaning sequences model developed by Gass and <b>Varonis</b> and revised for online communication by Smith. Language production was investigated in terms of fluency and complexity with regard to lexical and syntactic complexity. A detailed analysis of the data from the chat-scripts showed that NNSs engage in more negotiation of meaning and produce more fluent and lexically diverse language when provided with the ASSTVs than NNSs who were not provided with them. Based on these findings, this study concludes that using ASSTVs in an online TBLL environment is a viable and effective tool for promoting negotiation of meaning and language production in terms of fluency and lexical complexity...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the claim}} that nonnative {{speakers}} 2 ̆ 7 (NNSs) participation in negotiated interaction facilitates comprehension and production processes considered necessary for successful second language (L 2) acquisition (Long 1981, 1985), this study investigated two NNS boys as they interacted with each other, other NNS children, and NS peers. The study focused on the incidence of several negotiation features, e. g. comprehension checks and clarification and confirmation requests, {{and their impact on}} the boys 2 ̆ 7 L 2 production. Based on the finding that adult NNSs negotiated more with each other than with adult NSs (<b>Varonis</b> and Gass 1985), the boys were expected to obtain more opportunities for negotiation from each other and from the other NNSs than from NS peers. Also, based on {{the claim that}} syntactic structures develop during negotiation in an L 2 (Hatch 1978), the boys were expected to produce more linguistically modified than unmodified syntactic structures. ^ The data consisted of audiotaped speech samples of the boys in interaction with each other, two NNS children, and three KS peers in informal settings. These data were coded for negotiation and syntactic modifications which were then compared across the three interaction types. ^ As was predicted, {{it was found that the}} brothers responded with more modified than unmodified syntactic structures during their negotiation. However, contrary to predictions, they received more opportunities for negotiation with NSs than with other NNSs. ^ The finding that NNSs obtained more opportunities for negotiated interaction from NSs than from other NNSs has implications for L 2 learning. As NNS children often out-number NS students in the U. S. public schools, they are more likely to interact with other NNSs in their classrooms. Although this study has shown that such interaction provides opportunities for negotiation relevant to language learning, it has also shown that opportunities for NNSs to interact with NSs may be a more efficient resource for their learning. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by theoretical questions {{about the role of}} the linguistic environment on second language acquisition (SLA) (Long, 1996). The study extends existing research by examining three theoretical perspectives on interaction and conditions necessary for SLA. The conditions investigated are input, output, and negotiation. Specifically, this dissertation examines how input processing (VanPatten, 1996), “bare-bones” output (Swain 2 ̆ 6 Lapkin, 1995) and negotiation (Pica 1994) may facilitate ESL interlanguage development. Interlanguage development is investigated with reference to a well-attested implicational hierarchy of ESL question formation (Pienemann 2 ̆ 6 Johnston 1987). ^ Subjects were placed in one of four groups: input processing, bare-bones output, negotiation, or control. Three types of assessment were used: a verbal production test (Mackey, 1994), a written word order test, and a preference (grammaticality judgement) test. A pre test, post test, delayed post test design was implemented. ^ Results from the oral communication test indicated no significant positive effect for either the input treatment or the output treatment A comparison of the negotiation group with the other two treatment groups at the post test found a significant difference. However when compared with a control group, results favoring the negotiation group were not significant at the post test. ^ Important information was gained from post hoc analyses. These revealed (a) significant development for subjects in the negotiation group over the entire period of the study, and (b) a significant delayed gain for subjects in the negotiation group. These gains were not displayed in the results of subjects in the other groups. The results lend empirical support to the proposal that interaction and negotiation may have a delayed effect (Gass 2 ̆ 6 <b>Varonis,</b> 1994). ^ Although the results raise questions about the benefits of the input processing and bare-bones output treatments for development of ESL question forms while highlighting the benefits of negotiation, they should not be interpreted to discount claims about the benefits or necessity of the theoretical orientations with which they are associated. Instead, the methodology and results point out the difficulty of creating treatments and assessment tools which adequately test the theoretical constructs without creating confounds. ...|$|E
