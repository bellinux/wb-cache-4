5000|$|The major {{category}} {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions resulting from human activities is carbon dioxide. Several other primary gases also include methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. Greenhouse gas sources resulting from project construction activities are typically generated from transportation of materials to the project site and petrol based equipment used during construction of the project itself. Stationary sources emit greenhouse gases from a single point source such as a smoke stack. Stationary source examples include coal- or gas-fired power plants, incinerators, refineries, bakeries, or chemical plants. Projects that are not stationary sources such as residential and commercial developments, schools, and related infrastructure can also contribute to increases in greenhouse gases. These projects emit greenhouse gases from sources such as <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage</b> trips to site, energy to run the facility, and landscape maintenance equipment. Land use conversion can reduce vegetation sequestration of carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|With {{the growth}} of {{suburbanization}} {{and the spread of}} people living outside the city this can cause negative impacts on the environment. Suburbanization has been linked to the increase in <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage,</b> increase land use, and increase in residential energy consumption. From these factors of suburbanization it has then caused a degradation of air quality, increase usage of natural resources like water and oil, as well as increased amounts of greenhouse gas. With the increased use of vehicles to commute to and from the work place this causes increased use of oil and gas as well as increase in emissions. With the increase in emissions from vehicles this then can cause air pollution and degrades the air quality of an area. Suburbanization is growing which causes an increase in housing development which causes an increase in land consumption and available land. Suburbanization has also been linked to increase in natural resource use like water to meet residents’ demands and to maintain suburban lawns. Also with the increase in technology and consumptions of residents there is an increase in energy consumption with the amount of electricity used by residents.|$|E

50|$|Schemes {{are often}} {{specially}} marketed {{with a specific}} brand separately from other standard local bus services. This is sometimes not necessarily using the name park and ride. Public transport schemes mostly operate at a net loss, with the budgetary cost justified by the reduction in traffic congestion and reduced need for central parking spaces. Generally, the car parking is free, with revenue for the scheme being achieved through fares or travel passes taken by the bus operator. Initially heavily lobbied for by the environmentalists, increasingly the net benefits of park and ride schemes to the environment have been questioned in studies examining the effect of schemes on overall <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileages</b> and passenger travelling behaviour.|$|R

The age composition of the rolling fleet has been carefully modeled, deducting about one quarter of vehicles still registered but actually out-of-service. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage</b> is calibrated to the national fuel consumption which is essential to limit uncertainties. Sensitivity analyses reveal the primary impact of the emission factors and the secondary influence of <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage</b> and stock composition on total emissions.

40|$|This paper models {{the effects}} of three {{different}} options for domestic waste collection using data from three Hampshire authorities: (i) joint working between neighbouring waste collection authorities; (ii) basing vehicles at waste disposal sites; (iii) alternate weekly collection of residual waste and dry recyclables.

Alternate weekly collection was modelled to reduce <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage</b> by around 8 % and time taken by 14 %, when compared with a typical scenario of weekly collection of residual and fortnightly collection of recyclable waste.

40|$|Abstract. Rebound effects {{measure the}} behaviorally induced offset in the {{reduction}} of energy consumption following efficiency improvements. Using both panel estimation and quantile-regression methods on household travel diary data collected in Germany between 1997 and 2009, this study investigates the heterogeneity of the rebound effect in private transport. With the average rebound effect being {{in the range of}} 57 % to 62 %, our results are in line with a recent German study by FRONDEL, PETERS, and VANCE (2008), but are substantially larger than those obtained from other studies. Furthermore, our quantile-regression results indicate that the magnitude of estimated fuel price elasticities – from which rebound effects can be derived – depends inversely on the household’s driving intensity: Households with low <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage</b> exhibit fuel price elasticities, and hence rebound effects, that are significantly larger than those for households with high <b>vehicle</b> <b>mileage...</b>|$|E

40|$|Maintaining {{the quality}} of {{lubricant}} oil quality can guarantee maximum ability in engine functions of vehicles. Currently, {{the quality of}} lubricant oil is primarily determined by two factors, namely, <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>mileage</b> and duration. However, these judgments are inaccurate {{because there are many}} other factors like conductivity, humidity, temperature and viscosity that may affect the oil quality. In addition, improper treatment of used lubricant oil will greatly pollute the environment. From the investigation carried out, some parameters were suitably identified to determine the current quality of lubricant oil. Those parameters were error and change of error of lubricant oil temperature that were used as the inputs to a fuzzy logic system. The expert knowledge was compiled to justify the human expertise. This developed fuzzy logic system was able to function on its own by using Prolog programming language. The language eased the representation of rule-based knowledge so that its inference can be performed naturally. The obtained data of temperature relation to the lubricant oil quality were applied to the developed membership function of the the fuzzy logic system and had gone through several stages to obtain crisp values representing the lubricant oil quality. The results obtained shows that 90...|$|R
