50|$|Some 4×5-inch {{films were}} {{previously}} available in single-shot, pre-loaded, disposable envelopes {{which can be}} conveniently loaded into a special <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> in daylight (Kodak Readyload and Fuji Quickload). Each manufacturer made a <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> for its system's envelopes; the Polaroid 545/545i instant <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> also worked with both systems' films. In addition to eliminating dust problems, these daylight-loading systems reduced the amount of gear a photographer needed to carry to only a single <b>film</b> <b>holder.</b> However, as of 2014, no manufacturer offers quick-loading envelopes.|$|R
50|$|To {{take the}} photograph, the {{photographer}} pulls back the ground glass and slides the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> into its place. The shutter is then closed and cocked, the shutter speed and aperture set. The photographer removes the darkslide {{that covers the}} sheet of film in the <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> and triggers the shutter to make the exposure. Finally, the photographer replaces the darkslide and removes the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> with the exposed film.|$|R
5000|$|In place, {{the dark}} slide is in a <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> or magazine. <b>Film</b> <b>holders</b> usually refer to cut sheet film and {{magazines}} refer to roll <b>film.</b> Vintage <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> {{were made of}} wood and held in place either photo-sensitized plates or photo sensitive film. In either case, the construction must be such to reduce light leaks, or any unwanted light from striking the <b>film</b> until the <b>holder</b> is {{held in place by}} a camera and considered [...] "light tight". Some holders held only one piece of light sensitive material, some are double sided and hold two pieces of film.|$|R
50|$|Backs: The Omegaflex <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> {{interchanges}} {{with the}} Omega M, 100 (Press 2 in Japan) and 200, and permits mid-roll {{changes on the}} Omegaflex, M, and 200. The earlier Koni Omega Rapid (Press in Japan) <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> is not compatible with the above, and does not permit mid-roll changes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Film</b> <b>holders</b> that adapt {{rollfilm}} to {{sheet film}} cameras are usually called film backs. Film backs for 4&times;5 inch cameras are particularly common - {{there is little}} point in taking 6&times;9 cm pictures on a 20 x 25 cm camera. Horseman, Linhof, Graflex, and other manufacturers have made roll <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> in 6&times;7, 6&times;8, 6&times;9, 6&times;12, and 6&times;17 cm formats. Some models can slip under the ground glass like a normal sheet <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> while others require that the photographer replace the ground glass with the roll holder.|$|R
50|$|Special <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> and {{accessories}} can fit {{in place of}} standard <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> for specific purposes. A Grafmatic, for example, can fit six sheets of film {{in the space of}} an ordinary two-sheet holder, and some light meters have an attachment that inserts into the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> slot on the camera back so the photographer can measure light that falls at a specific point on the film plane. The entire film holder/back assembly is often an industry standard Graflex back, removable so accessories like roll-film holders and digital imagers can be used without altering focus.|$|R
50|$|To use sheet film, the {{photographer}} places {{a sheet of}} film, emulsion side out, into a <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> in the dark, and closes the dark slide over the loaded <b>film.</b> Next, the <b>holder</b> is inserted into a large-format camera, and the dark slide {{is removed from the}} holder. The exposure is made, the dark slide is replaced, and the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> is removed from the camera.|$|R

5000|$|Absence of {{international}} standards for <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> beyond 11" [...] x 14" [...] (30 cm x 40 cm) - this is rarely an issue as <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> are custom built to match cameras. An {{exception to this}} is 14" [...] x 17" [...] - the size of X-Ray and MRI films - which is indeed an international standard.|$|R
50|$|When using a sheet <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> {{the device}} is {{inserted}} into the camera, often a view camera, and the dark slide is withdrawn, making the film available for exposure. After the exposure has been made, the dark slide is reinserted into the <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> and {{the device is}} removed from the camera for later processing of the exposed film.|$|R

25|$|The 8 × 10 cameras he {{preferred}} were large and heavy, {{and due to}} the weight {{and the cost of}} the film he never carried more than twelve sheet <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> with him.

30|$|Bone {{level was}} {{measured}} by a single reader on standardized periapical radiographs taken at baseline (day 0), suture removal (7 – 14  days after surgery), provisional restoration, final restoration, and at the 12 -month follow-up. Radiographs were standardized by using customized <b>film</b> <b>holders.</b> A commercially available <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> was employed (e.g., System (Dentsply Rinn, Elgin, IL, USA)), RWT® window x-ray system (Kentzler-Kaschner Dental, Ellwangen, Germany) or similar). The film was placed almost parallel to the implants. Indentations of the incisal edge of the implant and of the neighboring teeth (where possible) were taken with impression material to improve reproducibility. The customized radiographic holder was fabricated by putting autopolymerizing resin to the biting plate of the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> and adapted its shape to the patient dentition in order to standardize {{the position of the}} X-ray film. The radiograph was exposed once the resin had polymerized, and the stent removed and stored for future use.|$|R

5000|$|The Speed Graphic {{was a slow}} camera. Setting {{the focal}} plane shutter speed {{required}} selecting both a slit width and a spring tension. Each exposure required the photographer to change the <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> open the lens shutter, cock the focal plane shutter, remove the dark slide from the inserted <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> focus the camera, [...] and release the focal plane shutter. Conversely, if the lens shutter were used, the focal plane shutter (on the Speed Graphic and Pacemaker Graphic models with both shutters) had to be opened prior to cocking using the [...] "T" [...] or TIME setting, and then releasing the shutter in the lens. If indoors, the photographer also had to change the flashbulb. Each <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> contained one or two pieces of sheet film {{which had to be}} loaded into the <b>film</b> <b>holder</b> in complete darkness. Faster shooting could be achieved with the Grafmatic <b>film</b> <b>holder,</b> which is a six sheet film [...] "changer" [...] that holds each sheet in a septum. [...] Even faster exposures could be taken if the photographer was shooting film packs of 12 exposures, or later 16 exposures (discontinued in the late 1970s). With film packs one could shoot as fast as one could pull the tab and cock the shutter, and film packs could be loaded in daylight. A roll film adapter that used 120 or 220 film was available for 2.25 x 3.25, 3.25 x 4.25 and 4 x 5 inch cameras that permitted 8 to 20 exposures per roll, depending on the model of the adapter. Photographers had to be conservative and anticipate when the action was about to take place to take the right picture. The cry, [...] "Just one more!" [...] if a shot was missed was common. President Harry Truman introduced the White House photographers as the [...] "Just One More Club." ...|$|R

50|$|The 23 Standard was {{a version}} of the {{original}} without the rear bellows introduced in 1965. The name was changed to reflect the camera's ability to use 2×3 film (with the right <b>film</b> <b>holder).</b>|$|R
50|$|Polaroid {{produced}} {{the widest range}} of instant sheet and pack film, but discontinued all production in 2008, leaving Fujifilm as the only producer of instant film and backs. The Polaroid 545, the lighter and more modern 545i, and the 545 Pro backs were 4&times;5 inch instant sheet <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> that many photographers used. New55 Holdings, LLC started producing {{a black and white}} P/N film for the 545 and 545i backs. This new instant sheet film produces a black and white negative and a positive image. The older Polaroid 550 packfilm back can take Fuji FP-100C film (3.25x4.25 inches), which was the last product of this type and was discontinued in February 2016. Polaroid also produced 8&times;10 inch <b>film</b> <b>holders</b> and <b>films.</b> Polaroid produced 10-sheet 4&times;5 inch instant <b>film</b> packs and <b>holders.</b>|$|R
