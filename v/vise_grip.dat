5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the main event from SmackDown, a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, where, Batista, defended the title against The Great Khali. In the match, two giant wooden cages {{surrounded}} the ring, and, to win, a competitor had to escape both structures. After both men prevented the other from escaping, Khali utilized a leather strap as a weapon. Batista later used the leather strap and attempted to climb over inner cage, but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista's head with a <b>Vise</b> <b>Grip.</b> Khali then called for a door to be opened but Batista struck him with a low blow. The match ended when Khali had climbed over the inner cage and began climbing the outer cage. Batista then mounted the inner cage, jumped to the second cage and, overtaking Khali, climbed to the ground, thereby winning the match and retaining the title.|$|E

40|$|Augmented Reality (AR), {{the ability}} to present the real-world, overlayed with digital information, is quickly gaining {{popularity}} {{for a number of}} applications ranging from entertainment to manufacturing. Improved hardware and miniaturization along with robust sensor processing techniques have made AR a viable technology on a variety of high-end and commodity devices. The intention of any AR system is to “augment” a user’s reality, with digital content, in order to aid him/her in a particular task. This task can vary from analyzing a factory layout in its intended physical space to following directions on your windshield while driving. Surgeons use AR technology to locate tumors on the fly during operations. The entertainment industry has used AR from hand-held games to major attractions. It has been used in all forms of product development from design to assembly to maintenance to guide users through complex processes. Particularly in manufacturing, these AR guided assembly viewers have been developed and found to benefit end-users considerably. It has reduced the cognitive load on the user, reduced assembly times, increased quality, and reduced training time. AR guided assembly viewers have also, in some cases, removed the advantage that experts have over non-experts. However, authoring the content within an AR guided assembly viewer is the biggest obstacle to its widespread adoption. Issues hindering authoring include: 1) inadequate software skillset of the person responsible for authoring, 2) complex hardware and software systems, and 3) the process being time and resource consuming. To mitigate the various issues in authoring AR guided assembly content, researchers have proposed a number of solutions without much success. Solutions include: 1) using markers placed in the real environment as reference for AR systems to reflect the necessary content, 2) creating content solely in a virtual environment, 3) performing gestures that facilitate content creation, and 4) using sensors (e. g., GPS) to locate the view of the user and overlay content. Based on a literature review conducted of the numerous solutions available, various gaps were identified in the context of AR guided assembly and formed into three research issues. They are: 1) establishing automatic registration of parts during an expert demonstration, 2) ensuring sufficient domain level expertise is incorporated into AR guided assembly instructions, and 3) evaluating the instructions generated by an authoring tool for accuracy and quality. To direct the creation of new AR guided assembly authoring methods that address the aforementioned research issues a classification technique, established by Hampshire et. al. was used (also known as Hampshire classification). Along with the Hampshire classification, the various factors necessary to successfully author AR content are categorized according to their specific environment, interaction metaphors, and author’s domain knowledge. All of these were used to support the design choices made in the proposed authoring technique known as expert demonstration. This technique automatically generates the various assembly steps and part movements by analyzing 3 D point cloud data generated from an expert who performs the assembly (i. e. “demonstrates” it). Through this demonstration, a corresponding skin model is generated and used to detect and remove the expert’s hands in the captured frames. Image analysis is also performed to remove the scene background as well as identify and track each part in the assembly. The analysis results in the detection of each individual assembly step, each part location, and each assembly path. This information is used to generate AR guided assembly work instructions. Skin detection is a critical component of the expert demonstration authoring technique, as without filtering out the hands detecting, identifying and tracking the parts becomes more difficult. Current skin detection techniques like Gaussian mixture models require clean data and are unable to handle noisy data without overfitting the model. This {{led to the development of}} a novel algorithm called particle swarm optimized Gaussian mixture model (PSOGMM). PSOGMM was designed to take only a single input variable describing the amount of noise in the system. It was compared to traditional GMM with two independent datasets. To illustrate the authoring of AR guided assembly work instructions, AREDA (Augmented Reality via Expert Demonstration Authoring), an AR authoring tool was developed. It was divided into two phases known as the demonstration phase and the refinement phase. The demonstration phase consisted of determining the various calibration parameters (background, area, and skin) as well as recording and processing the assembly demonstration. The refinement phase consisted of taking these automatically generated AR work instructions and fixing mistakes during the demonstration phase, refining orientation and positions of the 3 D models, and adding other forms of information like textual instructions or images. AREDA was tested on three assemblies of increasing complexity, namely DUPLO blocks, a 3 D printed <b>grip</b> <b>vise,</b> and a laptop...|$|R

5000|$|Champagne {{was born}} and raised in Roseville, California. She got her start at 9 years old singing with Bob Ringwald (father of film star Molly Ringwald) at the Placer County Fair. Despite a chaotic and {{sometimes}} painful childhood, her grandfather, former Detroit Lions football star Ernie Caddel encouraged her to pursue singing and acting as a career. After early attempts at singing with local rock bands, including 'The Innocents' with Ric Walz-Smith and featuring then boyfriend, Eric Martin, vocalist of the band, Mr Big. In Sacramento, Connie starred in a summer music workshop production of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' with Eric Martin. She starred in the role of Mary Magdalene as Kelly Brock. Champagne spent the early 80s as a vocalist for avant garde rock group Clocks of Paradise which featured Michael Belfer of The Sleepers, Mark Isham, Brian MacLeod, and Benjamin Bossi from Romeo Void, which led her to a stint is as a back-up for singer for Debora Iyall, and eventually Romeo Void. She toured extensively with Iyall, including tours with Cyndi Lauper and Jim Carroll.Champagne switched gears and decided to study acting, landing her first role at the San Francisco’s Magic Theater, in a play [...] "Love In the 3rd Degree”, written by noted actress O-Lan Jones. After performances at Theater on the Square, Climate Theater, and Theater Artaud, Champagne decided to study acting formally and earned her MFA from the American Conservatory Theater, where she also taught acting to youth for a number of years. During this time met former Cockette Scrumbly Koldewyn and the 2 formed the neo-cabaret group “Connie Champagne and her Tiny Bubbles,” which won numerous accolades include the SF Wammie Award for Outstanding Cabaret Performer. She also graduated from Mills College with a BA in Theater Arts. Champagne was originally named “Kelly Brock,” but the nickname “Champagne” stuck and is now her legal name. Prior to Champagne’s irreverent approach to the “Great American Songbook,” cabaret artists primarily stuck to one genre, and Champagne “broke the rules.” Champagne’s unique repertoire incorporated more modern songs written by artists such as Bob Dylan, David Bowie, Lou Reed, and Patti Smith and has since been emulated by many artists who came later including Justin Bond and Paula West. In the 1990s she recorded and toured with swing pioneers The New Morty Show, featuring band leader Morty Okin and singer <b>Vise</b> <b>Grip</b> including a 1-year engagement at the New York New York Hotel in Las Vegas, celebrating the music of Keely Smith and Louis Prima, Anita O’Day, and Louis Jordan.

40|$|Communalism and its {{cognates}} {{continue to}} exercise a <b>vise</b> <b>grip</b> on the African intellectual imaginary. Whether {{the discussion is}} in ethics or social philosophy, in metaphysics or even, on occasion, epistemology, the play of communalism, a concept expounded in the next section, {{is so strong that}} it is difficult to escape its ubiquity. In spite of this, there is little serious analysis of the concept and its implications in the contemporary context. Yet, at no other time than now can a long-suffering continent use some robust debates on its multiple inheritances regarding how to organize life and thought in order to deliver a better future for its population. Given the continual resort to communalism as, among others, the standard of ethical behavior, the blueprint for restoring Africans to wholeness and organizing our social life, as well as a template for political reorganization across the continent, one cannot overemphasize the importance of contributing some illumination to the discourse surrounding the idea. This essay seeks to offer a little illumination in this respect. Additionally, it offers a criticism of what all—proponents and antagonists alike—take to be a defensible version of communalism: moderate communalism. I shall be arguing that communalism, generally, has a problem with the individual. And the African variant of it, mostly subscribed to by the African scholars discussed below and defended by them as something either peculiar to or special in Africa, has an even harder time accommodating the individual. Yet, as history shows, until the modern age in which individualism is the principle of social ordering and mode of social living, a situation that privileges the individual, above all, various forms of communalism never really accorded the individual the recognition and forbearances that we now commonly associate with the idea. The strongest variants of moderate communalism discussed here have a difficult time taking the individual seriously. I am not aware of anyone else ever having made such a case.  These arguments are offered to show that (1) Africa and Africans need to take individualism seriously and (2) such have been the historical transformation that our diverse societies have undergone in the course of the last half a millennium that the types of communalism that are on offer do not appear to take this fact of radical change with the necessary urgency...|$|E
