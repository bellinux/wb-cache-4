40|$|Abstract: The alpine test, {{which is}} carried out by observing the {{temperature}} change on the brake parts of a vehicle during a high-mountain (the Gross Glockner Mountain) descent, is attracting much attention in Europe as it is conducted in extreme conditions. Consequently, many vehicle manufacturers targeting globalization are {{making an effort to}} comply with the standards of the alpine test. The test focuses on the determination of the maximum temperature of the disc and brake fluid. While rolling down a high mountain, the brake system experiences a rapid temperature change due to repetitive or continuous braking. This may in turn lead to symptoms such as fade, thermal judder, thermal crack, and <b>vapour</b> <b>lock.</b> The temperature rise {{is the result of the}} transfer of the frictional heat between the disc and pad to the brake parts. This study proposes a numerical method for predicting the temperature change of the brake system by using frictional heat division and one-dimensional heat transfer. This method can predict the temperature change not only in the disc but also in the brake fluid. Using the presented method, the alpine test result is predicted and subsequently validated by comparison with the reported experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Alternative fuels on {{internal}} combustion engine (ICE) recently has become an attention due to the concern for environmental protection, and needs on reducing dependency on fossil fuels and meeting the current stringent regulation. Alcohol fuel {{is one of the}} attractive alternative fuels as it can be produced from renewable resources and is oxygenated. Methanol fuel is a well-known alcohol fuel that can be blended at the lower blending ratio with gasoline and produce better engine operation in spark ignition engine. However, there is a problem related to its methanol properties, especially on its energy content and <b>vapour</b> <b>lock</b> characteristics. Alcohol with higher carbon number such as iso-butanol has high energy content and is able to displace more petroleum gasoline compared to the methanol-gasoline blended fuel. In this study, the focus on the effect of the iso-butanol additive in the methanol-gasoline fuel of unmodified spark ignition engines. A lower ratio of methanol-gasoline blends (M 5) was blended with the iso-butanol additive for 5 to 15 % with 5 % increment compared with base gasoline fuel. Tests were conducted at constant load (100 %) with a variable of lower engine speed range from 1000 rpm to 2500 rpm. The results indicate that as for engine performance, M 5 B 15 displayed improvement in engine brake power, BTE (brake thermal efficiency), and EGT (exhaust gas temperature) compared to other blended fuels. Nevertheless, there is a higher fuel consumption was recorded for all methanol-gasoline blended fuels with iso-butanol additive compared to base gasoline fuel. In terms of engine emissions, M 5 B 15 gives a significant reduction in CO and HC emissions compared to base gasoline fuel. However, the increasing trend projected by NOx and CO 2 emissions had been recorded in all iso-butanol additive in methanol-gasoline fuels with M 5 B 15 exerting the highest emissions. It can be concluded that iso-butanol additives are a viable option to be blended with existing lower ratio of methanol-gasoline for spark ignition engine operation as an alternative fuel...|$|E

During {{the second half of}} 1943, production of the Merlin 63 powered F Mk IX was discontinued in favour of the Merlin 66 powered LF Mk IX. Early production Spitfire IXs suffered from <b>vapour</b> <b>locks</b> in the fuel lines resulting from fuel evaporating if the aircraft was parked in direct sunlight. As a result of this the gun-camera was moved from the port wingroot to the starboard wingroot and a fuel cooler, fed by a small round air-intake was fitted in its place. This fuel cooler was also fitted to early PR Mk XIs ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this investigation, the Cotton Seed Oil Methyl Ester (CSOME) was {{prepared}} by transesterificationusing cotton seed oil, methyl alcohol and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst. At different preheatedtemperatures, {{the performance and}} exhaust emissions of a diesel engine fuelled with preheated CSOMEwere obtained and compared with neat diesel. Experiments were conducted at different load conditions ina single cylinder four stroke DI diesel engine. CSOME was preheated to temperatures namely 40, 60, 80, 100 oC before it was fuelled to the engine. From the test the brake thermal efficiency (BTE), brake specificfuel consumption (BSFC), smoke density, CO, HC, NOx emissions were evaluated. The results provedthat the preheated CSOME leads favourable on BTE and CO, HC emissions when it is heated up to 80 oC. At {{the same time the}} NOx emission was increased. But at preheated temperature of 100 °C, a considerabledecrease in the BTE and BSFC were observed due to the <b>vapour</b> <b>locking</b> in the fuel line caused by vapourformation due to higher temperature of CSOME. On the whole the results shows that CSOME preheatedup to 800 C can be used as an alternate fuel for diesel fuel without any significant modification in expenseof increased NOx emissions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{dissipation}} of {{the tidal}} energy deposited on eccentric planets may induce a heating {{of the planet}} that affects its atmospheric thermal structure. Here we study the influence of tidal heating on the atmospheric composition of the eccentric (e = 0. 16) "hot Neptune" GJ 436 b, for which inconclusive chemical abundances are retrieved from multiwavelength photometric observations carried out during primary transit and secondary eclipse. We build up a one-dimensional model of GJ 436 b's atmosphere in the vertical direction and compute the pressure-temperature and molecular abundances profiles for various plausible internal temperatures of the planet (up to 560 K) and metallicities (from solar to 100 times solar), using a radiative-convective model and a chemical model which includes thermochemical kinetics, vertical mixing, and photochemistry. We find that the CO/CH 4 abundance ratio increases with metallicity and tidal heating, and ranges from 1 / 20 to 1000 within the ranges of metallicity and internal temperature explored. Water <b>vapour</b> <b>locks</b> most of the oxygen and reaches a very high abundance, whatever the metallicity and internal temperature of the planet. The CO 2 /H 2 O abundance ratio increases dramatically with metallicity, and takes values between 1 e- 5 - 1 e- 4 with solar elemental abundances and 0. 1 for a metallicity 100 times solar. None of the atmospheric models based on solid physical and chemical grounds provide a fully satisfactory agreement with available observational data, although the comparison of calculated spectra and observations seem to point to models with a high metallicity and efficient tidal heating, in which high CO/CH 4 abundance ratios and warm temperatures in the dayside atmosphere are favoured...|$|R
40|$|The atomic fine-structure {{constant}} is {{a fundamental}} parameter that describes the coupling strength between charged particles and electromagnetic fields. Our group's objective is to measure this constant to an accuracy of 0. 5 ppb based on precise measurements of the 23 PJ fine-structure splittings of atomic helium. To measure the fine-structure splittings, we utilize an excitation scheme which requires two lasers locked to atomic resonances at wavelengths of 1083 nm and 707 nm. The accuracy of the fine-structure splitting measurement requires both laser frequencies to be stably locked to high precision. To achieve the desired accuracy of these laser locks, we have incorporated a saturated absorption setup in a dichroic atomic <b>vapour</b> laser <b>locking</b> (DAVLL) scheme. Using this locking technique, we have obtained a lock stability of ± 40 kHz for the 1083 -nm laser and ± 140 kHz for the 707 -nm laser, with the lasers remaining locked for a time scale of several weeks...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new apparatus designed to study cold, ultracold, and quantum degenerate mixtures of rubidium and caesium atoms. The Rb- Cs mixture is prepared using a double magneto-optical trap (MOT) {{system in which}} a two-species pyramid MOT acts {{as a source of}} cold atoms for a 'science' MOT. The first results of experiments on the magneto-optically trapped mixture are presented, including measurements of trap loss rates due to single-species and interspecies inelastic collisions. A technique for reducing interspecies loss by spatially separating the MOTs during loading is described. This technique allows 50 - 50 mixtures of Rb and Cs atoms to be loaded into a magnetic trap at close to their respective maximum single- species atom numbers. Alternatively, one species can be loaded with arbitrarily small amounts of the other. The displaced MOT technique is thus аn excellent starting point for investigations of interspecies Feshbach resonances and sympathetic cooling of Rb-Cs mixtures in magnetic and optical traps. In addition, a model of polarisation spectroscopy based on numerical integration of population rate equations is described. Theoretical polarisation spectra generated by the model are shown to agree with experimental spectra for the F = I + 1 / 2 → F' transitions in Rb and Cs. An investigation of the sub-Doppler dichroic atomic <b>vapour</b> laser <b>locking</b> (DAVLL) technique demonstrates how locking signals can be optimised for the Rb D 2 transitions. The role of polarisation purity in generating the spectra is discussed, and impurities are modeled using a Jones matrix approach. Comparisons with polarisation spectroscopy and DAVLL are used to enhance understanding of atom-light interactions in spectroscopic systems, and indicate methods for optimising locking signals for use in cold atom experiments.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{evanescent}} field sensing techniques of tapered optical nanofibres and microspherical resonators are investigated. This includes {{evanescent field}} spectroscopy of a silica nanofibre in a rubidium vapour; thermo-optical tuning of Er:Yb co-doped phosphate glass microspheres; optomechanical properties of microspherical pendulums; and the fabrication and characterisation of borosilicate microbubble resonators. Doppler-broadened and sub-Doppler absorption spectroscopic techniques are performed around the D 2 transition (780. 24 nm) of rubidium using the evanescent field produced {{at the waist}} of a tapered nanofibre with input probe powers as low as 55 nW. Doppler-broadened Zeeman shifts and a preliminary dichroic atomic <b>vapour</b> laser <b>lock</b> (DAVLL) line shape are also observed via the nanofibre waist with an applied magnetic field of 60 G. This device {{has the potential for}} laser frequency stabilisation while also studying the effects of atom-surface interactions. A non-invasive thermo-optical tuning technique of Er:Yb co-doped microspheres to specific arbitrary wavelengths is demonstrated particularly to 1294 nm and the 5 S 1 / 2 F= 3 to 5 P 3 / 2 Fʹ= 4 laser cooling transition of 85 Rb. Reversible tuning ranges of up to 474 GHz and on resonance cavity timescales on the order of 100 s are reported. This procedure has prospective applications for sensing a variety of atomic or molecular species in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) experiments. The mechanical characteristics of a silica microsphere pendulum with a relatively low spring constant of 10 - 4 Nm- 1 are explored. A novel method of frequency sweeping the motion of the pendulum to determine its natural resonance frequencies while overriding its sensitivity to environmental noise is proposed. An estimated force of 0. 25 N is required to actuate the pendulum by a displacement of (1 - 2) μm. It is suggested that this is of sufficient magnitude to be experienced between two evanescently coupled microspheres (photonic molecule) and enable spatial trapping of the micropendulum. Finally, single-input borosilicate microbubble resonators with diameters < 100 μm are fabricated using a CO 2 laser. Optical whispering gallery mode spectra are observed via evanescent coupling with a tapered fibre. A red-shift of (4 - 22) GHz of the resonance modes is detected when the hollow cavity was filled with nano-filtered water. A polarisation conversion effect, with an efficiency of 10 %, is observed when the diameter of the coupling tapered fibre waist is varied. This effect is also achieved by simply varying the polarisation of the input light in the tapered fibre where the efficiency is optimised to 92 %. Thus, the microbubble device acts as a reversible band-pass to band-stop optical filter for cavity-QED, integrated solid-state and semiconductor circuit applications...|$|R
