40|$|The {{deepening}} {{of regional}} disparities {{is an issue}} of increasing importance that has been systematically emphasized in the EU policy, especially since the process of “Eastern Integration” has started. The paper focuses on the <b>Visegrad</b> Group <b>countries</b> whose regions are less developed in the EU context. The aim of the research is to assess the development of disparities in regional economic performance of the <b>Visegrad</b> Group <b>countries,</b> to identify how the factors of economic growth determine these disparities, and partly to assess whether the integration of the <b>Visegrad</b> Group <b>countries</b> into the EU influenced the development of regional disparities in these countries. For the analysis of disparities during 2000 – 2013 we selected an approach of measuring real convergence (sigma-convergence). Disparities were measured {{in the context of a}} breakdown of the GDP per capita into sub-components, reflecting on the development of disparities in productivity and employment. The results show that, although regions of the <b>Visegrad</b> Group <b>countries</b> converged towards the EU average and also in terms of the Visegrad Group as a whole, regional disparities within countries rather increased. This led to a paradox where, although the objective of reducing regional disparities across the EU was satisfied, from a national perspective disparities increased. The Labour productivity factor, with its dominant yet steadily growing contribution, is the main determinant of disparities in the performance of the Visegrad Group regions. Other sources of disparities are characterized by a stable development or convergence. Only Polish regions deviated from the general conclusions, since the extent of disparities among them grew constantly, and the nature of disparities was the Labour participation rate. In terms of the impact caused by accession into the EU, the measured changes were rather minor and the identified trends had mostly been in place before the <b>Visegrad</b> Group <b>countries</b> entered the EU...|$|R

40|$|This article {{sets out}} to study the voting pattern of the <b>Visegrád</b> <b>countries</b> in the United Nations General Assembly, since the {{beginning}} of their respective memberships, analyzing their voting affinity with the Soviet Union (Russia) and the United States. Somewhat predictably, <b>Visegrád</b> <b>countries</b> tended to be closer to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Surprisingly though, the pattern does not change drastically {{after the end of the}} Cold War, and <b>Visegrád</b> <b>countries</b> still tend to vote more closely with Russia than with the United States. Equally striking is the fact that <b>Visegrád</b> <b>countries</b> tend to vote almost identically, without any changes given domestic political changes. Pattern of higher agreement with Russia than with the United States can be seen also when inspecting the voting of all EU members. Such finding is relevant for the study of the geopolitical transformation of the Central European region, but also wider geopolitical dynamics in the UN General Assembly. © 2013 SAGE Publications...|$|E

Literature focusing on the country-specific determinants of vertical and horizontal intra-industry trade is rather limited and those analysing agricultural (or agri-food) trade are extremely rare. Therefore, the paper seeks {{to contribute to the}} literature by covering latest theory and data available on the topic to provide up to date results and suggestions. Moreover, it seeks to identify the determinants of horizontal and vertical intra-industry trade of the <b>Visegrad</b> <b>Countries</b> after EU accession. Results suggest that agri-food trade of the <b>Visegrad</b> <b>Countries</b> is mainly inter-industry in nature but intra-industry trade is dominated by vertical elements. Results verify that determinants of horizontal and vertical IIT differ and suggest that economic size is positively, while distance is negatively related to both sides of IIT. However, the relationship between vertical IIT and differences in factor endowments as well as FDI is ambiguous. JEL: Keywords...|$|E
