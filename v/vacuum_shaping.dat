40|$|We {{calculate}} the three-point correlation {{function of the}} comoving curvature perturbation generated during an inflationary epoch driven by false vacuum energy. We get a novel false <b>vacuum</b> <b>shape</b> bispectrum, which peaks in the equilateral limit. Using this result, we propose a scenario which we call "old curvaton". The shape of the resulting bispectrum lies between the local and the false <b>vacuum</b> <b>shapes.</b> In addition we have a large running of the spectral index.

40|$|Many-body Hilbert {{space is}} a {{functional}} vector space {{with the natural}} structure of an algebra, in which vector multiplication is ordinary multiplication of wave functions. This algebra is finite-dimensional, with exactly $N!^{d- 1 }$ generators for $N$ identical particles, bosons or fermions, in $d$ dimensions. The generators are called shapes. Each shape is a possible many-body <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Shapes</b> are natural generalizations of the ground-state Slater determinant {{to more than one}} dimension. Physical states, including the ground state, are superpositions of shapes with symmetric-function coefficients, for both bosons and fermions. These symmetric functions may be interpreted as bosonic excitations of the shapes. The algebraic structure of Hilbert space described here provides qualitative insights into long-standing issues of many-body physics, including the fermion sign problem and the microscopic origin of bands in the spectra of finite systems.

50|$|The column can {{be filled}} with random dumped packing (creating a random packed column) or with {{structured}} packing sections, which are arranged or stacked (creating a stacked packed column). In the column, liquids tend to wet {{the surface of the}} packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Packing material can be used instead of trays to improve separation in distillation columns. Packing offers the advantage of a lower pressure drop across the column (when compared to plates or trays), which is beneficial while operating under <b>vacuum.</b> Differently <b>shaped</b> packing materials have different surface areas and void space between the packing. Both of these factors affect packing performance.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{addition}} to the fabrication of thermoset styrene-based shape memory polymer (SMP) and its nanocomposite filled with nanocarbon particles, this study presents the effect of nanocarbon particles on infrared light-active shape recovery behaviors {{of this type of}} SMP material. The experimental results reveal that both pure SMP and SMP filled with nanocarbon par-ticles can be actuated by infrared light in <b>vacuum,</b> while <b>shape</b> memory effect shown by the composite is stronger than that of in pure SMP. Shape memory effect is eval-uated by shape recovery ability and shape recovery speed in detail. Moreover, factors which would influence the infrared light-active shape memory effect in SMP with/without nanocarbon particles are explored by scan-ning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and infrared absorption characteristic tests. The better shape memory effect of the nanocomposite attributes to its higher storage modulus and higher infrared absorp...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} address squeezed light generation {{through the}} spontaneous {{breaking of the}} rotational invariance occuring in a type I degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) pumped above threshold.

This occurs at any pumping level above threshold, hence the phenomenon is non-critical. Imperfections of the rotational symmetry, due e. g. to cavity anisotropy, are shown to have a small impact, hence the result is not singular.

The aerobic bottle is filled first, and then the anaerobic bottle is filled. However, if the collection is performed using a syringe, the anaerobic bottle is filled first. If a butterfly collection kit is used, the aerobic bottle is filled first, so that any air in the tubing is released into the oxygen-containing bottle.|$|R

40|$|A new plasma fusion experiment, the Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) {{has been}} built in the Max-Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, Germany. A {{cryostat}} <b>vacuum</b> tank, <b>shaped</b> like a torus, hosts 70 superconducting magnetic coils to produce a toroidal magnetic field that will confine a fusion relevant plasma. The cryostat tank has a volume of about 420 m 3 and is equipped with several hundreds of vacuum ports, feed-throughs and service openings. Nested inside the cryostat is the plasma vessel with a volume of about 80 m 3, also shaped like a torus. This plasma vessel is connected to the outside by 254 ports that traverse the cryostat. These ports are needed as access for plasma diagnostics, plasma heating and the supply of cooling media. We report in this paper on the vacuum leak search on the W 7 -X cryostat, both for the internal piping as well as the integral leak search of the entire vessel against air. This is the initial leak search prior to the first cool-down of W 7 -X. Emphasis is put on the description of the methods, rather than on the results. The technical commissioning of the cryostat vacuum system within a limited time was the primary task; the emphasis was therefore much more on achieving practical results (the leak-tightness) rather than answering fundamental questions...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} the {{distance}} dependence of the transition voltage of gold?vacuum?gold junctions are investigated by employing first-principles quantum transport simulations. Our calculations show that atomic protrusions always exist on the electrode surface of gold?vacuum?gold junctions fabricated using the mechanically controllable break junction (MCBJ) method. The transition voltage of these gold?vacuum?gold junctions with atomically sharp electrodes {{is determined by the}} local density of states (LDOS) of the apex gold atom on the electrode surface rather than by the <b>vacuum</b> barrier <b>shape.</b> More specifically, the absolute value of the transition voltage roughly equals the rising edge of the LDOS peak contributed by the 6 p atomic orbitals of the gold atoms protruding from the electrode surface, whose local Fermi level is shifted downwards when a bias voltage is applied. Since the LDOS of the apex gold atom depends strongly on the exact shape of the electrode, the transition voltage is sensitive to the variation of the atomic configuration of the junction. For asymmetric junctions, the transition voltage may also change significantly depending on the bias polarity. Considering that the occurrence of the transition voltage requires the electrode distance to be larger than a critical value, the interaction between the two electrodes is actually rather weak. Consequently, the LDOS of the apex gold atom is mainly determined by its local atomic configuration and the transition voltage only depends weakly on the electrode distance as observed in the MCBJ experiments...|$|R
