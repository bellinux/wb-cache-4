Voters in the Kentucky {{district}} Johnson once represented in the House of Representatives had backed Van Buren by 1,600 votes in 1836, but favored Harrison by 251 votes in 1840. Both major parties saw an increase in vote, in part because 51 percent more people voted in 1840 than in 1836. The Democrats alleged that Harrison had won the popular <b>vote</b> <b>with</b> bribed and ineligible voters; the Whigs responded by accusing their rivals of being unwilling to accept the will of the people.|$|E
