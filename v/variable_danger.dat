40|$|Colorado {{residents}} {{living in}} the wildland urban interface (WUI) were asked about their perception of wildfire risk and their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for three fire management procedures: fuel reduction by thinning, fire suppression and prescribed fires. Respondent home locations were then digitized to enable the calculation of wildfire <b>danger</b> <b>variables</b> from various GIS map layers. These two processes resulted in perceived and actual wildfire risk variables which were then compared and analyzed. Perceived and actual fire <b>danger</b> <b>variables</b> were then used as explanatory variables in WTP functions. Results show that each fire management technique had different variables that would increase a person’s WTP. However, overall, WTP values {{for each of the}} approaches were substantial. We believe this information shows that people {{living in the}} WUI would be willing-to-pay for an annual “wildfire management fee ” to offset risks they consciously take by living in the WUI. This fee could potentially decrease the wildfire management cost burden that is currently incurred by taxpayers...|$|R
40|$|Environmental indices {{that provide}} {{short-term}} predictions of recruitment {{have the potential}} to improve the average yield from highly productive resources that sustain recruit fisheries without an associated increase in risk (of resource 'collapse'). This is particularly true for cases where a measurement of recruitment is not available until after substantial fishing on this recruitment has already taken place. The South African anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resource reflects such a situation, and forms the basis for a simulation study to investigate the benefits of using environmental indices to set appropriate Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Simulations, based on a 'management procedure' (sensu the International Whaling Commission), investigate how such benefits are related to the proportion of variation in recruitment explained by the environmental index. Furthermore, they evaluate to what extent these benefits are compromised by uncertainties related to the degrees of freedom effect (over-fitting data), the selection of explanatory <b>variables</b> (<b>danger</b> of spurious correlations), and errors in the values of explanatory variables (including measurement error). Five recruitment prediction models that incorporate increasing numbers of these uncertainties are investigated. These predictions are used to adjust TACs depending on whether they indicate forthcoming recruitment to be in the top or bottom third of the distribution of possible recruitment values. Results indicate that an environmental index needs to explain roughly 50 % or more of the total variation in recruitment (r 2 ≥ 0. 5) before the management procedure starts showing benefits in terms of the summary performance statistics for risk and average catch. Comparable benefits are possible at a lower r 2 value when TAC constraints are removed, but there is then a large associated increase in interannual catch variation. When r 2 is low, performance in terms of average catch may prove worse if attempting to take account of an environmental variable in setting the TAC than ignoring it...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} health and emotional-related issues of service members after a deployment to Iraq. Secondary data analysis and a cross-sectional descriptive design, were used to analyze data from the Department of Defense Post Deployment Health Assessment (PDHA) database. The cognitive appraisal model of stress and coping (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) guided this study. Several statistical techniques were used including: frequency distributions cross tab evaluations, factor analysis, reliability calculations, regression analysis and tests for mediation. The study sample included 510, 352 service members (49, 998 females, 460, 349 males) with a mean age of 29 years. The sample represented all components and branches of the military. Of the total sample, 51. 9 % (n= 264, 777) saw wounded, killed or dead individuals and 22. 1 % (n= 112, 620) discharged their weapon in combat. Environmental exposures were an important source of stress. Exposures to sand and dust were the largest complaint (89. 8 % of the sample). Multiple physical symptoms were identified and 40 % of the sample reported four or more symptoms (e. g. diarrhea, back pain, headache, fatigue). PTSD symptoms were identified in 11. 8 % (n = 60, 200) and depressive symptoms in 26. 5 %, (n= 123, 808) of participants. Results of the study indicated that age, gender, rank, race/ethnicity, military component and branch were important predictors of emotional and health-related concerns in this sample. Appraisal <b>variables</b> (<b>danger</b> of being killed and exposure concerns) mediated the relationship between immediate (physical and depressive symptoms) and long term outcomes (health perception, PTSD symptoms) for the majority of the analyses; supporting the study hypothesis. However, length of deployment did not have a significant impact on stress-related outcomes in this study. Implications for practice, policy and future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Herzog and Miller (1998) {{reported}} that people judged alleys with sharper curves as less dangerous than straighter alleys. The authors investigated {{the role of}} perceived alley length as a possible confounding influence. Raters judged a large sample of urban alleys for two target <b>variables</b> (preference and <b>danger)</b> and six predictor variables (setting care, mystery, shadow, curvature, length, and width). The partial correlation of danger and curvature, with length partialed out, was not significant. However, in regression analyses controlling for the entire set of predictors, curvature had a modest negative partial relation with preference and a tendency toward a modest positive partial relation with danger. Thus, when controlling for all predictors, the counter-intuitive relation between danger and curvature disappears. In the regression analyses, the strongest predictors were setting care (positive for preference, negative for danger) and shadow (the opposite pattern). Mystery tended to be positively related to both target variables...|$|R
40|$|Employing {{data from}} the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey and the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, this study tests: (1) the {{association}} between forest fire danger and an individual 2 ̆ 7 s life satisfaction; (2) the association between forest fire danger and an individual 2 ̆ 7 s feeling of safety; and (3) whether the association between forest fire danger and an individual 2 ̆ 7 s life satisfaction is explained by feelings of safety. Further, this study employs the experienced preference method to estimate, in monetary terms, the psychological costs associated with forest fire danger. We find negative and significant associations between life satisfaction and forest fire danger, {{as well as between}} forest fire danger and feelings of safety. When feelings of safety are included in the life satisfaction regression, however, the forest fire <b>danger</b> <b>variable</b> is no longer statistically significant - suggesting that the link between forest fire danger and life satisfaction can be largely explained by an individual 2 ̆ 7 s feelings of safety. The experienced preference method yields an implicit willingness-to-pay of 10 per year to avoid a one unit increase in the spatially weighted average of the average daily value of the Fire Danger Index over the previous 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Transition rules {{elicitation}} is {{an important}} issue in modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics of the Cellular Geography model, because the transition rule is an engine of the system dynamics. The rule calculates the value of current cell, based on cell value and the value of its neighboring cells at the previous time. We propose the transition rules of the model, using multiple linear regression analysis, by performing adjustment of model parameters and input data. Data in this research is a collection of JPEG images of maps that present the results of observations of drought code <b>variable</b> in Fire <b>Danger</b> Rating System for 30 successive days. In order to process the data in the model Continues Cellular Geography, the qualitative input data was transformed into continuous data using random number generator based on certain probability distribution. The research observed the effect of the selection of neighborhood scheme and its radius, to the quality of transition rules. Experimental results show, continues uniform distribution is better than normal distribution and uniform discrete distribution. Whilst in the scheme of Cellular Automata model, von Neumann neighborhood with radius 2, is the optimal scheme. Manipulation of map resolution, by up grading or down grading it‘s scale, can be decreasing the quality of transition rules. Unfortunately, this research hasn’t found the parameter setting, which has no significance of external variation, except of 2 cases...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{regimes are}} {{strongly}} related to weather conditions that directly and indirectly influence fire ignition and propagation. Identifying the most important meteorological fire drivers is thus fundamental for daily fire risk forecasting. In this context, several fire weather indices have been developed focussing mainly on fire-related local weather conditions and fuel characteristics. The specificity of the conditions for which fire danger indices are developed makes its direct transfer and applicability problematic in different areas or with other fuel types. In this paper we used the low-to-intermediate fire-prone region of Canton Ticino {{as a case study}} to develop a new daily fire danger index by implementing a niche modelling approach (Maxent). In order to identify the most suitable weather conditions for fires, different combinations of input variables were tested (meteorological <b>variables,</b> existing fire <b>danger</b> indices or a combination of both). Our findings demonstrate that such combinations of input variables increase the predictive power of the resulting index and surprisingly even using meteorological variables only allows similar or better performances than using the complex Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI). Furthermore, the niche modelling approach based on Maxent resulted in slightly improved model performance and in a reduced number of selected variables with respect to the classical logistic approach. Factors influencing final model robustness were the number of fire events considered and the specificity of the meteorological conditions leading to fire ignition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Increasedwildfire {{activity}} (e. g. {{number of}} starts, area burned, fire behaviour) across the western United States {{in recent decades}} has heightened interest in resolving climate–fire relationships. Macroscale climate–fire relationships were examined in forested and non-forested lands for eight Geographic Area Coordination Centers in the western United States, using area burned derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset (1984 – 2010). Fire-specific biophysical <b>variables</b> including fire <b>danger</b> and water balance metrics were considered in addition to standard climate variables of monthly temperature, precipitation and drought indices to explicitly determine their optimal capacity to explain interannual variability in area burned. Biophysical variables tied to the depletion of fuel and soil moisture and prolonged periods of elevated fire-danger had stronger correlations to area burned than standard variables antecedent to or during the fire season, particularly in forested systems. Antecedent climate–fire relationships exhibited inter-region commonality with area burned in forested lands correlated with winter snowwater equivalent and emergent drought in late spring. Area burned in non-forested lands correlated with moisture availability in the growing season preceding the fire year. Despite differences {{in the role of}} antecedent climate in preconditioning fuels, synchronous regional fire activity in forested and non-forested lands suggests that atmospheric conditions during the fire season unify fire activity and can compound or supersede antecedent climatic stressors. Collectively, climate–fire relationships viewed through the lens of biophysical variables provide a more direct link to fuel flammability and wildfire activity than standard climate variables, thereby narrowing the gap in incorporating top-down climatic factors between empirical and process-based fire models...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{estimation}} of moisture content of dead fuels {{is a critical}} <b>variable</b> in fire <b>danger</b> assessment since it is strongly related to fire ignition and fire spread potential. This study evaluates the accuracy of two well-known meteoro-logical moisture codes, the Canadian Fine Fuels Moisture Content and the US 10 -h, to estimate fuel moisture content of dead fuels in Mediterranean areas. Cured grasses and litter {{have been used for}} this study. The study was conducted in two phases. The former aimed to select the most efficient code, and the latter to produce a spatial representation of that index for operational assessment of fire danger conditions. The first phase required calibration and validation of an estimation model based on regression analysis. Field samples were collected in the Cabañeros National Park (Central Spain) for a six-year period (1998 – 2003). The estimations were more accurate for litter (r 2 between 0. 52) than for cured grasslands (r 2 0. 11). In addition, grasslands showed higher variability in the trends among the study years. The two moisture codes evaluated in this paper offered similar trends, therefore, the 10 -h code was selected since it is simpler to compute. The second phase was based on interpolating the required meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) to compute the 10 -h moisture code. The interpolation was based on European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast-ing (ECMWF) predictions. Finally, a simple method to combine the estimations of dead fuel moisture content with other variables associated to fire danger is presented in this paper. This method estimates the probability of ignition based on the moisture of extinction of each fuel type...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{personality}} over ontogeny can occur even when every agent (individual or genotype) {{is exposed to}} {{the same set of}} cues, experiences or environmental conditions. A recent Bayesian model (Stamps and Krishnan, in press) shows how individual differences in the means and variances of prior distributions of estimates of <b>variables</b> such as <b>danger</b> can generate predictable individual differences in behavioral developmental trajectories, and predictable changes in the differential consistency (broad-sense repeatability) of behavior over ontogeny, even if every subject is reared and maintained under the same conditions. We use this model to highlight the distinction between potential plasticity (the ability of an agent to change its phenotype in response to different types of experience) and realized plasticity (the extent to which an agent’s phenotype actually changes in response to a specific experience), and to demonstrate why the realized behavioral developmental plasticity of a given agent might vary {{as a function of the}} type of cues to which that agent was exposed over ontogeny. We describe two commonly used experimental protocols for studying individual differences in developmental plasticity (within-individual versus replicate individual designs), discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each for investigating individual differences in the developmental plasticity of personality traits, and explain why replicate individual designs provide better estimates than within-individual designs of the potential developmental plasticity of behavioral traits. More generally, we suggest that a Bayesian approach to development, especially one which assumes that individuals differ with respect to the information provided by their immediate and distant ancestors, can provide valuable insights into how genes, epigenetic factors, maternal effects and personal experiences might combine across the lifetime to affect the development of personality and other behavioral traits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{presents}} and discusses {{the relationships between}} live Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) measurements and fire occurrence (number of fires and burned area) in a Mediterranean area of central Spain. Grasslands and four shrub species (Cistus ladanifer L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Erica australis L. and Phillyrea angustifolia L.) were sampled in the field from the spring to the summer season over a 9 -year period. Higher seasonal FMC variability was found for the herbaceous species than for shrubs, as grasslands have very low values in summertime. Moisture variations of grasslands {{were found to be}} good predictors of number of fires and total burned surface, while moisture variation of two shrubs (C. ladanifer L. and R. officinalis L.) was more sensitive to both the total burned area and the occurrence of large fires. All these species showed significant differences between the FMC of high and low occurrence periods. Three different logistic regression models were built for the 202 periods of analysis: one to predict periods with more and less than seven fires, another to predict periods with and without large fires (> 500 ha), and the third to predict periods with more and less than 200 ha burned. The results showed accuracy in predicting periods with a high number of fires (94 %), and extensive burned area (85 %), with less accuracy in estimating periods with large fires (58 %). Finally, empirical functions based on logistic regression analysis were successfully related to fire ignition or potential burned area from FMC data. These models should be useful to integrate FMC measurements with other <b>variables</b> of fire <b>danger</b> (ignition causes, for instance), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of fire danger conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} {{project was}} to develop and test {{a new model of}} leadership, incorporating the key factors that influence leadership behavior. Article 1 (Chapter 2) reviewed contemporary leadership models focusing on factors which influence leadership behavior, from a traditional as well as a modern perspective on leadership. This theoretical basis {{led to the development of}} the ‘Dynamic Five-Factor Model of Leadership’ (Seiler & Pfister, 2009). The five factors are: (1) the leader’s individual competence, (2) the group, (3) the organization, (4) the general context, and (5) the immediate situation. The article explains the model in detail and discusses different applications. Study 1 and 2 (Chapter 3) tested the model’s reliability, validity, and applicability. Both studies showed that the model was a good tool to analyze, which factors within a specific situation were perceived as most important for one’s own leadership behavior. Two samples of Swiss university students (N 1 = 104, N 2 = 105) had to rate 24 different leadership situations using the ‘Dynamic Five- Factor Model of Leadership’. The findings showed, that the importance of each factor was rated independently of the other factors within a situation and each situation was rated independently of the other situations. Further findings indicated that the perceived importance of a factor was systematically influenced by three <b>variables</b> (time pressure, <b>danger,</b> formalization). Finally, a comparison of both studies revealed that when no changes were made to the structure of the situation, the situation was rated the same way. Both studies therefore demonstrated the validity, reliability, and applicability of the model for analyzing the influence of different factors on leadership behavior. Study 3 (Chapter 4) primarily examined the impact of the five factors of the model on decision behavior. A second objective was to analyze if and how the five factors mediated the effects of the three variables: time pressure, danger, and formalization on decision behavior. These variables defined the structure of a situation. All three variables are known to systematically influence decision behavior and were employed to manipulate the situation structure in this and in the two earlier studies. Swiss university students (N= 109) rated nine leadership situations using the factors of the ‘Dynamic Five-Factor Model of Leadership’. In addition, they had to rate four different decision behaviors in each situation. The results revealed that the five factors were systematic predictors for decision behavior and that they mediated the effects of the three variables on decision behavior. Further, the five factors were the prefered predictors for decision behavior. We additionally argued that the five factors can be used to measure the interpretation of a situation, as their perceived impact is influenced by an interpretation process. Hence, the interpretation of a situation, i. e. the holistic view of the situation, was most important for decision behavior and not the structure of a situation, i. e. specific situational variables. Study 4 (Chapter 5) analyzed how culture, measured with the nine culture dimensions of the GLOBE study (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004), and personality, measured with the ‘Big Five’ personality factors (Costa & McCrae, 1992), influenced the interpretation of a situation and decision behavior. Data from over 1400 participants of 14 different countries was collected in an online study. The results revealed that both culture and personality influenced the interpretation of a situation, i. e. the perceived impact of the five factors on leadership behavior. Further, the culture dimensions were systematic predictors for the five personality factors, showing the link already found between culture and personality (Hofstede & McCrae, 2004) on an individual level. Accordingly, personality partially mediated the effects of culture on the interpretation of a situation. Both, culture and personality, also systematically influenced decision behavior. As in the previous study the interpretation of a situation was the best predictor for decision behavior. Again, personality partially mediated the effects of culture on decision behavior. Additionally, interpretation of the situation partially mediated the effects of culture and personality on decision behavior. But the effects of culture and personality on the interpretation of a situation and decision behavior were small. The chapter proposes reasons why these influences were so small. The results of the studies have important implications for leadership research. First, they undscore the applicability of a new holistic leadership model. Aside from showing that a holistic measurement of a situation provides a solid basis for explaining leadership behavior, the studies also support the importance of the interpretation process for leadership behavior. The holistic interpretation of the situation is the basis for decision behavior rather than specific situational variables. Situational circumstances, culture, and personality influence this interpretation. In different ways, the studies show that leadership behavior is not the result of the sum of all influencing factors, but the result of a dynamic interactive process of all factors, which together generate leadership behavior. Leadership behavior is more than the sum of its influences...|$|R
