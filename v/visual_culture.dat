25|$|Berger {{has also}} curated {{a number of}} race-related concept-based exhibitions, {{including}} For All The World To See: <b>Visual</b> <b>Culture</b> and the Struggle for Civil Rights—a joint venture of the National Museum of African American History and Culture of the Smithsonian Institution and the Center for Art, Design & <b>Visual</b> <b>Culture</b> at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. This exhibition {{was the first to}} comprehensively examine the role played by visual images in shaping, influencing, and transforming the modern struggle for racial equality and justice in the United States. It opened at International Center of Photography in New York in May 2010 and traveled to the DuSable Museum of African American History (Chicago), Smithsonian National Museum of American History (DC), National Civil Rights Museum (Memphis), Center for Art, Design and <b>Visual</b> <b>Culture</b> (Baltimore), Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, MA) and other venues. For All the World to See was selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities as the twelfth NEH on the Road exhibition, an initiative that adapted the exhibition in a smaller, lower security version that will travel to up to 50 more venues, mostly smaller and mid-size institutions across the country over a ten-year period from 2012 to 2023.|$|E

25|$|Steeped in the <b>visual</b> <b>culture</b> of his day, Carlos Alberto, a {{scion of}} the {{restricted}} industrial elite that prospered after World War I, favored the artistic currents prevalent between the 1920s and the 1940s, in particular French architecture and French decorative arts, encouraged by {{his visit to}} Paris to the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in 1925. There he met {{the people who were}} most in tune with the pragmatism of his class, including Charles Siclis (1889-1942), an architect whose 1929 watercolors are behind the referential image of the Villa, Jacques Émile Ruhlmann (1879-1933), decorator and architect, and Jacques Gréber (1882-1962), the architect who was invited to design the new garden.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to earlier}} research, the {{assimilation}} and transformation of pre-existing architectural traditions is investigated under {{the aspect of}} mutual intra- and intercultural exchange of ideas, technologies and styles as well as artists, architects, and materials. In the area of art and architecture, the Rise of Islam {{is seen as a}} continuous transformation process leading from late Antiquity to the Islamic period. Early research into the area regarded the early Islamic architecture merely as a break with the past, from which apparently rose a distorted and less expressive form of art, or a degenerate imitation of the post-classical architectural forms. Modern concepts tend to regard the transition between the cultures rather as a selective process of informed appropriation and transformation. The Umayyads {{played a crucial role in}} this process of transforming and thereby enriching the existing architectural traditions, or, in a more general sense, of the <b>visual</b> <b>culture</b> of the nascent Islamic society.|$|E
25|$|Berger's media project, Revolution of the Eye: Modern Art and the Birth of American Television, {{organized}} for the Jewish Museum, New York, and the Center for Art, Design, and <b>Visual</b> <b>Culture,</b> University of Maryland, Baltimore County, {{is the first}} exhibition to explore how avant-garde art influenced and shaped the look and content of network television in its formative years, from the late-1940s to the mid-1970s. During this period, the pioneers of American television—many of them young, Jewish, and aesthetically adventurous—had adopted modernism {{as a source of}} inspiration. Revolution of the Eye looks at how the dynamic new medium, in its risk-taking and aesthetic experimentation, paralleled and embraced cutting-edge art and design. It examines television’s promotion of avant-garde ideals and aesthetics; its facility as a promotional platform for modern artists, designers, and critics; its role as a committed patron of the work of modern artists and designers; and as a medium whose relevance in contemporary culture was validated by the Museum of Modern Art’s historic Television Project (1952-55). In addition to the Jewish Museum and CADVC, the exhibition traveled to the NSU Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, MA.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham's {{existing}} <b>visual</b> <b>culture</b> made it highly {{receptive to}} Arts and Crafts thinking. The Arts and Crafts Movement itself {{had been born}} out of the Birmingham Set: a group of undergraduates, {{most of whom were}} from Birmingham, that formed at Oxford University in the 1850s and whose members included William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones. The direct relevance of the practice of design and production to the Birmingham economy gave such issues a high profile within the town, and the aesthetic and social philosophy of the key Arts and Crafts influence John Ruskin was well established among Birmingham's governing Liberal elite by the 1870s. It was on a trip to Birmingham in 1855 that Morris had decided to pursue architecture as a career, and he was to maintain close links with the town over following decades, serving as President of the Birmingham Society of Artists in 1878. By the 1890s Arts and Crafts architects dominated the Birmingham Architectural Association and architectural teaching at the Birmingham School of Art, and the Movement provided the first two Directors of the Birmingham School of Architecture from its foundation in 1905.|$|E

40|$|David Dibosa’s paper, 'Besides Looking: Patrimony, Performativity and <b>Visual</b> <b>Cultures</b> in National Art Museums', is an {{exploration}} and a further elaboration of {{the relations between}} the development of visual media practices within the research – what we have previously indicated as stemming from practice-based research approaches – and transmigrational <b>visual</b> <b>cultures.</b> David asks how perspectives derived from the study and articulation of <b>Visual</b> <b>Cultures,</b> (Hall, Mirzoeff, Evans, Rogoff) might usefully frame our understanding of transmigrational ‘viewing strategies’ and more specifically the practices of Tate Encounters’ participants. He introduces an important counter to the idea that either the art museum or the research framing can address the transmigrational viewer other than in an engagement at the point of viewing. This stresses the dynamic, rather than settled, historical sense of migrant experience that has become contained in notions of ‘heritage’, and ethnic categorisations. He looks to performativity to offer {{a way out of the}} impasse of categorisation and his focus upon transmigrational experience as fluid leads him to the idea that a corresponding art museum viewing strategy might be that “which has not yet been seen” or “a kind of seeing on the move”...|$|R

500|$|Although the Netherlandish {{artists are}} {{primarily}} {{known for their}} panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved retables, stained glass, brass objects and carved tombs. According to art historian Susie Nash, by the early 16th century, the region led the field in {{almost every aspect of}} portable <b>visual</b> <b>culture,</b> [...] "with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them". The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and metalwork, which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's [...] of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals {{as in the case of}} van Eyck's lost Portrait of Isabella of Portugal.|$|E
500|$|Impunities London {{exhibited}} alongside {{other works}} in the theme of masculine overreach at her 2015 second solo show in the Lawrie Shabibi gallery of Dubai. The show explored the emergence of machismo culture from themes of war heroism, exploitation, and violence, and machismo's relation to the seven deadly sins. Its central work, The Altarpiece, is an ink and wax print triptych in a gold leaf frame that visualizes war through its depiction of a World War II-era Berlin bunker. Civilians were forced to build the depicted bunker, which held private artworks from the Boros Collection as of the exhibition. ArtAsiaPacific wrote that the bullet holes {{on the walls of}} the bunker symbolized the wounds of Germany's involvement in the war. The magazine compared the work's format to that of early Christian art and considered the work [...] "an allegory for the political strategy of covering up the past for a more favorable present" [...] (revisionism). Tunisian Americans (2012) invoked the burial of American soldiers from the 1942 Tunisia Campaign, occupying foreign territory even in death. Grindballs, Hardballs, and Bangballs (2015) captured sand, cement, and pollen inside bubble wrap to reflect the masculine impulse to exploit the environment. A Short Story of Salt and Sun (2013), an ink and wax painting, comes from a print of a Tunisian resort's eroded wall to reflect on the inescapable erosion of man's creations and the decline of tourism in Tunisia. Artforum Stephanie Bailey wrote that Kaabi-Linke was both concise and sincere", with a [...] "severity" [...] offset by the [...] "lightness" [...] with which she navigates topical issues.

50|$|Nakamura's book, “Digitizing Race: <b>Visual</b> <b>Cultures</b> of the Internet,” {{discusses}} the <b>visual</b> <b>cultures</b> of the Internet {{and the type}} of information we seek online. She is interested in the emergence and immense popularity of racially themed websites that are created by for and about people of color. She is interested in what she terms the “racio-visual logic of the internet.” Jessie Daniels of Hunter College, City University of New York argues that the book's central insight is that the Internet is a “visual technology, a protocol for seeing that is interfaced and networked in ways that produce a particular set of racial formations.” From Facebook to YouTube to avatars to video games, visual representations online incorporate the embodied, gendered, and racialized self online.|$|R
40|$|The {{apparent}} ‘invisibility’, or lack {{of representation}} of black men in contemporary mainstream gay <b>visual</b> <b>cultures</b> is the primary critical issue that the study engages with. The study presupposes that {{the frequency with which}} white men appear in popular representations of ‘gayness’ prevails over that of black men. In order to substantiate this assumption, this study analyses selected issues of the South African queer men’s lifestyle magazine Gay Pages. Gay <b>visual</b> <b>cultures</b> appear to simultaneously conflate ‘whiteness’ and normative homosexuality, while marginalising black gay men by means of positioning ‘blackness’ and ‘gayness’ as irreconcilable identity constructs. Images of the gay male ‘community’ disseminated by queer and mainstream media constantly offer stereotypical, distorted and race-biased notions of gay men, which ingrain the exclusive cultural equation of white men and ideal homomasculinity. The disclosure of racist and selectively homophobic ideologies, which seem to inform gay visual representation, is therefore the chief concern of the dissertation. By investigating selected images that ostensibly embody the complex cultural relationship between race and homomasculinity, the study addresses the following forms of visual representation: colonial representations of ‘blackness’; so-called gay ‘colonial’ representations; black self-representation; gay black self-representation; and contemporary representations of homomasculinity in advertisements and queer men’s lifestyle magazines such as Gay Pages. A genealogy of images is explored in order to illustrate the ways in which ‘blackness’ and ‘whiteness’ are respectively positioned as contradictory to and synonymous with dominant visual representations of homomasculinity in gay <b>visual</b> <b>cultures.</b> The hegemony of ‘whiteness’ in images sourced from colonial systems of representation, queer male art and commercial publicity, for example, are thus critiqued in order to address the various race-based prejudices that appear to be symptomatic of contemporary gay <b>visual</b> <b>cultures.</b> CopyrightDissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.
