In this study, I utilize new 3 D body scanning technology to examine the person-chair interaction in flexible, material back chairs without adding anything to either the chair or the subject. I attempt to develop a new objective measure, <b>volumetric</b> <b>deformation,</b> which assesses the reaction of a flexible, material chair back to a seated user. In addition, this study aims to understand the relationships between perceived chair back comfort, objective <b>volumetric</b> <b>deformation,</b> subject anthropometric attributes, and ratings of perceived chair attribute comfort.

The relationship between chair back deformation and pressure distribution should be explored in future studies. Professor Alan Hedge, Faculty Adviso...|$|E
