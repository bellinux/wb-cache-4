25|$|Roller {{was born}} in Buhuși, then a commune in Neamț County, to a Jewish family; {{his father was a}} functionary. The boy {{completed}} his secondary education in Bacău, and soon became a sympathizer of the far left cause. The date of his affiliation with the banned Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), later Workers' Party (PMR), remains disputed. The formerly communist writer Mihai Stoian gives 1926, noting that it coincided with a strike action in Buhuși. Other sources suggest that he only joined in 1931. Historian Lucian Boia writes that Roller, like other communist men of his generation, could not have been a card-carrying member at that stage, since that would have formed material proof of conspiratorial activity. More likely, Roller was inducted through a <b>verbal</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lying Cat: Lying Cat {{is a large}} female talking feline {{companion}} to The Will who aids him in his work. Green in color and with yellow stripes, she {{has the ability to}} detect when a <b>verbal</b> <b>statement</b> is a lie, which she indicates by saying [...] "Lying". Her power is limited to the state of the mind of the person speaking: she can detect deliberate deception, but cannot detect a falsehood if a given statement is believed to be true by the speaker. According to Izabel, Lying Cats always play by the rules, an allusion to the fact that a Lying Cat must also admit ethical truths as well as factual ones. When Gwendolyn, who becomes Lying Cat's ally, accidentally kills a man, Izabel says that they had no right to execute that man in his home, which Lying Cat cannot deny. It has been revealed that Lying Cat was the runt of her seven-kitten litter, which has caused her distress.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the language-based strategies that computer-mediated communication (CMC) users employ to reduce uncertainty in the absence of nonverbal cues. Specifically, this study investigated the prevalence of three interactive uncertainty reduction strategies (i. e., self-disclosure, question asking, and question/ disclosure intimacy) in reduced-cue settings. Moreover, this study investigated whether these uncertainty reduction strategies increased the <b>verbal</b> <b>statements</b> of affection in CMC. Eighty-one unacquainted cross-sex dyads were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: face-to-face, visual CMC supported by a webcam, or text-only CMC. Content analysis of the verbal communication revealed that text-only CMC interactants made a greater proportion of affection statements than face-to-face interactants. Proportions of question asking and question/disclosure intimacy were higher in both CMC conditions than in the face-to-face condition, but only question asking mediated the relationship between CMC and <b>verbal</b> <b>statements</b> of affection. No differences in question asking, question/ disclosure intimacy, and <b>verbal</b> <b>statements</b> of affection were observed between the text-only CMC condition and the visual CMC condition. This study provided additional support for social information processing theory by specifying the role of different language-based strategies that may be employed online...|$|R

Purpose: To develop a method for characterizing clients’ <b>verbal</b> <b>statements</b> in audio-recordings of smoking cessation behavioural support consultations. Methods: An established framework for specifying practitioner-delivered BCTs was adapted to account for corresponding BCTs in clients’ <b>verbal</b> <b>statements.</b> A total of 1, 429 client statements within 15 transcripts of audio-recorded consultations were independently coded using the framework. Results: Of the 58 BCT categories in the practitioner framework, 53 corresponding client BCTs were included and five codes unrelated to smoking cessation were added.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} smiling on perceptions of positive, neutral and negative <b>verbal</b> <b>statements.</b> Participants viewed computer-generated movies of female characters who made angry, disgusted, happy or neutral statements and then showed either one of two temporal forms of smile (slow vs. fast onset) or a neutral expression. Smiles significantly increased the perceived positivity of the message by making negative statements appear less negative and neutral statements appear more positive. However, these smiles led the character {{to be seen as}} less genuine than when she showed a neutral expression. Disgust + smile messages led to higher judged happiness than did anger + smile messages, suggesting that smiles were seen as reflecting humour when combined with disgust statements, but as masking negative affect when combined with anger statements. These findings provide insights into the ways that smiles moderate the impact of <b>verbal</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R

[...] Perhaps [...] "Let there be light" [...] was the primary focus phrase for our universe.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of lying to}} conceal one’s own transgression was examined in school-age children.

Half of the children could not resist temptation and peeked at the answer. When the experimenter asked them whether they had peeked, the majority of children lied. However, children’s subsequent <b>verbal</b> <b>statements,</b> made in response to follow-up questioning, were not always consistent with their initial denial and, hence, leaked critical information to reveal their deceit. Children’s ability to maintain consistency between their initial lie and subsequent <b>verbal</b> <b>statements</b> increased with age.

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE RESEARCH PAPER OF MITCHELL D. MAST, for the Master of Science {{degree in}} Behavior Analysis and Therapy, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: EFFECTIVENESS OF STAFF MODELING ON INCREASING APPROPRIATE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN A MOTHER AND A CHILD WITH BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Brandon Greene The {{present study was}} an attempt to {{determine}} the effect of a training program on altering the frequency and type of verbal interactions exhibited by a parent of a child with behavior problems. Data on verbal interactions between a mother and her child was gathered using the Systematic Observation of Family Interactions, a partial interval system for recording verbal interactions that evaluates interactions as either positive or negative. On some days staff assumed the role of parent during the meal routine in order to demonstrate a more positive interaction style. A focus was placed on decreasing the amount of negative affect and <b>verbal</b> <b>statements,</b> while increasing positive <b>verbal</b> <b>statements</b> and positive affect. Although this procedure was effective at reducing statements with negative affect made by the mother, it was found to be less effective at reducing her negative <b>verbal</b> <b>statements.</b> On other days, a more intensive prompting/modeling procedure was implemented where both staff and parent shared the parenting role during the meal. The degree to which interactions learned during mealtime generalized to a period when the dyad discussed the child’s day at school was then assessed. Additional training {{in the form of an}} after school discussion was conducted in order to provide a more appropriate way to debrief with the child after his school day...|$|R
