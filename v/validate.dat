40|$|<b>Validated</b> (interval) {{method is}} used to solve the initial value {{problems}} (IVPs) of ordinary dierential equations (ODEs). Compare to traditional methods, <b>validated</b> method can provide a rigorous solution for IVPs of ODEs. But <b>validated</b> method requires more computational work than the traditional methods.

5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers.

Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In the Great Lakes {{region of}} the United States, there is an annual Woollybear Festival that has been celebrated for over 40 years. The larvae of the species Pyrrharctia isabella (commonly known as the Isabella Tiger moth), with their 13 {{distinct}} segments of black and reddish-brown, have the reputation in common folklore {{of being able to}} forecast the coming winter weather. From 1948, C. H. Curran, curator of insects at the American Museum of Natural History, counted the caterpillars in Bear Mountain State Park in an attempt to <b>validate</b> that tradition.|$|E
5|$|The Senate convened on 18 September, to <b>validate</b> Tiberius's {{position}} as Princeps and, {{as it had}} done with Augustus before, extend {{the powers of the}} position to him.

5|$|The elder Sellers was {{convinced}} {{the machine was}} a hoax. To <b>validate</b> his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged {{a demonstration of the}} machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer's machine appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.|$|E

40|$|P>Background: In double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} food challenges (DBPCFCs), the use {{of challenge}} materials in which blinding is <b>validated</b> {{is a prerequisite for}} obtaining true blinded conditions during the test procedure. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} enlarge the available range of <b>validated</b> recipes for DBPCFCs to facilitate oral challenge tests in all age groups, including young children, while maximizing the top dose in an acceptable volume. Methods: Recipes were developed and subsequently <b>validated</b> by a panel recruited by a matching sensory test. The best 30 % of candidates were selected to participate in sensory testing using the paired comparison test. Results: For young children, three recipes with cow's milk and one recipe with peanut could be <b>validated</b> which may be utilized in DBPCFCs. For children older than 4 years and adults, one recipe with egg, two with peanut, one with hazelnut, and one with cashew nut were <b>validated</b> for use in DBPCFCs. Conclusions: All recipes contained larger amounts of allergenic foods than previously <b>validated.</b> These recipes increase the range of <b>validated</b> recipes for use in DBPCFCs in adults and children...|$|R
