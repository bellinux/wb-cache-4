40|$|We study {{whether a}} 125 GeV {{standard}} model-like Higgs boson can be accommodated within the scale-invariant NMSSM {{in a way}} that is natural in all respects, i. e., not only is the stop mass and hence its loop contribution to Higgs mass of natural size, but we do not allow significant tuning of NMSSM parameters as well. We pursue as much as possible an analytic approach which gives clear insights on various ways to accommodate such a Higgs mass, while conducting complementary numerical analyses. We consider both scenarios with singlet-like state being heavier and lighter than SM-like Higgs. With A-terms being small, we find for the NMSSM to be perturbative up to GUT scale, it is not possible to get 125 GeV Higgs mass, which is true even if we tune parameters of NMSSM. If we allow some of the couplings to become non-perturbative below the GUT scale, then the non-tuned option implies that the singlet self-coupling, kappa, is larger than the singlet-Higgs coupling, lambda, which itself is order 1. This leads to a Landau pole for these couplings close to the weak scale, in particular below ~ 10 ^ 4 TeV. In both the perturbative and non-perturbative NMSSM, allowing large A_lambda, A_kappa gives "more room" to accommodate a 125 GeV Higgs, but a tuning of these A-terms may be needed. In our analysis we also conduct a careful study of the constraints on the parameter space from requiring global stability of the desired <b>vacuum</b> <b>fitting</b> a 125 GeV Higgs, which is complementary to existing literature. In particular, as the singlet-Higgs coupling lambda increases, vacuum stability becomes more serious of an issue.

40|$|The {{final product}} {{functionality}} of parts produced by Additive Manufacturing (AM) can, in part, {{be improved by}} the inclusion of multi-material capabilities. The “Multi 3 D system” that is under development at The University of Texas at El Paso uses material extrusion printing (or fused deposition modeling), solid conductor wire embedding, direct-write, component placement, and micromaching to enable multi-material fabrication. The Multi 3 D was designed to transport a workpiece between manufacturing stations via a six-axis robot, portable build platform (PBP), and a controlled temperature environment or chamber that travels to each manufacturing station. The heated travel envelope (HTE) was included to mitigate thermal shrinkage (and eventually warping) that occurs when a thermoplastic is subjected to a decrease in temperature {{within a short time}} frame. An end-effector was also designed to allow the six-axis robot to interact and handle the PBP and HTE. Discussed in this work is the design and construction of the HTE as well as its performance in terms of maintaining a stable temperature while considering the imposed weight and dimensional constraints. The HTE design includes a compressible high temperature bellow “door” which allows it slide over builds and increases the height of builds (~ 22 cm) which can be produced in the Multi 3 D system. The HTE is capable of maintaining a 150 ± 8 °C environment with its convective heating system, which is the baseline set for building parts with polycarbonate, specifically 145 °C. The temperature change (drop) of parts is reduced by 71 % with the inclusion of HTE in the transportation process. The quantified temperature drop without the HTE during transportation was approximately 21 °C in comparison to 6 °C with the HTE. The construction and performance (e. g., locating accuracy) of the PBP are also discussed. The PBP was designed around the “Platen” build platform to replicate its abilities but in a form that allows it to be portable. The PBP is able to receive vacuum (- 42. 3 ± 8. 5 KPa) supply for restraining sacrificial build sheets in two forms, from the station of the Multi 3 D system it is placed in and from the end-effector. The PBP locates accurately into the FDM system, in a form that maintains the FDM’s achievable accuracy of ± 38 ?m, via the use of three locating pins and its <b>vacuum</b> <b>fitting.</b> The locating accuracy of the PBP was determined by printing “stair step” parts which were analyzed for layer shifting. These results were compared to stair steps printed in an unmodified FDM system as a control. The layer shifting was measured to be + 50. 8 to - 38. 1 ?m for non-paused builds and + 63. 5 to - 50. 8 ?m for paused builds on both machines (modified and control). This gave indication that the modifications done to the FDM machine and the portable build platform had no direct effect on the achievable accuracy in parts with this specific geometry and these processing conditions. Ultimately, the Multi 3 D system will be utilized for Aerospace applications to manufacture components for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites, but other applications where disparate materials are required can be envisioned. This can be accomplished with these components or subsystems which were developed for material handling within the system. ...|$|E

Two-electrode Conflat cells {{were found to}} have the same performance as two-electrode coin cells at room temperature, while three-electrode Conflat cells are much easier to assemble than three-electrode coin cells. Such cells maintain good stack pressure, tolerate high vapor pressure solvents and can operate at temperatures up to 200 ◦C. Conflat cells are especially useful for high temperature and magnesium battery research, where the need for three-electrode cells operated at elevated temperatures with volatile solvents makes the use of coin cell hardware impractical. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.

Coin or Swagelok cells are the most commonly used hardware for testing metal ion battery materials. Coin cells are excellent test vehicles for new electrode materials, as they are simple and quick to make and are reproducible. 1 However, the thin metal cell casing can easily distort, making even stack pressure difficult to achieve.

In new construction, the vacuum tubing is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, vacuum tubing should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing.

One locomotive, No. 5 {{was the first}} to be delivered to Treforest Junction where it hauled the Engineer's Saloon at the northern end of the line; the through line to the docks not yet being completed. To perform this duty, No. 5 was fitted with a vacuum injector and train pipes. Because of this, No.5 had the honour of hauling the first passenger train between Barry Docks and Cogan when the line opened on 20 December 1888. The following year, the Class C locomotives arrived and were specifically designed for passenger traffic.

40|$|Description of {{activities}} conducted this report period: (1) Electronics Development [...] To improve the overall {{performance of the}} two-channel digital pulse processor (DPP 2), the PCB has been redesigned and the new printed board is now under assembly. The system is enhanced with two new fast ADCs from Analog Devices (AD 9230 - 250), each with a sampling rate of 250 MHz and a resolution of 12 bits. The data bus uses a high performance Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) standard. The offset and gain of each channel are separately controlled digitally by the GUI software. (2) GUI Software Development [...] A GUI is being developed using the Python programming language. All functions from the preceding MATLAB code have been re-implemented including basic waveform readout, pulse shape discrimination, and plotting of energy spectra. In addition, the GUI {{can be used to}} control sampling runs {{based on the number of}} pulses captured, either in real or live time. Calibration coefficients and pulse shape discrimination boundaries can be changed on the fly so that the detector may be characterized experimentally. Plots generated by the GUI can be exported as graphic data. At present, the software has only been tested using one channel, pending availability of the new DPP board (DPP 2). However, the functions have been written to allow easy expansion to two channels. (3) Light Collection Modeling [...] The XEPHWICH design has been modeled to determine its light capture efficiency. Research in the 7 th quarter includes additional simulations representing significant increase in data resolution, well over an order of magnitude greater than previous simulations. The final data set represents approximately 11 billion visible photons divided equally among 110 thousand data points. A laboratory experiment is being designed and executed to experimentally determine light capture efficiency as a function of position within the scintillators. (4) Radioxenon Fission Source [...] We have designed and constructed a fission chamber to be used for the collection of radioxenon gases following neutron bombardment of HEU in the Oregon State University TRIGA reactor. The aluminum housing and all <b>vacuum</b> <b>fittings</b> have been assembled, awaiting an HEU transfer from PNNL. Students have worked closely with PNNL and OSU Radiation Safety personnel to facilitate transfer of the HEU. The OSU TRIGA Reactor Operations Committee has approved the experiment. (5) Spectral (beta) Recognition [...] Spectral identification by a neural network developed in our laboratory was compared to that of solvers of a linear system of equations. Data indicate that our neural network is capable of identifying three beta emission sources ({sup 14 }C, {sup 36 }Cl, and {sup 99 }Tc) simultaneously with reliability to within 3 %...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{renormalization}} prescription for the quark-meson model in an extended mean-field approximation, where vacuum quark fluctuations are included. At a given cutoff scale the model parameters are fixed by <b>fitting</b> <b>vacuum</b> quantities, typically including the sigma-meson mass m_σ and the pion decay constant f_π. In most publications {{the latter is}} identified with the expectation value of the sigma field, while for m_σ the curvature mass is taken. When quark loops are included, this prescription is however inconsistent, and the correct identification involves the renormalized pion decay constant and the sigma pole mass. In the present article we investigate {{the influence of the}} parameter-fixing scheme on the phase structure of the model at finite temperature and chemical potential. Despite large differences between the model parameters in the two schemes, we find that in homogeneous matter the effect on the phase diagram is relatively small. For inhomogeneous phases, on the other hand, the choice of the proper renormalization prescription is crucial. In particular, we show that if renormalization effects on the pion decay constant are not considered, the model does not even present a well-defined renormalized limit when the cutoff is sent to infinity.

40|$|Threaded tubular {{fittings}} {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of industries for critical applications involving fluid transfer in a pressurised or <b>vacuum</b> system. These <b>fittings</b> are made of corrosion resistant metals such as stainless steel which are desirable in corrosive operating conditions; however, stainless steel is prone to galling which can cause threads to seize, resulting in loss of productivity. To prevent this, threads are electroplated using silver (Ag) coatings which prevent galling and serve as a solid lubricant during the connection make-up process. The Ag cyanide electroplating process currently used in industry is both hazardous to human health and its wastes are detrimental to the environment. The objective of this work is to evaluate environmental friendly self-lubricating Ag and Ag-polytetrafluoroethylene composite coatings using a non-cyanide electroplating process against the commercially available cyanide Ag coating through the analysis of torque-angle signatures and the torque-angle slope which characterises the make-up process. Results from the experiments suggest that the non-cyanide Ag-polytetrafluoroethylene coating is a potentially viable replacement option. Investigation and analysis of the coating performance have also highlighted potential risks of failure through poor lubrication during the make-up process and suggestions for improving the make-up process...|$|R
40|$|From {{the general}} {{assumption}} that gravity originates from the coupling and thermal equilibrium between matter and vacuum, after a derivation of Newton's {{law of gravitation}} and {{an interpretation of the}} attractive gravity force between two classical objects, we consider the macroscopic quantum gravity effect for particles whose wave packets are delocalized at macroscopic scale. We predict an abnormal repulsive gravity effect in this work. For a sphere full of superfluid helium, it is shown that with a gravimeter placed in this sphere, the sensitivities of the gravity acceleration Δ g/g below 10 ^- 8 could be used to test the abnormal quantum gravity effect, which satisfies the present experimental technique of atom interferometer, free-fall absolute gravimeters and superconducting gravimeters. We further propose a self-consistent field equation including the quantum effect of gravity. As an application of this field equation, we give a simple interpretation of the accelerating universe due to dark energy. Based on the idea that the dark energy originates from the quantum gravity effect of vacuum excitations due to the coupling between matter and <b>vacuum,</b> without any <b>fitting</b> parameter, the ratio between dark energy density and matter density (including dark matter) is calculated as 2. 2, which agrees quantitatively with the result 7 / 3 obtained from various astronomical observations. Comment: 42 pages, 11 figures. This work is a significant extension of our previous papers with several physical concepts being clarified and new method to calculate the dark energy density by including general relativit...|$|R
40|$|Pulse intensities {{greater than}} 10 (17) Watt/cm(2) were reached at the FLASH soft X-ray laser in Hamburg, Germany, using an {{off-axis}} parabolic mirror to focus 15 fs pulses of 5 - 70 mu J energy at 13. 5 nm wavelength to a micron-sized spot. We describe {{the interaction of}} such pulses with niobium and vanadium targets and their deuterides. The beam produced craters in the solid targets, and we measured the kinetic energy of ions ejected from these craters. Ions with several keV kinetic energy were observed from craters approaching 5 mu m in depth when the sample was at best focus. We also observed the onset of saturation in both ion acceleration and ablation with pulse intensities exceeding 10 (16) W/cm(2), when the highest detected ion energies and the crater depths tend to saturate with increasing intensity. A general difficulty in working with micron and sub-micron focusing optics is finding the exact focus of the beam inside a vacuum chamber. Here we propose a direct method to measure the focal position to a resolution better than the Rayleigh length. The method {{is based on the}} correlation between the energies of ejected ions and the physical dimensions of the craters. We find that the focus position can be quickly determined from the ion time-of-flight (TOF) data as the target is scanned through the expected focal region. The method does not require external access to the sample or venting the <b>vacuum</b> chamber. Profile <b>fitting</b> employed to analyze the TOF data can extend resolution beyond the actual scanning step size. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemistry}} of decamethylferrocene (DmFc) {{has been}} studied in organic solvent systems and {{proven to be a}} superior internal reference redox standard to ferrocene (Fc). However, the electrochemical information on this redox couple in ionic liquids is still limited. Therefore, the voltammetric and amperometric behaviour of DmFc was investigated under argon and vacuum conditions in six different ionic liquids and compared to that of Fc under the same experimental conditions. Consequently, the concentration, the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant (k 0), volatility, and diffusion coefficients (D) of Fc and Fc+, as well as the solubility, k 0, and D values for DmFc and DmFc+ were determined under argon and <b>vacuum</b> conditions by <b>fitting</b> the experimental chronoamperometric and voltammetric data with numerical and digital simulations. The rate of mass transport of ferrocene and decamethylferrocene was observed to decreases between 6 - 37 % by changing the working atmosphere from argon to vacuum. The D Fc/DFc+ ratios are in the range 1. 31 - 2. 01 in the different ILs. Importantly, the DDmFc/DDmFc+ ratio is ≈ 1 in 1 -methyl- 3 -butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide, 1 -methyl- 1 -butylpyrrolidinium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate, and 1 -methyl- 3 -ethylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl) trifluorophosphate. The experimental mid-point potential and half-wave potential of Fc 0 /+ vs. DmFc 0 /+, as well as the formal potential obtained after correction for inequality in the respective diffusion coefficients of both redox processes are presented. Even though DmFc is not freely soluble in the different ILs, the results presented in this work suggest that the DmFc 0 /+ redox process is less dependent than Fc on the IL nature. This is a very relevant finding for the application of this transition-metal sandwich complex as an internal reference redox system in IL solutions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
