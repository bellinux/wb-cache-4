5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, congestus, and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, cumulus pileus, <b>velum,</b> virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|H.olivaceoalbus shows {{similarities}} between other closely related fungi {{of the genus}} Hygrophorus, {{some of which have}} only minor differences in physical features. Examples include H.pustulatus, H.inocybiformis, H.tephroleucus or H.morrisii. In the field, H.olivaceoalbus is distinguished by a combination of features including the double <b>velum,</b> the dark streaks on the slimy cap, the ing of the stem, and growth under pines, as well as by microscopic characteristics. There is no risk of confusing it with toxic fungi.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus <b>velum</b> clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of the Pectinidae family, the Antarctic scallop is a {{suspension}} feeder, extracting its nourishment from the sea water that surrounds it. Bands of cilia on the <b>velum,</b> a curtain-like fold of the mantle, waft particles towards the gills. Oxygen is absorbed by the gills and food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are trapped in mucous and transported to the mouth by cilia. There is a seasonal increase in microscopic ice algae which become available to suspension feeders when the sea ice melts in the summer, and most of the annual growth takes place at this time. Research has shown that this is {{as a result of the}} rise in sea temperature and not the greater availability of food.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The <b>velum,</b> the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{utilizing the}} western blot technique showed an improved detection of EPO {{in blood and}} urine based on novel <b>Velum</b> SAR precast horizontal gels optimized for routine analysis. With {{the adoption of the}} horizontal SAR-PAGE in combination with the precast film-supported <b>Velum</b> SAR gels the discriminatory capacity of micro-dose application of rEPO was significantly enhanced.|$|E
25|$|It has a {{secondary}} articulation of velarization or pharyngealization, {{meaning that the}} back or root of the tongue approaches the soft palate (<b>velum),</b> or {{the back of the}} throat, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In phonetics, ingressive {{sounds are}} sounds {{by which the}} {{airstream}} flows inward through the mouth or nose. The three types of ingressive sounds are lingual ingressive or velaric ingressive (from the tongue and the <b>velum),</b> glottalic ingressive (from the glottis), and pulmonic ingressive (from the lungs).|$|E
25|$|The bladder {{walls are}} very thin and transparent, but are {{sufficiently}} inflexible {{to maintain the}} bladder's shape despite the vacuum created within. The entrance, or 'mouth', of the trap is a circular or oval flap whose upper half is joined {{to the body of}} the trap by very flexible, yielding cells which form an effective hinge. The door rests on a platform formed by the thickening of the bladder wall immediately underneath. A soft but substantial membrane called the <b>velum</b> stretches in a curve around the middle of this platform, and helps seal the door. A second band of springy cells cross the door just above its lower edge, and provide the flexibility for the bottom of the door to become a bendable 'lip' which can make a perfect seal with the <b>velum.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{tested the}} role of the <b>velum</b> by showing that the trap will never set if small cuts are made to it; and showed that the {{excretion}} of water can be continued under all conditions likely {{to be found in the}} natural environment, but can be prevented by driving the osmotic pressure in the trap beyond normal limits by the introduction of glycerine.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} pattern {{within the}} motor map determines the movement pattern of all model articulators (lips, tongue, <b>velum,</b> glottis) for a speech item. In {{order not to}} overload the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done. The Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer is used in order to generate articulator movements, which allows the generation of a time-varying vocal tract form and the generation of the acoustic speech signal for each particular speech item.|$|E
25|$|Hydrozoa medusae {{also have}} tetra-radial symmetry, nearly {{always have a}} <b>velum</b> {{attached}} just inside the bell margin, do not have oral arms, but a much smaller central manubrium with terminal mouth opening, and are distinguished {{by the absence of}} cells in the mesoglea. The majority of hydrozoan species maintain the polyp form for their entire life cycle and do not form medusa at all (such as Hydra, which is hence not considered a jellyfish).|$|E
25|$|Extending {{outwards}} {{from the}} bottom of the trapdoor are several long bristle-stiff protuberances that are sometimes referred to as trigger hairs or antennae but which have no similarity to the sensitive triggers found in Dionaea and Aldrovanda. In fact, these bristles are simply levers. The suction force exerted by the primed bladder on the door is resisted by the adhesion of its flexible bottom against the soft-sealing <b>velum.</b> The equilibrium depends quite literally on a hair trigger, and the slightest touch to one of the lever hairs will deform the flexible door lip enough to create a tiny gap, breaking the seal.|$|E
25|$|In biology, a medusa (plural: medusae) {{is a form}} of {{cnidarian}} {{in which}} the body is shaped like an umbrella, in contrast with polyps. Medusae vary from bell-shaped to the shape of a thin disk, scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below. The upper or aboral surface is called the exumbrella and the lower surface is called the subumbrella; the mouth is located on the lower surface, which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin (called the <b>velum).</b> The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin; these canals may be simple or branching, and vary in number from few to many. The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacles.|$|E
25|$|For speech production, the ACT model {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of a phonemic representation of a speech item (phonemic map). In {{the case of a}} frequent syllable, a co-activation occurs {{at the level of the}} phonetic map, leading to a further co-activation of the intended sensory state at the level of the sensory state maps and to a co-activation of a motor plan state at the level of the motor plan map. In the case of an infrequent syllable, an attempt for a motor plan is generated by the motor planning module for that speech item by activating motor plans for phonetic similar speech items via the phonetic map (see Kröger et al. 2011). The motor plan or vocal tract action score comprises temporally overlapping vocal tract actions, which are programmed and subsequently executed by the motor programming, execution, and control module. This module gets real-time somatosensory feedback information for controlling the correct execution of the (intended) motor plan. Motor programing leads to activation pattern at the level lof the primary motor map and subsequently activates neuromuscular processing. Motoneuron activation patterns generate muscle forces and subsequently movement patterns of all model articulators (lips, tongue, <b>velum,</b> glottis). The Birkholz 3D articulatory synthesizer is used in order to generate the acoustic speech signal.|$|E
500|$|The cap of H.olivaceoalbus is [...] {{wide and}} is {{hemispherical}} in young fungi; they become flatter and wider with age, but {{they keep their}} characteristic dark umbo. Underneath the slimy grey to sooty-brown surface, the cap cuticle is streaked with fine, dark grey radially arranged fibers. Young fruit bodies are covered by two <b>velum</b> layers; the inner <b>velum,</b> composed of dark fibrils, becomes a ring or sheath (annular zone) on the stem that is covered by the gelatinous outer layer.|$|E
500|$|Consonants {{are those}} sounds that have audible {{friction}} or closure {{at some point}} within the upper vocal tract. Consonant sounds vary by place of articulation, i.e. the place in the vocal tract where the airflow is obstructed, commonly at the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, palate, <b>velum,</b> uvula, or glottis. Each place of articulation produces {{a different set of}} consonant sounds, which are further distinguished by manner of articulation, or the kind of friction, whether full closure, in which case the consonant is called occlusive or stop, or different degrees of aperture creating fricatives and approximants. Consonants can also be either voiced or unvoiced, depending on whether the vocal cords are set in vibration by airflow during the production of the sound. Voicing is what separates English [...] in bus (unvoiced sibilant) from [...] in buzz (voiced sibilant).|$|E
500|$|The {{most basic}} {{molluscan}} larva is a trochophore, which is planktonic and feeds on floating food particles {{by using the}} two bands of cilia around its [...] "equator" [...] to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. New tissue grows in the bands of mesoderm in the interior, so the apical tuft and anus are pushed further apart as the animal grows. The trochophore stage is often succeeded by a veliger stage in which the prototroch, the [...] "equatorial" [...] band of cilia nearest the apical tuft, develops into the <b>velum</b> ("veil"), a pair of cilia-bearing lobes with which the larva swims. Eventually, the larva sinks to the seafloor and metamorphoses into the adult form. While metamorphosis is the usual state in molluscs, the cephalopods differ in exhibiting direct development: the hatchling is a 'miniaturized' form of the adult.|$|E
500|$|The koala {{has one of}} the {{smallest}} brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal, being 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only [...] The brain's surface is fairly smooth, typical for a [...] "primitive" [...] animal. It occupies only 61% of the cranial cavity and is pressed against the inside surface by cerebrospinal fluid. The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is not known, although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree. The koala's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain. Because of its small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves. The koala's olfactory senses are normal, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility. Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its round ears provide it with good hearing, and it has a well-developed middle ear. A koala's vision is not well developed, and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits. Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-pitched sounds (see social spacing, below). Unlike typical mammalian vocal cords, which are folds in the larynx, these organs are placed in the <b>velum</b> (soft palate) and are called velar vocal cords.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{species of}} the scallop family are {{free-living}} active swimmers, propelling themselves through the water {{through the use of}} the adductor muscles to open and close their shells. [...] Swimming occurs by the clapping of valves for water intake. Closing the valves propels water with strong force near the hinge via the <b>velum,</b> a curtain-like fold of the mantle that directs water expulsion around the hinge. Scallops swim {{in the direction of the}} valve opening, unless the <b>velum</b> directs an abrupt change in course direction.|$|E
2500|$|Basic shape: [...] is a {{side view}} {{of the back of}} the tongue raised toward the <b>velum</b> (soft palate). (For illustration, access the {{external}} link below.) [...] is derived from [...] with a stroke for the burst of aspiration.|$|E
2500|$|Adults superficially {{resemble}} eels in {{that they}} have scaleless,elongated bodies, and can range from 13 to 100cm (5 to 40inches) in length. Lacking paired fins, adult lampreys have large eyes, one nostril {{on the top of}} the head, and seven gill pores on each side of the head. The pharynx is subdivided; the ventral part forming a respiratory tube that is isolated from the mouth by a valve called the <b>velum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Each neuron (model cell, {{artificial}} neuron) {{within the}} speech sound map can be activated and subsequently activates a forward motor command towards the motor map, called articulatory velocity and position map. The activated neural representation [...] {{on the level}} of that motor map determines the articulation of a speech unit, i.e. controls all articulators (lips, tongue, <b>velum,</b> glottis) during the time interval for producing that speech unit. Forward control also involves subcortical structures like the cerebellum, not modelled in detail here.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} {{accessory}} clouds comprise formations {{that are associated}} mainly with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection. Pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud, whereas a <b>velum</b> feature is a thin horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or {{in front of the}} parent cloud. [...] An accessory cloud recently officially recognized the World meteorological Organization is the flumen, also known more informally as the beaver's tail. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or scud clouds and does not rotate.|$|E
2500|$|The human supralaryngeal tract {{is said to}} be {{digital in}} the sense that it is an {{arrangement}} of moveable toggles or switches, each of which, at any one time, must be in one state or another. The vocal cords, for example, are either vibrating (producing a sound) or not vibrating (in silent mode). By virtue of simple physics, the corresponding distinctive feature— in this case, [...] "voicing"— cannot be somewhere in between. The options are limited to [...] "off" [...] and [...] "on". Equally digital is the feature known as [...] "nasalisation". At any given moment the soft palate or <b>velum</b> either allows or doesn't allow sound to resonate in the nasal chamber. In the case of lip and tongue positions, more than two digital states may be allowed. (To experiment with this, click on [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Despite all this, {{scholars}} remain divided {{as to how}} [...] "special" [...] {{the human}} vocal tract really is. It {{has been shown that}} the larynx does descend to some extent during development in chimpanzees, followed by hyoidal descent. As against this, Philip Lieberman points out that only humans have evolved permanent and substantial laryngeal descent in association with hyoidal descent, resulting in a curved tongue and two-tube vocal tract with 1:1 proportions. Uniquely in the human case, simple contact between the epiglottis and <b>velum</b> is no longer possible, disrupting the normal mammalian separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts during swallowing. Since this entails substantial costsnbsp&— increasing the risk of choking while swallowing foodnbsp&— we are forced to ask what benefits might have outweighed those costs. The obvious benefitnbsp&— so it is claimednbsp&— must have been speech. But this idea has been vigorously contested. One objection is that humans are in fact not seriously at risk of choking on food: medical statistics indicate that accidents of this kind are extremely rare. Another objection is that in the view of most scholars, speech as we know it emerged relatively late in human evolution, roughly contemporaneously with the emergence of Homo sapiens. A development as complex as the reconfiguration of the human vocal tract would have required much more time, implying an early date of origin. This discrepancy in timescales undermines the idea that human vocal flexibility was initially driven by selection pressures for speech.|$|E
60|$|Section 22. Figure 9 ii. shows all the {{essential}} {{points of the}} structure of amphioxus. Epiblast is indicated by a line of dashes, mesoblast by dots, and hypoblast, dark or black. The true mouth is formed late by a tucking-in of epiblast, the stomodaeum (s.d.), which meets and fuses with the hypoblast, and is then perforated. The position of this mouth is at the <b>velum.</b> The formation of the atrium has been described. The metapleural folds run forward in front of the <b>velum,</b> as the epipleurs (ep. in Sections 1 and 2), and form an oral hood (b.c.), around which the tentacles appear, and which is evidently not equivalent to the vertebrate mouth cavity, but in front of and outside it. The anus is formed by a tucking in, the proctodaeum, similar to the stomodaeum.|$|E

The {{alimentary}} canal of Amphioxus commences with an [...] "oral cavity," [...] not represented in our vertebrata, {{surrounded by a}} number of cirri, or tentacles, supported by a horny substance which seems to be chitin, a common skeletal material among invertebrates. A <b>velum</b> (v.) forms a curtain, perforated by the mouth and by two smaller hyoidean apertures, between the oral cavity and the pharynx (ph.). [...] "Pharyux" [...] is here used in a wider sense than in the true vertebrata; it reaches back close to the liver, and is therefore equivalent to pharynx + oesophagus + a portion or all of the stomach. The [so-called] hyoidean apertures are not equivalent to the similarly-named parts of the vertebrata. Behind the pharynx the intestine (int.) runs straight out to the anus (an.), which opens not in the middle line, as one might expect, but in the left side! The liver lies usually on the creature's right, and instead of being a compact gland, is simply bag-like.|$|E
5000|$|Cumulonimbus <b>velum</b> (Cb vel) (from the Latin {{cumulonimbus}}, [...] "column-rain" [...] + <b>velum,</b> [...] "veil") is a cumulonimbus cloud {{with a small}} {{layer of}} altostratus cloud wrapped around its mid area, representing an area of humid stable air created {{as a result of}} the growth of the parent cumulonimbus.
