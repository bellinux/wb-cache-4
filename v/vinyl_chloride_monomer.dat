5000|$|In 1926, Waldo Semon, {{working in}} the United States, invented {{plasticized}} polyvinyl chloride. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a plastic containing carbon, hydrogen and chlorine. It is produced {{by the process of}} polymerisation. Molecules of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>monomers</b> combine to make long chain molecules of polyvinyl chloride. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based floor coverings, commonly known as vinyls [...] made its big splash when a vinyl composition tile was displayed at the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. Because of the scarcity of vinyl during the war years, vinyl flooring was not widely marketed until the late 1940s, eventually became the most popular choice for flooring in just about any hard-surface application.|$|R
25|$|<b>Vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> is a {{chemical}} intermediate, not a final product. Due to the hazardous nature of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{to human health}} there are no end products that use <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> in its <b>monomer</b> form. Polyvinyl <b>chloride</b> is very stable, storable, and nowhere near as acutely hazardous as the monomer.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the {{carcinogenicity}} of vinyl chloride (usually called <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>monomer</b> or VCM) {{was linked to}} cancers in workers in the polyvinyl chloride industry. Specifically workers in polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville, Kentucky, were diagnosed with liver angiosarcoma also known as hemangiosarcoma, a rare disease. Since that time, studies of PVC workers in Australia, Italy, Germany, and the UK have all associated certain types of occupational cancers with exposure to vinyl chloride, {{and it has become}} accepted that VCM is a carcinogen. [...] Technology for removal of VCM from products has become stringent, commensurate with the associated regulations.|$|E
2500|$|According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), [...] "vinyl {{chloride}} {{emissions from}} polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ethylene dichloride (EDC), and <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>monomer</b> (VCM) plants cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated {{to result in}} an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible illness. Vinyl chloride is a known human carcinogen that causes a rare cancer of the liver." [...] EPA's 2001 updated Toxicological Profile and Summary Health Assessment for VCM in its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) database lowers EPA's previous risk factor estimate by a factor of 20 and concludes that [...] "because of the consistent evidence for liver cancer in all the studies...and the weaker association for other sites, it is concluded that the liver is the most sensitive site, and protection against liver cancer will protect against possible cancer induction in other tissues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} is an organochloride {{with the}} formula H2C=CHCl {{that is also}} called <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>monomer</b> (VCM) or chloroethene. This colorless compound is an important industrial chemical chiefly used to produce the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). About 13 billion kilograms are produced annually. VCM is among the top twenty largest petrochemicals (petroleum-derived chemicals) in world production. The United States currently remains the largest VCM manufacturing region because of its low-production-cost position in chlorine and ethylene raw materials. China is also a large manufacturer {{and one of the}} largest consumers of VCM. Vinyl chloride is a gas with a sweet odor. It is highly toxic, flammable, and carcinogenic. It can be formed in the environment when soil organisms break down [...] "chlorinated" [...] solvents. Vinyl chloride that is released by industries or formed by the breakdown of other chlorinated chemicals can enter the air and drinking water supplies. Vinyl chloride is a common contaminant found near landfills. In the past VCM {{has been used as a}} refrigerant.|$|E

Several recent reports (1 - 3) have contributed new observations on pulmonary disease in <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> (VC) - and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) exposed patients. Earlier reports, a few even preceding the identification in 1974 of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> as a human carcinogen (with hemangiosarcoma of the liver the marker tumor, but most probably not the only tumor), had centered on the rather unexpected occurrence of pulmonary radiologic abnormalities (4 - 8) or pulmonary function impairment (4, 9 - 12) or had indicated dyspnea as a prominent symptom (11, 13) in VC and/or PVC exposed workers. The radiologic pattern first described in 1975 (5) was essentially that of reticular-linear and/or nodular (small rounded) opacities, involving both lungs, predominantly in the lower zones. Pulmonary function abnormalities reported have been both restrictive and obstructive dysfunction with diffusion defects and arterial desaturation in some cases.

2500|$|The {{hepatotoxicity}} of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> {{has long}} been established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its infant stages. In the very first study {{about the dangers of}} <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of test animals to just a single short-term high dose of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> caused liver damage. In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> caused liver injury among workers. In 1954, B.F. Goodrich Chemical stated that <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> caused liver injury upon short-term exposures. [...] Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects. They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies. The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made. In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in test animals from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm). Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers. In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans. In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P. L. Viola, a European researcher working for the European <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> industry, indicated, [...] "every monomer used in V.C. manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver. Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes. The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures." [...] In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> exposure, Viola added that he [...] "should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> such as a reduction of the threshold limit value of monomer …" [...] In 1970, Viola, reported that test animals exposed to 30,000 ppm of <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> developed cancerous tumors. Viola began his research looking for the cause of liver and bone injuries found in <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> workers. Viola's findings in 1970 were a [...] "red flag" [...] to B.F. Goodrich and the industry. In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> industry, found liver tumors (including angiosarcoma) from <b>vinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day.|$|R
