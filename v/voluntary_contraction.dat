25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. While {{there may be}} some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim to increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of <b>voluntary</b> <b>contraction</b> (EAS).|$|E

25|$|Identification of {{the exact}} causes usually begins with a {{thorough}} medical history, including detailed questioning about symptoms, bowel habits, diet, medication and other medical problems. Digital rectal examination is performed to assesses resting pressure and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contraction</b> (maximum squeeze) of the sphincter complex and puborectalis. Anal sphincter defects, rectal prolapse, and abnormal perineal descent may be detected. Anorectal physiology tests assess {{the functioning of the}} anorectal anatomy. Anorectal manometry records the pressure exerted by the anal sphincters and puborectalis during rest and during contraction. The procedure is also able to assess sensitivity of the anal canal and rectum. Anal electromyography tests for nerve damage, which is often associated with obstetric injury. Pudendal nerve terminal motor latency tests for damage to the pudendal motor nerves. Proctography, also known as defecography, shows how much stool the rectum can hold, how well the rectum holds it, and how well the rectum can evacuate the stool. It will also highlight defects {{in the structure of the}} rectum such as internal rectal intussusception. Dynamic pelvic MRI, also called MRI defecography is an alternative which is better for some problems but not as good for other problems. Proctosigmoidoscopy involves the insertion of an endoscope (a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera) into the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid colon. The procedure allows for visualization of the interior of the gut, and may detect signs of disease or other problems that could be a cause, such as inflammation, tumors, or scar tissue. Endoanal ultrasound, which some consider to be the gold standard for detection of anal canal lesions, evaluates the structure of the anal sphincters, and may detect occult sphincter tears that otherwise would go unseen.|$|E

Some of these that had no hole in them, I carefully opened with my Knife, and found in them a good large round white Maggot, almost as bigg as a small Pea, which seem'd shap'd like other Maggots, but shorter. I could not find them to move, though I ghess'd them to be alive, because upon pricking them with a Pinn, there would issue out a great deal of white mucous matter, which seem'd to be from a <b>voluntary</b> <b>contraction</b> of their skin; their husk or matrix consisted of three Coats, like the barks of Trees, the outermost being more rough and spongie, and the thickest, the middlemost more close, hard, white, and thin, the innermost very thin, seeming almost like the skin within an Egg's shell. The two outermost had root in the branch or stick, but the innermost had no stem or process, but was onely a skin that cover'd the cavity of the Nut. All the Nuts that had no holes eaten in them, I found to contain these Maggots, but all that had holes, I found empty, the Maggots, it seems, having eaten their way through, taken wings and flown away, as this following account (which I receiv'd in writing from the same person, as it was sent him by his Brother) manifests.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} effects of 6 wk of sub-maximal {{training}} by electrostimulation (100 Hz) and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> on the contractile properties of the adductor pollicis muscle in intact man. The daily training program consisted of ten series of twenty 1 -s isotonic contractions (60 to 65 % of maximum) separated by 1 -s intervals. The observed increase in muscle force, tested in maximal voluntary and electrically evoked contractions, appears to be significantly smaller during electrostimulation than during a training session performed by <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions.</b> The increase in force recorded during electrostimulation is not associated with changes in the tetanus rates of tension development and tension relaxation (dP 0 /dt). Conversely, the tetanus time course {{is found to be}} significantly accelerated in muscles trained by <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions.</b> No change of the surface action potential total area was observed during both training procedures. Furthermore, electrostimulation does not improve muscle resistance to fatigue, which is observed to be significantly increased after training by <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions.</b> This study indicates that electrostimulation augments the muscle force of contraction by changing peripheral processes associated with intra-cellular events, without modifying the nervous command of the contraction. The comparison of the peripheral changes recorded during sub-maximal training by electrostimulation and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> suggests that electrostimulation is less efficient, but complementary to voluntary training because the number and the type of trained motor units are different in the two procedures.

40|$|Context. Maximal <b>voluntary</b> {{isometric}} <b>contraction,</b> {{a method}} quantitatively assessing muscle strength, {{has proven to}} be reliable, accurate and sensitive in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Hand-held dynamometry is less expensive and more quickly applicable than maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction.</b> Objective. To investigate if hand-held dynamometry is as reliable and valid as maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction</b> in measuring muscle strength in patients with an adult-onset, non-hereditary progressive lower motor neuron syndrome. Design. Two testers performed maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction</b> and hand-held dynamometry measurements in six muscle groups bilaterally in patients with progressive lower motor neuron syndrome to assess reliability and validity of both the methods. Selling. Outpatient units of an academic medical center. Patients. A consecutive sample of 19 patients with non-hereditary progressive lower motor neuron syndrome (median disease duration 32. 5 months, range 10 - 84) was tested. Outcome measures. Comparison between maximal <b>voluntary</b> strength <b>contractions</b> as measured by hand-held dynamometry and maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction.</b> Results. Low intra- and interrater variation in all muscle groups were found, intraclass correlation coefficients vary between 0. 86 and 0. 99 for both methods. Both methods correlated well in all muscle groups with Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged between 0. 78 and 0. 98. Scatter plots indicated a trend to under-estimate muscle strength above 250 N by hand-held dynamometry as compared with maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction.</b> Conclusions. For longitudinal evaluation of muscle strength in patients with progressive lower motor neuron syndrome (i. e. between 0 and 250 N), muscle strength can be accurate quantified with both hand-held dynamometry and maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction.</b> Hand-held dynamometry has the advantage of being cheap and quickly applicable. However, our results indicate that hand-held dynamometry is less sensitive than maximal <b>voluntary</b> isometric <b>contraction</b> in detecting subnormal muscle strength in strong muscle groups (i. e. > 250 N), due to limited strength of the tester.

40|$|During strong <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions,</b> {{activity}} is {{not restricted to}} the target muscles. Other muscles, including contralateral muscles, often contract. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to analyse the origin of these unintended contralateral contractions (termed "associated" contractions). Subjects (n = 9) performed maximal <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> (MVCs) with their right elbow-flexor muscles followed by submaximal contractions with their left elbow flexors. Electromyographic activity (EMG) during the submaximal contractions was matched to the associated EMG in the left biceps brachii during the right MVC. During contractions, TMS was delivered to the motor cortex of the right or left hemisphere and excitatory motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and inhibitory (silent period) responses recorded from left biceps. Changes at a spinal level were investigated using cervicomedullary stimulation to activate corticospinal paths (n = 5). Stimulation of the right hemisphere produced silent periods of comparable duration in associated and <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> (218 vs 217 ms, respectively), whereas left hemisphere stimulation caused a depression of EMG but no EMG silence in either contraction. Despite matched EMG, MEPs elicited by right hemisphere stimulation were similar to 1. 5 - 2. 5 times larger during associated compared to <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> (P < 0. 005). Similar inhibition of the associated and matched voluntary activity during the silent period suggests that associated activity comes from the contralateral hemisphere and that motor areas in this (right) hemisphere are activated concomitantly with the motor areas in the left hemisphere. Comparison of the MEPs and subcortically evoked potentials implies that cortical excitability was greater in associated contractions than in the matched voluntary efforts...|$|R

[Purpose] This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the differences in the}} excitability of spinal motor neurons during motor imagery of a muscle contraction at different contraction strengths. [Methods] We recorded the F-wave in 15 healthy subjects. First, in a trial at rest, the muscle was relaxed during F-wave recording. Next, during mo-tor imagery, subjects were instructed to imagine maximum <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> of 10 %, 30 %, and 50 % while holding the sensor of a pinch meter, and F-waves were recorded for each contraction. F-waves were recorded im-mediately and at 5, 10, and 15 min after motor imagery. [Results] Both persistence and F/M amplitude ratios during motor imagery under maximum <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> of 10 %, 30 %, and 50 % were significantly higher than that at rest. In addition, persistence, F/M amplitude ratio, and latency were similar during motor imagery under the three muscle contraction strengths. [Conclusion] Motor imagery under maximum <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> of 10 %, 30 %, and 50 % can increase the excitability of spinal motor neurons.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{effects of}} β(2) -agonists on human {{skeletal}} muscle contractile properties, particularly on slow fibers, are unclear. Moreover, {{it remains to}} be ascertained whether central motor drive (CMD) during <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> could counter for eventual contractile alterations induced by β(2) -agonists. This study investigated central and peripheral neuromuscular adjustments induced by β(2) -agonist terbutaline on a predominantly slow human muscle, the soleus. METHODS: Ten recreationally active men ingested either a single dose of 8 mg of terbutaline or placebo in a randomized double-blind order (two experimental sessions). Isometric plantarflexion torque was measured during single and tetanic (10 and 100 Hz) stimulations as well as during submaximal and maximal <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> (MVC). Twitch peak torque and half-relaxation time were calculated. CMD was estimated via soleus electromyographic recordings obtained during <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> performed at approximately 50 % MVC. RESULTS: MVC and twitch peak torque were not modified by terbutaline. Twitch half-relaxation time was 28 % shorter after terbutaline administration compared with placebo (P < 0. 001). Tetanic torques at 10 and 100 Hz were significantly lower after terbutaline intake compared with placebo (- 40 % and - 24 % respectively, P < 0. 001). Despite comparable torque of submaximal <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> in the two conditions, CMD was 7 % higher after terbutaline ingestion compared with placebo (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence that terbutaline modulates the contractility of the slow soleus muscle and suggest that the increased CMD during submaximal contractions may be viewed as a compensatory adjustment of the central nervous system to counter the weakening action induced by terbutaline on the contractile function of slow muscle fibers...|$|R

Here, TMS-generated twitches and muscle relaxation during the TMS-evoked silent period were measured in fresh, heated, and fatigued muscle. Subjects performed isometric contractions of elbow flexors in two studies. Torque and EMG were recorded from elbow flexor and extensor muscles. One study (n = 6) measured muscle contraction times and relaxation rates during brief maximal and submaximal contractions in fresh and fatigued muscle. Another study (n = 7) aimed to 1) assess the reproducibility of muscle contractile properties during brief <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> in fresh muscle, 2) validate the technique for contractile properties in passively heated muscle, and 3) apply the technique to study contractile properties during sustained maximal <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions.</b> In both studies, muscle contractile properties during <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> were compared with the resting twitch evoked by motor nerve stimulation. Measurement of muscle contractile properties during <b>voluntary</b> <b>contractions</b> is reproducible in fresh muscle and reveals faster and slower muscle relaxation rates in heated and fatigued muscle, respectively. The technique is more sensitive to altered muscle state than the traditional motor nerve resting twitch. Use of TMS during sustained maximal contractions reveals slowing of muscle contraction and relaxation with different time courses {{and a decline in}} voluntary activation. Voluntary output from the motor cortex becomes insufficient to maintain complete activation of muscle, although slowing of muscle contraction and relaxation indicates that lower motor unit firing rates are required for fusion of force.
