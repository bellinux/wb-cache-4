25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} studies of the economic impact of immigration to Canada is Morton Beiser's Strangers at the Gate. This study looked at the arrival of the <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>boat</b> <b>people</b> who began to arrive in Canada in 1979 to much controversy. The total number of refugees was 60,000, the largest single group of refugees to ever arrive in Canada. Beiser first studied the boat people upon their arrival, finding that few spoke English or French, that most were farmers with few skills useful in Canada, and that they had arrived with no assets with which to establish themselves. Beiser then followed the progress of the boat people to see what effect they would have on Canada. Within ten years of arrival the boat people had an unemployment rate 2.3% lower than the Canadian average. One in five had started a business, 99% had successfully applied to become Canadian citizens, and they were considerably less likely than average to receive some form of social assistance.|$|E

In addition, the Vietnamese military also began expelling ethnic Hoa from Vietnam-occupied Kampuchea, leading to over 43,000 refugees of mostly Hoa descent fleeing overland to Thailand. By now, Vietnam was openly confiscating the properties and extorting money from fleeing refugees. In April 1979 alone, Hoa outside of Vietnam had remitted a total of US $242 million (an amount equivalent to half the total value of Vietnam's 1978 exports) through Hong Kong to Ho Chi Minh City to help their friends or family pay their way out of Vietnam. By June, money from refugees had replaced the coal industry as Vietnam's largest source of foreign exchange and was expected to reach as much as 3 billion in US dollars. By 1980, the refugee population in China reached 260,000, and the number of surviving <b>boat</b> <b>people</b> refugees in Southeast Asia reached 400,000.

500|$|By July 1974, {{following}} the cut-off of US {{aid to the}} South, the North Vietnamese leadership had decided to abrogate the ceasefire and to invade in 1975, instead of 1976 as previously planned, because they believed an earlier Vietnamese unification would put Vietnam in a stronger position against Chinese and Soviet influence. In his victory speech, Lê Duẩn stated: [...] "Our party is the unique and single leader that organised, controlled and governed the entire struggle of the Vietnamese people {{from the first day}} of the revolution." [...] In his speech he congratulated the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGRSV), the underground South Vietnamese government established in 1969, for liberating South Vietnam from imperialism. PRGRSV-ruled South Vietnam did not last long however and in 1976 the reunified Socialist Republic of Vietnam was established. Lê Duẩn purged South Vietnamese who had fought against the North, imprisoning up to 300,000 people in reeducation camps (not including [...] "dissidents detained in the many prisons of Vietnam") and setting off a mass exodus and humanitarian disaster (see <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>boat</b> <b>people).</b> A 1983 United States Department of State annual human rights survey called Vietnam under Lê Duẩn [...] "the single most repressive government in the world." ...|$|E

Commentating on the local elections of May 1977, The Economist noted [...] "The Tory tide swamped the smaller parties. That specifically includes the National Front (NF), which suffered a clear decline from last year". Her standing in the polls rose by 11% after a January 1978 interview for World in Action in which she said [...] "the British character has done so much for democracy, for law and done so much throughout the world that if there is any fear that it might be swamped people are going to react and be rather hostile to those coming in", as well as [...] "in many ways [...] add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened". In the 1979 general election, the Conservatives attracted voters from the NF, whose support almost collapsed. In a meeting in July 1979 with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington and Home Secretary William Whitelaw she objected to the number of Asian immigrants, in the context of limiting the total of <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>boat</b> <b>people</b> allowed to settle in the UK to fewer than 10,000.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis called "The Phenomenon of <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>Boat</b> People" introduces {{three reasons}} why the phenomenon was developed. It defines what the term "boat people" means. <b>Boat</b> <b>people</b> {{can be described as}} refugees fleeing on a boat from Vietnam right after the change of government in April 1975. The thesis describes three main waves of Vietnamese refugees from the historic view. It also includes a summary of social and political classes of Vietnamese people, who could be among the <b>boat</b> <b>people.</b> Then it speaks about the directions <b>boat</b> <b>people</b> fleeing from Vietnam could possibly go. There was an international response to the refugee problem so there is also a chapter about two international conferences on Indochinese refugees held in Geneva. Some refugees were repatriated. Those who were lucky enough made it to the resettlement countries, mostly to the USA, and started a new life. After some time even Vietnamese government changed its strategy and invited overseas Vietnamese to come back to Vietnam. What is new in this thesis is {{the fact that there were}} some groups of <b>people</b> among the <b>boat</b> <b>people,</b> which would not be expected to be among the refugees...|$|R

2500|$|The Fraser Government won two {{subsequent}} elections. Fraser maintained some of {{the social}} reforms of the Whitlam era, while seeking increased fiscal restraint.
