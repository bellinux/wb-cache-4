5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> {{will be required to}} record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will need to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of all 239 people on board, Flight 370 is the second deadliest {{incident}} involving a Boeing 777 and the second deadliest incident in Malaysia Airlines' history, behind Flight 17 in both categories. Malaysia Airlines was struggling financially, a problem that was exacerbated by a decline in ticket sales after the disappearance of Flight 370 and the downing of Flight 17; the airline was re-nationalised {{by the end of}} 2014. The Malaysian government received significant criticism, especially from China, for failing to disclose information promptly during the early weeks of the search. Flight 370's disappearance brought to public attention the limits of aircraft tracking and flight recorders, including several issues raised four years earlier—but never mandated—following {{the loss of}} Air France Flight 447. In response to Flight 370's disappearance, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted new standards for aircraft position reporting over open ocean, extended recording time for cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders,</b> and, from 2020, will require new aircraft designs to have a means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water.|$|E

25|$|On 5 November 1997, a Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340-300, G-VSKY, made an {{emergency}} landing following an undercarriage malfunction. Part of the undercarriage collapsed on landing, and both aircraft and runway were damaged. Recommendations made {{as a result of}} the accident included one that aircraft cabin door simulators should more accurately reproduce operating characteristics in {{an emergency}}, and another that cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> should have a two-hour duration in aircraft registered before April 1998.|$|E
25|$|The crash {{took place}} against the {{background}} of a pilots' strike that had caused bad feelings between crew members. The strike had also disrupted services, causing Flight 548 to be loaded with the maximum weight allowable. Recommendations from the inquiry led to the mandatory installation of cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> in British-registered airliners. Another recommendation was for greater caution before allowing off-duty crew members to occupy flight deck seats. Two of the pilots' unions protested the way the inquiry was conducted.|$|E
25|$|Flight data {{recorders}} and cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> {{were not}} fitted to all RAF Chinooks {{at the time}} of the accident. The absence of this data greatly reduced the amount and quality of data available to subsequent investigations. Information on speed and height were derived from the position of cockpit dials in the wreckage, and the wreckage's condition. During 1994, the RAF had begun to fit these recording devices across the Chinook HC.2 fleet prior to the accident; this process was completed in 2002.|$|E

Audiobooks, church services, and other spoken word material are still frequently sold on cassette, as lower fidelity generally is not a drawback for such content, and some people prefer the convenience of the tape controls for rewinding to repeat a missed passage. While most publishers sell CD audiobooks, they usually also offered a cassette version at the same price well into the 2000s. In the audiobooks application, where recordings may span several hours, cassettes also {{have the advantage of}} holding up to 150 minutes of material, whereas the average CD holds less than 80.|$|E
500|$|At 5:56p.m. (16:56 UTC), {{one minute}} and 56 seconds into the flight, the plane {{disappeared}} from radar screens. Officials later determined that the plane went into a diving right turn before vanishing from radar screens. Burning wreckage was scattered for 200 to 300 metres near houses in Niederhasli, some [...] northwest of the runway at Zurich's Kloten airport.

2500|$|Recommendations {{included}} an urgent call for cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> and for closer co-operation between the Civil Aviation Authority and British airlines. Though the report covered {{the state of}} industrial relations at BEA, no mention was made of it in its conclusions, despite the feelings of observers that it intruded directly and comprehensively onto the aircraft's flight deck. BEA ceased to exist as a separate entity in 1974, when it and the British Overseas Airways Corporation merged to form British Airways. A recommendation of the report that all British-registered civil passenger-carrying aircraft of more than [...] all-up weight should be equipped with cockpit <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> resulted in their fitting becoming mandatory on larger British-registered airliners from 1973.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{similarities}} {{were drawn}} between Flight 5452 {{and that of}} Northwest Airlink Flight 2268, another CASA C-212 which crashed in Detroit earlier that year. [...] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated. The NTSB investigation was hindered {{by the lack of}} flight data or <b>voice</b> <b>recorders,</b> which were not required on commuter aircraft at the time, and by lack of radar data, as the Mayagüez control tower had been shut down by the Federal Aviation Administration due to budgetary constraints. Airport facilities, however, were not a factor in the crash.|$|E

2500|$|Memory {{aids are}} {{any type of}} assistive {{technology}} that helps a user learn and remember certain information. Many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading, writing, or organizational difficulties. For example, a Smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text. Users simply tap certain parts of their notes and the pen saves it and reads it back to them. From there, the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility. Digital <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> are also used to record [...] "in the moment" [...] information for fast and easy recall at a later time.|$|E
2500|$|Simple <b>voice</b> <b>recorders</b> {{and earlier}} {{cassette}} decks {{are designed to}} work with standard ferric formulations. Newer tape decks usually are built with switches and later detectors for the different bias and equalization requirements for higher grade tapes. The most common, iron oxide tapes (defined by the IEC 60094 standard, as [...] "Type I") use 120 µs equalization, while chrome and cobalt-absorbed tapes (IEC Type II) require 70 µs equalization. The recording bias levels also were different. BASF and Sony tried a dual layer tape with both ferric oxide and chrome dioxide known as 'ferrichrome' (FeCr) (IEC Type III), but these were available for {{only a short time}} in the 1970s. These also use 70 µs, just like Type II did. Metal cassettes (IEC Type IV) also use 70 µs equalization, and provide still further improvement in sound quality as well as durability. The quality normally is reflected in the price; Type I cassettes generally are the cheapest, and Type IV are usually the most expensive. BASF chrome tape used in commercially pre-recorded cassettes used type I equalization to allow greater high-frequency dynamic range for better sound quality, but the greater selling point for the music labels was that the Type I cassette shell could be used for both ferric and for chrome music cassettes.|$|E
2500|$|Klatzow {{contends that}} {{conversation}} {{of the crew}} suggests that the fire started above the South China Sea, shortly after takeoff; he believes that this indicates that the voice recorder was not working {{for a long period}} of the flight or that the crew turned it off (Cockpit <b>Voice</b> <b>Recorders</b> in aircraft at that time only recorded 30 minutes [...] ). [...] If this is the case, he says it is then likely that an unknown number of the passengers would have already died from smoke inhalation from the first fire. [...] Klatzow believes that theory is consistent with reports that find most of the passengers were in the first class area of the plane at the front as smoke from the back of the plane forced them to move forward. [...] The captain did not land the aircraft directly after the fire, Klatzow argues, because if he had he would have been arrested for endangering the lives of his passengers and it would have caused a major problem for South Africa, costing the country and SAA R400 million. [...] Klatzow argues that the captain, who was also a reservist in the South African Air Force, would therefore have been ordered to carry on to South Africa in hopes of making it there before the aircraft's structural integrity gave in. [...] These points have been refuted by others.|$|E
