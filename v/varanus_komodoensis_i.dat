50|$|Throughout {{their long}} {{evolutionary}} history, varanoids have exhibited great diversity, both in habitat and form. This superfamily includes the largest-known terrestrial lizard, Megalania (5-6 meters), {{and the largest}} extant lizard, the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis,</b> 3+ meters).|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} of Komodo National Park's {{reptiles}} is the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis).</b> It is the world's largest lizard and is among the world's largest reptiles and can reach 3m or more in length and weigh over 70 kg.|$|R
50|$|Pieter Antonie Ouwens (14 February 1849, Amsterdam - 5 March 1922, Buitenzorg) was a Dutch {{scientist}} and Director of the Java Zoological Museum and Botanical Gardens. He {{is best known}} for writing the first formal description of the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> in 1912.|$|R
50|$|The park {{is famous}} for several reasons, the most {{important}} being its collection of exotic wild animals, including some rare and endangered species including the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), African elephant (Loxodonta africana), lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris), and Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis).</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{the largest}} extant lizard, the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> another island giant, can reach 3 m in length, its extinct Australian {{relative}} Megalania may have reached {{more than twice}} that size. These monitor lizards' marine relatives, the mosasaurs, were apex predators in late Cretaceous seas.|$|R
5000|$|Three endemic genera of snake can {{be found}} only in this region: Calamorhabdium, Rabdion, and Cyclotyphlops. One {{of the most famous}} {{reptiles}} in the Wallacea is probably the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> known only from the islands of Komodo, Padar, Rinca, and the western end of Flores.|$|R
50|$|The Komodo Biosphere Reserve and National Park is {{situated}} between Flores and Sumbawa in Indonesia. It is {{renowned for its}} population of about 5,000 giant lizards, called 'Komodo dragons' (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis).</b> They exist nowhere {{else in the world}} and are of significant interest to scientists studying the theory of evolution.|$|R
50|$|The hot and {{dry climate}} of the park, {{characterized}} by savannah vegetation, makes it to a good habitat for the endemic Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis).</b> Their populations are restricted to the islands of Komodo (1,700), Rinca (1,300), Gili Motang (100), Gili Dasami (100), and Flores (c. 2,000), while extinct on Padar.|$|R
50|$|The Komodo dragon, <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis,</b> {{was found}} to be venomous only in 2009: {{magnetic}} resonance imaging shows that it possesses a mandibular gland with a major posterior compartment and five smaller anterior compartments. Mass spectrometry showed that the mixture of proteins present in the venom is as complex as the proteins found in snake venom.|$|R
50|$|The Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> {{also known}} as the Komodo monitor, is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family Varanidae, it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 m in rare cases and {{weighing}} up to approximately 70 kg.|$|R
50|$|Komodo National Park was {{established}} in 1980 and was declared a World Heritage Site and a Man and Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1991. The park was initially established to conserve the unique Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> first discovered by the scientific world in 1912 by J.K.H. Van Steyn. Since then conservation goals have expanded to protecting its entire biodiversity, both marine and terrestrial.|$|R
50|$|William L. Abler {{or simply}} known as Bill Abler is a {{paleontologist}} who has mostly studied {{the teeth of}} dinosaurs.He has studied tyrannosaurine teeth and has concluded that Tyrannosaurus had infectious saliva that could have helped it kill prey. In modern animals this saliva {{can be seen in}} many monitor lizards, such as <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis,</b> commonly known as the Komodo dragon or Komodo monitor.|$|R
5000|$|The Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> {{also known}} as the [...] "Komodo monitor", is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar. A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 m in rare cases and {{weighing}} up to approximately 70 kg.|$|R
50|$|Monitor lizards are, as a rule, {{almost entirely}} carnivorous, {{consuming}} prey {{as varied as}} insects, crustaceans, arachnids, myriapods, mollusks, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Most species feed on invertebrates as juveniles and shift to feeding on vertebrates as adults. Deer make up about 50% of the diet of adults of the largest species, <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis.</b> In contrast, three arboreal species from the Philippines, Varanus bitatawa, Varanus mabitang, and Varanus olivaceus, are primarily fruit eaters.|$|R
40|$|Komodo dragons (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> {{are able}} to feed on large prey items by inject-ing a dose of toxic {{bacteria}} with their bite that, over time, kills the prey by systemic infection. Dragons also suffer bites from other {{members of their own}} species during territorial disputes and feeding frenzies. However, they do not suf-fer the same fate as their prey, suggesting that they have developed a strong immunity to bac-terial infections. This study was undertaken to determine the antibacterial activities of serum from the Komodo dragon. Bacterial cultures were treated with different volumes serum from <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis</b> and the growth was monitored by optical density at 430 nm. In addition, the serum was treated with protease, chelators of divalent metal ions, or with mild heat to determine the mechanism of antibac-terial activities. Treatment of bacterial cul-tures with serum from Komodo dragons (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> resulted in a volume-dependent decrease in bacterial growth. Cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella oxytoca exhibited mod-erate-strong growth inhibition by V. komodoen-sis serum, while cultures of Streptococcus epi-dermitis, Salmonella typhimurium, Providen-cia stuartii, and Shigella flexneri were nearly completely obliterated for 24 h by only 10 % (v/v) serum. The antibacterial activity of V. komodensis serum occurred very rapidly, as 18 % of E. coli growth was inhibited by a five min exposure to serum. Furthermore, 10 - and 20 -min incubations of E. coli with serum from V. komodoensis resulted in 43 and 68 % inhibi-tion of bacterial growth, respectively. The bac-tericidal capacity of the serum against E. coli was 2, 075, 000 bacteria/µL serum, and was inhibited by mild heat treatment, pronase, EDTA, and phosphate, indicating that the anti-bacterial action is most probably due to the presence of a potent serum complement pro-tein system...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to biting, {{it has been}} speculated that the forces resulting from pulling on food items may also contribute to feeding success in carnivorous vertebrates. We present an in vivo analysis of both bite and pulling forces in <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis,</b> the Komodo dragon, to determine how they contribute to feeding behavior. Observations of cranial modeling and behavior suggest that V. komodoensis feeds using bite force supplemented by pulling in the caudal/ventrocaudal direction. We tested these observations using force gauges/transducers to measure biting and pulling forces. Maximum bite force correlates with both body mass and total body length, likely due to increased muscle mass. Individuals showed consistent behaviors when biting, including the typical medial-caudal head rotation. Pull force correlates best with total body length, longer limbs and larger postcranial motions. None of these forces correlated well with head dimensions. When pulling, V. komodoensis use neck and limb movements {{that are associated with}} increased caudal and ventral oriented force. Measured bite force in <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis</b> is similar to several previous estimations based on 3 D models, but is low for its body mass relative to other vertebrates. Pull force, especially in the ventrocaudal direction, would allow individuals to hunt and deflesh with high success without the need of strong jaw adductors. In future studies, pull forces need to be considere...|$|R
50|$|He {{eventually}} became {{curator of the}} Zoological Museum in Buitenzorg (now Bogor). As such he received a photo and a skin of a Komodo dragon from Lieutenant Jacques Karel Henri van Steyn van Hensbroek {{who had been the}} first Westerner to observe the lizards and had been told that they could reach 6 to 7 meters. Ouwens dispatched a collector to Komodo who returned to Java with two adults and a young specimen. Ouwens named the species <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis</b> in a publication of 1912. Ouwens became Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau and died in Buitenzorg in 1922.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin and}} diversification of the reptilian venom system is described. The resolution of higher-order molecular phylogenetics has clearly established that a venom system is ancestral to snakes. The diversification of the venom system within lizards is discussed, {{as is the}} role of venom delivery in the behavioural ecology of these taxa (particularly <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis).</b> The more extensive diversification of the venom system in snakes is summarised, including its loss in some clades. Finally, we discuss the contentious issue of a definition for "venom", supporting an evolutionary definition that recognises the homology of both the venom delivery systems and the toxins themselves...|$|R
50|$|Ouwens was keen {{to obtain}} {{additional}} samples. He recruited hunters who killed two dragons measuring 3.1 metres and 3.35 metres {{as well as}} capturing two pups, each measuring less than one metre. Ouwens carried out studies on the samples {{and concluded that the}} Komodo dragon was not a flame-thrower but was a type of monitor lizard. Research results were published in 1912. Ouwens named the giant lizard <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis.</b> Realizing the significance of the dragons on Komodo Island as an endangered species, the Dutch government issued a regulation on the protection of the lizards on Komodo Island in 1915.|$|R
50|$|In a book {{published}} in 2004, Ralph Molnar determined {{a range of}} potential sizes for megalania, made by scaling up from dorsal vertebrae, after he determined a relationship between dorsal vertebrae width and total body length. If it had a long thin tail like the lace monitor (Varanus varius), then it would have reached a length of 7.9 m, while if its tail-to-body proportions were more {{similar to that of}} the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> then a length of around 7 m is more likely. Taking the maximal 7 m length, he estimated a weight of 1940 kg, with a leaner 320 kg being average.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{species of}} high {{commercial}} value include sea cucumbers, Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), and groupers. The number of terrestrial animal species is important from a conservation perspective, as some species are endemic. The Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> {{is among the}} world’s largest reptiles and can reach over 3.6 metres in length and weigh over 90 kg. In 1991, the Komodo National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site to protect the Komodo dragon. Many of the mammals are Asiatic in origin (e.g. deer, pig, macaques, civet), while several reptile and bird species are Australian. These include the orange-footed scrubfowl (Megapodius reinwardti), the lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphure) and the friarbird.|$|R
40|$|Background The largest living lizard species, <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis</b> Ouwens 1912, is {{vulnerable}} to extinction, being restricted to a few isolated islands in eastern Indonesia, between Java and Australia, where it is the dominant terrestrial carnivore.

Methodology/Principal Findings We reconstruct the palaeobiogeography of Neogene giant varanids and identify a new (unnamed) species from the island of Timor. Our data reject the long-held perception that V. komodoensis became a giant because of insular evolution or as a specialist hunter of pygmy Stegodon.

40|$|The predatory {{ecology of}} <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis</b> (Komodo Dragon) {{has been a}} subject of long-standing {{interest}} and considerable conjecture. Here, we investigate the roles and potential interplay between cranial mechanics, toxic bacteria, and venom.

We find that the lightweight skull is relatively poorly adapted to generate high bite forces but better adapted to resist high pulling loads. We reject the popular notion regarding toxic bacteria utilization. Instead, we demonstrate that the effects of deep wounds inflicted are potentiated through venom with toxic activities including anticoagulation and shock induction.

2500|$|Komodo dragons (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> are carnivores. Although {{they eat}} mostly carrion, {{they will also}} ambush live prey with a {{stealthy}} approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon's ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal and attempt to grasp the underside or the throat. The Komodo dragon's diet is wide-ranging, and includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boar, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo. [...] The Komodo dragon hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day. [...] These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer. Komodo dragons have been observed knocking down large pigs and deer with their strong tails.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade much {{attention}} {{has focused on the}} role that genetics can play in the formation of management strategies in conservation. Here, we describe genetic diversity in the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis),</b> examining the evolutionary relationships and population genetic history of the four islands in south-east Indonesia, which form the vast majority of its range. We identify distinct genetic groups for conservation. The population on the island of Komodo shows by far the largest values of genetic divergence and is proposed that it should be a separate conservation management unit. Other populations, surviving either on small islands with substantially reduced genetic variability, or in isolated patches, are identified as particularly vulnerable to stochastic threats and habitat loss. Our results provide an example of how data defining intraspecific levels of genetic divergence can provide information to help management plans, ensure the maintenance of genetic variability across populations and identify evolutionary potential within endangered species...|$|R
40|$|Kin {{recognition}} {{facilitates the}} evolution of cooperation in animals, but its relevance in microorganisms and their behavior toward relatives remains unclear. The Entamoeba lineage constitutes an ideal model to determine the behavioral and signaling cues needed for aggregative preference. Chemical cues have been reported for E. histolytica but not E. dispar, suggesting cell-communication between con-specifics and behavioral differences with relevance for disease. Entamoeba varieties have been reported as ‘morphologically undistinguishable’. Two strains of E. invadens have been isolated from different hosts (VK- 1 : NS - <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis</b> and IP 1 - serpentes) but were classified within the same ‘species’. Trophozoites of each strain aggregate only with {{members of their own}} variety, suggesting they are able to associate based on behavioral and chemical communication. Adaptations to different environments and horizontal gene exchange could have influenced diversification of each lineage. Measurable aggregation and behavioral cues in fluorescence micrographs of Entamoeba varieties suggest that these characteristics should be included in phylogenetic studies...|$|R
5000|$|Some lizards use tactile {{communication}}. The term tactile means touch, and lizards {{that use}} tactile communication either use {{direct or indirect}} [...] "touch" [...] {{as a form of}} communication. Some species come into direct contact with one another, such as nudging, licking, biting, or bumping another lizard. This type of direct contact may be associated with courtship (i.e., attracting a mate), or with aggression—in many lizards, fights can escalate to direct physical contact, such as biting and bumping into one another. Species that engage in these physical conflicts often rely on other forms of communication (such as visual or chemical), and resort only to physical contact when other methods of deterring potential rivals have failed. In the case of courtship, some lizards such as the male Komodo dragon, <b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis,</b> lick females to determine whether they are sexually receptive. While this is direct touch, it also incorporates chemical communication, as the male is detecting different chemicals present on the female's body in addition to directly touching her.|$|R
40|$|While {{working on}} the {{research}} and design phase of a naturalistic Asian rainforest exhibit for the California Science Center’s World of Ecology exhibit, we had the unique opportunity to research and develop innovative habitat components intended to showcase naturalistic behaviors. In many cases, the cost of designing and constructing truly naturalistic enrichment devices may not be worthwhile, particularly when it is uncertain how target taxa may respond. We were tasked {{with the challenge of}} designing, constructing, testing, and assessing naturalistic enrichment prototypes for siamangs (Hylobates syndactylus), babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), crocodile monitors (Varanus salvadorii), and Komodo dragons (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis).</b> Design objectives included: 1) striking a balance between ensuring sound husbandry while maintaining the natural appearance of the exhibit; 2) providing animals the opportunity and motivation to express species-typical behaviors; and 3) exploring enrichment options {{within the context of the}} natural exhibit design. Data were collected by observing animals that were well habituated to their enclosures. Analysis of the data provided valuable design insight and suggested that modifications range from none to some changes necessary to fully achieve design objectives...|$|R
40|$|Thermoregulatory {{processes}} {{were compared}} among three-size groups of free-ranging Komodo dragons (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> comprising small (5 – 20 [*]kg), medium (20 – 40 [*]gm) and large (40 – 70 [*]kg) lizards. While all size groups maintained a similar preferred body temperature of ≈ 35 ∘C, they achieved this end point differently. Small dragons appeared {{to engage in}} sun shuttling behavior more vigorously than large dragons as represented by their greater frequency of daily ambient temperature and light intensity changes {{as well as a}} greater activity and overall exposure to the sun. Large dragons were more sedentary and sun shuttled less. Further, they appear to rely to a greater extent on microhabitat selection and employed mouth gaping evaporative cooling to maintain their preferred operational temperature and prevent overheating. A potential ecological consequence of size-specific thermoregulatory habits for dragons is separation of foraging areas. In part, differences in thermoregulation could contribute to inducing shifts in predatory strategies from active foraging in small dragons to more sedentary sit-and-wait ambush predators in adults...|$|R
5000|$|Dakotaraptor steini is the {{smallest}} playable carnivore planned for Saurian. Although solitary, Dakotaraptor will form unorganized [...] "mobs" [...] {{in order to take}} down larger prey. Primarily, however, Dakotaraptor will focus on smaller prey. Lacking stamina, it instead relies on ambush tactics, which let it quickly overtake and restrain prey. Dakotaraptor will make use of Raptor Prey Restraint (RPR) in order to restrain its food, using its [...] "killing claw" [...] and body weight to pin its meal down while using the mouth to dispatch it. Dakotaraptor will be cannibalistic, with very limited parental care given to offspring. Young juveniles will be able to climb trees and glide in order to escape from predators, including older Dakotaraptors. The behavior of Dakotaraptor is heavily inspired by that of Komodo dragons (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> as well as the Deinonychus fossil site, in which several specimens were preserved along a Tenontosaurus. The original fossil bed which Dakotaraptor was found in 2005, namely Bone Butte, Harding County, South Dakota, will serve as the map where gameplay in Saurian will take place.|$|R
40|$|The Komodo dragon (<b>Varanus</b> <b>komodoensis)</b> {{displays}} a unique hold and pull-feeding technique. Its delicate ‘space-frame’ skull morphology differs greatly from that apparent in most living large prey specialists and is suggestive {{of a high}} degree of optimization, wherein use of materials is minimized. Here, using high-resolution finite element modelling based on dissection and in vivo bite and pull data, we present results detailing the mechanical performance of the giant lizard's skull. Unlike most modern predators, V. komodoensis applies minimal input from the jaw muscles when butchering prey. Instead it uses series of actions controlled by postcranial muscles. A particularly interesting feature of the performance of the skull is that it reveals considerably lower overall stress when these additional extrinsic forces are added to those of the jaw adductors. This remarkable reduction in stress in response to additional force is facilitated by both internal and external bone anatomy. Functional correlations obtained from these analyses also provide a solid basis for the interpretation of feeding ecology in extinct species, including dinosaurs and sabre-tooth cats, with which V. komodoensis shares various cranial and dental characteristics...|$|R
