Anomalous secondary circulations were formed in which air currents ascended in regions south to 25 °N and descended in 25 °– 40 °N. Because of the anomalous <b>vertical</b> meridional atmospheric <b>circulations</b> reinforced as such in high EASMI years, positive relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in regions south to 30 °N, while negative relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in 30 °– 45 °N.

40|$|The use of ageostrophic flow {{to infer}} the {{presence}} of <b>vertical</b> <b>circulations</b> in the entrances and exits of the climatological jet streams is questioned. Problems of interpretation arise because {{of the use of}} different definitions of geostrophy in theoretical studies and in analyses of atmospheric data. The nature and role of the ageostrophic flow based on constant and variable Coriolis parameter definitions of geostrophy vary. In the latter the geostrophic divergence cannot be neglected, so the vertical motion is not associated solely with the ageostrophic flow. Evidence is presented suggesting that ageostrophic flow in the climatological jet streams is primarily determined by the kinematic requirements of wave retrogression rather than by a forcing process. These requirements are largely met by the rotational flow, with the divergent circulations present being geostrophically forced, and so playing a secondary, restoring role...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The lack of {{accurate}} moisture/cloud initial {{conditions is}} one of the major causes for the spinup problem in explicit cloud and precipitation forecasting models during the first a few hours. Although many studies have sought a remedy by using satellite or/and radar data, the lack of detailed information on initial moisture, cloud water and latent heating fields is still a key problem. NEXRAD data can provide the three-dimensional precipitation field with high spatial and temporal resolution, though in a model, other conventional variables (i. e., water vapor, temperature and wind) may not be consistent with the cloud and precipitation analysis fields. Thus, evaporation processes may quickly kill convective storms present at the start of the model forecast. To address this problem, a diabatic initialization scheme has been improved to provide a latent heat forcing in the model thermodynamic equation and to force <b>vertical</b> <b>circulations</b> and the associated divergence that is c...|$|R

In addition, the relationship between latent heat release and the baroclinic energy conversion is examined for the life cycles of two cyclones which propagated along the South Pacific Convection Zone in that period. It is shown that latent heat {{plays an important role in}} the baroclinic energy conversion between potential and kinetic energy through diabatically-induced <b>vertical</b> <b>circulations.</b> For a cyclone where latent heat stays at a high level both spacially and with regard to intensity, there appears to be ample fuel for its intensification. On the other hand, for a filling cyclone, the latent heat impact decreased and the baroclinic conversion fell off rapidly, due to the lack of both potential energy generation and diabatically-induced thermally-direct circulations...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of the structure of a warm frontal region as deduced from Doppler radar observations. The precipitation occurring ahead of the surface warm front was banded. The dominant precipitation bands were oriented transverse to the mid-level winds, and they were spaced 110 km apart. It is suggested that these bands were formed by highly organized <b>vertical</b> <b>circulations</b> in a 2. 5 km thick layer just above the warm frontal zone. The precipitation bands extended from this layer down to the surface. Near the surface additional circulations were produced by pressure perturbations resulting from cooling associated with melting snow. Some diagnostic calculations of ageostrophic winds, frontogenesis and vorticity production are presented. The frontogenesis calculation gives approximately a 2 - 4 h doubling time of the horizontal potential temperature gradient associated with the warm front, at mid-levels.

40|$|A {{census of}} 24 coupled (CMIP) and 13 {{uncoupled}} (AMIP) models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth assessment report (AR 4) {{were compared with}} observations and reanalysis to show varied ability of the models to simulate Caribbean precipitation and mechanisms related to precipitation in the region. Not only were errors seen in the annual mean, with CMIP models underestimating both rainfall and sea surface temperature (SST) and AMIP models overestimating rainfall, the annual cycle was also incorrect. Large overestimates of precipitation at all SSTs (and particularly above 28 degrees C) and at <b>vertical</b> <b>circulations</b> less than - 10 hPa/day (the deep convective regime) were inherent in the atmospheric models with models using spectral type convective parameterizations performing best. In coupled models, however, errors {{in the frequency of}} occurrence of SSTs (the distribution is cold biased) and deep convective <b>vertical</b> <b>circulations</b> (reduced frequency) lead to an underestimation of Caribbean mean precipitation. On daily timescales, the models were shown to produce too frequent light rainfall amounts (especially less than 1 mm/day) and dry extremes and too few heavy rainfall amounts and wet extremes. The simulation of the mid-summer drought (MSD) proved a challenge for the models, despite their ability to produce a Caribbean low-level jet (CLLJ) in the correct location. Errors in the CLLJ, such as too strong magnitude and weak semi-annual cycle, were worse in the CMIP models and were attributed to problems with the location and seasonal evolution of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH) in both CMIP and AMIP models. Despite these discrepancies between models and observations, the ability of the models to simulate the correlation between the CLLJ and precipitation varied based on season and region, with the connection with United States precipitation particularly problematic in the AMIP simulations. An observational study of intraseasonal precipitation in the Caribbean showed an explicit connection between the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and Caribbean precipitation for the first time. Precipitation anomalies up to 50 percent above (below) the annual mean are observed in phases 1 and 2 (5 and 6) of the MJO and are related to changes in the CLLJ, that is also modulated by the MJO. Considerable progress has been made on identifying both problems and successes in the simulation of Caribbean climate in general circulation models, but many areas still require investigation...|$|R
