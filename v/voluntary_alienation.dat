These rights are not subject to <b>voluntary</b> <b>alienation.</b> And there are rights that adhere to specific characteristics of resources and are subject to alienation. These are rights in property. However, there has been a system-atic tendency to promote property rights {{at the expense of the}} rights of person and, in so doing, confound the analysis of the commons, of common property, and of private prop-erty. Given a delineation of fundamental concepts, this paper examines critically the foundational works of Demsetz and Coase and shows that their theoretical arguments depend on an implicit denial of all rights of person. It is shown, however, that rights of person are not properly analyzable by the standards that apply to rights in property and that the optimal policy to pursue in contemporary society is to determine a desired con-figuration rights and responsibilities in combination with rights in property...|$|E
