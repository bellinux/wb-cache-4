40|$|Abstract: This paper compares {{business}} registers and {{distributive trade}} statistics between the EU and other selected countries. It shows the various {{differences in the}} methodologies. The comparative study is carried out in three parts. The first part is general business registers, focusing on data sources, <b>statistical</b> <b>units,</b> and classification. It shows each country uses both administrative and statistical data, or statistical data to create and maintain them. The second part consists of structural surveys on distributive trade, focusing on <b>statistical</b> <b>units,</b> coverage, classification, and variables. The main differences are <b>statistical</b> <b>units.</b> The basic <b>statistical</b> <b>unit</b> is broadly divided into the enterprise and the establishment. The third part is estimation of distributive trade value added in national accounts. Each country adopts different methods to compile the data.

5000|$|Average prices represent, quite simply, {{total sales}} revenue divided by total units sold. Many products, however, {{are sold in}} {{multiple}} variants, such as bottle sizes. In these cases, managers face a challenge: they must determine 'comparable' units. Average prices can be calculated by weighting different unit selling prices by the percentage of unit sales (mix) for each product variant. If we use a standard, rather than an actual mix of sizes and product varieties, the result is price per <b>statistical</b> <b>unit.</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>units</b> are also known as equivalent units. Average price per unit and prices per <b>statistical</b> <b>unit</b> are needed by marketers who sell the same product in different packages, sizes, forms, or configurations {{at a variety of}} different prices. As in analyses of different channels, these product and price variations must be reflected accurately in overall average prices. If they are not, marketers may lose sight of what is happening to prices and why. If the price of each product variant remained unchanged, for example, but there was a shift in the mix of volume sold, then the average price per unit would change, but the price per <b>statistical</b> <b>unit</b> would not. Both of these metrics have value in identifying market movements. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 51 percent responded that they found the [...] "average price per unit" [...] metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses, while only 16% found [...] "price per statistical unit" [...] very useful.|$|R
