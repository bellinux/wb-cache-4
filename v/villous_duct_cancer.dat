40|$|Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy {{has become}} a {{standard}} operation for distal and middle bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancers.</b> Bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> typically extends longitudinally and invades vertically. It frequently metastasizes to the lymph nodes and infiltrates the perineural spaces. The presence of residual cancer in the bile duct stump and lymph node metastases are significant prognostic factors. Negative surgical margins and D 2 lymph node dissection are necessary for curative resection. The clinical course after portal vein resection for bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> with portal vein invasion is better than that of non-resectable bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Portal vein resection can therefore be useful. The efficacy of prophylactic portal vein resection is unclear. We describe here our methods for performing pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy for bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancers</b> are {{frequently}} diagnosed as advanced diseases.

Background: A report of multiple cases of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> at a Japanese printing company raised concern about such cancers. We examined long-term trends in bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> in Japan. Methods: Data from 4 population-based cancer registries were used to calculate incidence between 1985 and 2007, and vital statistics were used to estimate mortality between 1985 and 2011. Age-standardized rates were calculated and analyzed using a joinpoint regression model. Results: Among men, the incidence rate of intrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> increased throughout the observation period; among women, it increased until 1996 – 1998 and remained stable thereafter. The incidence rate of extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> was stable in men and decreased from 1993 – 1995 in women. In people aged 30 to 49 years, the incidence rates of intra- and extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> remained stable or decreased. The mortality rate of intrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> increased in both sexes and in all age groups since 1996, while that of extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> decreased since 1992. In people aged 30 to 49 years, the mortality rates of intra- and extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> remained stable and decreased, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Since extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{difficult}} to diagnose and to cure, a safe and radical surgical strategy is needed. In this review, the modes of infiltration and spread of extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> and surgical strategy are discussed. Extended hemihepatectomy, with or without pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), plus extrahepatic bile duct resection and regional lymphadenectomy has recently been recognized as the standard curative treatment for hilar bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> On the other hand, PD is the choice of treatment for middle and distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Major hepatectomy concomitant with PD (hepatopancreatoduodenectomy) {{has been applied to}} selected patients with widespread tumors.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the fluids bathing tumors might contain {{a higher level of}} the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) than those found in the blood. Therefore, we {{evaluated}} the role of bile CEA in diagnosing bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> One hundred and thirty two patients were prospectively studied. The patients were divided into 3 groups: the bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> (n= 32), pancreatic cancer (n= 16), and benign biliary diseases (n= 84) groups. Bile samples were obtained on the next day of the biliary drainage procedures. The mean bile CEA level in those with bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> (120. 6 +/- 156. 9 ng/mL) was significantly higher than those with pancreatic cancer and benign biliary diseases (32. 0 +/- 28. 5 ng/mL, 29. 3 +/- 56. 3 ng/mL). Using the level of 20 ng/mL, the sensitivity and specificity of bile CEA in the diagnosis of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> from benign biliary diseases were 65. 6 % and 66. 7 %, respectively. Both the bile CEA and total bilirubin level were found to be an independent factor linked to bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> This study result suggests that bile CEA level is a useful supplementary test for diagnosing bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Prognostic {{factors for}} distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> are contentious. This study was {{conducted}} to analyze the prognostic factors of distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> after surgery with the aim of identifying those associated with diminished survival. Methods: Two hundred forty-one patients who underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) or Whipple procedure in our tertiary hospital from February 1995 to June 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were pathologically proven to have distal bile duct adenocarcinoma. Postoperative complications, survival, and well-known prognostic factors after resection for distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> were investigated. Results: Preoperative elevated carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9) level (P = 0. 006), positive resection margin (P < 0. 001), advanced T stage (P = 0. 043), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0. 002) were significantly independent worse prognostic indicators by multivariate analysis of resectable distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Conclusion: R 0 resection is the most important so that frozen sections should be utilized aggressively during each operation. For the distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> with elevated preoperative CA 19 - 9 level or advanced stage, further study on postoperative adjuvant treatment may be warranted...|$|R

40|$|Salvage {{surgery for}} {{recurrent}} bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> is generally impractical due to local invasion of surrounding major vascular structures or distant metastases. We describe {{a case of}} a relapsed tumor in the right hepatic duct 3 years after pancreatoduodenectomy for middle to distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> The recurrent tumor, measuring 25 · 12 · 12 mm, was mostly confined within the right hepatic duct. It displayed an intraductal superficial extension rather than transmural invasive growth to thehepatic hilum. Anextended right hemihepatectomywas successfully performedwith a histologically negative margin. The patient is currently doing well without any signs of local recurrence or distantmetastasis 8 months after the secondoperation. Precise pathological exam-ination revealed that the lesion had originated frommulticentric foci in the right hepatic duct, not as a result of anastomotic recurrence. These results raised the consideration of a potentially more indolent subgroup of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> This is a detailed report of a successfully resected recurrent bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer,</b> for which the patient underwentmajor hepatectomy as a salvage procedure after pancreatoduodenectomy for the primary tumor.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to {{describe}} recent advances and topics in the surgical management of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Radical resection with a microscopically negative margin (R 0) {{is the only way}} to cure cholangiocarcinoma and is associated with marked survival advantages compared to margin-positive resections. Complete resection of the tumor is the surgeon’s ultimate aim, and several advances in the surgical treatment for bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> have been made within the last two decades. Multidetector row computed tomography has emerged as an indispensable diagnostic modality for the precise preoperative evaluation of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer,</b> in terms of both longitudinal and vertical tumor invasion. Many meticulous operative procedures have been established, especially extended hepatectomy for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, to achieve a negative resection margin, which is the only prognostic factor under the control of the surgeon. A complete caudate lobectomy and resection of the inferior part of Couinaud’s segment IV coupled with right or left hemihepatectomy has become the standard surgical procedure for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, and pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy is the first choice for distal bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Limited resection for middle bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> is indicated for only strictly selected cases. Preoperative treatments including biliary drainage and portal vein embolization are also indicated for only selected patients, especially jaundiced patients anticipating major hepatectomy. Liver transplantation seems ideal for complete resection of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer,</b> but the high recurrence rate and decreased patient survival after liver transplant preclude it from being considered standard treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have a potentially crucial role in prolonging survival and controlling local recurrence, but no definite regimen has been established to date. Further evidence is needed to fully define the role of liver transplantation and adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to analyze the actual long-term outcome after the surgical resection of extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> and to identify the characteristics shared by long-term survivors (5 years or longer). Summary Background Data: Although reported 5 -year survival rates of extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> lie between 20 % and 30 %, these data are not reflecting the actual cure rate. Some patients survive longer than 5 years with recurrent disease. In some patients, recurrence is detected after 5 years. Accordingly, true cure rate is probably substantially lower than the 5 -year survival rate. Methods: One hundred fifty-one patients from a total of 282 patients with extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> (excluding ampulla of Vater cancer) underwent surgical resection between 1986 and 1997. We analyzed the actual survival outcome and postresection prog-nostic factors after resection, which included hepatobiliary resectio...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, {{mortality}} from primary liver cancer has increased in the UK. We aimed {{to determine whether the}} incidence trends for these cancers were similar and in particular if the increasing occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma has continued. We calculated directly age-standardised incidence rates (using the European standard population) by subsite and histological type for all cancers of the liver, gallbladder and biliary tract in England and Wales from 1971 to 2001, using cancer registry data. The incidence of cancers of the liver, gallbladder and biliary tract increased, with the greatest rise, around 12 -fold, in intrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancers.</b> The rate of liver cell cancer increased by around 45 % in males, but by < 10 % in females. There were marked reductions in the incidence of gallbladder and extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Cholangiocarcinoma increased around 16 -fold and became {{the most common type of}} primary liver cancer in females, while hepatocellular carcinoma remained the commonest type in males. The age-specific incidence rates showed that intrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> continued to increase throughout the 1990 s in those aged 75 and over, while liver cell cancer decreased in the older age groups. In conclusion, there were increases in the incidence of primary liver cancer, which have been particularly dramatic for intrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer,</b> over the last three decades of the 20 th century in England and Wales. There has been a halving in the incidence of gallbladder cancer and a reduction of a third in extrahepatic bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Tumor {{thrombus}} in {{the portal}} vein {{is a common}} complication of hepatocellular carcinoma, but an extremely rare complication of common bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer.</b> Case presentation A 78 -year-old woman was referred to our department because of jaundice. Laboratory data showed severe liver dysfunction with high serum levels of total bilirubin and CA 19 - 9. Computed tomography showed lesions in the middle bile duct and main portal vein. FDG PET scan and 3 D imaging showed hot spots in the same location as those revealed by CT. Under a diagnosis of middle bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> with portal vein tumor thrombus, the patient underwent surgery. At laparotomy, the main tumor {{was found to be}} located in the middle bile duct with a tumor thrombus, 2 cm in diameter, in the main portal vein. The patient underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with thrombectomy. Histological examination showed that this thrombus had the same histological features as those of the main bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma). The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient is doing well without any signs of recurrence 18 months after surgery. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful resection of middle bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> with portal vein tumor thrombus. </p...|$|R
40|$|Opisthorchis viverrini is {{considered}} {{among the most important}} of the food-borne trematodes due to its strong association with advanced periductal fibrosis and bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> (cholangiocarcinoma). We investigated the relationship between plasma levels of Interleukin (IL) - 6 and the risk of developing advanced fibrosis and bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> from chronic Opisthorchis infection. We show that IL- 6 circulates in plasma at concentrations 58 times higher in individuals with advanced fibrosis than age, sex, and nearest-neighbor matched controls and 221 times higher in individuals with bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> than controls. We also observed a dose-response relationship between increasing levels of plasma IL- 6 and increasing risk of advanced fibrosis and bile duct cancer; for example, in age and sex adjusted analyses, individuals with the highest quartiles of plasma IL- 6 had a 19 times greater risk of developing advanced periductal fibrosis and a 150 times greater risk of developing of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> than individuals with no detectable level of plasma IL- 6. Finally, we show that a single plasma IL- 6 measurement has excellent positive predictive value for the detection of both advanced bile duct fibrosis and bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> in regions with high O. viverrini transmission. These data support our hypothesis that common mechanisms drive bile duct fibrosis and bile duct tumorogenesis from chronic O. viverrini infection. Our study also adds a unique aspect to the literature on circulating levels of IL- 6 as an immune marker of hepatobiliary pathology by showing that high levels of circulating IL- 6 in plasma are not related to infection with O. viverrini, but {{to the development of the}} advanced and often lethal pathologies resulting from chronic O. viverrini infection...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen {{patients}} with bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> (excluding gallbladder) and associated chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) were {{seen at the}} Mayo Clinic from 1935 through 1973. Most patients had initial symptoms of severe diarrhea and bleeding, followed by a pattern of mild-to-moderate disease with exacerbations and remissions. Three patients had especially severe symptoms and underwent total colectomy (1 patient) or proctocolectomy (2 patients) an average of 15. 7 years from onset of CUC symptoms. Anorexia, followed rapidly {{by the development of}} progressive jaundice (or a sudden deterioration when liver disease was already present), marked the onset of symptoms of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> in the 13 patients. The overall mean duration from onset of CUC to development of symptoms of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> was 19 years. The patients in whom colitis was managed by proctocolectomy or total abdominal colectomy developed symptoms of bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> an average of 9. 4 years after colectomy. When cancer was diagnosed, the tumor had spread beyond the bile ducts in 10 patients. The tumors were difficult to identify and often infiltrated the hepatic hilus. The present series and review of the literature suggest that the relationship between CUC and bile <b>duct</b> <b>cancer</b> is more than a chance occurrence. The carcinoma has an onset approximately 3 decades earlier than does carcinoma of the bile ducts without CUC. Surgical removal of the diseased colon and mode of medical management of the unresected colon have no relationship to the subsequent development of carcinoma of the bile ducts; neither does the extent or severity of the colonic disease. The prognosis of carcinoma of the bile ducts unfortunately continues to be dismal...|$|R
