5|$|In the United States, <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{administered}} {{along with}} the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine. In the UK, IPV is combined with tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus {{in areas where}} it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the oral polio vaccine reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the most}} widely used vaccine worldwide, with more than 90% of all {{children}} being vaccinated. The immunity it induces decreases after about ten years. As tuberculosis is uncommon in most of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, BCG is administered to only those people at high risk. Part of the reasoning against the use of the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> that it makes the tuberculin skin test falsely positive, reducing the test's use in screening. A number of new vaccines are currently in development.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} measles <b>vaccines</b> <b>was</b> investigated in Niakhar, {{a rural area}} of Senegal under demographic surveillance in 1987 - 1990. Three measles <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> tested: a standard Schwarz, a high-titer Edmonston-Zagreb, and a high-titer Schwarz. The two high-titer <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> administered at 5 months of age and the standard Schwarz vaccine at 10 months. In addition to a formal randomized vaccine trial, data from national campaigns using the standard Schwarz <b>vaccine</b> <b>were</b> also analyzed. Clinical efficacy was estimated after controlling for exposure. In the randomized trial, the esti-mate of {{the efficacy of the}} standard Schwarz <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> 97. 2 % (95 % confidence interval (Cl) 91. 3 - 98. 1). In the 1986 - 1987 national campaign, the efficacy of the stand-ard Schwarz <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> lower: 92. 5 % (95 % Cl 88. 8 - 94. 6). In the randomized trial, the efficacy of the high-titer <b>vaccines</b> <b>was</b> lower than that of the standard <b>vaccine.</b> High-titer <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> not used in national campaigns. Other factors associated with <b>vaccine</b> efficacy <b>were</b> age at exposure, intensity of exposure, and age at vaccination. Controlling for the intensity of exposu re did not change the relative ranking of the efficacy of the three vaccination strategies. The theoretical efficacy of the standard measles vaccine for...|$|R
25|$|While most <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> created using inactivated or {{attenuated}} compounds from micro-organisms, synthetic <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> composed mainly or wholly {{of synthetic}} peptides, carbohydrates, or antigens.|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} {{application}} of his <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> conducted between 1936 and 1943 by Belgian missionaries in China. The <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> dangerous {{to produce and}} hard to make on a large scale. Over time, other <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> developed that were less dangerous and more economical to produce, including the Cox vaccine developed on egg yolk.|$|R
5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral rehydration solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville) {{and other}} Syndicate Elders watch as their black oil <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{administered}} to Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), which {{has yet to}} work. Later, The Well-Manicured Man meets with Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), who is being held captive aboard a Russian freighter. The Well-Manicured Man believes that the Russians possess a functional vaccine to the black oil, or else Krycek would not have infected the boy. With a working vaccine, resistance to the alien Colonists is possible.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective <b>vaccine</b> <b>is,</b> thus, highly improbable.|$|E
40|$|Unadsorbed, regular {{production}} pertussis <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> {{treated with}} polymyxin B sulphate at concentrations of 25, 50 and 100 microgram/ml. The toxic activity of treated and untreated <b>vaccines</b> <b>was</b> compared using both the limulus amoebocyte lysate {{test and the}} mouse-weight-gain test. Protective efficacy was also assessed by the mouse protection test. No discernible effect on either toxicity or efficacy of the pertussis <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> observed. When the <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> treated with 5000 microgram/ml of polymyxin, endotoxic activity assessed by the limulus lysate test appeared to be abolished...|$|R
5|$|Most viral <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> {{based on}} live {{attenuated}} viruses, while many bacterial <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> based on acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting {{cells of the}} innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1950, Jonas Salk {{had tested}} both live, {{attenuated}} polio vaccines and formaldehyde killed polio vaccines in monkeys and by 1952, began testing on humans. [...] The killed <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> {{found to be}} effective, with proper filtration of the biological culture. [...] A problem with this <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> to be adequately protected; a child had to get three Salk shots, properly spaced, and a recommended booster shot once a year, which was expensive. [...] This <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> the first polio vaccine to receive approval of the U.S. government, and was used until 1961 in America, when the Sabin <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> recommended to replace it.|$|R
5|$|The second inactivated polio {{virus vaccine}} was {{developed}} in 1952 by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh, and announced to the world on 12 April 1955. The Salk vaccine, or inactivated poliovirus <b>vaccine,</b> <b>is</b> based on poliovirus grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (vero cell line), which is chemically inactivated with formalin. After two doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (given by injection), 90 {{percent or more of}} individuals develop protective antibody to all three serotypes of poliovirus, and at least 99 percent are immune to poliovirus following three doses.|$|E
5|$|The <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} by Sanofi and {{goes by the}} brand name Dengvaxia. It {{is based on a}} weakened combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four dengue serotypes. Two studies of a vaccine found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases. This is less than wished for by some.|$|E
5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{purchase}} {{and distribution of}} <b>vaccines</b> <b>is</b> managed centrally, and recommended <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> provided for free by the NHS. In the UK, no laws require vaccination of schoolchildren.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vaccines</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} {{for a number of}} viral/bacterial agents, including IBR, PI3, BVD, BRSV, Pasteurella, and Haemophilus somnus. Many of these <b>vaccines</b> can <b>be</b> given simultaneously, because of their similar dosing schedule. For example, IBR, PI3, BVD, and BRSV <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> often sold in combination with each other.|$|R
50|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{trials for}} the blood-derived <b>vaccine</b> <b>were</b> performed on gay men, {{in accordance with}} their high-risk status. Later, Hilleman’s <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> falsely blamed for igniting the AIDS epidemic. (See Wolf Szmuness) But, although the purified blood vaccine seemed questionable, it was determined to have indeed been free of HIV. The purification process had destroyed all viruses—including HIV. The <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> approved in 1981.|$|R
5|$|Using an {{attenuated}} virus Dr. Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To {{cut out the}} lengthy time {{it would take to}} obtain informed consent from infected patients, Dr. Hextall inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and immediately visits her gravely ill father (Dan Flannery), who has been infected with MEV-1. The doctor does not contract MEV-1 and the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> declared a success.|$|E
5|$|A {{spacecraft}} crashes at Wiekamp Air Force base in West Virginia, and {{the surviving}} Rebel passenger is {{captured by the}} military. Mulder shows Scully more photos of the victims and, having found more implants in them, believes the implant in Scully {{may be able to}} answer all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them of the existence of the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
5|$|Frequent {{hand washing}} {{reduces the risk}} of viral spread. Wearing a {{surgical}} mask is also useful. Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk. The <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> usually effective against three or four types of influenza. It is usually well tolerated. A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy {{do not appear to be}} greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.|$|E
50|$|Almost {{all human}} cases of rabies were fatal until a <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} in 1885 by Louis Pasteur and Émile Roux. Their original <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> harvested from infected rabbits, {{from which the}} virus in the nerve tissue was weakened by allowing it to dry for five to ten days. Similar nerve tissue-derived <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> still used in some countries, as they are much cheaper than modern cell culture vaccines.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> safe. This {{includes}} {{their use}} in people with HIV/AIDS. An earlier <b>vaccine</b> that <b>is</b> no longer used was linked to intussusception, but the current versions are not clearly linked. Due to a potential risk they are not recommended in babies who have had intussusception. The <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> made from weakened rotavirus.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} safe. Pain and redness {{may occur}} {{at the site of}} injection. As of 2015, 15 different <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> available: some are based on recombinant DNA techniques, others weakened virus, and others inactivated virus.|$|R
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E
25|$|No <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> {{currently}} known. Experimentally inoculated pigs {{appear to}} develop a persistent immunity so a <b>vaccine</b> may <b>be</b> possible.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} in the U.S. to prevent meningococcal disease. Some of the vaccines cover serogroup B, while others cover A, C, W, and Y. A meningococcal polysaccharide <b>vaccine</b> (MPSV4) has <b>been</b> available since the 1970s {{and is the only}} meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. MPSV4 may be used in people 2-55 years old if the MCV4 <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> not available or contraindicated. Two meningococcal conjugate <b>vaccines</b> (MCV4) <b>are</b> licensed for use in the U.S. The first conjugate <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> licensed in 2005, the second in 2010. Conjugate <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> the preferred <b>vaccine</b> for people 2 through 55 years of age. It is indicated in those with impaired immunity, such as nephrotic syndrome or splenectomy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes information about who should receive meningococcal vaccine.|$|R
25|$|Two new <b>vaccines</b> <b>were</b> {{launched}} in 1992. These combined tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis (TDaP or DTaP) {{which could be}} given to adolescents and adults (as opposed to previously when the <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> only given to children).|$|R
25|$|A vaccine {{known as}} the EV71 <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} to prevent HFMD in China as of December 2015. No <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> currently available in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> {{administered}} at infancy. The baby {{is injected}} with the DTaP vaccine which is 3 inactive toxins in one injection. DTaP protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. This <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> safer than the previously used DTP.|$|E
25|$|A <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> in {{the process}} of being developed, but is not yet licensed. There is a fear that when a <b>vaccine</b> <b>is</b> licensed, {{financial}} constraints will make the vaccination an unrealistic factor for many countries that are suffering from high rates of melioidosis.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> {{given by}} {{hypodermic}} or intramuscular injection {{as they are}} not absorbed reliably through the gut. Live attenuated polio and some typhoid and cholera <b>vaccines</b> <b>are</b> given orally {{in order to produce}} immunity based in the bowel.|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} Weigl's <b>vaccine</b> <b>was</b> {{the only one}} in {{existence}} which could be employed in practical applications outside of controlled settings.
