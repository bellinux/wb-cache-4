5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP <b>violation</b> in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity <b>violation,</b> CP <b>violation</b> occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. Thesis ABSTRACT Mgr. Veronika Kristková, LL.

Analysis of the rights of the victims of serious <b>violations</b> necessary must be based {{on the rights of the}} victims of human rights <b>violations</b> in general, which serves as a baseline for the analysis of the rights of the victims of serious <b>violations.</b> Only in comparison with the general rights of the victims of human rights <b>violations</b> the specificities of the rights of the victims of serious <b>violations</b> stand up.

30|$|After that, {{the architects}} started {{to remove the}} {{remaining}} <b>violations</b> until 80 % were fixed.

However, these high-risk <b>violations</b> were documented and presented to the project managers. The project managers assured they will make plans to carefully remove these <b>violations</b> in the near future.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{replicate}} the distinction between errors, lapses and <b>violations,</b> and to identify aggressive <b>violations</b> from normal or highway code <b>violations.</b> Furthermore, the relationship of these behaviours with road traffic accidents was examined. A total number of 1126 Finnish drivers completed a questionnaire containing the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) with extended <b>violations</b> scale, and questions regarding background information, such as age, gender and mileage. Also, questions about previous accidents and fines were asked. Factor analysis showed that a four-factor structure seemed more appropriate than the earlier established three-factor structure. The four factors were errors, lapses, speeding <b>violations</b> and interpersonal <b>violations.</b> The two types of <b>violations</b> result from different motives, and seem to be associated with different kinds of affect. Both interpersonal and speeding <b>violations</b> were reported most by young males, which was consistent with earlier findings. Logistic regression analyses indicated that errors predicted active accident involvement after partialling out the effects of demographic variables, whereas interpersonal <b>violations</b> were positively related to involvement in passive accidents. This was presumably due to different reporting tendencies of respondents. Speeding tickets were predicted by speeding and interpersonal <b>violations</b> and lapses and penalties for speeding by both kinds of <b>violations</b> and errors. Penalties for speeding, parking and other offences were predicted by interpersonal <b>violations.</b> The implications of these results are discussed. (Author/publisher...|$|R
