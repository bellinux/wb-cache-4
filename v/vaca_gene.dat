40|$|Background :   Vaculating {{cytotoxic}} A (<b>vacA)</b> <b>gene</b> {{is one of}} {{the multiple}} Helicobacter pylori genotypes that produce a cytotoxin protein (VacA). This gene is a major cause of chronic peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the correlation between <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD). Methods :    This was a case control study of 130 patients, aged 16 - 64, with positive H. pylori in histological and Giemsa reports. The case and control groups included 65 PUD patients and 65 NUD patients, respectively. The presence of the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> genotypes was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on biopsy samples, taken by endoscopy. Results :    In the case group, gastric ulcer was detected in 41. 5 % (27) of the participants; of whom, 77. 8 % (21) were female; and duodenal ulcer was found in 58. 5 % (38) of the participants, of whom, 42. 1 % (16) were female. The control group (NUD) included 65 patients; of them, 45 % (29) were female and the average age was 36. 4 ± 10. 8 years (18 to 60).

40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) {{is known}} as the main {{pathogen}} which causes infection in human’s stomach. There are three strains of H. pylori, which are type I, intermediate, and type II strains of H. pylori. Strain type I has cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (vacA) while strain type II has only vacuolating cytotoxin gene A (vacA). The aim {{of this study is to}} determine whether the stool sample shows cagA gene and or <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> expression. The benefit of this study is to understand the strains of H. pylori in order to prevent misdiagnosis and recurrent infection. Method: This study was conducted by using descriptive purposeful sampling method upon patients in Endoscopy Department of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hepatology Gastroentero Dr. Soetomo starting from 20 October to 25 November 2015. Total patients in this study were ten patients each was selected by random sampling. The aim of this study is to determine whether the stool sample shows cagA gene and or <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> expression. The data was processed by observing results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays to look at the genes that were expressed by H. pylori. DNA was extracted from stool by using QIAamp (Qiagen) stool kit. Results: Results of the study showed only one patient was positive for <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> while cagA gene was found in none of those ten patients. DNA examinations with different concentrations and temperatures also showed similar results. One sample from the stool specimens showed positive for type II strain, indicating that it only had <b>vacA</b> <b>gene.</b> PCR examination through gastric biopsy has been known for its high specificity. Conclusion: In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination of extracted gene from patients’ faecal specimen, cagA gene expression which was type I strain of H. pylori was not found. Meanwhile, <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> expression was found to be positive in one patient which indicated type II strain of H. pylori. ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{strains of}} Helicobacter pylori {{are known to}} produce an {{extracellular}} cytotoxin that causes vacuolization in various mammalian cells. In this study, we found that concentrated culture supernatants from four Helicobacter strains isolated from patients infected with the bacterium, but having normal gastric mucosa, lacked cytotoxic activity. We also show that {{a higher percentage of}} strains isolated from patients with polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration of gastric mucosa are toxin positive (78 %) versus those isolated from patients lacking such infiltration (33 %). In addition to examining the relationship between pathology and cytotoxic activity, we used the previously published N-terminal sequence of the protein to clone and characterize vacA, the structural gene encoding the cytotoxin. Briefly, three oligonucleotides capable of encoding the first nine amino acids corresponding to the sense strand and four oligonucleotides corresponding to the noncoding strand of the last seven known amino acids of the cytotoxin protein were made. They were used in all 12 possible combinations in 12 different PCR reactions, with DNA from a cytotoxin-positive strain as template. In four combinations, the expected 69 -bp fragment was seen. The sequence of this 69 -bp fragment confirmed that it encoded the known N-terminal sequence of the cytotoxin. This gene is capable of encoding a 136 -kDa protein with a 33 -amino-acid signal peptide, whereas the purified cytotoxin is only 87 kDa, suggesting processing in the C-terminal region of the protein. A single copy of the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> encodes the cytotoxin in H. pylori. Consequently, the insertion of a kanamycin resistance marker in the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> produced an isogenic mutant lacking the cytotoxic activity. This mutant provides genetic evidence that vacA encodes the cytotoxin. Sequence analysis of the DNA adjacent to the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> demonstrated that this gene is next to a putative cysteinyl tRNA synthetase gene. From the sequence arrangement, we predict that there are no other genes transcribed together with vacA. We also show that five of seven cytotoxin-negative strains examined still carry the sequences encoding it whereas the other two have suffered a deletion of the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene.</b> We further show that in at least one cytotoxin-negative but vacA-positive strain (MO 19), there are variations in the length of the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> that could explain the cytotoxin-negative phenotype in this strain...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{damaging}} {{capacity of}} Helicobacter pylori is variable and depends, in part, on its genetic polymorphism. Aim: To study H pylori genes vacA, cagA and iceA {{and the relationship}} of these genotypes with the features of acute damage in chronic gastritis. Material and methods: Gastric endoscopic biopsies were obtained in 75 adults for pathological study and genetic typification of H pylori by specific PCR. Results: In only 64 cases, complete information was available. In 53 of these, there was H pylori infection demonstrated by PCR. Twenty one percent had infection by two or more H pylori strains, <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> had genotypes s 2 /m 2, s 1 /m 1 and s 1 /m 2 in 36, 25 and 8 % of cases respectively, cagA gene was present in 49 % of infected patients. iceA gene had genotypes iceA 1 ad iceA 2 in 15 and 60 % of patients respectively. The presence of cagA or alleles s 1 /m 1 and s 1 /m 2 of <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> was directly correlated with polymorphonuclear infiltration and the severity of epithelial damage.

40|$|The {{varieties}} of infections caused by Helicobacter pylori {{may be due}} to differences in bacterial genotypes and virulence factors as well as environmental and host-related factors. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of cagA and <b>vacA</b> <b>genes</b> among H. pylori-infected patients in Iran and analyze their relevance to the disease status between two clinical groups via a meta-analysis method. Different databases including PubMed, ISI, Scopus, SID, Magiran, Science Direct, and Medlib were investigated, and 23 relevant articles from the period between 2001 and 2012 were finally analyzed. The relevant data obtained from these papers were analyzed by a random-effects model. Data were analyzed using R software and STATA. The prevalence of cagA and <b>vacA</b> <b>genes</b> among H. pylori-infected patients was 70 % (95 % CI, 64 - 75) and 41 % (95 % CI, 24. 3 - 57. 7), respectively. The prevalence of duodenal ulcers, peptic ulcers, and gastritis among cagA+ individuals was 53 % (95 % CI, 20 - 86), 65 % (95 % CI, 34 - 97), and 71 % (95 % CI, 59 - 84), respectively. Odds ratio (OR) between cagA-positive compared with cagA-negative patients showed a 1. 89 (95 % CI, 1. 38 - 2. 57) risk of ulcers. In conclusion, the frequency of cagA gene among H. pylori strains is elevated in Iran {{and it seems to be}} more frequently associated with gastritis. Therefore, any information about cagA and vacA prevalence among different H. pylori-infected clinical groups in the country can help public health authorities to plan preventive policies to reduce the prevalence of diseases associated with H. pylori infection...|$|R

Helicobacter pylori cagA and vacA strains induce more inflammation, ulceration and oncogenesis. Here, {{for the first time}} we present data on H. pylori cagA and <b>vacA</b> <b>genes</b> and their association with gastro-duodenal disease in Ghana. A total of 159 patients with dyspepsia at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Accra, were investigated for H. pylori with urease-CLO, of which 113 (71. 1 %) were positive. Genomic DNA was extracted from antral biopsies using QIAGEN DNeasy kit. Detection of H. pylori <b>vacA</b> and cagA <b>genes</b> were determined by PCR as previously described. RESULTS: In total, 110 (69. 2 %) vacAs 1, 71 (44. 7 %) vacAm 1, 35 (22. 0 %) vacAm 2, 77 (48. 4 %) cagA-(hydrophilic region) and 109 (68. 6 %) cagA-(internal duplication region) were detected. In multivariate analysis, duodenal ulcer was more likely than other diagnoses to have detectable cagA-(hydrophilic region) (OR 3. 1 CI 1. 2 - 7. 9) or vacAs 1 m 1 (OR 6. 5 CI 1. 2 - 34. 0).

40|$|Background: Helicobacter pylori strains {{have two}} {{classical}} virulence gene, the cytotoxinassociated A (cagA) gene and the vacuolating cytotoxin A (<b>vacA)</b> <b>gene,</b> which {{are located in}} the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI). Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to H. pylori, especially, the CagA antigen may be a reliable marker for selection of dyspeptic patients for upper endoscopy. Methods: Serum sample of 129 dyspeptic patients with positive H. pylori, were tested for serum IgG Anti-CagA antibody by ELISA. The presence of the cagA and vacA genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on biopsy samples taken via endoscopy. Results: Positive serum IgG anti-CagA antibodies in patient with cagA+/vacA+ and cagA+/vacAgenotypes were 22 / 23 (95. 6 %) and 18 / 19 (94. 7 %), respectively. In addition, serum IgG anti-CagA antibodies in patients with cagA-/vacA+ and cagA-/vacA- genotypes were 22 / 47 (46. 8 %) and 33 / 40 (82. 5 %), respectively.

40|$|Cytotoxin-associated-gene A (CagA) of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a {{virulence}} {{factor that}} plays critical roles in H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation. In the present study, gastric biopsies {{were used for}} genotyping cagA and <b>vacA</b> <b>genes,</b> determining the autophagic activity, and the severity of gastric inflammation response. It was revealed that autophagy in gastric mucosal tissues infected with cagA+H. pylori strains was lower than the levels produced by cagA−H. pylori strains, accompanied with accumulation of SQSTM 1 and decreased LAMP 1 expression. In vitro, deletion mutant of cagA gene resulted in increased autophagic activity, and decreased expression of SQSTM 1 and cytokines, whereas over-expression of CagA down-regulated the starvation-induced autophagy, and induced more production of the cytokines. Moreover, {{the production of the}} cytokines was increased by inhibition of autophagy, but decreased by enhancement of autophagy. Deletion of CagA decreased the ability to activate Akt kinase at Ser- 473 site and increased autophagy. c-Met siRNA significantly affected CagA-mediated autophagy, and decreased the level of p-Akt, p-mTOR, and p-S 6.

Both s 1 m 1 and s 1 m 2 <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> combinations of Helicobacter pylori {{have been associated}} with the development of major gastroduodenal diseases. This study assessed whether H. pylori <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> arrangement changed over 15 years in a Southern Italy area. H. pylori-positive patients observed in January-June 1989 and January-June 2005 were selected. Histological specimens were retrieved to extract DNA for vacA arrangement characterization (mid-m and peptide signal-s regions) by using the polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-nine patients in the first period and 56 matched patients in the second period were evaluated. A correlation between s 1 presence and intestinal metaplasia at histology was found. Overall, the s 1 m 1 combination increased (P < 0. 01) and s 2 m 2 decreased (P < 0. 001) during the study period. In detail, s 1 m 1 (P < 0. 05) and s 1 m 2 (P < 0. 01) increased, and s 2 m 2 decreased (P < 0. 001) in dyspeptic patients, while only s 1 m 1 increased (P < 0. 01) in peptic ulcer patients. Finally, few cases of s 2 m 1 combination in both series were found. Our results show some unexpected aspects that require confirmation. In detail, the increased prevalence of potential more virulent H. pylori strains contrasts with peptic ulcer incidence reduction...|$|E
40|$|Geographical {{differences}} in the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori genes and their association with disease severity have been identified. This study analyzes the prevalences of the cagA gene and alleles of the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> in H. pylori-associated gastroduodenal diseases in isolates from Recife, PE, Brazil. Gastric biopsy of 61 H. pylori-positive patients were submitted to DNA extraction and gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction. Among the 61 patients, 21 suffered from duodenal ulcer (DU) and 40 from gastritis (GT). The prevalence of H. pylori strains harbouring the cagA gene was higher in the DU group (90. 5 %) than in the GT group (60 %) (p = 0. 02). The <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> was amplified in 56 out of 61 biopsies, of which 43 (76. 8 %) contained bacteria carrying the s 1 allele and 13 (23. 2 %) the s 2. However, the prevalence of the vacA s 1 genotying was the same in either DU or GT group. The majority of the s 1 -typed strains, 39 (90. 7 %) out of 43, were subtype s 1 b. In resume {{there was a strong}} association between the H. pylori cagA+ gene and DU. However, there were no differences between the DU and GT groups in relation to the vacA s 1 and s 2 alleles distribution, albeit the subtype s 1 b was predominat...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of Helicobacter pylori including strains with putatively virulent genotypes is high, whereas the H. pylori-associated disease burden is low, in Africa compared to developed countries. In this study, we investigated the {{prevalence of}} virulence-related H. pylori genotypes and their association with gastroduodenal diseases in The Gambia. Methods and Findings: DNA extracted from biopsies and H. pylori cultures from 169 subjects with abdominal pain, dyspepsia or other gastroduodenal diseases were tested by PCR for H. pylori. The H. pylori positive samples were further tested for the cagA oncogene and <b>vacA</b> toxin <b>gene.</b> One hundred and twenty one subjects (71. 6...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gastric {{infection}} with Helicobacter pylori {{is the major}} cause of chronic active gastritis and {{is associated with the}} pathogenesis of peptic ulcer and gastric carcinoma.

40|$|The {{bacterial}} pathogen Helicobacter pylori has co-evolved with humans and colonizes approximately 50 % {{of the human}} population, but only causes overt gastric disease in a subset of infected hosts. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenesis of H. pylori and the mechanisms it uses to promote persistent colonization of the gastric mucosa, {{with a focus on}} recent insights into the role of the virulence factors vacuolating cytotoxin (<b>VacA),</b> cytotoxin-associated <b>gene</b> A (CagA) and CagL. We also describe the immunobiology of H. pylori infection and highlight how this bacterium manipulates the innate and adaptive immune systems of the host to promote its own persistence...|$|R
40|$|According to {{controversial}} {{theories and}} results of studies, foods with animal origins {{play an important}} role in the transmission of H. pylori to human. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of vacA genotypes of H. pylori, isolated from milk and meat samples of cow, sheep, goat, camel, and buffalo. Eight hundred and twenty raw milk and meat samples were collected from various parts of Iran. Samples were cultured and those found positive for H. pylori were analyzed for the presence of various genotypes of <b>vacA</b> <b>gene.</b> Out of 420 milk and 400 meat samples, 92 (21. 90 %) and 105 (26. 25 %) were positive for H. pylori, respectively. The most commonly detected genotypes in the <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> were s 1 a (86. 80 %), m 1 a (79. 18 %), s 1 b (69. 54 %), and m 1 b (63. 45 %) and detected combined genotypes were mostly m 1 as 1 a (68. 52 %), m 1 as 1 b (60. 40 %), m 1 bs 1 b (55. 83 %), and m 1 bs 1 a (53. 29 %). High presence of bacteria in the milk and meat samples of sheep represents that sheep may be the natural host of H. pylori. High presence of H. pylori strains in milk and meat samples similar to vacA genotypes in human being suggests that milk and meat samples could be the sources of bacteria for human...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori VacA is a channel-forming toxin {{unrelated}} to other known bacterial toxins. Most H. pylori strains contain a <b>vacA</b> <b>gene,</b> {{but there is}} marked variation among strains in VacA toxin activity. This variation is attributable to strain-specific variations in VacA amino acid sequences, as well as variations in the levels of VacA transcription and secretion. In this review, we discuss epidemiologic studies showing an association between specific vacA allelic types and gastric cancer, as well as studies that have used animal models to investigate VacA activities relevant to gastric cancer. We also discuss the mechanisms by which VacA-induced cellular alterations {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of gastric cancer...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) cytotoxin and its {{heterogeneity}} amongst strains hasbeen {{closely linked}} to the varying infection-associated clinical outcomes. In order to determinethe decisive role of the vacuolating cytotoxin (<b>vacA)</b> <b>gene</b> mosaicism in its corresponding geneexpression and phenotype, we aimed to characterize vacA alleles of different H. pylori strainsin addition to the resulting protein and its vacuolating activity in epithelial cell culture. Materials and Methods: <b>vacA</b> <b>gene</b> polymorphism was determined for 80 H. pylori strainsisolated from dyspeptic patients, using multiplex gene-specific polymerase chain reaction(PCR). VacA protein was detected by immuno-blotting assay using a polyclonal anti-VacAantibody. In vitro cytotoxicity assay was conducted on HeLa cells in order to evaluate thevacuolating cytotoxin activity. Results: Genotyping revealed the following strain distribution: 26 (32. 5 %) s 1 m 1, 35 (43. 8 %) s 1 m 2, and 19 (23. 8 %) s 2 m 2 subtypes. Infection with s 1 m 1 type strain was significantlyassociated with gastric cancer as compared to non-ulcer dyspepsia (p= 0. 005) and peptic ulcer disease (p= 0. 008). A 95 -kDa immuno-reactive band that represented thevacuolating toxin was demonstrated in SDS-PAGE analysis of concentrated culture filtrate(CCF) of H. pylori strains. H. pylori CCFs induced HeLa cell vacuolation which correlatedwith the strain genotype; s 1 m 1 strains demonstrated higher levels of vacuolation as comparedto s 1 m 2 strains, whereas s 2 m 2 strains showed no detectable cytotoxic activity. Conclusion: The current study confirmed the relatively high cytotoxic activity of s 1 m 1 type H. pylori strains which infect the majority of patients suffering from gastric cancer andmay be partly responsible for the pathogenesis of this mortal disease...|$|E

40|$|Helicobacter pylori is {{associated}} with diverse pathologies of varying severity, such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulceration, MALT lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. This broad diversity of outcomes is explained, at least in part, by the heterogeneity of the H. pylori quasispecies. Mosaicism, illustrated by the vacuolating cytotoxin <b>gene</b> (<b>vacA)</b> and non-conserved <b>genes,</b> as those belonging to the cag pathogenicity island, {{take part in the}} genetic diversity of the microorganism. In addition, non-proteinaceous elements such as the lipopolysaccharide, contribute also to the heterogeneity of H. pylori. However, all clinical isolates are motile and display a strong urease activity. These common features are indispensable for the persistent colonization of the gastric mucosa. Both variable and conserved virulence factors are reviewed here, from the angle of genetics and molecular biology. The molecular analyses, culminating with the recent sequencing of the H. pylori genome, afford answers to but also new questions over the H. pylori challenge.
