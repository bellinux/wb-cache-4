I. INTRODUCTION The recent achievement of x 86 virtualization by advanced software techniques allows attaining virtualization of server and network functions at competitive performance-cost trade-offs with respect to legacy solutions. The increasing adoption of virtualization techniques has recently favored the emergence of useful switching functions at the hypervisor level, commonly referred to as <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging.</b> In the context of data center network (DCN) consolidations, for VMs colocated in the same virtualization server, <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> becomes very useful to offload inter-VM traffic from access and aggregation switches, at the expense of an additional computing load on the physical server. DCN consolidations typically chase traffic engineering (TE) and energy efficiency (EE) objectives, and both should be affected by <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging,</b> but it is not intuitive to assert whether <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> acts positively or negatively with respect to TE and EE that should also depend on the DCN topology and forwarding techniques. In this paper, we bring additional understanding about the impact of <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> on DCN consolidations. The literature on DCN consolidation problems is extensive. Often referred to as DCN optimization, VM placement or virtual network embedding, the various propositions at {{the state of the art}} often have a narrow scope, with a set of constraints so that it is not possible to jointly adopt E...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} server virtualization has recently favored three key technology advances in data-center networking: the emergence at the hypervisor software level of <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> functions between <b>virtual</b> machines {{and the physical}} network; the possibility to dynamically migrate virtual machines across virtualization servers in the data-center network (DCN); a more efficient exploitation of the large path diversity by means of multipath forwarding protocols. In this paper, we investigate {{the impact of these}} novel features in DCN optimization by providing a comprehensive mathematical formulation and a repeated matching heuristic for its resolution. We show, in particular, how <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> and multipath forwarding impact common DCN optimization goals, traffic engineering (TE) and energy efficiency (EE), and assess their utility in the various cases of four different DCN topologies. We show that <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> brings a high performance gain when TE is the primary goal and should be deactivated when EE becomes important. Moreover, we show that multipath forwarding can bring relevant gains only when EE is the primary goal and <b>virtual</b> <b>bridging</b> is not enabled...|$|R

30|$|The network state {{consistency}} {{issue is}} easily solved {{in a local}} cloud environment: in fact, since each VM is connected via a <b>virtual</b> <b>bridge</b> to the same physical LAN at both source and destination hosts, it will keep the same IP address and, when the execution is resumed at the destination, a gratuitous ARP packet is sufficient to make all switches and neighbors aware of the new VM location. More complex {{is the case of}} migrating a VM to a remote DC, because ongoing connections need to be rerouted. Indeed, when the relocated VM is hosted in a DC connected to a different IP network, or even within a different domain, some kind of IP mobility solution must be adopted, such as those based on the so-called identifier/locator split principle [25, 26]. Another possibility is {{to take advantage of the}} highly flexible, dynamic network reconfiguration capabilities of SDN, which allows to migrate an entire virtual network from one DC to another [27], and to smartly reroute external traffic after a VM has been migrated [28].|$|E

Intra-VM communication of network I/O intensive TCP message workload has a lower overhead compared to multiple threads when VMs are pinned to specific cores.

Proper planning for the patient education component will increase its effectiveness and lead to the building of a <b>virtual</b> <b>bridge</b> between the provider and the patient. A multidisciplinary team composed of experts dealing with the particular disease being addressed should conduct all patient education planning. This will ensure that all stakeholders are involved in planning from inception and are capable of designing interventions for implementation across the healthcare system. When patient {{education is}} incorporated into all points within the system where a patient might access services, it is more effective than a single intervention conducted by an education department. The first step in the planning process for the designated task force is the completion of a comprehensive needs assessment. Results from this assessment will identify the target population and direct the programme goals, objectives, design and evaluation. Consideration must be given at the planning phase to how the programme will be marketed throughout the healthcare system. Without patient participation, even the best designed programme cannot be effective in achieving results. All potential processes for patient enrolment must be explored and incentives will increase participation rates. The identification and repetition of key education principles with the assessment and reinforcement of learned behaviours are essential to increasing educational effectiveness with patients. This standard is easy to implement if the task force embraces a systems approach to programme development. Adopting basic, clearly written, patient education literature to use system-wide contributes to consistency of the message and minimises confusion for the patients. It allows everyone from the medical assistant in the office to the pharmacist to assess patient knowledge and compliance with a plan of action.

The article traces the history of the bridge and of the ethnically mixed populations living on the opposite sides of the Danube River that the bridge connects in order to suggest the complexity of the cross-border relationships in this particular corner of Europe. In more recent decades relationships between Hungarians and Slovaks have been influenced by national populist politics exercised {{on both sides of the}} Danube after the fall of communism in the late 1980 s. The consequence of such politics is a narrow understanding of “national” interests and “national” culture that prevents a more open, more cosmopolitan approach to the relationship among the ethnic groups living in the area. The longawaited and often delayed rebuilding of the Mária Valéria Bridge is symbolic of the shortcomings of the “national container” approach.
