5000|$|Jean Maritz (1680-1743), also Johan Maritz, was a Swiss inventor, born in Burgdorf, Canton of Bern, {{who moved}} to France, {{becoming}} [...] "Commissaire des Fontes" [...] at Strasbourg (Commissionner of the King's Foundry), and invented the <b>vertical</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> {{as well as the}} horizontal drilling machine for cannons in the 18th century.

5000|$|He {{trained as}} a {{shoemaker}} in Baťa’s Zlín factory, then as locksmith and later as engineer. He studied under prominent Czech sculptor Vincenc Makovský at Zlín’s Art School from 1939 where he became interested in industrial design. He graduated there in 1943. He continued to work at Zlín for Baťa creating body designs for <b>vertical</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machines.</b> In 1947 he founded an industrial design studio in the Zlín Technical College. From 1959 he taught at the Institute of Arts & Crafts in Prague. Kovář was also a sculptor. His industrial designs involved projects for scissor and tool handles, lever door handles, sewing machines, lathes, typewriters, film projectors, record players. His most well-known proposals are for the Tatra truck bodies for types T137 and T138 (1956-1958) and studies for the passenger car Tatra T603 (1954). His design for scissors handles in 1952 anticipated similar product designed products produced in the West, such as Olaf Backstrom's excellent scissors (1960), produced by Fiskars in 1967.|$|R
40|$|Individual {{component}} reliability {{can often be}} estimated from degradation signals. In this paper, we examine {{the utility of the}} wavelet transform in pre-processing degradation signals for on-line reliability estimation. Wavelet preprocessing facilitates examination of degradation signals in both the time- and frequency-domains, simultaneously. Neural networks are used for forecasting the degradation signals (or a transformation thereof) and estimating the likelihood that these signals would exceed a pre-determined critical plane representative of unit failure in the immediate future. This leads to an on-line estimate for individual unit reliability. The proposed method is applied for analyzing degradation signals collected from a <b>vertical</b> CNC <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> using drill-bits. The degradation signals, force and torque, were collected as the drillbits were destructively tested...|$|R
30|$|According to Nestmann et al. (2009) the {{construction}} phase {{was started in}} 2004 with the drilling of the vertical shaft (using an innovative <b>vertical</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> of the German industry partner Herrenknecht AG) for insertion of building material {{as well as for}} the plant’s future operation and maintenance. Subsequently the installation of the flood relief lines (leading the inflowing water during {{the construction}} phase), mining activities for widening the cavern in the area of the rock abutment as well as further preparing measures for the construction of the machinery platform were carried out.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} advances {{over the}} last two decades in sensing instrumenta-tion and information technology infrastructure, monitoring and diagnostics tech-nology has not yet found its place in health management of mainstream machinery and equipment. This is in spite of numerous studies reporting that the expected savings from widespread deployment of condition-based mainte-nance (CBM) technology would be in the tens of billions of dollars in many industrial sectors as well as in governmental agencies. It turns out that a prere-quisite to widespread deployment of CBM technology and practice in industry is cost efficient and effective diagnostics and prognostics. This paper presents a novel method for employing hidden Markov models (HMMs) for carrying out both diagnostic as well as prognostic activities for metal cutting tools. The methods employ HMMs for modelling sensor signals emanating from the machine (or features thereof), and in turn, identify the health state of the cutting tool as well as facilitate estimation of remaining useful life. This paper also investigates some of the underlying issues of proper HMM design and training for the express purpose of effective diagnostics and prognostics. The proposed methods were validated on a physical test-bed, a <b>vertical</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> Experimental results are very promising...|$|E

40|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} machine tools in industry except lathe and frais <b>machine.</b> <b>Drilling</b> <b>machine</b> has an important role on production proceses. But, vibration while drilling operation that caused by chatter or machine faults made the product output failure. One of the machine faults types is mass unbalance that can reduce the quality of product geometry. Therefore, dynamic behaviour analyze is necessary to prevent this mass unbalance will not happen. So, we did the dynamic behaviour analyze of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> used ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench. The aim of this research is to find out the natural frequency and the mode shape of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine,</b> could to display their mode shape deformation with damping caused by excitation forces 100 N, and could to display FRF and FFT graphics caused by mass unbalance. In order to achieve the aims, modal analysis method has been adopted.

The <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> were modeled in three configuration of head body position. Software ANSYS 11. 0 Workbench used to determine FRF. As the results, the different configuration of head body position has been influence the dynamic behaviour structure that can be signed with the different of natural frequency. More higher the natural frequency, more higher the stiffness and it’s allow the structure difficult to vibrate. From the FRF, we know that the increase operation rotation of <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> allow higher vibration velocity that caused by mass unbalance. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When the drilling operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lack of the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> maintain, the speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project. From the method, the speed of the motor will increase when the drilling operation is given a friction. There will be feedback for the error that the sensors detect from the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback will calculate the error and from the calculation the new increasing voltage will be determined. For the conclusion, the method is trying to find the new voltage for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the speed of the machine. From the fact, we know that when the voltage in increase, the speed will also increase. Thus, the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will become more efficient...|$|R
