60|$|Eric sailed {{on up the}} Thames to London, {{bringing}} the <b>viking</b> <b>ships</b> with him, and he delivered their captains bound to Edmund, Edward's son, the king who was called Edmund the Magnificent. These captains the King hung, for they had wrought damage to his ships.|$|R
50|$|Another {{inspiration}} {{came from}} Iceland, like a geyser; Uppspretta means source. The vikings, who are believed by the artists {{to be the}} first inhabitants of Iceland, appear in the form of Freyja, the goddess of love from the Norse mythology. There's also an image of a <b>viking</b> <b>ship.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tune <b>ship,</b> a <b>viking</b> <b>ship</b> {{dating from}} ca. 900 and now {{exhibited}} in the Viking Ship Museum in Bygdøy, Oslo was found in Rolvsøy in 1867. It was so named because it {{was found in a}} boat burial mound on Rolvsøy which was a part of Tune at that time.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{designed}} by architect Gustav August Munzer, who stated that the form {{was not meant to}} represent anything specific but was to inspire positive feelings in those who look at it. It is frequently associated with the stem of a <b>viking</b> <b>ship</b> or the conning tower of a submarine.|$|R
60|$|So Eric {{told her}} all his deeds, though he showed small boastfulness about them. He {{told her how}} he had smitten the war-dragons of Ospakar, how he had boarded the Raven and with Skallagrim slain those who sailed in her. He told her also of his deeds in Ireland, and of how he took the <b>viking</b> <b>ships</b> and came to London town.|$|R
50|$|It has rich {{resources}} for {{small and large}} game hunters, rivers and mountain lakes attracting sports fishermen from near and afar, and a nature reserve with the oldest living pine trees on record in Northern Europe. Among 1000-year-old living trees, trees still standing have been dated to 830 AD. It is assumed that this forest served as source of timber and tar for <b>viking</b> <b>ships,</b> and there are settlements and burial sites {{that have not yet}} been excavated.|$|R

The timeline {{in question is}} the year 793 {{to the middle of}} 11 th century. The main sourceof information are taken from the sources that have the runes and scaldic verses as their referecepoint. The study will take a brief look at the <b>viking</b> <b>ships</b> used in those battles and the weapons andarmor the soldiers would use.

6000|$|He tore up {{the several}} pages that {{repeated}} that oldest most melancholy {{cry of the}} lover, which rang among the deodars, from <b>viking</b> <b>ships,</b> from the moonlit courtyards of Provence, the cry which always sounded about Mr. Wrenn as he walked the deck: [...] "I want you so much; I miss you so unendingly; I am so lonely for you, dear." [...] For no more clearly, no more nobly did the golden Aucassin or lean Dante word that cry in their thoughts than did Mr. William Wrenn, Our Mr. Wrenn.|$|R
5000|$|The museum {{grew out}} of the archaeological {{investigation}} of sunken <b>viking</b> <b>ships</b> in Foteviken Bay and local interest in the Battle of Fotevik, which was fought there on 4 June 1134. A group headed by Björn M. Buttler Jakobsen formed a foundation called SVEG (Scandinavian Viking Explorer Group) in 1987. In 1993, the foundation started planning to open a maritime museum; in 1995, after changing their focus towards Viking Age living history, they opened Foteviken Museum, with Jakobsen as its director. At the [...] in Malmö, the group built two replica viking cogs; in 2014 the city sold these and the harbour site where they are located is now a medieval-themed tourist area called Medeltidsriket Malmöya.|$|R
50|$|Nordland is {{regarded}} as part of Sápmi. The Sami, which are not of Norse origins, have lived in Nordland for at least 2,000 years. Not just inland, but also along the fjords and, {{in the northern part}} of Nordland, even on the coast and larger islands, such as Hinnøya. There is a story in Heimskringla about a Viking which became a contender for the throne, Sigurd Slembe. He was on the run from the king, and was helped by Sami in what is probably Lødingen municipality today. The sami even built him a boat, which the saga mention was made from pine wood (<b>viking</b> <b>ships</b> were typically made from oak wood, but oak does not grow naturally this far north). Tysfjord today is a centre for the Lule Sami culture.|$|R
5000|$|The ship {{set sail}} from Reykjavík on Icelandic National Day, 17 June, with Marel skippering and {{a crew of}} 8 {{including}} one woman, Ellen Ingvadottir, who kept the weblog of the voyage. Her first port of call was Búðardalur in Hvammsfjörður, where she took part in celebrations at Eiríksstaðir, where Erik the Red lived and his son Leif was born. Despite a 10-hour ordeal with bad weather off Cape Farewell, she arrived on 15 July at Brattahlíð in Greenland for {{the celebration of the}} viking settlement attended by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. On 28 July she arrived at L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland, the single viking settlement to have been discovered in North America and thought to be the site of the Vinland settlement, where she participated in the celebrations with other replica <b>viking</b> <b>ships,</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{familiar}} confidence, {{these traits}} of engaging simplicity, are characters of a secluded people. Mankind—and, above all, islanders—come very swiftly to a bearing, and find very readily, upon one convention or another, a tolerable corporate life. The danger is to those from without, {{who have not}} grown up from childhood in the islands, but appear suddenly in that narrow horizon, life-sized apparitions. For these no bond of humanity exists, no feeling of kinship is awakened by their peril; they will assist at a shipwreck, like the fisher-folk of Lunga, as spectators, and when the fatal scene is over, and the beach strewn with dead bodies, they will fence their fields with mahogany, and, after a decent grace, sup claret to their porridge. It is not wickedness: it is scarce evil; it is only, in its highest power, the sense of isolation and the wise disinterestedness of feeble and poor races. Think how many <b>viking</b> <b>ships</b> had sailed by these islands in the past, how many vikings had landed, and raised turmoil, and broken up the barrows of the dead, and carried off the wines of the living; and blame them, if you are able, for that belief (which may be {{called one of the}} parables of the devil’s gospel) that a man rescued from the sea will prove the bane of his deliverer. It might be thought that my grandfather, coming there unknown, and upon an employment so hateful to the inhabitants, must have run the hazard of his life. But this were to misunderstand. He came franked by the laird and the clergyman; he was the King’s officer; the work was ‘opened with prayer by the Rev. Walter Trail, minister of the parish’; God and the King had decided it, and the people of these pious islands bowed their heads. There landed, indeed, in North Ronaldsay, during {{the last decade of the}} eighteenth century, a traveller whose life seems really to have been imperilled. A very little man of a swarthy complexion, he came ashore, exhausted and unshaved, from a long boat passage, and lay down to sleep in the home of the parish schoolmaster. But he had been seen landing. The inhabitants had identified him for a Pict, as, by some singular confusion of name, they called the dark and dwarfish aboriginal people of the land. Immediately the obscure ferment of a race-hatred, grown into a superstition, began to work in their bosoms, and they crowded about the house and the room-door with fearful whisperings. For some time the schoolmaster held them at bay, and at last despatched a messenger to call my grand-father. He came: he found the islanders beside themselves at this unwelcome resurrection of the dead and the detested; he was shown, as adminicular of testimony, the traveller’s uncouth and thick-soled boots; he argued, and finding argument unavailing, consented to enter the room and examine with his own eyes the sleeping Pict. One glance was sufficient: the man was now a missionary, but he had been before that an Edinburgh shopkeeper with whom my grandfather had dealt. He came forth again with this report, and the folk of the island, wholly relieved, dispersed to their own houses. They were timid as sheep and ignorant as limpets; that was all. But the Lord deliver us from the tender mercies of a frightened flock! ...|$|R
