40|$|In this article, I {{investigate}} {{the strength of}} intergenerational transmission of <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> non-profit associations in The Netherlands. Data from the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 2000 reveal that there are significant relations between current volunteering and parental volunteering in the past. While the transmission of <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> religious and quasi-religious (‘pillarized’) associations is due largely to the transmission of religion and social status from parents to their children, parental <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> pillarized associations has increased the likelihood of children’s <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> secular associations, even controlling for parental and children’s religion, education, wealth and personality characteristics. Consistent with a value internalization explanation, this spillover effect was not due to the direct social pressure of parents. ...|$|R

5|$|Born in {{a suburb}} of Newcastle, New South Wales, Jeffries was {{employed}} as a surveyor at a mining company where his father served as general manager following his completion of school.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low recruitment and retention rates across the RAN resulted {{in the number of}} trained submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of <b>volunteers</b> <b>for</b> submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent burnout. A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E

Lhermitte's instructions emphasised subtlety in the operation, but on 20 April he attacked the British port of Tellicherry and seized the East Indiaman merchant ships Woodcot and Raymond. This alerted the British to Preneuses mission and although the reinforcements were landed safely at Mangalore on 24 April, diplomatic relations between the British and Mysore collapsed, leading to the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War the following year in which Tipu Sultan was killed and his kingdom absorbed into British India.|$|E

5|$|The 2/18th Battalion {{was raised}} around Sydney, New South Wales, in June 1940, with its first {{subunits}} being formed on 13 July at Wallgrove Camp.

The battalion concentrated at Wallgrove on 15 July, and a cadre of commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) who were selected from the Militia—in many cases personally by Varley—was established, while the remainder of the battalion's NCOs were appointed from recruits following their arrival.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson Creek Watershed Council (JCWC) is {{a nonprofit}} group {{organized}} in 1995 to protect the creek and its watershed. Its projects involve such things as controlling invasive species, planting native riparian vegetation, improving fish passage, and creating off-channel flood storage. JCWC's fish passage barrier program focuses on removing or improving fish passage barriers such as culverts. The council is heavily dependent on <b>volunteers</b> <b>for</b> watershed riparian restoration activities such as planting native plants, and in their Community Science program, where volunteers collect data on wildlife in the watershed. In 2011 alone, {{more than a thousand}} volunteers donated 5,500 hours of their time to JCWC activities.|$|E

Joule's weapons are color-coded to inflict damage on a particular set of enemies and, like her companions, can also be enhanced. The corebots support her in battle and puzzle solving.|$|E
