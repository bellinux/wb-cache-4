5|$|Associated with jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal wind shear caused by jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the jet, next to and just under the axis of the jet. Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E

5|$|One E {{aircraft}} (AF Serial No. 56-0632) {{was modified}} as a testbed for various B-52 systems. Redesignated NB-52E, the aircraft was fitted with canards and a Load Alleviation and Mode Stabilization system (LAMS) which reduced airframe fatigue from wind gusts during low level flight. In one test, the aircraft flew 10knots (11.5mph, 18.5km/h) {{faster than the}} never exceed speed without damage because the canards eliminated 30% of <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> 50% of horizontal vibrations caused by wind gusts.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who {{was inspired by}} examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe.

Holden called them 'brick boxes with concrete lids'. Today, several of these Holden-designed stations are listed buildings, including the prototype Sudbury Town listed as Grade II*.|$|E

5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> individualism <b>and</b> collectivism as testable {{dimensions of}} cultural variation. Collectivism emphasizes {{the primacy of}} norms, duties, and obligations, whereas individualism favors maximum enjoyment for the individual, interpersonal contracts, and freedom fiom the collectivity. While the horizontal dimension stresses equality, the vertical dimension calls attention to hierarchy. While past research (Triandis, 1995, Triandis & Gelfand, 1998) has demonstrated the convergent and divergent validity of horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> individualism <b>and</b> collectivism, it is contended that the Triandis (1 995) measures of horizontal <b>and</b> <b>vertical</b> individualism <b>and</b> collectivism could provide predictive value by discriminating between attitudinal responses of adult members of the Democratic and Republican parties in Maine and Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties in New Brunswick.

5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the Renaissance, when they were built in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (<b>vertical)</b> <b>and</b> horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E
5|$|Following the event, a {{field survey}} was {{conducted}} along the fault zone {{with the goal of}} estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators. Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed, both in the valley and in the foothills, with both <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area. The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant, and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event, and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers. Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings.|$|E

5|$|For the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, {{which opened}} in 1991, Tange {{designed}} a large civic centre with a plaza dominated by two skyscrapers. These house the administration offices whilst a smaller seven-storey building contains assembly facilities. In his design of a high tech version of Kofu Communications Centre, Tange equipped all three buildings with state-of-the-art building management systems that monitored air quality, light levels and security. The external skin of the building makes dual references to both tradition and the modern condition. Tange incorporated <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal lines reminiscent of both timber boarding and the lines on semiconductor boards.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the images and local elements applied in design, {{the capacity of the}} buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of <b>vertical</b> <b>and</b> horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E
