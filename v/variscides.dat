40|$|New {{seamless}} onshore to offshore bedrock (1 : 10 k scale) {{mapping for}} the Lyme Bay area {{is used to}} resolve the westward termination of the Purbeck–Wight Fault Zone (PWFZ) structure, comprising {{one of the most}} prominent, long-lived (Variscan–Cimmerian–Alpine) structural lineaments in the southern UK. The study area lies south of the Variscan Frontal Thrust and overlays the basement <b>Variscide</b> Rhenohercynian Zone, in a region of dominant E-W tectonic fabric and a secondary conjugate NW-SE/NE-SW fabric. The PWFZ comprises one of the E-W major structures, with a typical history including Permian to early Cretaceous growth movement (relating to basement Variscan Thrust reactivation) followed by significant Alpine (Helvetic) inversion. Previous interpretations of the PWFZ have been limited by the low resolution (1 : 250 k scale) of the available offshore BGS mapping, and our study fills this gap. We describe a significant change in structural style of the fault zone from east to west. In the Weymouth Bay area, previous studies demonstrate the development of focussed strain associated with the PWFZ, accompanied by distributed strain, N-S fault development, and potential basement uplift in its hangingwall. In the Lyme Bay area to the west, faulting is dominantly E-W, with N-S faulting absent. Comparison of the newly mapped faulting networks to gravity data suggests a spatial relationship between this faulting variation and basement variability and uplift...|$|R
40|$|The Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ) is a {{broad and}} complex zone of terrane {{accretion}} separating ancient lithosphere of the Baltic Shield and East European Craton (EEC) from the younger lithosphere of western and southern Europe. There is debate {{about the number of}} terranes involved, and their origins. The most significant terrane boundaries, originally oceanic sutures, are poorly exposed, and are defined using faunal provinciality. Prominent geophysical lineaments may represent sub-terrane boundaries within composite terranes. The Avalonia Composite Terrane was amalgamated to Baltica in latest ician time. The provenance of the Malopolska and Moravo–Silesian terranes, whose Neoproterozoic basement is suspect with respect to Baltica, but with which they nonetheless share faunal affinities, is still debated. The extent of the <b>Variscide</b> Rhenohercynian Zone defines the southern limit of the early Palaeozoic-accreted terranes. Terranes within the Bohemian Massif exhibit HP metamorphism recording subduction-driven collision prior to incorporation in the TESZ collage, itself associated with a HP event. In Romania, the Saxothuringian Zone (and Rheic Suture) are directly juxtaposed with the EEC, and the crustal structure of the TESZ has been much modified by post-Palaeozoic tectonism. Deep seismic reflection data, where available, show that the oceanic sutures are frequently associated with inclined reflectivity zones (IRZ) in the lithospheric mantle, here inferred to mark relict subduction zones. Interpreting the age of subduction is complicated by offset of originally coplanar mantle and crustal segments of the IRZ, resulting from early orogenic lithospheric delamination at the Moho interface and/or post-orogenic ‘reordering’ processes. The mantle IRZ appear to indicate a N-directed polarity for early Palaeozoic subduction, apparently incompatible with the geological evidence, which indicates subduction of the Tornquist Sea beneath Avalonia, and a large amount of underthrusting of Avalonia by Baltica. Possible explanations for these apparently incompatible observations are evaluated...|$|R

The collision lasted nearly 90 million years in the late Carboniferous - early Triassic. Unlike the other major orogens of the Paleozoic (Appalachians, Caledonides, <b>Variscides),</b> the Urals have not undergone post-orogenic extensional collapse and are unusually well preserved for their age, being underlaid by a pronounced crustal root.

A distinction is made here between rock complexes, commonly referred to as [...] "slate belts" [...] (German: [...] ) made of unmetamorphosed or weakly metamorphosed rocks (slate, chert, sandstone, limestone, altered basalt, phyllite and quartzite) which are intruded only to a small extent by granitoids, and rock complexes commonly referred to as crystalline, comprising weakly to highly metamorphosed rocks (phyllite, quartzite, marble, amphibolite, serpentinite, schist, gneiss, granulite and eclogite) which are extensively intruded by granitoids. The slate belt rock units were folded at a shallow depth at relatively low temperatures, whereas the metamorphic crystalline areas sank much deeper during the Variscan Orogeny, and were subjected to high pressures and, in some places, very high temperatures which caused partial melting of the rocks. The geochemical signature of the Variscan granitoids suggests that their magma was produced by the partial melting of deeply-buried sedimentary rocks. Outcropping slate belts are found mainly in the Rhenish Massif, the Harz and the Thuringian-Franconian-Vogtland Slate Mountains.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} mineralogical, geochemical and geochronological {{studies in}} the <b>Variscides</b> and Uralides to elucidate the petrochemical history of dynamic orogenic processes. In combination with published data the results highlight significant differences between both orogens. Pre-orogenic (i. e. pre-Uralian) basement is incorporated to different degrees and in contrasting patterns in <b>Variscides</b> and Uralides. In the <b>Variscides</b> numerous different terranes were agglomerated in a complicated large scale bow-shaped pattern, whereas in the Uralides mainly the fragments of the longitudinally trending eastern margin of Baltica were incorporated. The Taratash Complex of the Middle Urals is an outstanding example of such fragments. This thesis delineates a succession of Palaeoproterozoic magmatic and amphibolite facies tectonometamorphic events (2. 46 – 1. 8 Ga) following Archean granulite facies metamorphism and granitoid formation (3. 65 – 2. 91 Ga) recorded in the rocks of the Taratash Complex. In the Uralides, pre-orogenic basement is restricted {{to the west of}} the Main Uralian Fault leading to a simple geometry compared to the <b>Variscides.</b> In both orogens, pre-Neoproterozoic rocks are only preserved in basement slivers, whereas remnants of Neoproterozoic magmatism and tectonism are abundant. For the southern Urals this is shown in a study of detrital zircon. Isotope signatures (U/Pb) of detrital zircon serve as geochemical indicator for the dynamic process of terrane accretion and for the transition from a passive to an active continental margin around 620 Ma, which affected large parts of the eastern margin of Baltica. The main suture lines and associated former subduction zones can well be traced in the <b>Variscides</b> (i. e. Rheic suture) and Uralides (i. e. Main Uralian Fault), although secondary suture lines in both orogens require further characterization for better understanding. Different to the <b>Variscides,</b> where high-pressure metamorphic rocks are known in all major terranes, such rocks are exclusively observed along the Main Uralian Fault in the Uralides. Lawsonite bearing mineral assemblages in rodingitized ultramafite of the Maksyutov Complex (Southern Urals) that are investigated in a part of this thesis are an example of such metamorphism related to the dynamic process of subduction. In contrast to the <b>Variscides,</b> which are characterized by large scale lithospheric reequilibration, the Uralides were not affected by significant orogenic collapse and postorogenic extension. This is also reflected in the preservation of prograde high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic assemblages in the Maksyutov Complex (e. g. Lawsonite-bearing assemblages) and associated low-temperature pseudomorphs presented in this thesis. The lack of postorogenic extension highlights that the Uralides are characterized by a pronounced and isostatically equilibrated crustal root. During the Variscan orogenesis existing continental crust was extensively recycled. In contrast to this, large amounts of juvenile crust, which formed in magmatic arcs, are a characteristic feature of the Uralian orogen. Here, data are presented for the Valerianovka arc in the Transuralian zone, which is rarely addressed in the literature. It is shown that granitoids formed by mixing of slab-derived melts and melts generated in the crust. This result supports the model of an Andean type setting. Juvenile crust is particularly dominating in the Easturalian zone, where granitoids also formed after accretion of magmatic arcs. In this thesis it is demonstrated that the Borisov granite intruded in a first pulse of melt generation at 358 ± 23 Ma. Granitoid melt formation as well as high-temperature amphibolite facies metamorphic overprint of host rocks also reflect the dynamic process of crustal thickening during the Uralian orogeny. <b>Variscides</b> and Uralides also vary with respect to their crustal architecture. Major crustal units of the Variscan orogen have a subhorizontal orientation, whereas crustal scale structural boundaries in the Uralides are high angle fault zones. Such structural differences are in line with the observation that the <b>Variscides</b> experienced significant crustal shortening, whereas the Uralides were affected by lower degrees of shortening. This can be demonstrated in a comparison of the Rhenohercynian (Variscan) and the Westuralian foreland fold and thrust belts. Expulsion of hydrothermal fluids to the Variscan foreland during the dynamic process of orogenic compaction is investigated in this thesis applying various techniques. Enrichment of mobile components, such as Ba and NH 4, in sedimentary rocks studied in the RWTH- 1 well in Aachen (Germany) serves as geochemical indicator for palaeo fluid-flow. Illite mineralogy, fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry as well as isotope geochemistry of fluid inclusions and vein minerals suggest that expulsion of metamorphic fluids at the Variscan front was a short termed (approx. 5000 y) process, which was affected by fracture opening during episodic seismic activity and which occurred at depths between 4500 and 8000 m and temperatures close to 400 °C.

40|$|Abstract: A clear {{correlation}} {{exists in}} the southern Irish <b>Variscides</b> between extensional structures which controlled late Palaeozoic sedimentation in the Munster Basin, and contractional thrusts and folds of end-Carboniferous age. This correlation is interpreted to indicate that he extensional structural framework of the basin, including a basal low-angle detachment {{and an array of}} superjacent normal faults, was reused during transpressive inversion of the basin to produce the fold-thrust belt. The extensional framework, which in turn was to some extent derived by reactivation of Caledonian structures, therefore, exerted a fundamental control on the geometry and style of contractional deformation. It is not evident that the detachment had a discrete link to the fold belt in south Wales or the main Variscan orogen in Europe. The <b>Variscides</b> of southern Ireland have been interpreted by Cooper et al. (1984, 1986) as the result of deformation above a northward-propagating dkollement over a largely passive basement. This thin-skinned model of linked faults contrasts with that proposed by Sanderson (1984) who believed the Irish <b>Variscides</b> to be the product of dextral transpression associated with faults that steepened down-wards into the lower crust. Sanderson’s model may {{be thought of as a}} thick-skinned one, because the basement is considered to have been actively involved during the deformation and the faults were typically unconnected.

40|$|Sudetic {{segment of}} the <b>Variscides,</b> {{together}} with adjacent areas, experienced multi-stage accretion during successive collisional events that followed the closure of different segments of the Rheic Ocean. In SW Poland, Variscan tectono-stratigraphic units are tectonically juxtaposed and often bear record of contrasting exhumation/cooling paths, constrained by palaeontological and geochronological data. This points to the collage-type tectonics of this area. A three-partite subdivision of the Sudetes is proposed that reflects timing differ-ences in deformation and exhumation of the respective segments. The Central, West and East Sudetes were deformed and amalgamated during the Middle/Late Devonian, at the turn from the Devonian to Carboniferous and during Early Carboniferous times, respectively. Problems in extending the classical tectono-stratigraphic zonation of the <b>Variscides</b> into the Sudetes are discussed and attributed to activ-ity along Late Palaeozoic strike-slip faults and shear zones, disrupting and dispersing the initially more simply distributed tectono-strati-graphic units into the present-day structural mosaic. Relationships between the Variscan Externides and the foreland basin are explored. Sediments of the foreland basin locally onlap the external fold-and-thrust belt that had undergone an earliest Carboniferous partial tectono-thermal overprint.

40|$|A {{principal}} {{uncertainty in}} models of orogenic ore deposits concerns their ages relative to orogenic processes. The yardstick {{of the relation}} has resided, loosely, in the peak of metamorphism. Age estimates in the <b>Variscides</b> and Tianshan indicate that most orogenic ore deposits were formed {{in the course of}} the Late Carboniferous to Middle Triassic with a peak between 305 and 280 Ma. Their locations, settings and ages suggest an association with coeval, lithosphere-scale strike-slip deformation which played a role in the destruction of the orogenic system following crustal shortening. This destruction tends to invalidate the orogenic association of the orogenic ore deposits. Observation of a mantle signature in some of these ore deposits and in coeval magmatic rocks suggests that the strike-slip belts tapped into sub-crustal levels. Here, lithological composition had been modified by subduction during the stage of construction. Consequently, any orogenic element in the ore deposit models is, apart from location, only an element of inheritance of subduction-modified lithosphere features acquired during construction of the orogen. These features may, however, well have been crucial for the formation of the ore deposits. In view of the translithospheric extent of the strike-slip belts, fluids which contributed to the ore deposits may have come from at least the entire, in part metasomatized, lithosphere column. The ore deposits could probably not have been formed without these deep-reaching strike-slip systems. A model is proposed for the geological setting of the orogenicgolddeposits in the <b>Variscides</b> and the Southern Tianshan. It consists of plutono-metamorphic elements in the mantle, in the lower and in the middle crust, within a transpressional to transtensional tectonic framework of translithospheric faults, and associated domes and pull-apart basins with shallow marine to terrestrial sediments and interlayered felsic and mafic volcanics. The thermal engines of these systems were probably in localized upwellings of the asthenosphere, prompted and controlled by the lithosphere-scale deformation at the time. At an even larger scale, oroclinal bending of the old orogenic backbone may have played yet another role in the localization of the ore deposits. The thesis of specific, localized tectono-thermal engines is at odds with the original proposals of a relation between orogenic ore deposits and regional metamorphism. It suggests that the LatePalaeozoicgold(–antimony–mercury) ore deposits in the <b>Variscides</b> and the Southern Tianshan are more akin to the intrusion-related ore systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the early}} Carboniferous, final {{subduction}} of the Rhenohercynian Ocean, accretion of a magmatic arc and docking of microcontinents caused fault reactivation, extension and fault-controlled basin formation i the foreland of the Variscan Orogen. Lithospheric stretching resulted in generally mildly alkaline basaltic volcanism that peaked in the Visean. In the internal <b>Variscides,</b> rapid uplift and granitoid plutonism shortly followed collision and was {{probably due to}} slab detachment(s) or removal of orogenic root material. A regional-scale, E-W-oriented stress field was superimposed on a collapsing orogen and its foreland from the Westphalian onwards. In the Stephanian-Early Permian, a combination of outward-propagating collapse, mantle or slab detachment and the regional stress field resulted in widespread formation of fault-controlled basins and extensive magmatism dated at 290 - 305 Ma. In the foreland, large amounts of felsic volcanic rocks erupted in northern Germany, accompanied by mafic-felsic volcanics and intrusions in the Oslo Rift, and dolerite sills and dyke swarms in Britain and Sweden. In the internal <b>Variscides,</b> mafic rocks are rare and felsic-intermediate compositions predominate.

Themain Ibero-Armorican Arc (IAA) is essentially {{defined by a}} predominantNW–SE trend in the Iberian branch and an E–Wtrend in the Brittany one. However, in northern Spain it presents a 180 ° rotation, sometimes known as the Cantabrian Arc (CA). The relation between both arcs is controversial, being considered either as a single arc due to one tectonic event, or {{as the result of}} a polyphasic process. According to the last assumption, there is a later arcuate structure (CA), overlapping a previousmajor one (IAA). Whatever themodels, they must be able to explain the presence of a Variscan sinistral transpression in Iberia and a dextral one in Armorica, and a deformation spanning from the Devonian to the Upper Carboniferous. Another arcuate structure, in continuity with the CA, the Central-Iberian Arc (CIA) was recently proposed mainly based upon on magnetic anomalies, geometry of major folds and Ordovician paleocurrents. The critical review of the structural, stratigraphic and geophysical data supports both the IAA and the CA, but as independent structures. However, the presence of a CIA is highly questionable and could not be supported. The complex strain pattern of the IAA and the CA could be explained by a Devonian — Carboniferous polyphasic indentation of a Gondwana promontory.

Notably, andesites emplaced in medium-grade metamorphic basement (Mt. Cobingius, Ogliastra) show a cluster of older ages at 332 Â± 12 Ma. Despite the large uncertainty, this age constrains the onset of igneous activity in the mid-crust. These new radiometric ages constitute: (1) a consistent dataset for different volcanic events; (2) a precise chronostratigraphic constraint which fits well with the biostratigraphic data and (3) insights into the plate reorganization between Laurussia and Gondwana during the late Palaeozoic evolution of the Variscan chain...|$|E

40|$|A crustal geotraverse {{through the}} Iberian <b>Variscides</b> is {{presented}} by integrating the available geological and seismic profiling data. Different modes of orogenic shortening are identified, {{with varying degrees}} of coupling between upper and lower crust. In northern and southern regions of the geotraverse, a decoupling in the middle crust permits the lower crust to subduct/underthrust, thus compensating for strong upper crustal shortening. This behavior does not result in great crustal thickening, except in sectors of crustal underthrusting. In southern Central Iberia, moderate upper crustal shortening is due to a mechanically strong lower crust impeded to subduct/underthrust. In this region, shortening is partitioned between upper and lower crust, deformation being distributed in the upper crust while localized at major fault zones in the lower crust. Finally, the central region of the geotraverse (northern Central Iberia) shows a coupled crustal deformation, having given way to the largest orogenic thickening in the Iberian <b>Variscides.</b> The thermal maturity of this much thickened crust originated voluminous crustal melting, and concomitant normal-fault detachments developed, while shortening dominated in other regions. Theoretical models suggest that compressive stresses may prevail in the lower crust beneath the extending upper crust, thus explaining the efficient syncollisional exhumation {{in this part of the}} orogen. A particular feature of the Iberian Variscan geotraverse is the great importance of out-of-section mass movements, mainly left-lateral shear zones concentrated in two suture boundaries, which displaced to the NW (present coordinates) central and northern Iberia with respect to southern Iberia. © 2013.

40|$|Controlled source seismic {{methods were}} {{employed}} in this study to investigate the reflectivity and velocity structure of two Hercynian orogens – the Uralides and <b>Variscides.</b> Conventional common depth point (CDP) sections from five reflection seismic campaigns and a velocity model obtained from tomographic inversion of wide-angle observations were the main datasets studied from the Middle Urals. These were complemented with the near-vertical seismic sections and velocity models from the Southern Urals. In the <b>Variscides,</b> conventional CDP processing, along with non-standard processing and synthetic data modeling, were used to obtain and interpret reflection seismic images of the Southwestern Iberian crust. Although, the Uralian and Variscan belts were formed in Late Paleozoic time in apparently similar plate collisional settings, {{a comparison of the}} seismic results show that the crust of these two orogens looks quite different at depth. In the Urals, collision of Baltica with Asian terranes (Siberia and Kazakhstan) resulted in a highly diversely reflective crust of 40 - 45 km thickness. The axial zone of the orogen is characterized by a high velocity crustal root of diffuse reflectivity and an imbricated Moho, with a crustal thickness reaching 55 - 60 km. The Moho discontinuity is marked by a sharp decrease in reflectivity and is well imaged in most locations except in the crustal root zone. The Southwestern Iberian Variscan crust is 30 - 35 km thick and is characterized by a highly reflective two-layered structure that resulted from collision of Luarussia and Gondwana, including terranes in-between them. This type of crustal structure is very similar to those imaged in other regions of the Variscan belt in the Europe. The Moho discontinuity is flat and appears to be the deepest reflection. This thesis compares the deep structure of the two orogens and interprets mountain building processes related to late Paleozoic plate movements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – SIMS dating of {{detrital}} zircons {{from the}} stratigraphically enigmatic Radzimowice Slates of the Kaczawa Mountains (Sudetes, SW Poland), near the eastern {{termination of the}} European <b>Variscides,</b> has yielded age populations of: (1) 493 – 512 Ma, corresponding to late Cambrian to early Ordovician magmatism and constraining a maximum depositional age; (2) between 550 and 650 Ma, reflecting input from diverse Cadomian sources; and (3) older inherited components ranging to c. 3. 3 Ga, with age spectra similar to those from Gondwanan North Africa. The new data show that the Radzimowice Slates cannot form a Proterozoic base to the Kaczawa Mountains succession, as suggested by earlier models, but was deposited, at the earliest, as an extensional basin-fill, during a relatively late stage of the break-up {{of this part of}} northern Gondwana...|$|E

We have obtained new apatite fission-tracks and apatite (U-Th) /He ages to constrain the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic {{evolution of}} {{this portion of the}} Iberian Massif located just north of the Betic-Rif Alpine orogen. We have obtained nine apatite fission-track ages on samples from Variscan and pre-Variscan granitoids. These ages range from 174. 4 (+/- 10. 8) to 54. 1 (+/- 4. 9) Ma, with mean track lengths between 10. 3 and 13. 9 mu m. We have also performed 5 (U-Th) /He datings on some of the same samples, obtaining ages between 74. 6 (+/- 1. 6) and 18. 5 (+/- 1. 4) Ma. Time-temperature path modeling of these low-temperature geochronological data leads us to envisage four post-Paleozoic tectonically controlled exhumation episodes in the SW Iberian <b>Variscides.</b> Three of these episodes occurred in Mesozoic times (Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous) at rates of approximate to 1. 1 to 2. 5 degrees C Ma(- 1), separated by periods with almost no cooling. We relate these Mesozoic cooling events to the formation of important marginal reliefs during the rifting and opening of the central and northern Atlantic realm. The fourth exhumation episode occurred in Cenozoic times at rates of approximate to 3. 2 to 3. 6 degrees C Ma(- 1), being only recorded in samples next to faults with topographic escarpments. These samples cooled below 80 degrees C at approximate to 20 Ma at rates of 3 - 13 degrees C Ma(- 1) due to roughly N-S oriented compressional stresses affecting the whole Iberian plate, which, in the particular case of SW Iberia, reactivated some of the previous Late Paleozoic thrusts.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the turbiditic sediments from the Carboniferous Baixo Alentejo Flysch Group (BAFG) in the South Portuguese Zone, an {{external}} zone of the Iberian <b>Variscides.</b> The aim of this work is to constrain the provenance and tectonic setting of these sediments in a context of a complex evolution of SW Iberian <b>Variscides.</b> For this purpose, we performed a systematic study of petrographical and geochemical signatures of greywackes and shales from the three BAFG formations: Mértola, Mira and Brejeira. Major and trace element composition and ratios suggest heterogeneous source area composition for BAFG shales and greywackes. For the oldest Mértola Formation greywackes, source area is dominated by granitoid rocks with minor mafic input. The latter becomes residual in the Mira Formation. The youngest Brejeira Formation greywackes show clear felsic affiliation associated with an increase in recycled components. The shales of all three BAFG formations denote a granodioritic affiliation. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) and Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values suggest moderate weathering in the source areas of Mértola and Mira formations. These indices, together with A–CN–K relations, point out to steady-state weathering conditions in the source areas of both formations. In contrast, both CIA and PIA values for the Brejeira Formation indicate variable conditions of palaeoweathering, from moderate to intense, as a consequence of non-steady-state conditions probably triggered by tectonic instability in the provenance area. Compared to the greywackes, the shales of all three BAFG formations exhibit higher CIA and PIA values, as well as low K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 (~ 0. 2) and index of compositional variability (b 1), reflecting the cumulative effect of multiple cycles of sedimentary recycling and prolonged chemical weathering history. Major and trace element distribution and upper continental crust-normalized multi-element plots suggest that the sediments of BAFG were derived mainly from a continental arc/active margin with minor contribution from old continental crust. Together, our geochemical data are compatible with BAFG sediments derived mainly from SW border of the Ossa Morena Zone (Gondwanan affinity), with possible contribution from an external (Avalonian) source...|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of pre-Variscan plates configuration in the Mediterranean area, is still poorly understood. Different hypotheses {{have been proposed}} to explain the relationships between peri-Tyrrhenian blocks such as Sardinia-Corse block (SCB) and Calabrian-Peloritain Arc (CPA), which before the opening of South Tyrrhenian Basin belonged to a branch of Southern Variscan Realm (Alvarez & Shimabukuro, 2009). Is still ambiguous if the CPA in the early time was formed by an amalgamation {{of two or more}} continental terranes that collided during Tertiary (Bonardi etal., 1980; Scandone, 1982) or was a single terrane during the middle and late Tertiary (Amodio-Morelli et al., 1976). With the aim to provide a contribution in unraveling the peri-Tyrrhenian area evolution of the peri-Gondwana terranes, amalgamated during Variscan and widespread during Cainozoic opening (and closing) of Tethys, both Variscan and Tertiary rocks cropping out in the two Blocks have been investigated, either magmatic or sedimentary. The first part of the research was focused on the magmatic bodies supposed belonging to the European <b>Variscides</b> with the aim to provide more constrains to the Variscan magmatic evolutionand so to draft the analogies between the present-day, separated blocks. In detail, the geochemical data from magmatic and detrital zircons of the basement rocks highlight analogies or differences between the tectono-sedimentary sectors of the Sardinian <b>Variscides</b> (nappe and foreland zones) and between them and the Calabria <b>Variscides.</b> The geochemical whole rocks analyses and U-Pb data obtained show that the Variscan basement which crops out in the Northern part of the CPA (Sila region) is characterized by the similar features of that in the SCB: the Middle Ordovician and Late Palaeozoic magmatic products recognized in the two blocks look similar. Some of these data can provide new insights also about the Ordovician evolution of the Northern Gondwana margin. To compare the and better constrain the relationships between the two blocks, detrital zircons were sampled in Tertiary rocks in NE Sardinia, E Corsica and Calabria, commonly regarded as closely related to the tectonic evolution of the Central-western Mediterranean. The analyses performed suggest some differences on the classical paleo-geographic positions of the SCB respect to the CPA and some assumptions can be made also about their relationships with other peri-Gondwana terranes. The association of U-Pb and Lu-Hf study performed on Tertiary detrital zircon populations is a good tool to furnish more data for recognize the pre-Variscan inputs suffered by the peri-Tyrrhenian area, and to highlight differences and similarities between them. The first consideration that can be made is that the two blocks suffered different crustal evolution. The main difference between them has given by the Grenvillian zircons input studied in the Tertiary deposits. The Southern part of CPA (Aspromonte and Peloritani) is characterized by the lacking of Mesoproterozoic age, whereas the Northern part of CPA (Sila) together with the SCB, are characterized by an important Grenvillian input. These considerations have a geodynamic implications about the misunderstood early evolution of the studied zones The Southern part of CPA shows strong similarities with Cadomiam terranes, which permit to correlate it with the evolution of <b>Variscides</b> now cropping out in North Africa. The SCB and the Northern part of CPA could be associated to the other European Variscan terranes (e. g. Iberia) characterized by widespread Grenvillian zircons. A supplementary assumption that stem out from these analyses is that the early position of SCB and Northern part of CPA, were possibly close to the Amazonian craton or nearness to the West African craton (Arabian-Nubian shield and the Sahara Metacraton), quite different from more of the proposed reconstructions. Finally, considering all these data in the complicated evolution of southern Tyrrhenian basin, here is supported the “two-terrane model” (slightly different from that proposed by Alvarez and Shimabukuro, 2009) which considers the CPA composed by a northern CPA terrane connected with the SCB {{from the end of the}} Variscan orogeny until the almost the Eocene. The southern CPA terrane suffered a different evolution before the opening of the Tyrrhenian Sea. According to the roll-back model of the westward subduction of Adria plate under Europe during Neogene-Pliocene the whole CPA, likely amalgamated in the early Miocene, was then tear apart from SCB and drifted away eastwards during the open of the South Tyrrhenian basin. ...|$|E
40|$|In the Iberian <b>Variscides</b> it is {{possible}} to distinguish major arcuate structures; although highly studied, their characterization and genesis are still a matter of controversy. The main Ibero- Armorican Arc (IAA) is essentially defined by a NW–SE trend in the Iberian branch and an E–W trend in the Brittany branch; however, in northern Spain it is rotated 180 º, sometimes known as the Cantabrian Arc (CA). The relationship between these arcs is debatable, being considered either as a single arc generated in one tectonic event, or the result of polyphase bending process. According to the last assumption, there is a later arcuate structure (CA), overlapping a previous major one (IAA). Whatever the proposed models, they must explain the presence of a sinistral transpression regime in Iberia and a dextral one in Armorican branch, and the temporal deformation range of Devonian to Upper Carboniferous (Dias and Ribeiro, 1995) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The early {{evolution}} of SW Europe <b>Variscides</b> started by {{opening of the}} Rheic ocean at 500 Ma, splitting Avalonia from Armorica/Iberia. Subduction on the SE side of Rheic generated the Paleotethys back-arc basin (430 – 390 Ma, splitting Armorica from Iberia), with development of Porto-Tomar-Ferreira do Alentejo (PTFA) dextral transform defining the boundary between continental Armorica and Finisterra microplate to the W. Obduction of Paleotethys was followed by Armorica/Iberia collision and emplacement of NW Iberian Allochthonous Units at 390 – 370 Ma, whereas toward the west of PTFA, there was antithetic ophiolite obduction (Beja-Acebuches and Rheic ophiolites plus Finisterra continental slices) on top of Ossa-Morena Zone, with simultaneous development of eclogites and orogenic magmatism under a flake–double wedge tectonic regime. Continued convergence (< 370 Ma) proceeded by intracontinental deformation, with progressive tightening of the Ibero-Armorican Arc through dextral transpression on the Cantabrian Indentor, from Iberia to Armorica.

40|$|The Southern Variscan Front in the Tinerhir area {{involves}} Palaeozoic allochthonous units (Ouaklim and Tilouine units) thrust {{onto the}} northern edge of the West African Craton during late Carboniferous time. Illite crystallinity data highlight an anchizonal grade for the Ouaklim Unit, and a diagenesis-anchizone transition for the Tilouine Unit during deformation phase D 1. The tectonic stack is crosscut by major dextral reverse faults bounding E–W trending domains of dominant shortening deformation (central domain) and strike-slip deformation (northern and southern domains), later segmented by a network of post-Variscan faults. This complex deformation pattern is the result of kinematic partitioning of dextral transpression along the Southern Variscan Front, coeval with the Neovariscan (300 – 290 Ma) oblique convergence observed at the scale of the whole Moroccan <b>Variscides.</b> Partitioning of dextral transpression described in the Tinerhir area is consistent with dextral wrench faulting along the Tizi n’ Test Fault, and with Appalachian-style south-directed thrusting in the Tinerhir and Bechar-Bou Arfa areas...|$|E

The expressions of brittle tectonics and geological events linked with them are often important clues leading to understanding processes giving unique forms to many localities.
