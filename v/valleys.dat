5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and <b>valleys.</b> The tightly packed lakes in the narrow <b>valleys</b> are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow <b>valleys</b> are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E
5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep <b>valleys</b> that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the <b>valleys</b> were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river <b>valleys</b> of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{geological}} features {{near the}} headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include anthracite and ridges of sandstone.

50|$|In its {{southern}} section, the Great <b>Valley</b> is bounded {{to the east}} by the Blue Ridge Mountains, which extend north into Maryland and Pennsylvania as South Mountain. Regional names of the southern Great <b>Valley</b> include Hagerstown <b>Valley</b> in Maryland, Winchester <b>Valley</b> and Shenandoah <b>Valley</b> in Virginia and West Virginia, the upper <b>valley</b> of the James River, Roanoke <b>Valley,</b> and New River <b>Valley</b> in Virginia, the Holston River <b>Valley</b> in Virginia and Tennessee, and the East Tennessee <b>Valley</b> extending from Virginia through Tennessee to Alabama.

5|$|After passing Minden, {{the scenic}} highway begins diving into <b>valleys</b> and along cliffs {{overlooking}} several lakes.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the <b>valleys</b> with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the <b>valleys</b> from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping downslope to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller <b>valleys</b> between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet <b>valleys,</b> are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger <b>valleys,</b> these <b>valleys</b> grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E

5|$|The hilly {{area around}} Aarhus {{consists}} of a moranial plateau from the last ice age, broken by a complex system of tunnel <b>valleys.</b> The most prominent <b>valleys</b> of this network are the Aarhus Valley in the south, stretching inland east-west with the Aarhus River, Brabrand Lake, Årslev Lake and Tåstrup Lake, and the Egå Valley to the north, with the stream of Egåen, the bog of Geding-Kasted Mose and Geding Lake. Most parts of the two <b>valleys</b> have been drained and subsequently farmed, {{but in the early}} 2000s some of the drainage was removed and parts of the wetlands were restored for environmental reasons. The valley system also includes the stream of Lyngbygård Å in the west and <b>valleys</b> to the south of the city, following erosion channels from the pre-quaternary.
