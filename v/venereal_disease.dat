5|$|After World War I, Harrison {{traveled}} the Middle East performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> in Constantinople and operating an X-ray facility in Lod, Israel. Although still not legally divorced {{from his first}} two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and his new wife's train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned {{with a group of}} politicians. The quick thinking of the recently thrice-married physician prevented his new wife's broken leg from developing into gangrene.|$|E

40|$|During World War I, the American Government {{with the}} help of {{non-profit}} organizations waged an internal and external campaign against <b>venereal</b> <b>diseases.</b> With the creation of the Committee of Training Camp Activities, the Federal Government identified <b>venereal</b> <b>diseases</b> {{as a threat to the}} war effort. Internally, the government restructured the atmosphere of training camps by offering intellectual and athletic activities that stimulate the mind rather than sexual desires. Externally, the government used its prestige and power to eliminate factors that caused <b>venereal</b> <b>diseases,</b> including prostitution and red-light districts. Although the internal and external reforms succeeded in restricting the potentiality of <b>venereal</b> <b>diseases,</b> it, nevertheless limited an individual’s freedom and inspired negative connotations that women struggle to evade today...|$|R

5|$|The New Zealand {{government}} authorised {{the formation}} of the NZEF for service in the war in support of Great Britain, with Godley, having relinquished his position as commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces to Major General Alfred William Robin, as its commander. Godley would retain command of the NZEF {{for the duration of the}} war, making regular reports to James Allen, the New Zealand Minister of Defence. By October 1914, the NZEF consisted of 8,500 men and, along with Godley, embarked from Wellington for Europe. The NZEF was intended for service on the Western Front but was diverted to Egypt while in transit, following the entry of Turkey into the war. In Egypt, the NZEF underwent an intensive period of training under Godley's supervision. Despite his strict approach to training and discipline, he was a relatively enlightened commander for his time; he discreetly established drinking canteens and <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> treatment centres for his men.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from <b>venereal</b> <b>disease.</b> In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly spent, and William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E
25|$|Due to the devadasi being equated to prostitutes, {{they also}} became {{associated}} with the spreading of <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> in India. During the British Colonial period, many British soldiers were exposed to <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> in the various brothels being operated at that time. As such, devadasis were misunderstood {{to be responsible for}} this. In efforts to control the spread of <b>venereal</b> <b>disease,</b> the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves, with devadasis being forced to do this as well, as they were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.|$|E

Between 1915 and 1916, research at the hospital led to reducing the length of <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> and halving the cost of its treatment.

25|$|In October 1911, Knox {{attempted}} {{to rejoin the}} army and applied {{to the office of}} the surgeon general for readmission. His application was received in 1912, and unfortunately his application was not well received. Although it is not clear precisely why Knox fell out of favor of the army, there are several possibilities. It is possible that his discovery and reported treatment of rampant <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> while at Fort Hancock was frowned upon, as at the time <b>venereal</b> <b>disease</b> was quite stigmatizing and his treatment of it might have been considered immoral. It is also possible that the rapid dissolution of his marriage to Marion, and quick remarriage to Gladys, painted him as an unreliable man. In any case, he was not permitted readmission to the army.|$|E
