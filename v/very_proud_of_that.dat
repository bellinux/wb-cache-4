That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.|$|E

2500|$|Smart Bomb Interactive {{stated that}} the {{inspiration}} for Flying Ace came from their well received 2006 title, Snoopy vs. the Red Baron. [...] "We were <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> game {{and it was a}} critical success, but the budget and time constraints that came from the publisher [...] left us feeling that we could have done a lot more. So we went to United Media and representatives of the Schulz family, and we licensed the property ourselves" [...] stated Clark Stacey, Vice President for Smart Bomb Interactive. [...] "But of course, it was Charles M. Schulz’s original strips of Snoopy as the World Famous WWI Flying Ace that are the ultimate inspiration" [...] added Stacey.

2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I think it just has great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and she and I were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really good for you, sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E

The group also collaborated with Sean Kingston. Sugababes also joked that [...] "Rihanna's been like our fourth member, listening to all our songs and saying what she liked and what she didn't like." [...] Buchanan told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat, the album has [...] "definitely got the British feel throughout the album - we've not gone away and gone 'All American' on our fans." [...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. I think the one thing we wanted to do was come back with something different." [...] She also admitted the girls had become [...] "complacent" [...] around the time of Catfights and Spotlights but they also said that they are <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> album.|$|E

60|$|It {{happened}} that Roger Vanderwater {{was fond of}} scientific farming, and that on his farm, three miles outside of Kingsbury, {{he had managed to}} grow a new kind of strawberry. He was <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> new strawberry of his, and he would have been out to see and pick the first ripe ones, {{had it not been for}} his illness. Because of his illness he had ordered the old farm slave to bring in personally the first box of the berries. All this was learned from the gossip of a palace scullion, who slept each night in the slave pen. The overseer of the plantation should have brought in the berries, but he was on his back with a broken leg from trying to break a colt. The scullion brought the word in the night, and it was known that next day the berries would come in. And the men in the slave pen of Hell's Bottom, being men and not cowards, held a council.|$|E

When I was {{fourteen}} I was Dad's actual housekeeper, with entire power over the servants, and I am <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> period of my life. And when I was sixteen we three girls were all sent up to California to Mills Seminary, which was quite fashionable and stifling. How we used to long for home! We didn't chum with the other girls, who called us little cannibals, just because we came from the Sandwich Islands, and who made invidious remarks about our ancestors banqueting on Captain Cook--which was historically untrue, and, besides, our ancestors hadn't lived in Hawaii.|$|E

"Matilda {{was sure}} he would, so she sat on in the big chair, {{guarding}} the papers, {{and no one could}} get her away, till one day a man came with her father's ring and told her to give up the secret. She knew the ring, but would not tell until she had asked many questions, so as to be very sure, and while the man answered all about her father and the king, she looked at him sharply. Then she stood up and said, in a tremble, for there was something strange about the man: 'Sir, I doubt you in spite of the ring, and I will not answer till you pull off the false beard you wear, that I may see your face and know if you are my father's friend or foe.' Off came the disguise, and Matilda found it was my lord himself, come to take them with him out of England. He was <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> faithful girl, I guess, for the old chair still stands in the castle, and the name keeps in the family, Pa says, even over here, where some of the Bassetts came along with the Pilgrims." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know, dearie. I never {{remember}} of Captain Jim making up to anybody. He was edging on old {{as far as}} my memory goes. He's seventy-six, you know. I never heard any reason for his staying a bachelor, but there must be one, believe ME. He sailed all his life till five years ago, and there's no corner of the earth he hasn't poked his nose into. He and Elizabeth Russell were great cronies, all their lives, but they never had any notion of sweet-hearting. Elizabeth never married, though she had plenty of chances. She was a great beauty when she was young. The year the Prince of Wales came to the Island she was visiting her uncle in Charlottetown and he was a Government official, and so she got invited to the great ball. She was the prettiest girl there, and the Prince danced with her, and all the other women he didn't dance with were furious about it, because their social standing was higher than hers and they said he shouldn't have passed them over. Elizabeth was always <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> dance. Mean folks said that was why she never married--she couldn't put up with an ordinary man after dancing with a prince. But that wasn't so. She told me the reason once--it was because she had such a temper that she was afraid she couldn't live peaceably with any man. She HAD an awful temper--she used to have to go upstairs and bite pieces out of her bureau to keep it down by times. But I told her that wasn't any reason for not marrying if she wanted to. There's no reason why we should let the men have a monopoly of temper, is there, Mrs. Blythe, dearie?" ...|$|E
60|$|I am {{not quite}} sure that the mother would have been equally quick to ask her {{daughter}}'s advice, had she been left in the matter entirely to her own propensities. Mrs. Grantly had ever loved her daughter dearly, and had been <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> great success in life which Griselda had achieved; but in late years, the child had become, as a woman, separate from the mother, and there had arisen, not unnaturally, a break of that close confidence which in early years had existed between them. Griselda, Marchioness of Hartletop, was more than ever a daughter to the archdeacon, even though he might never see her. Nothing could rob him of the honour of such a progeny,--nothing, even though there had been actual estrangement between them. But {{it was not so}} with Mrs. Grantly. Griselda had done very well, and Mrs. Grantly had rejoiced; but she had lost her child. Now the major, who had done well also, though in a much lesser degree, was still her child, moving in the same sphere of life with her, still dependent in a great degree upon his father's bounty, a neighbour in the county, a frequent visitor at the parsonage, and a visitor who could be received without any of that trouble which attended the unfrequent comings of Griselda, the marchioness, to the home of her youth. And for this reason Mrs. Grantly, terribly put out as she was at the idea of a marriage between her son and one standing so poorly in the world's esteem as Grace Crawley, would not have brought forward the matter before her daughter, had she been left to her own desires. A marchioness in one's family is a tower of strength, no doubt; but there are counsellors so strong that we do not wish to trust them, lest in the trusting we ourselves be overwhelmed by their strength. Now Mrs. Grantly was by no means willing to throw her influence into the hands of her titled daughter.|$|E
