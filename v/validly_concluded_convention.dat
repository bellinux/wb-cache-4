40|$|In its {{simplest}} form, syllogisms are deductive reasoning problems {{consisting of}} two related statements (premises) and a conclusion. A popular example of a syllogism is: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal. To engage in syllogistic reasoning one must {{understand the concept of}} groups (sets), and set memberships. In this example, Socrates belongs to the set “men”, which in turn, belongs to the set “mortal”; based on these two set memberships, we can <b>validly</b> <b>conclude</b> that “Socrates is mortal”. Syllogisms, like the above example, contain quantifiers such as “all”, “some”, “none ” and “most”. In everyday life, people utilize and are exposed to shorter forms of syllogistic reasoning where a premise is often implied rather than stated (Kirby & Goodpaster, 2007). For example, a Canadian citizen might claim that: Michaëlle Jean is the Governor General of Canada...|$|R

40|$|Several European law {{documents}} (including the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) {{lay down}} a general prohibition {{on making the}} human body and its parts, as such, a source of financial gain. Scholars have identified three reasons for this prohibition: human dignity, equality, and solidarity. This paper aims at exploring to what extent non-gratuitous contracts on human biological samples can be <b>validly</b> <b>concluded</b> for purposes of research and commercial applications of the research results. In particular, the present paper will firstly, analyse the role of the three aforementioned reasons – dignity, equality, and solidarity – in the assessment of the validity of non-gratuitous contracts on human biological samples for the purposes of research and possible commercial uses thereof. Secondly, this paper will outline some possible advantages of excluding this kind of contracts from the scope of application of the prohibition of financial gain...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the agreement}} as to proceedings {{is the central}} point. By means of an agreement as to proceedings, parties diverge from procedural law. It is relevant to conduct research into agreements as to proceedings, as they may contribute to a swift and efficient course of the civil proceedings. In addition, research into these agreements {{can result in a}} better insight into the question about the control over the proceedings. Who ultimately has the right to determine the course of affairs during the proceedings? Is it the parties, whose substantive rights are at issue, or is it the government, which makes the civil proceedings available? Three main questions are to be distinguished in this research. Firstly, the admissibility of agreements as to proceedings has been examined. To what extent can parties <b>validly</b> <b>conclude</b> an agreement as to proceedings? Secondly, the effect of agreements as to proceedings has been examined. What are the consequences of an agreement as to proceedings concluded by parties? Finally, it has been investigated what rules are applicable to such agreements. Promotor: H. J. SnijdersWith summary in Englis...|$|R

40|$|Change of {{circumstances}} {{and its effect}} on a duration of an obligation In particular cases, an unexpected supervening event may substantially affect original equilibrium of a contract, or make the performance for one of the parties much more burdensome, so that it would be greatly unjust to hold the parties to their obligations. In such situations, when the performance of one of the parties has become much more onerous, a conflict may rise between the classical principles of contractual freedom, sanctity of the contract, certainty of the law and pacta sunt servanda, on the one hand, and principle of contractual fairness, equity and good faith on the other. Pacta sunt servanda, principle accepted by most of developed legal systems, determines that obligations which are <b>validly</b> <b>concluded,</b> must be fulfilled, parties are bound by their agreement. In case of change {{of circumstances}}, this may lead to situations, when it would be unjust to hold the debtor to the obligation. This makes the topic of the thesis very controversial and polemic. The topic of this thesis is a change of circumstances and its impact on an existing obligation. The aim of the thesis is to focus and describe relevant legal doctrines, institutes, and possible solutions of the problem. Another purpose is to analyze different legislations and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the overall presentation of contracts to which the law recognizes the power of enforcement, in a brief retrospect carried out through the Roman law and their evolution to the present day as they are found in the Civil Code or special laws that govern them. The contract is in effect, the conventional framework by which parties incur obligations and acquire rights in relation to each other, representing the materialization of the agreement of the parties and is only deemed <b>validly</b> <b>concluded</b> if the parties have expressed their consent freely and without undue influence. Contract partners are free to insert any clauses they want in the Covent signed, provided that they do not contravene to public order or morality. But the aim is to highlight both the power of the contract, and even more the importance of expressing the individual’s will on its fate. The importance of this legal act never contested, made the legislator invest it with the force of law between the contracting parties. So in cases expressly stipulated by the rules of law, this legal act has been given the benefit of enforcement, however without prejudicing in any way the principle of autonomy of will and without creating a contractual imbalance, privileges or discriminations...|$|R

40|$|Hierarchical models (HMs; Lindley & Smith, 1972) offer {{considerable}} prom-ise {{to increase}} the level of realism in social science modeling, but the scope {{of what can be}} <b>validly</b> <b>concluded</b> with them is limited, and recent technical advances in allied fields may not yet have been put to best use in implement-ing them. In this article, I (a) examine 3 levels of inferential strength supported by typical social science data-gathering methods, and call for a greater degree of explicitness, when HMs and other models are applied, in identifying which level is appropriate; (b) reconsider the use of HMs in school effectiveness studies and meta-analysis from the perspective of causal inference; and (c) recommend the increased use of Gibbs sampling and other Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the application of HMs in the social sciences, so that comparisons between MCMC and better-established fitting methods—including full or restricted maximum likelihood estimation based on the EM algorithm, Fisher scoring, and iterative general-ized least squares—may be more fully informed by empirical practice. Much of the data gathered in the social sciences to answer scientific and decision-making questions has a nested or hierarchical character. Examples in fields as disparate as economics, education, and health policy come immedi-ately to mind: • the multistage cluster sampling employed by the U. S. government's main instrument for estimating local and national unemployment rates, the Current Population Survey (e. g., Bureau of the Census, 1978), in which random samples are taken at each of the state, area, and (city) block levels...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{have significantly}} caused an unprecedented {{shift from the}} orthodox paper-based approach to a continuum of internet transactions. Technology redefined the status quo of traditional markets and resulted {{in the international community}} and territorial boundaries merging into one population of cyber citizens in the electronic commerce sphere. These new paradigms give rise to legal challenges which are precipitated by legal aspects of electronic commerce necessitating for the legal regulation. The 1996 United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on Electronic Commerce is a global legal framework for legislators. It seeks to address these issues by transposing common law requirements for <b>validly</b> <b>concluded</b> traditional contracts into cyber contracts in order to accord cyber contracts the same legal standing through functional equivalence approach. The Lesotho jurisdiction envisions to embrace this development through the envisaged Lesotho Electronic Transactions and Electronic Commerce Bill 2013. This study is the juxtaposition of the Lesotho Bill and the South Africa s Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002 on electronic transactions provisions covering the legal recognition of electronic messages, time of contract formation, time and place of dispatch and receipt of communication, and the in writing and signature requirements which are applied in online contracts {{in order to meet the}} similar common law contract demands for paper based contracts. The interrogation should indicate whether there are any challenges occasioned by the Bill in electronic contracting, and the recommended solutions, considering lessons learned from the South Africa s ECT Act, and compliance with the best international practices.
