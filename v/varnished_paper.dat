60|$|The chamber {{which was}} destined to be the scene of our unforgettable {{experience}} was a charmingly feminine sitting-room, some fourteen or sixteen feet square.

The curtain was still hanging, but the boudoir and dressing-room could be taken as one chamber for the purposes of our experiment. One door and the window frame had been plastered round with <b>varnished</b> <b>paper</b> so as to be practically sealed. Above the other door, which opened on to the landing, there hung a fanlight which could be drawn by a cord when some ventilation became absolutely necessary.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the usage of high viscosity polymeric hydrogels in <b>varnish</b> removal on <b>paper</b> objects, for conservation purposes. <b>Varnishing</b> <b>paper</b> artefacts was a common practice between the 18 th and 20 th century. However, the procedure has resulted in degradation and discoloration of paper artefacts, which usually results in the removal of the varnish by conservators. The study aims to investigate the solvent-based poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and borate gel as an alternative for removing shellac <b>varnish</b> on <b>paper</b> artefacts. Different solvent-based gels are frequently used in fine arts conservation but are not commonly used in paper conservation. Traditional conservation methods with solvent baths may have negative consequences in terms on the effect on the paper substrate. The hydrogel PVA-borax will be compared to traditional solvent baths commonly used in paper conservation. The study includes a disciplinary literature study of PVA-borax usage for cleaning works of art and the historical usage of <b>varnish</b> on <b>paper</b> objects. Artificial aging of shellac samples are carried out in order to provide sufficient materials and samples for analysis. The chosen analysis methods are Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Ultraviolet (UV) Fluorescence imaging, which both can be used to indicate the presence of shellac residues left after removal. The FTIR analysis shows that PVA-borax is an insufficient substrate for removal of <b>varnish</b> on <b>paper</b> samples due to the low percentage of solvents of the total moisture content carried out in the gel. However, a case study on a varnished wall map shows that PVA-borax gel sufficiently removes aged <b>varnish</b> from the <b>paper</b> substrate. Further studies are needed to analyse the gels sufficiency as a varnish removal agent on paper substrates.

Zuccato’s system involved writing {{on a sheet of}} <b>varnished</b> <b>paper</b> with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the Blériot V had no {{resemblance}} to his earlier aircraft, which had been biplanes. It was a canard configuration pusher monoplane with a braced wooden box-girder fuselage covered with varnished silk, {{at the rear of}} which was the 24 hp (18 kW) Antoinette water-cooled V-8 engine. The wings, which could be folded upwards for transport and had no wire bracing, were made of wood covered with <b>varnished</b> <b>paper</b> and were of a complex design probably inspired by the seeds of the Zanonia tree. There was a small elevator mounted {{at the front of the}} fuselage as well as a rectangular rudder mounted underneath, which also served as a nose skid. The main undercarriage consisted of a pair of bicycle wheels set close together under the wing. [...] It was first tried on 21 March 1907, when Blériot made a single taxiing trial which ended in the aircraft slewing round, causing the undercarriage to collapse and damaging the rudder and elevator. Two further ground trials were made, one on 26 March, causing similar damage, and another on 2 April, when the propeller was damaged. After this trial Blériot replaced the frontal rudder with a semi-circular rudder behind the propeller, and added a fin to the underside of the fuselage in front of the wing. On 5 April a further trial was made, and after a 100 m (305 ft) run the machine briefly left the ground. Concerned about his ability to control the aircraft in the stiff breeze that was blowing, Blériot cut the engine and landed, yet again damaging the undercarriage slightly. He had only flown around 6 m (20 ft), but nevertheless this was the first time one of his aircraft had successfully flown. More trials followed, the last on 19 April when, traveling at a speed of around 50 km/h (30 mph), the aircraft left the ground, Blériot over-responded when the nose began to rise and the machine hit the ground nose-first and somersaulted. The machine was largely destroyed, but Blériot was by great good fortune unhurt. The engine of the aircraft was immediately behind his seat, and he was very lucky not to have been crushed by it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To enhance {{printing}} qualities, {{this study}} used refluxed silica (SiO 2) from rice husk by hydrochloric acid (HCl) at different molarities and reaction times as coating agent for printed paper. Characterization of the refluxed silica from 2 M HCl 120 min elucidated the purity of 98. 7 % and amorphous structure. Particle size of the silica exhibited uniform size of 3 μm and the color measurement (CIE L*a*b*) indicated 94. 79 + 0. 48 + 1. 24, whiteness and color difference (∆E) were 84. 85, 3. 28, respectively. The coating agent was prepared by water-based varnish of acrylic resin mixed with the synthesized silica at different proportions: 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 (%wt), and later was applied on 170 g/m 2 -white kraft papers. The {{results showed that the}} water-based coating varnish with silica exhibited an increase of viscosity as increasing the amount of the silica. Printing qualities indicated that the vanished printed paper with 1. 0 % silica elucidated the highest details in shadow tone and text (font) sharpness. The color gamut yielded a wider scope than the printed papers which were varnished with the silica at 0. 0 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 5 %.

40|$|Marine algae are macroscopIC plants constituting an {{important}} marine living renewable resource. They {{are used as}} human food, livestock feed and fertilizer for land plants {{in many parts of}} the world besides having the prime importance of being the only source for the production of agar, carrageenan and alginates. These phytochemicals are extensively used in various industries such as food, confectionery, textile, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, dairy, liquor, canning, paint, <b>varnish,</b> <b>paper</b> etc. mostly as gelling, stabilising and thickening agents and have an estimated billion dollar global market (Zilinskas and Lundin, 1993). A summary of sources, chemical composition, properties and important applications of these phytochemicals given by Nambisan (1998) is presented in Table 1. The commercial exploitation of seaweeds is going on since 1966 and the export of economically important seaweeds such as Gelidiella, Gracilaria and Sargassum was banned by the Govt. of India in 1975 as agar and algin industries were started in India by 1970. In recent years many industries producing these phytochemicals have come up in India but as yet the production do not meet the demand. The annual demands of raw materials by Indian seaweed based industries are 2000 tonnes and 12, 000 tonnes (dry weight) of agarophytes and alginophytes respectively. Annually, about 60 tonnes of agar and 500 tonnes of alginates are produced. In India carrageenan is not yet produced. However its demand is nearly 200 tonnes per year. Since the indigenous production of agar and alginates is unable to meet the increasing demand, India is importing about 10 - 12 tonnes of pharmaceutical grade agar, 35 tonnes of algi nates and 140 tonnes of carrageenan costing foreign exchange of about Rs. 10 crores (Zaidi et al., 1999) This is mainly due to the paucity of raw materials particularly agar yielding seaweeds...|$|R

Instead of <b>varnishing</b> the <b>paper</b> to prevent the escape of the gas, and supposing, erroneously, that the fault lay in the latter, they sought about for a new gas more suitable to the paper. This they found, as they supposed, in the gas which resulted from the combustion of wet straw and wool, which had an upward tendency, they thought, on account of its electrical properties, which caused it to be repelled from the ground. It is scarcely necessary now {{to point out that}} the true cause of the upward tendency lay in the rarefaction of the air by the heat of the fire, and that hot air has a tendency to rise because its bulk is greatly increased beyond the same quantity of the surrounding cold air.|$|R
40|$|Dental caries on approximal tooth {{surfaces}} in adolescents {{is still a}} problem in Sweden, {{as well as in}} many other industrialised countries. The aims of the present thesis were therefore: 1) to study whether caries prevalence is underestimated, 2) to evaluate the effect of cessation of fluoride mouth rinse (FMR) programmes in schoolchildren with low caries prevalence, and 3) to reconsider the school as an arena for population-based fluoride (F) varnish and FMR programmes in order to minimise caries development in 13 - 16 -year-olds. Papers I and II showed that the adolescents own dentists consistently registered less caries compared to the recordings made by calibrated dentists from outside. Based on 420 16 -year-olds at 12 different dental clinics in two neighbouring counties in Sweden, the differences were statistically significant at 10 of the 12 clinics when caries prevalence was both high in 1984 (Paper I) and somewhat lower in 1987 and 1990 (Paper II). About 80 % of all approximal caries lesions were enamel lesions and are therefore not reported to the Swedish authorities, as only dentin lesions and fillings are currently included in the official caries data. The basis for Paper III was that many counties in Sweden abandoned school-based FMR programmes in the mid-late 1980 s, as the official caries data revealed low caries prevalence among children. The cessation of FMR for 3 years for a group of 13 - 16 -year-old adolescents (n= 60) with low caries prevalence did not reveal any statistically significant differences in new caries lesions and fillings or in the progression of existing enamel lesions compared to a group of 13 - 16 -year-olds (n= 60) who continued to rinse for 3 years. Nor did a supplementary cross-sectional study reveal any differences in caries prevalence among adolescents who had or had not taken part in FMR programmes for the last 3 years. In Papers IV and V, new models for school-based F treatment were evaluated in two 3 -year randomised controlled trials, RCT studies. Fluoride varnish (Duraphat) treatment, carried out at school by specially trained dental nurses using a simple mobile unit, among 854 13 - 16 -year-olds from low, medium and high caries risk areas, showed that the control groups developed more caries than the <b>varnish</b> groups (<b>Paper</b> IV). The largest difference was found in the high risk area. The prevented fraction (PF) with approximal enamel lesions as the diagnostic threshold was 69 % in high, 66 % in medium and 20 % in low risk areas for F varnish applied twice a year at 6 -month intervals. Supervised school-based FMR among 788 13 - 16 -year-olds with a low to moderate caries risk (Paper V) showed that FMR on the first three and the last three school days during the school term, i. e. 12 rinses/year, had a PF of 59 %. Enamel lesions constituted > 90 % of the new approximal caries lesions in both Papers IV and V. The main conclusions from this thesis are: (1) that enamel caries lesions on approximal surfaces should be included in epidemiological caries data in order to show true caries prevalence, (2) that the cessation of weekly FMR for 3 years did not lead to a statistically significant increase in caries incidence in a relatively small group of adolescents with low caries prevalence, and (3) that the school should be reconsidered as an arena for new models for population-based F school programmes. Fluoride varnish treatment twice a year at 6 -month intervals in medium and high caries risk areas, as well as supervised FMR on the first and the last three school days during the school term in low and medium caries risk areas, are excellent caries prevention strategies for approximal {{surfaces in}} adolescents at the caries risk ages of 13 - 16 years, as a supplement to dental home care and preventive efforts at dental clinics...|$|R
40|$|In this Current Intelligence Bulletin, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{reviews the}} animal and human data {{relevant}} to assessing the carcinogenicity of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) (Chapters 2 and 3), presents a quantitative risk assessment using dose-response data in rats for both cancer (lung tumors) and noncancer (pulmonary inflammation) responses and extrapolation to humans with lung dosimetry modeling (Chapter 4), provides recommended exposure limits (RELs) for fine and ultrafine (including engineered nanoscale) TiO 2 (Chapter 5), describes exposure monitoring techniques and exposure control strategies (Chapter 6), and discusses avenues of future research (Chapter 7). This report only addresses occupational exposures by inhalation, and conclusions derived here should not be inferred to pertain to nonoccupational exposures. TiO 2 (Chemical Abstract Service [CAS] Number 13463 - 67 - 7) is a noncombustible, white, crystalline, solid, odorless powder. TiO 2 is used extensively in many commercial products, including paints and <b>varnishes,</b> cosmetics, plastics, <b>paper,</b> and food as an anticaking or whitening agent. Production in the United States was an estimated 1. 45 million metric tons per year in 2007 [DOI 2008]. The number of U. S. workers currently exposed to TiO 2 dust is not available. TiO 2 is produced and used in the workplace in varying particle size fractions including fine (which is defined in this document as all particle sizes collected by respirable particle sampling) and ultrafine (defined as the fraction of respirable particles with a primary particle diameter of 100 nm), the data on which to assess carcinogenicity are limited. Generally, the epidemiologic studies for fine TiO 2 are inconclusive because of inadequate statistical power {{to determine whether they}} replicate or refute the animal dose-response data. This is consistent for carcinogens of low potency. The only chronic animal inhalation study [Lee et al. 1985], which demonstrated the development of lung tumors (bronchioalveolar adenomas) in response to inhalation exposure of rats to fine sized TiO 2 did so at a dose of 250 mg/m 3 but not at 10 or 50 mg/m 3. The absence of lung tumor development for fine TiO 2 was also reported by Muhle et al. [1991] in rats exposed at 5 mg/m 3. However, the responses observed in animal studies exposed to ultrafine and fine TiO 2 are consistent with a continuum of biological response to TiO 2 that is based on particle surface area. In other words, all the rat tumor response data on inhalation of TiO 2 (ultrafine and fine) fit on the same dose-response curve when dose is expressed as total particle surface area in the lungs. However, exposure concentrations greater than 100 mg/m 3 are generally not considered acceptable inhalation toxicology practice today. Consequently, in a weight-of-evidence analysis, NIOSH questions the relevance of the 250 mg/m 3 dose for classifying exposure to TiO 2 as a carcinogenic hazard to workers and therefore, concludes that there are insufficient data at this time to classify fine TiO 2 as a potential occupational carcinogen. Although data are insufficient on the cancer hazard for fine TiO 2, the tumor-response data are consistent with that observed for ultrafine TiO 2 when converted to a particle surface area metric. Thus to be cautious, NIOSH used all of the animal tumor response data when conducting dose-response modeling and determining separate RELs for ultrafine and fine TiO 2. NIOSH also considered the crystal structure as a modifying factor in TiO 2 carcinogenicity and inflammation. The evidence for crystal-dependent toxicity is from observed differences in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated on the surface of TiO 2 of different crystal structures (e. g., anatase, rutile, or mixtures) in cell-free systems, with differences in cytotoxicity in in vitro studies [Kawahara et al. 2003; Kakinoki et al. 2004; Behnajady et al. 2008; Jiang et al. 2008, Sayes et al. 2006] and with greater inflammation and cell proliferation at early time points following intratracheal instillation in rats [Warheit et al. 2007]. However, when rats were exposed to TiO 2 in subchronic inhalation studies, no difference in pulmonary inflammation response to fine and ultrafine TiO 2 particles of different crystal structure (i. e., 99 % rutile vs. 80 % anatase/ 20 % rutile) was observed once dose was adjusted for particle surface area [Bermudez et al. 2002, 2004]; nor was there a difference in the lung tumor response in the chronic inhalation studies in rats at a given surface area dose of these fine and ultrafine particles (i. e., 99 % rutile vs. 80 % anatase/ 20 % rutile) [Lee et al. 1985; Heinrich et al. 1995]. Therefore, NIOSH concludes that the scientific evidence supports surface area as the critical metric for occupational inhalation exposure to TiO 2. NIOSH also evaluated the potential for coatings to modify the toxicity of TiO 2, as many industrial processes apply coatings to TiO 2 particles. TiO 2 toxicity has been shown to increase after coating with various substances [Warheit et al. 2005]. However, the toxicity of TiO 2 has not been shown to be attenuated by application of coatings. NIOSH concluded that the TiO 2 risk assessment {{could be used as a}} reasonable floor for potential toxicity, with the notion that toxicity may be substantially increased by particle treatment and process modification. These findings are based on the studies in the scientific literature and may not apply to other formulations, surface coatings, or treatments of TiO 2 for which data were not available. An extensive review of the risks of coated TiO 2 particles is beyond the scope of this document. NIOSH recommends airborne exposure limits of 2. 4 mg/m 3 for fine TiO 2 and 0. 3 mg/m 3 for ultrafine (including engineered nanoscale) TiO 2, as time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations for up to 10 hr/day during a 40 -hour work week. These recommendations represent levels that over a working lifetime are estimated to reduce risks of lung cancer to below 1 in 1, 000. The recommendations are based on using chronic inhalation studies in rats to predict lung tumor risks in humans. In the hazard classification (Chapter 5), NIOSH concludes that the adverse effects of inhaling TiO 2 may not be material-specific but appear to be due to a generic effect of PSLT particles in the lungs at sufficiently high exposure. While NIOSH concludes that there is insufficient evidence to classify fine TiO 2 as a potential occupational carcinogen, NIOSH is concerned about the potential carcinogenicity of ultrafine and engineered nanoscale TiO 2 if workers are exposed at the current mass-based exposure limits for respirable or total mass fractions of TiO 2. NIOSH recommends controlling exposures as low as possible, below the RELs. Sampling recommendations based on current methodology are provided (Chapter 6). Although sufficient data are available to assess the risks of occupational exposure to TiO 2, additional research questions have arisen. There is a need for exposure assessment for workplace exposure to ultrafine TiO 2 in facilities producing or using TiO 2. Other research needs include evaluation of the (1) exposure-response relationship of TiO 2 and other PSLT particles and human health effects, (2) fate of ultrafine particles in the lungs and the associated pulmonary responses, and (3) effectiveness of engineering controls for controlling exposures to fine and ultrafine TiO 2.
