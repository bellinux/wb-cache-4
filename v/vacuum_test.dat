5|$|The {{greatest}} difficulty was encountered {{with the}} uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow {{had to be}} coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a hot dipping process without success. Meanwhile, Alcoa tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard <b>vacuum</b> <b>test,</b> but high temperature tests indicated a failure {{rate of more than}} 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of General Electric, which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.|$|E

40|$|A {{low cost}} imaging {{displacement}} technique {{suitable for use}} in thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>testing</b> was built and <b>tested</b> during thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>testing</b> of the {{space infrared telescope facility}} (SIRTF, later renamed Spitzer infrared telescope facility). The problem was to measure the relative displacement of different portions of the spacecraft due to thermal expansion or contraction. Standard displacement measuring instrumentation could not be used because of the widely varying temperatures on the spacecraft and for fear of invalidating the thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>testing.</b> The imaging system was conceived, designed, purchased, and installed in approximately 2 months at very low cost. The system performed beyond expectations proving that sub millimeter displacements could be measured from over 2 meters away. Using commercial optics it was possible to make displacement measurements down to 10 (mu) m. An automated image processing tool was used to process the data, which not only speeded up data reduction, but showed that velocities and accelerations could also be measured. Details of the design and capabilities of the system are discussed along with the results of the test on the observatory. Several images from the actual test are presented...|$|R

5000|$|They used a {{conventional}} ISM band 2.45 GHz 700 W oven magnetron, {{and a small}} cavity with a low Q factor (20 in <b>vacuum</b> <b>tests).</b> They observed small positive thrusts in the positive direction and negative thrusts in the negative direction, of about 20 µN in a hard vacuum. However, when they rotated the cavity upwards as a [...] "null" [...] configuration, they observed an anomalous thrust of hundreds of micronewtons, significantly larger than the expected result of zero thrust. This indicated a strong source of noise which they could not identify. This led them to conclude {{that they could not}} confirm or refute claims about such a thruster. At the time they considered future experiments with better magnetic shielding, other <b>vacuum</b> <b>tests</b> and improved cavities with higher Q factors.|$|R

5000|$|... === Partial vacuum method (ultra sniffer test) === In {{contrast}} to the Helium charged sniffer test, the partial vacuum method, the ultra sniffer test gas method (UST-method) uses the partial vacuum effect, so that the gas tightness of test sample can be detected at normal pressure with the same sensitivity as the helium charged <b>vacuum</b> <b>test</b> with helium gas helium. The method has a sensitivity of 10−12 Pa·m3·s−1.Similar to the classical Helium charged sniffer test the test sample is rapped into a bag, but in {{contrast to}} the classic method, the bag is exposed with a helium-free gas, so that the helium concentration inside the bag can reduced from 5·10−7 to 10−12 Pa·m3·s−1.

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 2010, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer 2 (AMS- 02) {{underwent}} a series of system level electromagnetic interference control measurements, followed by thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>testing.</b> Shortly after completion of the thermal <b>vacuum</b> <b>testing,</b> the project decided to remove the cryogenically cooled superconducting magnet, {{and replace it with}} the original permanent magnet design employed in the earlier AMS- 01 assembly. Doing so necessitated several structural changes, as well as removal or modification of numerous electronic and thermal control devices and systems. At this stage, the project was rapidly approaching key milestone dates for hardware completion and delivery for launch, and had little time for additional testing or assessment of any impact to the electromagnetic signature of the AMS- 02. Therefore, an analytical assessment of the radiated emissions behavioural changes associated with the system changes was requested...|$|R
