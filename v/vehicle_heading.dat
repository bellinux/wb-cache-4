While on the phone, Tom hears Jack being murdered on the line; his last words being the first two lines of Tom's address. Tom, terrified and confused, grabs his children and flees the house. While leaving the neighborhood, he passes a suspicious <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> towards his house. He leaves his children with his mother-in-law and goes to find his wife only to be attacked in her office by a balaclava-clad man wielding an already bloody knife. He is then quickly arrested by the police on suspicion of murder. Tom is questioned about the murder of Vanessa Blake (his wife's work partner), telling him that there was evidence that he was at the crime scene.|$|E
40|$|Most {{terrestrial}} {{vehicles are}} steered via a first-order control for <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading,</b> {{such as a}} conventional steering wheel. A joystick which provides second-order control of <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> is used to steer some underground coal shuttle cars. A desktop virtual simulation of the situation was employed to compare the steering accuracy of 24 novice participants randomly assigned to either first-order or second-order joystick steering conditions. The average steering accuracy of participants assigned to the first-order joystick condition was superior, however there was considerable individual variability and some participants assigned to the second-order steering condition were able to perform the task equally and successfully. Desktop virtual simulation may be a useful component of training and competency assessment for operators of these vehicles...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares two di®erent global {{position}} estimation {{strategies for}} vehicle navigation. Both estimate individual wheel radii with GPS {{and then use}} wheelspeed information to estimate the path length travelled. One further uses wheelspeed information to estimate <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading.</b> The other uses GPS to calibrate the bias and scale factor of an automotive grade gyroscope which is then used to estimate <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading.</b> Detailed model assumptions are discussed including the error contributions of several modeling simpli¯cations. Test results show the gyro and wheelspeed-heading schemes perform equally when modeling assumptions hold, such as when navigating smooth road surfaces. However, the wheelspeed-heading estimator exhibits more sensitivity to wheel slip and road surface. Its position errors grow about twice as fast when the vehicle navigates speed bumps and uneven road surfaces. Increasing {{the resolution of the}} stock wheelspeed sensors does not increase the positioning accuracy of either estimator. Both schemes may bene¯t by compensating for wheel slip during braking...|$|E

40|$|Most {{autonomous}} vehicles use GPS {{to determine}} vehicle location and heading. Using GPS for vehicle autonomous driving posts a few challenges. It {{does not look}} {{far ahead of the}} vehicle and requires frequent adjustment of <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading.</b> This results in an unstable control system and increases the chance of unstable driving behavior. Unlike this kind of passive or reactive control system, human drivers look far ahead of the road to determine the road curvature and actively adjust <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> and turning angle in advance. Visual information is essential to enabling this kind of human-like driving behavior for autonomous vehicles and should be an important supplement to the GPS-based system, especially in GPSdenied environments. Road lanes are often curved, making vision-based detection of smooth and continuous curves in front of the vehicle a challenging task. Furthermore, commonly used computer vision algorithms such as edge detectors or Hough transform for line or curvature detection are not robust in changing lighting conditions. This paper presents a vision algorithm designed specifically for detecting and modeling road curvature for humanlike active steering control and heading adjustment for autonomous vehicles. The proposed algorithm has been tested for paved and unpaved road conditions and shown very good results...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic model}} of the lateral system for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed. Different from the traditional steering system, a driver’s reaction model is introduced and meanwhile the disturbance caused by irregularities of road surface is also considered in this paper. Based on the integrated nonlinear dynamic equations, {{it shows that the}} stability of lateral system of EVs is closely related to the heading speed of the vehicle. The lateral system has a Hopf bifurcation when the <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> speed equals a critical value, and then enters into chaos domain along with the increment of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> speed. The unstable behaviors may make EVs spin and even turn over, which are quite harmful to the safety of EVs. As for this issue, a control method is proposed and implemented to protect the vehicle from spinning and thus improve the safety of EVs. The computer simulation is utilized in this paper to analyze nonlinear dynamics, as well as to validate the existence of chaotic motions and the feasibility of the control scheme. From the simulation results, it shows that the chaotic motions existing in the EV lateral dynamics can be suppressed by the proposed control method, and thus the corresponding cornering performance and safety are improved. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Some motor tasks can be completed, quite literally, {{with our}} eyes shut. Most people can touch their nose without looking or reach for an object {{after only a}} brief glance at its location. This {{distinction}} leads {{to one of the}} defining questions of movement control: is information gleaned prior to starting the movement sufficient to complete the task (open loop), or is feedback about the progress of the movement required (closed loop) ? One task that has commanded considerable interest in the literature over the years is that of steering a vehicle, in particular lane-correction and lane-changing tasks. Recent work has suggested that this type of task can proceed in a fundamentally open loop manner [1 and 2], with feedback mainly serving to correct minor, accumulating errors. This paper reevaluates the conclusions of these studies by conducting a new set of experiments in a driving simulator. We demonstrate that, in fact, drivers rely on regular visual feedback, even during the well-practiced steering task of lane changing. Without feedback, drivers fail to initiate the return phase of the maneuver, resulting in systematic errors in final heading. The results provide new insight into the control of <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading,</b> suggesting that drivers employ a simple policy of “turn and see,” with only limited understanding of the relationship between steering angle and <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading...</b>|$|E

This bound can be used to guarantee collision avoidance with fixed lateral obstacles. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Master of Science In Environmental Systems: Mathematical Modeling, 2004. Patricia O. McConkey Outstanding Thesis Award, 2005 Landmines are {{currently}} being cleared using unmanned vehicles. There {{is a need for}} verification of the ground covered by a vehicle???s landmine clearing apparatus to ensure clearance of the entire minefield. Recent advancements in satellite positioning technology now make accurate verification possible. In this project we will model the ground covered by the clearance apparatus of a landmine clearance vehicle to a specified confidence level using real-time kinematic differential GPS and inertial sensing technologies. A two-dimensional probability density function of the ground covered by the front flail will be developed. The probability density function is intended to be a main component in a real-time two-dimensional mapping application for tracking the ground covered by a landmine clearance vehicle. It will be a function of the following: ??? Flail size (length and width) ??? Position of the flail in relation to the GPS antenna ??? GPS antenna position ??? GPS antenna position error ??? <b>Vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> ??? <b>Vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> error This function relates to the probability a point was covered when given the estimated vehicle state by an INS/GPS system. A method for implementing the probability density function into software is explained. The viability of the software implementation is then tested through an experiment conducted using a prototype landmine clearance vehicle. Results of the experiment show that the implementation is effective at limiting both Type I and Type II errors...|$|E

A new non-parametric learning technique is presented to generate a mobility representation where maximum feasible speed is used as a criterion to classify the world. The inputs to the algorithm are terrain gradients derived from an elevation map and past observations of wheel slip. It is argued that such a representation can aid in path planning with improved selection of <b>vehicle</b> <b>heading</b> and operating velocity in off-road slopes. Results of mobility map generation and its benefits to path planning are shown. I...|$|E
