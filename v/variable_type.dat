5|$|AK Pyxidis is a {{red giant}} of {{spectral}} type M5III and semi-regular variable that varies between magnitudes 6.09 and 6.51. Its pulsations take place over multiple periods simultaneously of 55.5, 57.9, 86.7, 162.9 and 232.6 days. UZ Pyxidis is another semi-regular variable red giant, this time a carbon star, that is around 3560 times as luminous as the Sun with a surface temperature of 3482 K, located some 2116 light-years away from Earth. It varies between magnitudes 6.99 and 7.83 over 159 days. VY Pyxidis is a BL Herculis <b>variable</b> (<b>type</b> II Cepheid), ranging between apparent magnitudes 7.13 and 7.40 {{over a period of}} 1.24 days. Located around 650 light-years distant, it shines with a luminosity approximately 45 times that of the Sun.|$|E
