40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts {{are one of}} {{the vital}} part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. <b>Valve</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method.

Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E
