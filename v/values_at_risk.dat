Flood peaks increase more rapidly with increases in rainfall intensity above a threshold value for the maximum 30 min intensity of approximately 10 mm per hour.

40|$|Analysis of {{the risks}} of sea-level rise favours {{conventionally}} measured metrics such as the area of land that may be subsumed, the numbers of properties at risk, and the capital values of assets at risk. Despite this, {{it is clear that}} there exist many less material but no less important <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from sea-level rise. This paper re-theorises these multifarious social <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from sea-level rise, by explaining their diverse nature, and grounding them in the everyday practices of people living in coastal places. It is informed by a review and analysis of research on social values from within the fields of social impact assessment, human geography, psychology, decision analysis, and climate change adaptation. From this we propose that it is the ‘lived values’ of coastal places that are most at risk from sea-level rise. We then offer a framework that groups these lived values into five types: those that are physiological in nature, and those that relate to issues of security, belonging, esteem, and self-actualisation. This framework of lived <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> from sea-level rise can guide empirical research investigating the social impacts of sea-level rise, as well as the impacts of actions to adapt to sea-level rise. It also offers a basis for identifying the distribution of related social outcomes across populations exposed to sea-level rise or sea-level rise policies. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|The {{levels of}} {{participation}} in various types of outdoor recreation in forested areas are substantial. Studies have shown that over 18. 5 million days, representing approximately 80 % of recreation user days, were spent by Canadians in recreational activities in forested lands. Furthermore, recreation has significant social and economic value that should be reflected in management decisions if sustainable forest management is to be achieved. The importance of recreation in forests {{has resulted in the}} selection of measures of recreation participation as one of the relevant indicators of sustainable forest management reporting in Canada. This suggests that recreation areas should be {{an important component of the}} values of forest at risk due to loss from wildfire. However, the presence of recreationists, who are considered to be the highest <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk,</b> dispersed on the fire prone landscape presents some issues for fire management agencies. These issues include the possibility of recreationists perishing in a wildfire and/or the possibility of fire starts as a result of recreation activities which are projected to increase into the future. For fire management agencies that strive to suppress all wildfires, the latter issue is particularly challenging when faced with resource constraints. Thus, a move away from suppression of all wildfires to suppression based on protecting highest <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> is needed. An explicit incorporation of recreation values is advantageous in that these values are closely linked to the presence of recreationists. Therefore, during fire events, directing resources to high value recreation areas fulfill a fire management goal of protecting highest <b>values</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> as well as identifying areas of the landscape where the suppression efforts are to be directed.

In this paper, we analyze the problem of how a single economic risk figure for the Value at Risk of a hypothetical portfolio composed of different commercial banks might be obtained for a supervisor. Using the daily profits and losses and the daily Value at Risk figures of twelve German banks for the period from 2001 to 2003, we estimate the Value at Risk of the entire portfolio. We assume a reduced-form model and neglect the effects of a potential bankruptcy of one of the banks. We analyze different models for the cross-correlation of the banks? profits and losses. In an empirical study, we apply backtesting methods to determine which aggregation model leads to the best out-of-sample estimates for the portfolio's economic risk figure.

There are many approaches to computing <b>value</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> alongside the extreme value method. One fundamental problem the manager of risk face is “what is the optimal choice of <b>value</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> estimator that will best predict the risk?” This implies that choosing an approach to best predict <b>value</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> is challenging. This study proposed a method of estimating <b>value</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> using the two-dimensional inhomogeneous Poisson model. An extreme value theory method {{that is based on}} the Peak Over Threshold (POT). The method takes into consideration time varying parameters through some explanatory variables. The study also shows how well theoretical model fit real financial data. The data used is the daily log return of the OMX Hex Index from the period 1990 to 2014. From the data we show empirically that the OMX Hex Index obeys a Fréchet distribution. The explanatory variables for the study are GARCH volatilities, annual trend and quarter dummies. The explanatory variables are all available at time t- 1. With the help of the fitted models we adopt the two-dimensional inhomogeneous Poisson model approach to estimating <b>value</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> over the two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson model and other classical or traditional methods, and find that this better predict <b>value</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> estimates...|$|R
