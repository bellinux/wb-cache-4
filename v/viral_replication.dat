Further, the lectin has antiviral properties: it inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus enzyme reverse transcriptase. Other studies suggest that B.edulis also has antiviral activity against Vaccinia virus and tobacco mosaic virus grown in culture.

5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid <b>viral</b> <b>replication,</b> leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for <b>viral</b> <b>replication.</b>|$|E
5|$|During <b>viral</b> <b>replication,</b> the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the virus genome, while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
40|$|At least 10 {{distinct}} early virus-induced polypeptides were synthesized within 0 to 6 h {{after infection}} of permissive cells with cytomegalovirus. These virus-induced polypeptides were synthesized before and independently of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> A {{majority of these}} early virus-induced polypeptides were also synthesized in nonpermissive cells, which do not permit <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> The virus-induced polypeptides synthesized before <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> were hypothesized to be nonstructural proteins coded for by the cytomegalovirus genome. Their synthesis {{was found to be}} a sequential process, since three proteins preceded the synthesis of the others. Synthesis of all early cytomegalovirus-induced proteins was a transient process; the proteins reached their highest molar ratios before the onset of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> Late <b>viral</b> proteins were synthesized {{at the time of the}} onset of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication,</b> which was approximately 15 h after infection. Their synthesis was continuous and increased in molar ratios with the accumulation of newly synthesized viral DNA in the cells. The presence of the amino acid analog canavanine or azetadine during the early stage of infection suppressed <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication.</b> The amount of viral DNA synthesis was directly correlated to the relative amount of late viral protein synthesis.

40|$|Efficient {{translation}} of poliovirus (PV) RNA in uninfected HeLa cell extracts generates {{all of the}} viral proteins required to carry out <b>viral</b> RNA <b>replication</b> and encapsidation and to produce infectious virus in vitro. In infected cells, <b>viral</b> RNA <b>replication</b> occurs in ribonucleoprotein complexes associated with clusters of vesicles that are formed from preexisting intracellular organelles, which serve as a scaffold for the <b>viral</b> RNA <b>replication</b> complex. In this study, we have examined the role of membranes in <b>viral</b> RNA <b>replication</b> in vitro. Electron microscopic and biochemical examination of extracts actively engaged in <b>viral</b> RNA <b>replication</b> failed to reveal {{a significant increase in}} vesicular membrane structures or the protective aggregation of vesicles observed in PV-infected cells. <b>Viral,</b> nonstructural <b>replication</b> proteins, however, bind to heterogeneous membrane fragments in the extract. Treatment of the extracts with nonionic detergents, a membrane-altering inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis (cerulenin), or an inhibitor of intracellular membrane trafficking (brefeldin A) prevents the formation of active replication complexes in vitro, under conditions in which polyprotein synthesis and processing occur normally. Under all three of these conditions, synthesis of uridylylated VPg to form the primer for initiation of viral RNA synthesis, as well as subsequent <b>viral</b> RNA <b>replication,</b> was inhibited. Thus, although organized membranous structures morphologically similar to the vesicles observed in infected cells do not appear to form in vitro, intact membranes are required for viral RNA synthesis, including the first step of forming the uridylylated VPg primer for RNA chain elongation...|$|R
40|$|Herpesviral transcription, DNA synthesis, and capsid {{assembly}} {{occur within}} the infected cell nucleus. To further define the spatial relationship among these processes, we {{have examined the}} intranuclear distributions of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication,</b> gene regulatory, and capsid proteins using dual label immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. We observed {{that several of the}} <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> proteins localize preferentially to punctate structures within replication compartments while the major transcriptional activator, ICP 4, and the ICP 27 regulatory protein show a more diffuse distribution within <b>replication</b> compartments. The <b>viral</b> proteins that show a punctate distribution in replication compartments redistribute from these compartments to prereplicative sites when <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is inhibited, whereas viral proteins that show a diffuse distribution remain within <b>replication</b> compartments when <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> is inhibited. Thus the sites of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> and late transcription appear to be distinct but codistribute within the boundaries of replication compartments.

However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} likely to respond than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces <b>viral</b> <b>replication</b> in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
5|$|Herpes {{antiviral}} therapy {{began in}} the early 1960s with the experimental use of medications that interfered with <b>viral</b> <b>replication</b> called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) inhibitors. The original use was against normally fatal or debilitating illnesses such as adult encephalitis, keratitis, in immunocompromised (transplant) patients, or disseminated herpes zoster. The original compounds used were 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, AKA idoxuridine, IUdR, or(IDU) and 1-β-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine or ara-C, later marketed under the name cytosar or cytorabine. The usage expanded to include topical treatment of herpes simplex, zoster, and varicella. Some trials combined different antivirals with differing results. The introduction of 9-β-D-arabinofuranosyladenine, (ara-A or vidarabine), considerably less toxic than ara-C, in the mid-1970s, heralded the way for the beginning of regular neonatal antiviral treatment. Vidarabine was the first systemically administered antiviral medication with activity against HSV for which therapeutic efficacy outweighed toxicity for the management of life-threatening HSV disease. Intravenous vidarabine was licensed for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1977. Other experimental antivirals of that period included: heparin, trifluorothymidine (TFT), Ribivarin, interferon, Virazole, and 5-methoxymethyl-2'-deoxyuridine (MMUdR). The introduction of 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)guanine, AKA acyclovir, in the late 1970s raised antiviral treatment another notch and led to vidarabine vs. acyclovir trials in the late 1980s. The lower toxicity and ease of administration over vidarabine has led to acyclovir becoming the drug of choice for herpes treatment after it was licensed by the FDA in 1998. Another advantage in the treatment of neonatal herpes included greater reductions in mortality and morbidity with increased dosages, which did not occur when compared with increased dosages of vidarabine. However, acyclovir seems to inhibit antibody response, and newborns on acyclovir antiviral treatment experienced a slower rise in antibody titer than those on vidarabine.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{replication}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is dependent on miR-122 expression. miR-122 regulates HCV by binding directly to two adjacent sites close to the 5' end of HCV RNA. Although these experiments were conducted using genotype 1a and 1b HCV RNA, the miR-122 binding sites are highly conserved across different genotypes, and miR-122 is also required for replication of infectious type 2a HCV. As miRNAs generally function to repress gene expression by binding to 3'UTR sites, this positive regulation of <b>viral</b> <b>replication</b> via a 5'UTR represents a novel function for miR-122. The mechanism of regulation is not yet clear. miR-122 stimulates translation of HCV RNA, but not to a sufficient extent to explain its effects on <b>viral</b> <b>replication,</b> indicating that a second stage of the <b>viral</b> <b>replication</b> cycle must also be regulated.|$|E

Efficient B 19 V replication also requires hypoxic conditions, which upregulate the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT 5) pathway, and phosphorylated STAT 5 is essential for virus replication. In this study, our results revealed direct involvement of STAT 5 in B 19 V DNA replication. Consensus STAT 5 -binding elements were identified adjacent to the NS 1 -binding element within the minimal origins of <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> in the B 19 V genome. Phosphorylated STAT 5 specifically interacted with <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> origins both in vivo and in vitro, and was actively recruited within the <b>viral</b> DNA <b>replication</b> centers.
