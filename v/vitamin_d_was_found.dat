40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles <b>were</b> <b>found</b> for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews <b>were</b> used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can <b>be</b> explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies on <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls.

[Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to measure bone mineral density, serum and urinary bone {{turn-over}} parameters, and to evaluate the influence of demographic and genetic factors on these parameters in FMF patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-seven attack-free patients who were diagnosed with FMF (in accordance with Tel Hashomer criteria) were recruited at outpatient rheumatology clinics. We investigated whether there were any differences between the FMF patients and a control group in terms of lumbar and femur bone mineral density (BMD), standard deviation scores (Z scores and T scores) and bone markers. [Results] In terms of the median val-ues of lumbar BMD (p = 0. 21), lumbar T (p = 0. 098) and Z (p = 0. 109) scores, femoral neck BMD, femoral T and Z scores and total femur BMD, T (p = 0. 788) and Z scores, there were no significant differences.

40|$|Aim: Bone {{disorders}} such as osteopenia or osteoporosis are {{the most}} common clinical manifestations seen in sickle cell disease (SCD) with a high of morbidity. There are many reasons, including vitamin D deficiency for the appearance of bone problems. In the present study we aimed to evaluate osteopathy in patients with SCD using bone mineral densitometry (BMD) and biochemical indices. Material and Method: 61 patients (29 female, 32 male) were included in the study. The age, gender, and biochemical parameters with BMD were evaluated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry from lumbar vertebrae. According to Z scores, [- 2] was considered as osteoporosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the factors influencing BMD. Results: There were a total of 61 SCD patients. The average age was 21. 06 ± 5. 06 (15 - 27) years and the mean BMI was 19. 15 ± 2. 98 kg/m 2. 23 patients were osteopenic (11 female, 12 male) (37. 7 %) and 26 were osteoporotic (12 female, 13 male) (44. 3 %).

40|$|In {{the search}} for a simple method of {{assessing}} the therapeutic efficacy of sodium fluoride, a prospective study of vertebral radiography during such treatment was carried out. Treatment of osteoporosis with sodium fluoride, calcium and <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to enhance the vertical markings of the vertebral trabecular pattern in 69 % of patients. This response was graded 1 (failure), 2 (good) and 3 (excellent); Grade 2 or 3 was attained after a mean treatment period of 31. 7 months. Subsequent analysis of the vertebral fracture rate revealed that new vertebral fractures had occurred only in patients with Grade 1 and not in those with Grade 2 or 3. We recommend that treatment should aim at increasing the vertebral trabecular pattern to Grade 2 or 3 and that the duration of therapy should be approximately 30 months. Osteoporosis is characterised by a reduction in bone mass which results in spontaneous fractures. The therapeutic goal is a reduction in the fracture rate. Ideally this is attained by increasing bone mass. This is difficult to achieve since most therapeutic measures merely slow the rate of bone loss.

40|$|The {{neonatal}} immune {{environment and}} the events that occur during this time have profound effects for the adult period. While protective immune responses can develop, the neonatal immune system, particularly the skin immune system (SIS), tends to promote tolerance. With this information we undertook {{a number of studies}} to identify unique aspects of skin during the neonatal period. Proteomics revealed proteins uniquely expressed in neonatal, but not adult, skin (e. g. Stefin A, peroxiredoxins) and these may have implications in the development of SIS. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to have a modulating role on SIS and this was apparent from the early neonatal period. Exposure of the neonatal skin to UV radiation altered the microenvironment resulting in the generation of regulatory T cells, which persisted in adult life.

NAFLD was diagnosed on the basis of typical ultrasonographic findings and a history of alcohol consumption. Results:The subjects were aged 51. 7 ± 10. 3 years (mean±SD) and 54. 7 % were female. NAFLD showed a significant inverse correlation with the vitamin D level after adjusting for age and sex [odds ratio (OR) = 0. 85, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 75 – 0. 96]. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of NAFLD decreased steadily with increasing vitamin D level [OR= 0. 74, 95 % CI= 0. 60 – 0. 90, lowest quintile (≤ 14. 4 ng/mL) vs highest quintile (≥ 28. 9 ng/mL), p for trend 20 ng/mL) [OR= 0. 86, 95 % CI= 0. 75 - 0. 99] and the quintiles of the vitamin D level in a dose-dependent manner (p for trend= 0. 001).

Sixty adult male rats were divided into control and diabetic groups. Each was further subdivided into sedentary and exercised subgroups.

The exercised subgroups underwent swimming for 60 min, 5 {{times a week for}} 4 weeks. Serum glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipids, vitamin D and tissue Vitamin D receptors (VDR) were evaluated. Significant increase in serum glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in sedentary diabetic rats was detected. On the other hand, high density lipoprotein (HDL), free fatty acids, serum vitamin D and pancreatic, adipose, and muscular VDR showed a significant decrease in the same group.

Aim of the study: The aim of the study was the analysis of the vitamin D and calcium diet supply in relation to the bone status assessed with Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) in growing children. Material and methods: The study comprised 643 pupils (384 girls and 259 boys) at the age 9 - 13 years from primary schools in Łódź. The medium daily consumption of vitamin D and calcium was estimated with the computer program Dieta 2. In all children the QUS was performed. Results: Extreme deficiency of <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the diet of nearly all examined children (in 96, 7 % schoolgirls and 95, 7 % schoolboys). Girls consumed on average 25, 5 % of recommended values, boys 33, 3 %. Considerable deficiency of diet calcium was observed in 92 % schoolgirls and 81, 9 % of schoolboys. The medium daily consumption of calcium was higher than vitamin D and reached 59, 2 % of recommended values in girls and 66, 2 % in boys. In 48 % of children an decrease of {{at least one of the}} QUS parameters was observed. The statistical analysis showed positive, significant correlation between QUS parameters and calcium consumption, it was not observed for vitamin D. Conclusions: 1. The deficiency of diet vitamin D and calcium is common in children in Łódź. 2. The extremely low supply of diet vitamin D does not meet the recommended values. 3. The lowering of the QUS parameters observed in 48 % of children indicates for worse bone mineralization and bone quality. 4. The results of this study indicate for the necessity of changes in nutritional habits of children and adolescence and if it is not possible the supplementation of vitamin D and calcium...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : The {{prevalence}} of vitamin D deficiency {{has increased in}} India. Recently there have been plenty of research studies pointing to the essentiality of vitamin D beyond bone health. Type 2 diabetes is also {{found to be more}} prevalent in individuals with hypovita minosis D. AIM: To evaluate the levels of vitamin D in type 2 diabetic patients and age matched healthy controls in South Indian population and also to correlate vitamin D level with fasting plasma glucose level and lipid profile in type 2 diabetic patient s. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross - sectional study include d 51 type 2 diabetic patients and 51 healthy controls. Estimation of Fasting blood glucose and lipid profile was done in Beckmann - Coulter auto analyzer using standard kits. Vitamin D was estimated by Chemiluminescent Immuno Assay (C. L. I. A.) Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 21 software. RESULTS: The vitamin D level was significantly lower in the diabetic patients. The fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low densi ty lipoproteins and very low density lipoproteins were increased in patients with vitamin D deficiency (i. e. vitamin D < 20 ng/ml) but the increase was statistically significant only in fasting blood glucose and triglycerides(p< 0. 01). The level of high den sity lipoproteins was statistically significantly lower in the vitamin D deficient group (p< 0. 01). By Pearson’s correlation <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> to be negatively correlated significantly (p value < 0. 01) with fasting blood sugar and triglycerides and was fo und to be positively correlated significantly (p value < 0. 01) with HDL. CONCLUSION: There is high {{prevalence of}} Vitamin D deficiency in type 2 diabetic patients. These individuals have also been proved to have atherogenic dyslipidemia that may lead to vasc ular complications. Whether supplementing diabetic patients with vitamin D helps in reducing further complications is yet to be proved by interventional studies...|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 32 {{patients}} with Plasmodium falciparum malaria were studied. Of these, 23 had benign infections, and 9 had typical cerebral malaria. Cryoglobulins, {{circulating immune complexes}} detected by a C 1 q-binding assay, and hypocomplementemia <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in eight of nine patients with cerebral malaria. Raised levels of complement component 3 breakdown products (C 3 <b>d)</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> in the seven patients tested. Peak levels of circulating immune complexes and C 3 <b>d</b> <b>were</b> associated with thrombocytopenia. In contrast, in patients with benign Plasmodium falciparum malaria, cryoglobulins and circulating immune complexes <b>were</b> <b>found</b> only in 3 of 23 patients. Similarly, hypocomplementemia was detected only in 5 of 23 patients. These observations suggest that {{the intensity of the}} immune response and of the associated complement activation may be important factors in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria...|$|R
40|$|Photometric {{observations}} of the Seyfert Sextet (VV 115) are analyzed. Apparent integrated magnitudes are derived relative to the sky brightness, and isophotal maps are given for the field.
