50|$|The Russian {{military}} has established accuracy standards that the SVD and its corresponding sniper grade ammunition have to meet. Manufacturers must perform firing tests to check if the rifles and sniper grade ammunition fulfill these standards. To comply to the standards, the SVD rifle with 7N1 sniper cartridges may not produce more than 1.24 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> with 240 mm twist rate barrels {{and no more}} than 1.04 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> with 320 mm twist rate barrels. When using standard grade 57-N-323S cartridges, the accuracy of the SVD is reduced to 2.21 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread.</b> The extreme vertical spreads for the SVD are established by shooting 5-shot groups at 300 m range. The accuracy requirements demanded of the SVD with sniper grade ammunition are similar to the American M24 Sniper Weapon System with M118SB cartridges (1.18 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread)</b> and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System with M118LR ammunition (1.27 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread).</b>|$|E

50|$|A Ratio spread is a complex, multileg options {{position}} {{that is a}} variation of a <b>vertical</b> <b>spread.</b> Like a vertical, the ratio spread involves buying and selling options on the same underlying security with different strike prices and the same expiration date. Unlike a <b>vertical</b> <b>spread,</b> a number of option contracts sold is not equal {{to a number of}} contracts bought. An unequal number of options contracts gives this spread certain unique properties compared to a regular <b>vertical</b> <b>spread.</b> A typical ratio spread would be where twice as much option contracts are sold, thus forming a 1:2 ratio.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{practical}} advantages of an iron condor over a single <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> (a put spread or call spread), is that the initial and maintenance margin requirements for the iron condor are often {{the same as the}} margin requirements for a single <b>vertical</b> <b>spread,</b> yet the iron condor offers the profit potential of two net credit premiums instead of only one.

40|$|It {{is an open}} {{question}} whether turbulent mixing across density surfaces is sufficiently large to play a dominant role in closing the deep branch of the ocean meridional overturning circulation. The diapycnal and isopycnal mixing experiment in the Southern Ocean found the turbulent diffusivity inferred from the <b>vertical</b> <b>spreading</b> of a tracer to be an order of magnitude larger than that inferred from the microstructure profiles at the mean tracer depth of 1, 500 [*]m in the Drake Passage. Using a high-resolution ocean model, it is shown that the fast <b>vertical</b> <b>spreading</b> of tracer occurs when it comes in contact with mixing hotspots over rough topography. The sparsity of such hotspots is made up for by enhanced tracer residence time in their vicinity due to diffusion toward weak bottom flows. The increased tracer residence time may explain the large vertical fluxes of heat and salt required to close the abyssal circulation. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (OCE- 1233832...|$|R
