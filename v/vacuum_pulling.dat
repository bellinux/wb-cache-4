The combination of a narrow depth of focus, unusually thin films, a relatively large film gate and rapidly advancing films can produce imagery with less than optimum resolution across or within individual frames. A vacuum platen and an additional styrene pressure plate were fitted to a motorized 35 mm camera {{in an effort to}} insure the film lies flat. Continuous <b>vacuum</b> <b>pulling</b> mechanisms, suction and induction, were evaluated. Each system 2 ̆ 7 s simplicity, portability and statistically analyzed imagery were assessed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assess a {{prototype}} inspiratory impedance threshold valve (ITV) {{designed to enhance}} vital organ circulation during standard and active compression/decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). BACKGROUND: The ITV attaches to commonly used airway assist devices and decreases intrathoracic pressure during the decompression (chest recoil) phase of CPR by creating a vacuum within the thorax, which increases venous {{blood flow to the}} heart and thus increases coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to the brain. METHODS: The evaluation included laboratory bench testing, according to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines, and performance testing with pigs in cardiac arrest. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>pull</b> test was developed to determine the inspiratory impedance under various inspiratory flow conditions. RESULTS: The valve passed all minimum ASTM and ISO performance tests. During cardiac arrest in pigs the ITV decreased intrathoracic pressures by 6 – 8 mm Hg during the decompression phase. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>pull</b> test demonstrated that the prototype ITV functioned as intended. CONCLUSIONS: The prototype ITV passed all performance testing recommended by international guidelines and functioned effectively as intended for use. The animal study results, when combined with recent clinical data, suggest that an ITV inspiratory cracking pressure of 12 cm H 2 O should be sufficient to decrease intrathoracic pressure during the decom-pression phase of standard CPR. Clinical studies are now underway. Key words: cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, inspiratory impedance threshold valve, ventricular fibrillation, active compression/decompression, CPR.

This work evaluated forming capability with respect to surface quality of the composite assembly. Improved drawability was achieved with increasing temperature. However, this yielded in print-through of the fibers through the film. Five process parameters (temperature, mold type, time, fiber reinforcements, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pull),</b> were optimized through sequential experimentation using analysis of variance (ANOVA) in terms of print-through, as the response variable. Statistical validation indicated minimal print-through at a forming temperature of 147 degrees C. However, at this temperature formability of the film was limited to subtle contours. At 160 degrees C, the forming capability of the composite assembly was maximized, yet surface finishes exhibited high print-through.

50|$|The initial {{process begins}} with {{the making of the}} helmet shell using a vacuum forming machine and a metal mould. A sheet of black {{fortified}} plastic is heated and then lowered over the mould, where a <b>vacuum</b> <b>pulls</b> the plastic into shape over the mould. Once hardened instantly, a rubber mallet is used to release the plastic from the mould so that the excess plastic around brim of the helmet can be trimmed with a bandsaw and sanded. The helmet's fabric covers are made out of water-repellent wool that are cut in halves and stitched together to give the helmet a distinctive centred, front-to-back seam. Moving down the line of production, glue is applied to both the inside of the fabric cover and the outside surface of the helmet shell, the fabric cover is then steamed and stretched tightly over the shell to prevent buckling. A wooden tool is carefully used to smooth away any air bubbles as well as to ensure the fabric cover is in full contact with the helmet shell; excess fabric is cut away.|$|R
50|$|For simple {{pieces of}} which {{relatively}} few copies are needed (1-2 per day), a vacuum bag can be used.

50|$|Vacuum {{pressure}} casting (VPC) uses gas pressure and a vacuum {{to improve the}} quality of the casting and minimize porosity. Typically VPC machines consist of an upper and a lower chamber—the upper chamber, or melting chamber, housing the crucible, and the lower casting chamber housing the investment mould. Both chambers are connected via a small hole containing a stopper. A <b>vacuum</b> is <b>pulled</b> in the lower chamber, while pressure is applied in the upper, and then the stopper is removed.

50|$|Newcomen's design {{used some}} {{elements}} of earlier concepts. Like the Savery design, Newcomen's engine used steam, cooled with water, to create a vacuum. Unlike Savery's pump, however, Newcomen used the <b>vacuum</b> to <b>pull</b> on a piston instead of pulling on water directly. The {{upper end of the}} cylinder was open to the atmospheric pressure, and when the vacuum formed, the atmospheric pressure above the piston pushed it down into the cylinder.

40|$|Automated {{watering}} systems {{provide a}} reliable source of ad libitum water to animal cages. Our facility uses an automated water delivery system to support approximately 95 % of the housed population (approximately 14, 000 mouse cages). Drinking valve failure rates from 2002 through 2006 never exceeded the manufacturer standard of 0. 1 % total failure, based on monthly cage census {{and the number}} of floods. In 2007, we noted an increase in both flooding and cases of clinical dehydration in our mouse population. Using manufacturer's specifications for a water flow rate of 25 to 50 mL/min, we initiated a wide-scale screening of all valves used. During a 4 -mo period, approximately 17, 000 valves were assessed, of which 2200 failed according to scoring criteria (12. 9 % overall; 7. 2 % low flow; 1. 6 % no flow; 4. 1 % leaky). Factors leading to valve failures included residual metal shavings, silicone flash, introduced debris or bedding, and (most common) distortion of the autoclave-rated internal diaphragm and O-ring. Further evaluation revealed that despite normal autoclave conditions of heat, pressure, and steam, an extreme negative <b>vacuum</b> <b>pull</b> caused the valves’ internal silicone components (diaphragm and O-ring) to become distorted and water-permeable. Normal flow rate often returned after a ‘drying out’ period, but components then reabsorbed water while on the animal rack or during subsequent autoclave cycles to revert to a variable flow condition. On the basis of our findings, we recalibrated autoclaves and initiated a preventative maintenance program to mitigate the risk of future valve failure...|$|R

40|$|A {{partnership}} between MagCorp and Air Liquide {{was made to}} develop and test the potential of reducing sulfur hexafluoride emissions from magnesium casting operations. Air Liquide has developed the Floxal SF 6 Recycle Process, which is capable of capturing dilute SF 6 in the parts per million (ppm) range from casting system exhaust and recycling it as a concentrated feed gas in percentage levels. This process utilizes proprietary membrane technology to separate the SF 6 from air in four stages: pretreatment, compression, separation, and recycling. In order to benchmark the process, the test program was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 was a pre-test visit, Phase 2 was an on-site analytical campaign to characterize the emissions of the casting process and provide a mass balance on the SF 6, and Phase 3 was a second analytical campaign to measure {{the performance of the}} Floxal SF 6 Recovery Unit while it operated. Phase 2 had the largest impact for the recovery system, because the levels of corrosive byproducts and particulate affected the design of the pretreatment. Also, the amount of <b>vacuum</b> <b>pulled</b> from the casting system had to be optimized with the makeup rate so it would not deplete the SF 6 atmosphere. Preliminary results show that the Floxal Recovery Unit, after one month of service, had a 90 % recovery or better of SF 6 supplied to the unit. The Floxal unit produced concentrations of SF 6 in the permeate at approximately 34 ppm, while the product was approximately 0. 4 %. The machine, on average, increased the concentration of the diluted SF 6 from the casting system 10 times. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{inertial}} supercharging {{effect from}} two-stroke engines {{is the result}} of the design of an expansion chamber in the two-stroke exhaust system. Its carefully designed shape and length uses the expanding exhaust gasses to create a <b>vacuum</b> that <b>pulls</b> more exhaust gases (and some of the intake gasses) out of the engine. This is immediately followed by a reflected pressure wave timed to force the extra intake gasses back into the cylinder, thus achieving a greater mass of air/fuel mix in the combustion chamber than possible with conventional induction & exhaust scavenging methods. Expansion chambers only work well at a narrow engine speed range which is why two stroke engines are referred to as having a [...] "powerband". Since the early eighties exhaust powervalves have been developed which have the effect of altering the timing and/or volume of the expansion chamber, greatly improving the spread of power of high output two stroke engines.|$|R
