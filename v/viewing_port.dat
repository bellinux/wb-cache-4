5000|$|On 26 March 2012 (local time), Canadian film {{director}} James Cameron made a solo manned descent in the DSV Deepsea Challenger {{to the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep.At approximately 05:15 ChST on 26 March (19:15 UTC on 25 March), the descent began.At 07:52 ChST (21:52 UTC), Deepsea Challenger arrived at the bottom. The descent lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes and the recorded depth was 10898.4 m when Deepsea Challenger touched down.Cameron had planned to spend about six hours near the ocean floor exploring but decided to start the ascent to the surface after only 2 hours and 34 minutes. [...] The time on the bottom was shortened because a hydraulic fluid leak in the lines controlling the manipulator arm obscured the visibility out the only <b>viewing</b> <b>port.</b> It also caused the loss of the submersible's starboard thrusters. [...] At around 12:00 ChST (02:00 UTC on 26 March), the Deepsea Challenger website says the sub resurfaced after a 90-minute ascent, although Paul Allen's tweets indicate the ascent took only about 67 minutes.During a post-dive press conference Cameron said: [...] "I landed on a very soft, almost gelatinous flat plain. Once I got my bearings, I drove across it for quite a distance ... and finally worked my way up the slope." [...] The whole time, Cameron said, he didn't see any fish, or any living creatures more than an inch (2.5 cm) long: [...] "The only free swimmers I saw were small amphipods"—shrimplike bottom-feeders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} the beam emission spectroscopy (BES) to Heliotron J, having the nonsymmetrical helical-magnetic-axis configuration. The spectral and spatial profile of the beam emission has been estimated by the numerical calculation taking the collisional excitation processes between plasmas (electrons/ions) and beam atoms. Two sets of the sightlines with good spatial resolution are presented. One is the optimized viewing chords which have 20 sightlines and observe the whole plasma region with the spatial resolution Δρ less than ± 0. 055 using the newly designed <b>viewing</b> <b>port.</b> The other is 15 sightlines from the present <b>viewing</b> <b>port</b> of Heliotron J for the preliminary measurement to discuss the feasibility of the density fluctuation measurement by BES. The beam emission has been measured by a monochromator with a CCD camera. A good consistency has been obtained between the spectral profiles of the beam emission measured by the monochromator and the beam emission spectrum deduced by the model calculation. An avalanche photodiode with an interference filter system was also used to evaluate the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the beam emission in the present experimental setup. The modification of the optical system is being planned to improve the S/N ratio, which will enable us to estimate the density fluctuation in Heliotron J...|$|E
