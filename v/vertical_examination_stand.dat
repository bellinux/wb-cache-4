40|$|Abstract: Studies {{of normal}} fault {{development}} {{in space and}} time by X-ray tomography imaged analogue modelling suggest that different processes occur during the propagation of these faults. The conceptual model proposed istinguishes two types of propagation: horizontal and <b>vertical.</b> <b>Examination</b> of horizontal propagation reveals two separate levels of organization. Firstly, an isolated fault segment develops, alternately over time, by radial propagation and by linkage with secondary fault segments (tip faults) arising atthe end of the main fault segment (parent fault). These are arranged either in an en echelon or stepwise pattern. Secondly, isolated faults evolve by linkage. Two isolated faults connect up via a relay fault area which arises inthe relay zone of the two isolated faults. The relaY faults develop by radial propagation and link with the two major faults. Undulating fault traces result from propagation by tip-to-parent fault segment linkage or isolated-to-isolated fault linkage. Upward and downward vertical propagation are identified and exhibit equivalent propaga-tion processes to those involved in horizontal propagation. Space-time sequences combining horizontal and vertical propagations over time suggest that the evolution of normal faults observed in space also reflects their evolution over time...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} {{analyze the}} radiation doses delivered to patients undergoing fluoroscopy examinations {{in terms of}} the skin dose and the dose-area product (DAP). Materials and Methods: The subjects of this study were patients who underwent fluoroscopy examinations at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa during the period August 2007 to March 2008. The skin dose and dose-area product values were obtained from a built-in DAP-meter installed on a digital Philips Medical Systems MultiDiagnost Eleva fluoroscopy unit. The following cases were analyzed namely barium swallow, barium meal, barium enema, hexabrix swallow, gastrografin meal, voiding cystourethrogram, fistulogram, myelogram, nephrostomy and loopogram. Results: An analysis of three hundred and thirty one examinations is presented. From the recorded data the following quantities were deduced: the mean- and range of the skin doses and DAPs, mean screening time and mean fluoroscopy duration. An analysis of the screening time for the various examinations showed a weak correlation (r = 0. 59) between skin dose and screening time, while a poor correlation (r = 0. 42) was deduced between DAP reading and screening time. Conclusion: There is a wide spread in the radiation doses registered for any one given type of examination. The large variability in the radiation dose delivered proves that fluoroscopic <b>examinations</b> <b>stand</b> to gain from dose optimization. The usefulness and potential use of DAP meters with regards to dose optimization in radiology is shown. In line with efforts to optimize dose from diagnostic radiography examinations the authors recommend the establishment of diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) in South Africa for the most frequent examinations in general radiography, fluoroscopy, mammography and computed tomography.
