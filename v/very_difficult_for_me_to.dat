500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Song Remains The Same {{is not a}} great film, but there's {{no point}} in making excuses. [...] It's just a {{reasonably}} honest statement of where we were at that particular time. [...] It's <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> watch it now, but I'd like to see it in a year's time just to see how it stands up.|$|E
2500|$|Dylan {{talked about}} his {{difficulty}} at the recording sessions {{in an interview with}} Guitar World magazine. [...] "I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it's <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> think that I'm going to eclipse anything I've ever done before. I get bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes and this and that." [...] In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.|$|E

I used to think life was made <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because besides being poor, I had a father who was very mad at me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|To {{surrender}} {{was made}} <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> by Eugene Field, who had publicly celebrated me as [...] "the sturdy {{opponent of the}} swallow-tail suit," [...] and yet he himself,--though still outwardly faithful--had been heard to say, [...] "I {{may be forced to}} wear the damned thing yet." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2003–04 season, Larsson left Celtic on a free {{transfer}} and signed a one-year contract with Barcelona with an option for a second year. Larsson's contribution in Barças La Liga win in his first season there was disrupted by serious injury. He scored 3 goals in 12 Liga games and one goal (against his former club Celtic) in four Champions League matches. After the match against Celtic, he said: [...] "It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> celebrate my goal because I had so many great times here." [...] On 20 November 2004, during the 3–0 victory in El Clásico against Real Madrid, Larsson tore the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus in his left knee. Despite his injury-hit 2004–05 season, playing only 16 games, Barcelona took the option to extend his contract.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when I came back from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{my return}} to the Homestead I went at once to see him. He was sitting in my mother's wheeled chair, quite helpless, yet cheerful and {{confident}} of ultimate recovery. He {{had always been a}} man of dignity, and singularly abstemious of habit, and these qualities were strongly accentuated by his sudden helplessness. He was very gentle, very patient, and the sight of him lying there made speaking <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R

Remember that I am all alone and it is all <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I have {{been looking forward to}} your coming.

5000|$|In Scott's {{own words}} in 2006: [...] "I {{had decided to}} sit out the 1987 {{elections}} after my struggles with Edwards during those difficult legislative years... I needed a break. Then Edward Steimel talked me into the state senate race against McPherson. Very harsh race and <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the country precincts with the unpopularity of desegregation/busing orders by my father... plus Joe is a very tough candidate. ...

He is under my roof, {{and to some extent}} he is {{entitled}} to my protection. But there are limits to the obligations even of hospitality. There have been things spoken of in his presence which must not be repeated." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also sparked {{negative}} reactions {{because of its}} content. [...] "A lot of people got freaked out", says Bakshi. [...] "The people {{in charge of the}} power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and Norman Rockwell, thought I was a pornographer, and they made things <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me." ...|$|R
60|$|LIZA. It's {{not because}} you paid for my dresses. I know you are generous to {{everybody}} with money. But it was from you that I learnt really nice manners; {{and that is what}} makes one a lady, isn't it? You see it was so <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> with the example of Professor Higgins always before me. I was brought up to be just like him, unable to control myself, and using bad language on the slightest provocation. And I should never have known that ladies and gentlemen didn't behave like that if you hadn't been there.|$|R
500|$|During filming, Roth held {{a grudge}} against Heston {{due to his}} work with the National Rifle Association: [...] "It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> On one level, there's the man and he's my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing {{is what it is}} now. I'm so against it, very vocally so. But it was {{inappropriate}} for the workplace. If I'm going to talk to him, I'll talk to him outside the workplace. So it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene." [...] Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston.|$|R
60|$|Seeing, therefore, no remedy, I {{was obliged}} to {{withdraw}} my hand from him, that had been my first destroyer, and reserve the assistance that I intended to have given him for another more desirable opportunity.

You must {{understand}} that, circumstanced as we are, your brother's visit here,--what I mean is, that it is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> act and speak exactly as I should do, and a few unfortunate words spoken may make my position unendurable." ...|$|E
60|$|I have no {{idea how}} long Lop-Ear and I wandered in the land north of the river. We were like mariners wrecked on a desert isle, so far as {{concerned}} the likelihood of our getting home again. We turned our backs upon the river, and for weeks and months adventured in that wilderness where there were no Folk. It is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reconstruct our journeying, and impossible to do it from day to day. Most of it is hazy and indistinct, though here and there I have vivid recollections of things that happened.|$|E
40|$|A {{quarter century}} ago, Jan van Paradijs and I {{started on a}} {{scientific}} journey, our lives became entwined, and a friendship evolved that shaped both our lives scientifically and in personal matters. To tell our story was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I went through 24 years of notes in my calendars and re-lived more than 8000 days of my own and Jan's life, 20 years of slides, 15 years of e-mail. There were times that I had to stop and leave it alone {{for a week or}} more as it became too emotional. Few people know (perhaps only two) what we meant for each other. When Jan died, part of me died...|$|R
50|$|Haushofer commented a {{year later}} {{in a letter to}} the same friend:I am {{extremely}} industrious. My novel is completed in its first draft. I have already completed one hundred pages of the rewrite. Altogether there will be 360 pages. Writing strains me a great deal and I suffer from headaches. But I hope that I will be finished by the beginning of May (I must allow at least four weeks for the typing)... And the household must keep on running also. All that is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because I can only concentrate on one thing and forcing me to be versatile makes me extremely nervous.

5000|$|His {{lead was}} cut at the [...] {{as he was}} denied a likely win due to gearbox failure, but he bounced back to win his home race in Germany for the first time, despite {{pressure}} from Kimi Räikkönen and Romain Grosjean. In Hungary, Vettel {{had to settle for}} 3rd behind Hamilton and Räikkönen, but wins in Belgium (from 2nd on the grid), Italy, Singapore and Korea (all 3 from pole) put him 77 points clear with only 5 races to go. With grand slams at Singapore and Korea, he became only the third man after Alberto Ascari and Jim Clark to take consecutive grand slams. Vettel sealed his fourth world title at India on 27 October.

6000|$|... 'All {{through the}} season I saw {{a great deal of}} her, and the {{atmosphere}} of mystery never left her. Sometimes I thought that she was in the power of some man, but she looked so unapproachable, that I could not believe it. It was really <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come to any conclusion, for she was like one of those strange crystals that one sees in museums, which are at one moment clear, and at another clouded. At last I determined to ask her to be my wife: I was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that she imposed on all my visits, and on the few letters I sent her. I wrote to her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following Monday at six. She answered yes, and I was in the seventh heaven of delight. I was infatuated with her: in spite of the mystery, I thought then--in consequence of it, I see now. No; it was the woman herself I loved. The mystery troubled me, maddened me. Why did chance put me in its track?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am working}} {{through a series}} of readings, widely {{dispersed}} through England, Scotland, and Ireland, and am so constantly occupied that it is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write letters. I have received your highly esteemed note (forwarded from my home in Kent), and should have replied to it sooner but that I had a hope of being able to get home and see your present first. As I {{have not been able to}} do so, however, and am hardly likely to do so for two months to come, I delay no longer. It is safely awaiting me on my own desk in my own quiet room. I cannot thank you for it too cordially, and cannot too earnestly assure you that I shall always prize it highly. The terms in which you send me that mark of your remembrance are more gratifying to me than I can possibly express to you; for they assure me that there is nothing but goodwill left between you and me and a people for whom I have a real regard, and to whom I would not wilfully have given an offence or done an injustice for any worldly consideration.|$|E
60|$|It is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{describe}} {{the period of}} time which elapsed between my arrival at Babyan's Peak and my marriage with Stella. When I look back on it, it seems sweet as with the odour of flowers, and dim as with the happy dusk of summer eves, while through the sweetness comes the sound of Stella's voice, and through the gloom shines the starlight of her eyes. I think that we loved each other from the first, though for a while we said no word of love. Day by day I went about the place with her, accompanied by little Tota and Hendrika only, while she attended to the thousand and one matters which her father's ever-growing weakness had laid upon her; or rather, as time drew on, I attended to the business, and she accompanied me. All day through we were together. Then after supper, when the night had fallen, we would walk together in the garden and come at length to hear her father read aloud sometimes from the works of a poet, sometimes from history. Or, if he did not feel well, Stella would read, and when this was done, Mr. Carson would celebrate a short form of prayer, and we would separate till the morning once more brought our happy hour of meeting.|$|E

2500|$|Schwarzenegger {{wanted to}} move from {{bodybuilding}} into acting, finally achieving {{it when he was}} chosen {{to play the role of}} Hercules in 1970's Hercules in New York. Credited under the stage name [...] "Arnold Strong", his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production. His second film appearance was as a deaf-mute mob hitman in The Long Goodbye (1973), which was followed by a much more significant part in the film Stay Hungry (1976), for which he was awarded a Golden Globe for New Male Star of the Year. Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career: [...] "It was <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the beginning– I was told by agents and casting people that my body was 'too weird', that I had a funny accent, and that my name was too long. You name it, and they told me I had to change it. Basically, everywhere I turned, I was told that I had no chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{replied to}} this: [...] "Your play made me cry, for I, too, am leaving the dewy morning behind. I like this play; {{it is very}} tender and beautiful, {{and do you know}} I believe it would touch more hearts than your {{gorgeous}} melodrama. Mr. Howells somewhere beautifully says that when he is most intimate in the disclosures of his own feelings he finds himself most widely responded to--or something like that. I really am eager to do this play. It has increased my wonder of your powers. I really begin to feel that I know only part of you. First Lillian's Duty taught me some of your stern Scotch morality. Then Enid's Choice revealed to me your conception of the integrity of a good woman's soul--that nothing can debase it. Alessandra disclosed your learning and your imaginative power. Now here I feel the poet, the imaginative boy. I will not say this has increased my faith in you--it has added to my knowledge of you. But I must confess to you it has made it <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on with Alessandra. All the other plays are in line of a national drama. Alessandra is a bitter and ironical concession. The Morning makes its splendor almost tawdry. It hurt me to go to rehearsal to-day. Westervelt's presence was a gloating presence, and I hated him. Hugh's report of the exultant 'I told you so's' of the dramatic critics sickened me--" [...] Her letter ended abruptly, almost at this point.|$|E

"I still hope," [...] he wrote, slowly {{considering}} {{the words as}} they fell from his pen, [...] "for the day when this work will have been done--for the happy day when we shall feel that we have prevailed not only against our enemies, but over our own vices; but my heart nearly fails me, when I think how little we have yet effected. I feel that among the friends whom we most trust, those who are actuated by patriotism alone are lukewarm. Lust, avarice, plunder, and personal revenge, are the motives {{of those who are}} really energetic [...] . It is <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> know my friends; this also preys heavily on my spirits. The gold of the royalists is as plentiful as when the wretched woman, who is now about to die, was revelling in her voluptuous pride at Versailles. I know that the hands of many, who call themselves patriots, are even now grasping at the wages for which they are to betray the people. A day of reckoning shall come for all of them, though the list of their names is a long one. Were I to write the names of those whom I know to be true, I should be unable to insert in it above five or six. [...] . I look for your return to Paris with more than my usual impatience. Eleanor's quiet zeal, and propriety of demeanour, is a great comfort to me; but even with her, I feel that I have some reserve. I blame myself that it is so, for she is most trustworthy; but, as yet, I cannot throw it off. With you alone I have none. Do not, however, leave the work undone; remember that those who will not toil for us, will assuredly toil against us. There can be none neutral in the battle we are now waging. A man can have committed no greater crime against the Republic than having done nothing to add to its strength. I know your tender heart grieves at the death of every traitor, though your patriotism owns the necessity of his fall. Remember that the prosperity of every aristocrat has been purchased by the infamy of above a hundred slaves! How much better is it that one man should die, than that a hundred men should suffer worse than death!" ...|$|E
