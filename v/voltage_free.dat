30|$|The {{polarization}} field can {{be screened}} by applied <b>voltage,</b> <b>free</b> carriers or charged defects, and strain relaxation. By applying reverse bias on the structures, the polarization field can be canceled, {{and the field}} strength can be then deduced from the change of applied voltage or emission wavelength. Based on this, several experimental methods were put forward to determine the polarization field in quantum well structures including photoluminescence (PL) [5], electroreflectance [6], electrotransmission [7], photocurrent [8], and Raman scattering [9]. It {{has been reported that}} the polarization field can be screened by doping, defects, and carrier injection [10 – 13], therefore resulting in a blue-shifted emission wavelength. The strain relaxation might lead to a reduction in polarization field, because the piezoelectric polarization is determined by the strain status of the epi-layers. Once the strain is relaxed, the piezoelectric polarization would be weakened accordingly.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of physical parameters of a tunable MEMS capacitor, {{as the major}} part of MEMS AC voltage reference, is of great importance to achieve an accurate output <b>voltage</b> <b>free</b> of the malfunctioning noise and disturbance.

30|$|The top gating of a graphene-based FET {{with a solid}} or liquid {{electrolyte}} presents several advantages compared to the conventional back gating with a metallic electrode. Upon application of gate <b>voltage,</b> <b>free</b> ions in the electrolyte re-distribute themselves, forming an electrostatic double layer (EDL) at the interface between graphene and the electrolytic solution [12]. Depending on the ion concentration, the EDL can be only a few nanometers thick, while still providing efficient shielding of graphene. As a consequence, the capacitance of the EDL in an electrolyte can be {{much higher than the}} capacitance of the back gate, which is typically separated from graphene with a layer of SiO 2 a few hundred nanometers thick [12]. This property of the EDL enables a much better control of the surface potential on the graphene layer, while requiring a much lower operating voltage that needs to be applied to the reference electrode in the electrolyte than voltages currently used with back gates [12]. The applied voltage then modifies the chemical potential of graphene, resulting in changes in its observable properties such as conductance. Since properties of the EDL depend on the ion concentration, monitoring the resulting changes in graphene’s conductance can provide a means for sensor application, e.g., in measuring the amount of salt in the solution.|$|E

By using high <b>voltage</b> <b>free</b> flow electrophoresis to separate a platelet mixed membrane fraction into highly purified surface and intracellular membrane subfractions, we have confirmed that the major polypeptide acetylated after exposing whole platelets to [acetyl- 14 C]aspirin is almost exclusively associated with intracellular membrane structures.

In sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis the [14 C]acetylated component, which appears to be a dimer, migrates with a mobility corresponding to 72 kDa. Although cyclo-oxygenase is inhibited, there is no discernible radioactive labelling when the platelets are exposed to aromatic-ring-labelled [14 C]aspirin.

In unstimulated neutrophils, 75 % of Mac- 1 colocalized with specific granules including gelatinase granules, 20 % with secretory vesicles and the rest with plasma membranes.

Stimulation with PMA or Ionomycin resulted in full translocation of Mac- 1 from secretory vesicles and gelatinase granules to the plasma membrane, and partial translocation of Mac- 1 from specific granules.
