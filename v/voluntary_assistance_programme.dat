40|$|In {{the past}} 15 years, the Government of Indonesia has {{implemented}} {{a variety of}} social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> intended {{to improve the lives of}} the poor and help them escape poverty. Many of these programmes are now operating at a national scale and cover millions of Indonesians. Using a new household survey dataset that covers the eastern areas of Indonesia (Indonesian Family Life Survey East 2012), this paper investigates the household-level determinants of access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> The analysis reveals that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> are relatively more available in poorer provinces and that poorer households—all things being equal—are more likely to access social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> than nonpoor households, which suggests that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in eastern Indonesia are successful in their efforts to target the poor (poverty targeting), both across regions and households. However, poverty targeting still has scope for improvement in terms of accuracy. Besides the poverty status (as measured in per capita consumption expenditures), the authors found that several other factors infl uence programme access. Having a disabled household member or having a household head who is a widow(er) appears to increase the likelihood of receiving social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Likewise, the level of trust and confl ict in a community affects access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Particularly in the case of Raskin, we found that the programme is distributed more widely among those communities that are characterized by higher levels of confl ict and lower levels of trust. The authors did not fi nd that poor access to infrastructure and remoteness infl uences household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> once they controlled for province fi xed effects in the regression framework. Furthermore, the fi ndings suggest that possession of a local ‘poverty letter’ strongly improves household access to social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> even after controlling for a wide set of socioeconomic characteristics. In general, determinants of programme access differ signifi cantly among provinces and between rural and urban areas...|$|R

40|$|Social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> {{have been}} noted {{as one of the}} {{important}} keys to determining the success of the recovery process in the aftermath a disaster. It has also been shown that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster, significantly contribute to the recovery phase of disaster management, by utilizing the communities? capacity to facilitate community recovery from a disaster. Through the community recovery framework, social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> with active collaboration and interaction between the community and the social assistants, can speed up community recovery efforts; contributing to the disaster recovery management. The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the social assistance delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes,</b> following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of social assistance within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption. Data was analysed using qualitative descriptive methodology via open-ended and close-ended questions with 10 participants. The study explored whether the lived experiences of the Kinahrejo community was congruent with Indonesian regulation regarding social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> This study has contributed to the field of research on social <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> following a disaster by providing findings on the importance of the mentioned programmes toward the affected community from the community?s experiences and perspectives...|$|R

In this context, concerns have arisen that poor government policies and inadequate donor coordination have reduced the effectiveness of such assistance. The paper discusses the sources of policy success and policy failure of such international <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> within a principal-agent framework that models the influence of misaligned objectives, differing incentive structures, asymmetric information and moral hazard facing the different actors in the institutional structure of <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes.</b> In this political economy approach the varying influences on multiple principals and agents are key determinants {{of the effectiveness of}} policy. The paper takes a sectoral view in examining <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in the vocational education sector, where large donor effort has been applied in the Western Balkans over the last decade to modernise and reform the education system. The specific focus is on secondary vocational education in Serbia. The paper identifies causes of policy failure in EU pre-accession assistance in this key policy area...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of {{government}} <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> on internationalization of SMEs from an Asian developing nation. Design/methodology/approach - Primary data from a sample of 203 SMEs in three export-oriented industries in Bangladesh were analyzed using structural equations model to examine both direct and indirect causal effects of government assistance on their internationalization. Findings - Results suggest that the usage of market development-related government assistance significantly influence internationalization directly as well as indirectly via other determinants, whereas finance- and guarantee-related assistance has only indirect effect. Practical implications - Government export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> play an important role in the SMEs' internationalization process by contributing to a number of firm- and management-related factors that determine international marketing performance of a firm. The study provides a guideline for SME managers as to how they can benefit from both categories of export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> in improving their positive attitudes towards the export market environment, building their knowledge and enhancing commitment to exporting for better success in their international operations. Originality/value - The importance of export <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> is well recognized in the literature but its causal effect on internationalization of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is low. The paper tries to fill this gap by reporting the results of an empirical study examining effects of government <b>assistance</b> <b>programmes</b> on internationalization of SMEs from an Asian developing nation, where there is a gross dearth of research.
