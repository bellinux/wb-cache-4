5000|$|This {{is defined}} as a device that {{reflects}} and absorbs waves of oscillatory energy, extending from a piece of working machinery or electrical equipment, and with the desired effect being <b>vibration</b> <b>insulation.</b> The goal is to establish vibration isolation between a body transferring mechanical fluctuations and a supporting body (for example, between the machine and the foundation). The illustration shows a vibration isolator from the series «ВИ» (~"VI" [...] in Roman characters), as used in shipbuilding in Russia, for example the submarine [...] "St.Petersburg" [...] (Lada). The depicted «ВИ» devices allow loadings ranging from 5, 40 and 300 kg. They differ in their physical sizes, but all share the same fundamental design. The structure consists of a rubber envelope that is internally reinforced by a spring. During manufacture, the rubber and the spring are intimately and permanently connected {{as a result of the}} vulcanization process that is integral to the processing of the crude rubber material. Under action of weight loading of the machine, the rubber envelope deforms, and the spring is compressed or stretched. Therefore, in the direction of the spring's cross section, twisting of the enveloping rubber occurs. The resulting elastic deformation of the rubber envelope results in very effective absorption of the vibration. This absorption is crucial to reliable <b>vibration</b> <b>insulation,</b> because it averts the potential for resonance effects. The amount of elastic deformation of the rubber largely dictates the magnitude of vibration absorption that can be attained; the entire device (including the spring itself) must be designed with this in mind. The design of the vibration isolator must also take into account potential exposure to shock loadings, in addition to the routine everyday vibrations. Lastly, the vibration isolator must also be designed for long-term durability as well as convenient integration into the environment in which it is to be used. Sleeves and flanges are typically employed in order to enable the vibration isolator to be securely fastened to the equipment and the supporting foundation.|$|E

This car, numbered 3342, was tested in February 1904 and deemed to be too heavy for practical use in the new subway. It required further design changes before it could become serviceable. But most importantly, the all-steel prototype proved that an all-steel car could be feasible, and validated Gibbs' claims that the previously held fears of excessive <b>vibration,</b> poor <b>insulation,</b> and loud noise were unfounded. IRT engineers began modifying the all-steel design to lighten the cars to a more suitable weight. One of the largest breakthroughs came when engineers learned they could achieve a similar structural strength as the heavier car by constructing a [...] "skeleton" [...] floor frame made of thick, intersecting steel sills and crossmembers. This was in contrast to using a single thick, heavy sheet of steel for a large center sill that supported the car. Following this and other weight reducing changes, the IRT {{was ready to go}} ahead with a production order of the new [...] "Gibbs" [...] cars, so named after George Gibbs. Larger builders remained steadfast in their refusal to build all-steel cars. However, {{as a result of the}} generally successful introduction of the steel prototype car, the growing American Car & Foundry was willing to accept an order for steel cars.

40|$|Power {{transformer}} winding clamping pressure {{is a critical}} parameter, which {{is directly related to}} transformer short circuit ride through capability. Mechanical impacts generated on the winding structure during short circuit faults, switching surges and other high current faults {{have a significant impact on}} the winding clamping structure and could lead to reduce the clamping pressure. The change in clamping pressure influences the vibration behaviour of winding structure. Hence, variations in clamping pressure can be assessed by monitoring the transformer vibrations.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{adhesives}} {{in place}} of traditional joining techniques as welding and riveting is becoming increasingly common in structural design. Compared to other conventional joining processes, adhesive bonding offers several advantages: including acoustic <b>insulation,</b> <b>vibration</b> attenuation, structure lightening, corrosion reduction and uniform stress distribution. These benefits can be offset if the surfaces to be bonded are not carefully cleaned, degreased and prepared. Many approaches to surface treatments based on physical or chemical modifications have been developed in the years {{in order to improve}} the surface activity. Although widely used and very efficient, these techniques present several disadvantages. Physical methods based on mechanical abrasion are supposed to extend bonding area as they increase the roughness, but cause an extensive degradation to the specimens and they are often not easy to reproduce. On the other hand, chemical treatments are typically used with the aim of modifying both morphology and chemical structure of the substrates layers, but they present serious environmental problems of waste disposal, which has moved investigations to an industrial alternative to these processes. According, the use of energetic methods of surface cleaning, such as laser and plasma cleaning processes have been recently consolidated since they are useful to modify the topmost layers of the substrates, increasing their reactivity, without affecting the bulk material properties. These treatments offer an effective and environment-friendly processing of different materials, providing strong and durable bonds with adhesives through modification of the surface morphology and functionalities. In this study, the effects of laser and low pressure plasma treatments on mechanical properties of adhesive bonded joints has been investigated and compared performing lap-shear tests...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the fiber}} {{reinforced}} composite industry has grown exponentially in many areas such as automotive, aerospace and construction. Lately, the use of natural fibers as replacement of less environmentally-friendly products, such as glass fibers, has become {{a strong interest in}} the composite industry, in response to society’s demand for more renewable resources. In this context, the use of flax fibre is increasing thanks to key functionalities, such as acoustic and thermal <b>insulation,</b> <b>vibration</b> damping, as well as renewability. In terms of mechanical performance, flax fibers are known to be as stiff as glass fibers, and even stiffer than glass when normalised to their low density. Flax fibres are among the strongest of the natural fiber family. As of today, a major lack of data on natural fibre durability properties, such as fatigue behaviour and impact resistance, has been limiting the use of these fibres for high performance applications. In the case of fatigue, few papers such as from Liang et al. [1] relate to this behaviour. They have shown an increase of the stiffness of a single flax fibre for a certain number of loading cycles which rose from 40 GPa up to 70 GPa, the first being very low compared to other studies. Similarly, Silva et al. [2] have shown for sisal fibres, that at fatigue stresses below 50 % of the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), all tested fibres can resist more than 106 cycles as well as show a slight increase of the stiffness. As for the impact resistance, it is documented as the greatest threat to natural composite structures. It was shown by Santulli [3] that fibre defects have a large role in the impact resistance of natural fibre composites because they decrease the fibre bridging effect that prevents further development of a crack, which may cause the fibres to bend and pull-out early from the polymer during the impact. The aim of this work is to study the impact resistance and fatigue behaviour of flax fibre composites for various preform architectures. This investigation is crucial in order to assess the durability of the materials since these properties have a great influence on the service life, product safety and liability.

40|$|Multi-storey wood {{buildings}} have been increasing in popularity since a century-old {{ban on the}} construction of such buildings was lifted in 1994. Compared to conventional concrete structures, it is more difficult to build lightweight structures {{in such a way that}} noise and disturbing vibrations is avoided. To design buildings of high performance regarding sound and vibrations, it is desirable to have tools for predicting the effects of structural modifications prior to construction. The long-term aim of the studies presented in the dissertation is to develop such tools by means of numerical models. Accurately assessing the dynamic behaviour of multi-storey wood buildings requires use of models representing the geometry in considerable detail, resulting in very large models which easily exceed the limits of computer capacity, at least for computations to be performed within reasonable time. It is therefore desirable to avoid unnecessarily detailed models, while at the same time describing the phenomena of interest accurately. Moreover, the computational efficiency of the models can be improved by employing model order reduction, reducing the size and computational cost of the models without affecting the accuracy appreciably. A common way of employing model order reduction is through substructure modelling, in which full finite element models are divided into smaller parts, or substructures, that are reduced in size and assembled to form reduced global models. The dissertation includes an investigation into the effect of modelling acoustic media inside cavities of multi-storey wood buildings on the transmission of structural <b>vibrations.</b> Air and <b>insulation</b> inside cavities were modelled as acoustic media in different ways and the resulting finite element models were compared. It was concluded that the acoustic media in cavities close to the source of vibration affect the vibration transmission and that it, therefore, has to be included in the models to some extent. Furthermore, the efficiency of different methods for reducing substructure models of multi-storey wood buildings are discussed in the dissertation. Comparisons of different methods for model order reduction, applied to substructures of buildings, showed that the frequently employed method of component mode synthesis by Craig & Bampton and the increasingly popular Krylov subspace methods result in efficient reduced order models. In order to improve the efficiency of the reduced order models, interface reduction can be employed. Different methods for interface reduction were found to be the most efficient ones for the interface surfaces of wood components and elastomer materials. Elastomer are used at junctions in wooden buildings in order to reduce the vibration transmission...|$|R

There is a need for less costly measures which, although less effective, may achieve the required vibration reduction. For a specific case such measures have been developed and are being applied. This case is a large new housing development around a tunnel in the new Dutch dedicated freight track from the Rotterdam harbour to Germany. This 'new-new' situation posed an extra challenge: houses were designed while it was still unknown to what extent trains would give rise to vibration and induced noise. Because predictions of floor vibration and vibration induced noise in buildings showed that low frequency noise might be perceived in buildings close to the tunnel, it was necessary to consider vibration mitigation measures. The performance of several measures for a number of different building designs was therefore evaluated and assessed.

This paper investigates various metamaterial layouts for reducing vibrations along a known transmission path, being a duct with a square section. The efficiency of the considered metamaterial designs for vibration attenuation are evaluated and compared both numerically and experimentally. Due to the typical periodic nature of this class of materials, the numerical prediction of the stop band behavior is modeled using unit cell models for the duct; both a one dimensional (1 D) waveguide as well as a two dimensional (2 D) infinite periodic structure. The efficiency and accuracy of both approaches are evaluated and compared to measurements. It is demonstrated that different resonant structures can be combined to merge stop bands, either using a mixed, checkered pattern, or a sequential pattern. Depending on the transmission path and the targeted frequency zone, either approach or a combination of both can be used.
