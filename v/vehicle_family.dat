25|$|When Korolev died in January 1966, his {{notoriously}} incompetent deputy Vasily Mishin {{took over}} his design bureau. Mishin {{succeeded in getting}} the Kremlin to terminate the UR-700/900 project {{as well as the}} RD-270 engine Glushko planned for the launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>family.</b> His main arguments were the tremendous safety risk posed by a low-altitude launch failure of the UR-700 in addition to the waste of money by developing two HLV families at once.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercury-Redstone's {{automatic}} in-flight abort {{sensing system}} solved {{this problem by}} monitoring the rocket's performance during flight. If it detected an anomaly which might threaten the astronaut, such as loss of flight control, engine thrust, or electrical power, it would automatically abort, shutting down the engine and activating the capsule's escape system. The abort system could not shut off the engine until at least 30 seconds after liftoff {{in order to prevent}} a malfunctioning launch vehicle from coming down on or near the pad; during the initial 30 seconds, only the Range Safety Officer could terminate the flight. Review of flight data from the more than 60 Redstone and Jupiter C launches since 1953 was used to analyze the most likely failure modes of this launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>family.</b> In the interest of simplicity, the abort sensing system had to be kept as simple as possible and only monitor parameters that were vital to booster operation. An automatic abort could be triggered by any of the following conditions, all of which could be indicative of a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction: ...|$|E
