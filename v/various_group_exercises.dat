The workshops aimed to encourage trying out interdisciplinary hands-on teaching, and enable teachers to implement their ideas for teaching development utilising the DF pedagogical platform. The majority of the participants planned teaching experimentations aiming at enhancing student understanding of curricula through <b>various</b> <b>group</b> <b>exercises</b> utilising concrete artefacts, but found their implementation within established practices quite challenging, highlighting the challenges of transforming strategic collaboration into grass-root activity. However, the workshops ignited widespread interest in a continuum of collaboration in teaching development, and the DF has since acted as a hub for the implementation of subsequent internationalisation efforts of the two universities, including establishing a dual-degree programme.

40|$|Abstract Physical {{activity}} may {{be carried out}} alone or in a group. No comprehensive stud-ies have been conducted on the associations between <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> and health outcomes, the mechanisms underlying the associations with health outcomes, and determinants of participa-tion in <b>group</b> <b>exercise.</b> The aim {{of this article is}} to review the associations and mechanisms be-tween <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> and health outcomes, and the determinants of participation in group exer-cise among healthy adults and the elderly without specific illnesses. <b>Group</b> <b>exercise</b> may reduce the risk of physical and mental illness by improving adherence to physical activity, psychologi-cal factors, and social relationships. While there may potentially be <b>various</b> determinants of <b>group</b> <b>exercise,</b> previous research has only examined specific demographic and environmental factors. Among the studies discussed in this review, few studies examined the differences be-tween individual <b>exercise</b> and <b>group</b> <b>exercise.</b> Thus, the unique effects and determinants of <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> remain unclear. Further studies examining these points are needed to develop a more complete knowledge base on <b>group</b> <b>exercise...</b>|$|R
30|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} {{and the lack}} of information are of course interrelated since ‘gender stereotypes are often caused by a lack of information; and a lack of information often is a lack of accurate information caused by the persistent circulation of stereotypes concerning SET as well as gender stereotypes’ (Karpodini-Dimitriadi 2008, limited circulation). Despite the efforts of the last years to eliminate gender inequalities in the teaching curricula and teaching material, gender differentiations and stereotypes are still reproduced. It has been also noted that media and youth magazines promote values and stereotypes of <b>various</b> social <b>groups</b> thus <b>exercising</b> pressure on ‘girls to comply with female {{stereotypes and}} rewards them with social acceptance from their parents, schoolmates, and teachers’ (Arztmann and John 2008).|$|R

40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>exercise</b> {{training}} programs were introduced {{as a strategy}} for improving health and fitness and potentially reducing dropout rates. This study examined the psychophysiological responses to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> training sessions. Twenty-seven adults completed two <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> training sessions of moderate and vigorous exercise intensities in a random and counterbalanced order. The %HRR and the exertional and arousal responses to vigorous session were higher than those during the moderate session (p< 0. 05). Consequently, the affective responses to vigorous session were less pleasant than those during moderate session (p< 0. 05). These {{results suggest that the}} psychophysiological responses to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> training sessions are intensity-dependent. From an adherence perspective, interventionists are encouraged to emphasize <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> training sessions at a moderate intensity to maximize affective responses and to minimize exertional responses, which in turn may positively affect future exercise behavior...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{adoption}} {{and maintenance of}} <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> behavior are scarce. The objective {{of this study is}} to test two self-efficacy based interventions to increase barrier self-efficacy and <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> behavior. In total 122 participants (Mage 42. 02 yr.; SD 12. 29; 67 % females) were recruited and randomly assigned to one control and two experimental groups. The control group was limited to participate in one virtual <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> program only (<b>group</b> 1). The first experimental group was able to self-set their activities and participate in multiple <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> programs (<b>group</b> 2). The second experimental group received an additional monthly coaching protocol to manage self-set goals (group 3). A validated scale for barrier self-efficacy was used, <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> sessions were measured and drop-out rates were registered. An ANOVA indicated that mean amount of sessions of group 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 differed significantly (p < 0. 05) in 12 weeks. Descriptive statistics demonstrate mean <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> sessions over the total of 12 weeks of 2. 74 (SD 4. 65) in the control group; 4. 75 (SD 6. 08) in the first experimental group, and 12. 25 (SD 9. 07) for the second experimental group. Regression analysis indicated that self-efficacy at 8 -weeks explained the highest variance in overall <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> sessions (R(2) = 0. 18; p < 0. 05). Overall drop-out rates were 88 % in group 1, 78 % in group 2 and 48 % in group 3. The results showed that <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> behavior can significantly be improved by a coaching protocol on self-set goals. Future research should address the effectiveness of self-set activities and self-set goals for a longer period of time and in other types of exercise programs. Key pointsApproximately 144 million individuals exercise in fitness clubs worldwide. About 50 % participate in at least one <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> program and 23 % participate only in <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> classes with instructor. Research on attendance and exercise behavior in fitness clubs is limited but there are strong indications that the frequencies are low. This study demonstrates that <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> behavior in fitness clubs can be improved significantly by a coaching protocol on self-set goals based on tenets of self-efficacy theory...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{reduces the}} risk for disease, improves overall health, and quality of life. <b>Group</b> <b>exercise</b> classes are large contributors for meeting physical activity recommendations. Improving long-term adherence to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> classes is essential {{in order to receive}} health and fitness benefits. Many contributing factors affect adherence rates including the role of the instructor. The instructor has great influence over the decision to return to a <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> class. It is important to find out what qualities and characteristics are preferred among those who take classes to increase long-term adherence. Another important factor relating to adherence is body type, appearance and attractiveness of the instructor. These factors have been influential in other areas including performance enhancement consulting, counseling, teacher ratings, and willingness to accept health advice. However, little research has been done to determine if body type, appearance and attractiveness influence adherence to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> classes. Identifying if there are stereotypes associated with <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> instructors will provide the opportunity to educate participants and improve the professional development of instructors. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the relationship between participants 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> leaders and adherence to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> classes. Business cards will be distributed to participants after their exercise class, which will contain the web address to the survey. Participants will also have the opportunity to fill out a paper and pencil version of the survey if that is more convenient. The survey will be posted on surveymonkey. com. Flyers with the web address will also be posted around the facilities to promote the survey. Results showed that participants did not prefer significant differences in fatness and muscularity of the instructor nor were they related to motivation, effort, attendance, willingness to accept health information from the instructor, or perceived attractiveness. However, perceived attractiveness was related to attendance. Results also showed that participants preferred to be less fat and more muscular, similar to that of the current instructor body type, indicating that participants desired to have a physique similar to that of the instructor. Although, fatness and muscularity of the instructor were not associated with motivation or adherence to <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> class, instructional quality was associated with these outcomes. It was found that instructional quality is more important to participants of a <b>group</b> <b>exercise</b> class than body type. Instructional quality was associated with motivation, effort, attendance, and willingness to accept health information. This demonstrates the importance of professional development of instructors. Results from the current study support that body type of the instructor is associated less with different psychosocial outcomes than instructional quality...|$|R
