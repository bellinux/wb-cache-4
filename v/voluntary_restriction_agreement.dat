40|$|<b>Voluntary</b> <b>restrictions</b> and self-commitment Abstract in English In our work, we {{summarize}} {{the topic of}} dual self and propose various types of restrictions the long-run self might impose on the myopic self concerning procrastination, health and emotions. Then we design a questionnaire aimed to find {{to what extent do}} the real people behave in such way, and what are the determinants of such behavior. We find that the phenomenon of <b>voluntary</b> <b>restriction</b> of self is present in our contemporary society to large extent. Women have a tendency to restrict themselves significantly more than men, while higher Cognitive Response Test (CRT) score, higher education and lower conscientiousness cause lower interest in the self-regulatory facilities...|$|R

50|$|Surfactants are {{routinely}} deposited in numerous ways {{on land and}} into water systems, whether {{as part of an}} intended process or as industrial and household waste. Some of them are known to be toxic to animals, ecosystems, and humans, and can increase the diffusion of other environmental contaminants. As a result, there are proposed or <b>voluntary</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the use of some surfactants. For example, PFOS is a persistent organic pollutant as judged by the Stockholm Convention. Additionally, PFOA has been subject to a voluntary agreement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and eight chemical companies to reduce and eliminate emissions of the chemical and its precursors.|$|R

50|$|In 2000, access was {{unilaterally}} withdrawn by the Avon Wildlife Trust {{pending the}} results of a mine inspector's report on the safety of the mines. This report was required because of the Health and Safety at Work Act which affects employees and volunteers of Avon Wildlife Trust who might have to enter the mine to count the bats. These legal requirements do not affect leisure access by cavers. Prior to 2000, access to the mine was controlled by the Council of Southern Caving Clubs and cavers coexisted with a thriving bat population with <b>voluntary</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the access during the bat roosting season. There is no evidence of caving activity adversely affecting the bat population. Other locations such as Box Freestone quarry have seen rising bat populations despite becoming very popular.|$|R

This proliferation of homes that maintain a com-plete ban on smoking seems to have contributed to favorable smoking-related outcomes, including a reduction in exposure to ETS among children and nonsmoking adults (Gonzales, Malcoe, Kegler, & Espinoza, 2006).

40|$|Modern {{business}} process modeling languages such as BPMN or EPC provide users with more constructs to represent real world situations {{than their predecessors}} such as IDEF or Petri Nets. But this apparent increase in expressiveness is accompanied {{by an increase in}} language complexity. In practice many organizations choose to only use a subset of the available modeling constructs. Using a wellestablished ontology-based theory of representation, we analyze how this <b>voluntary</b> <b>restriction</b> affects the expressiveness and complexity of the resulting modeling vocabulary. We compare our empirical findings with two notation sets of the popular language BPMN – the core and full set. Our findings indicate that users are willing to accept ambiguity among modeling constructs and that the full element set of BPMN adds little expressiveness at the expense of considerably decreased ontological clarity. The findings are a first step towards an understanding of an optimal cost-effectiveness ratio for process modeling languages- both in theory and practice...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{can resist}} temptations by exerting willpower, the effortful {{inhibition}} of impulses. But willpower can be disrupted by emotions and depleted over time. Luckily, humans can deploy alternative self-control strategies like precommitment, the <b>voluntary</b> <b>restriction</b> {{of access to}} temptations. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of willpower and precommitment using fMRI. Behaviorally, precommitment facilitated choices for large delayed rewards, relative to willpower, especially in more impulsive individuals. While willpower was associated with activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus, precommitment engaged lateral frontopolar cortex (LFPC). During precommitment, LFPC showed increased functional connectivity with DLPFC and PPC, especially in more impulsive individuals, {{and the relationship between}} impulsivity and LFPC connectivity was mediated by value-related activation in ventromedial PFC. Our findings support a hierarchical model of self-control in which LFPC orchestrates precommitment by controlling action plans in more caudal prefrontal regions as a function of expected value...|$|R
