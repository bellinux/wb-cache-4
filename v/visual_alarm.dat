50|$|In various medical {{treatments}} that use Extracorporeal Blood Circuits (ECBC) {{the detection of}} air bubbles in the blood is vital for the patient safety.

The sensors allow the operator to set a size threshold for the size of the bubbles to detect. If the bubbles are below the threshold it is displayed to the user as microbubble activity. When a bubble equal to or greater than the threshold is detected an audio and <b>visual</b> <b>alarm</b> is generated and the arterial pump is stopped, this effectively terminates the cardiopulmonary bypass.

40|$|Chemical {{communication}} {{relating to}} predation risk is a trait common among fish species. Prey fish {{under threat of}} predation can signal risk to conspecific fish, which then exhibit defensive responses. Fish also assess predation risk by visual cues and change their behavior accordingly. Here, we explored whether these behavioral changes act as <b>visual</b> <b>alarm</b> signals to conspecific fish that are not initially under risk. We show that shoals of zebrafish (Danio rerio) visually exposed to a predator display antipredator behaviors. In addition, these defensive maneuvers trigger antipredator reactions in conspecifics and, concomitantly, stimulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis, leading to cortisol increase. Thus, we conclude that zebrafish defensive behaviors act as <b>visual</b> <b>alarm</b> cues that induce antipredator and stress response in conspecific fish...|$|E

40|$|During an {{underground}} mine fire, air can be rapidly depleted of oxygen and contaminated with smoke and toxic fire gases. Any delay in warning miners could have disastrous consequences. Unfortunately, present mine fire alarm systems, such as stench, audible or <b>visual</b> <b>alarms,</b> telephones, and messengers, are often slow, unreliable, and limited in mine area coverage. Recent {{research by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines has demonstrated that ultra low frequency electromagnetic signaling {{can be used for}} {{an underground}} mine fire alarm.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to empirically assess the {{efficacy}} of cognitive countermeasures based on the technique of information removal to enhance human operator attentional disengagement abilities when facing attentional tunneling. Background: Lessons learned from human factors studies suggest that conflict with automation leads to the degradation of operators’ performance by promoting excessive focusing on a single task to the detriment of the supervision of other critical parameters. Method: An experimental setup composed of a real unmanned ground vehicle and a ground station was developed to test the efficiency of the cognitive countermeasures. The scenario (with and without countermeasure) involved an authority conflict between the participants and the robot induced by a battery failure. The effects of the conflict and, in particular, the impact of cognitive countermeasures on the participants’ cognition and arousal were assessed through heart rate measurement and eye tracking techniques. Results: In the control group (i. e., no countermeasure), 8 out of 12 participants experienced attentional tunneling when facing the conflict, leading them to neglect the <b>visual</b> <b>alarms</b> displayed that would have helped them to understand the evolution of the tactical situation. Participants in the countermeasure group showed lower heart rates and enhanced attentional abilities, and 10 out of 11 participants made appropriate decisions. Conclusions: The use of cognitive countermeasures appeared to be an efficient means to mitigate excessive focus issues in the unmanned ground vehicle environment. Applications: The principle of cognitive counter- measures can be applied to a large domain of applications involving human operators interacting with critical systems...|$|R
