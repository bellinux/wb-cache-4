5|$|To gain good terrain for Operation Cobra, Bradley and Collins {{conceived}} {{a plan to}} {{push forward}} to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, along which VII and VIII Corps were securing jumping-off positions. On 18 July, {{at a cost of}} 5,000 casualties, the American 29th and 35th Infantry Divisions managed to gain the vital heights of Saint-Lô, driving back General der Fallschirmtruppen Eugen Meindl's II Parachute Corps. Meindl's paratroopers, together with the 352nd Infantry Division (which had been in action since its D-Day defense of Omaha Beach) were now in ruins, and the stage for the main offensive was set. Due to poor weather conditions that had also been hampering Goodwood and Atlantic, Bradley decided to postpone Cobra for a few days—a decision that worried Montgomery, as the British and Canadian operations had been launched to support a break-out attempt that was failing to materialize. By 24 July the skies had cleared enough for the start order to be given, and 1,600 Allied aircraft took off for Normandy. However, the weather closed in again over the battlefield. Under poor <b>visibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> more than 25 Americans were killed and 130 wounded in the bombing before the air support operation was postponed until the following day. Some enraged soldiers opened fire on their own aircraft, a not uncommon practice in Normandy when suffering from friendly fire.|$|E

40|$|Researches {{indicate}} that foggy weather {{is one of}} the most critical factors that restrict human&# 39;s traffic activities and cause traffic accidents. It will reduce the visibility of traffic message board, which could cause the insecurity of transportation. Commonly, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used as light source for variable message sign, which could not be seen clearly in the foggy low <b>visibility</b> <b>condition.</b> A high-brightness light source which could be used for variable information board was firstly put forward in this paper. And a new type of variable message sign used in low <b>visibility</b> <b>condition</b> was also introduced. Besides, the attenuation characteristics of laser diode (LD) and light-emitting diode (LED) were analyzed respectively. Calculation and simulation show that the attenuation of red light source is fastest, and the yellow LED light has the better transmittance property. In the experiment, LDs were used to make variable message board for verifying image definition. A 16 ∗ 16 array structure composed of LDs was designed and could display Chinese characters. By comparing the display effect of LDs and LEDs driven with same power, they were placed in fog chamber of the visibility less than 5 meters. And experiment results show that the penetrability of red LD light is better than that of red LED. So traffic variable message sign based on LDs could improve the image definition and the information could be seen more clearly in the foggy weather. In addition to the high-brightness, good coherence, good direction, experimental results show that traffic variable message board based on LD has better visual effect in low <b>visibility</b> <b>condition.</b> © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

25|$|At 15:48, {{with the}} {{opposing}} forces roughly parallel at , with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., {{on the right}} side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets (position 2). Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the Run to the South, in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except Princess Royal fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse <b>visibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> before finally getting the range. Only Lion and Princess Royal had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.|$|E

25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low <b>visibility</b> <b>conditions.</b> A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} procedure in use for this flight {{in the low}} clouds and low <b>visibility</b> <b>conditions</b> that night required the pilot to fly over the MAC VOR at 3,900 feet, then turn west-northwest to fly out over the water, descend to 1,540 feet and level off within nine miles, then make a left base turn to fly east, back toward the airport (a teardrop procedure turn), and descend for final approach {{with the use of}} the MAC VOR. The pilot was not allowed to descend below 1,540 feet until the turn was completed, and then not below 1,045 feet unless he had the runway in sight. Once the pilot could see the airport from that altitude, he would be allowed to circle and land on the runway of his choice. This is called a circle-to-land manoeuvre, or sometimes a cloud break procedure. The pilot elected to attempt this circling approach to land on runway 29 instead of landing straight in on runway 11, though the reported clouds at the time would have made a circling approach impossible at the minimum altitude of 1,045 feet.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, an expedition, {{funded and}} filmed by the History Channel, brought {{together}} fourteen skilled divers {{to help determine}} what caused the quick sinking of Britannic. After preparation the crew dived on the wreck site on 17 September. Time was cut short when silt was kicked up, causing zero <b>visibility</b> <b>conditions,</b> and the two divers narrowly escaped with their lives. One last dive was to be attempted on Britannics boiler room, but {{it was discovered that}} photographing this far inside the wreck would lead to violating a permit issued by the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, a department within the Greek Ministry of Culture. Partly because of a barrier in languages, a last minute plea was turned down by the department. The expedition was unable to determine the cause of the rapid sinking, but hours of footage were filmed and important data was documented. Underwater Antiquities later recognised the importance of this mission and has since extended an invitation to revisit the wreck under less stringent rules. On this expedition, divers found a bulb shape in her expansion joint. This proved that her design was changed following the loss of Titanic.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} employed to explain transport characteristics in realistic, quantum Hall based Aharonov-Bohm interferometers. First, the {{spatial distribution of}} incompressible strips, and thus the current channels, are obtained applying a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi method to a realistic heterostructure under quantized Hall conditions. Second, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation is solved for electrons injected in the current channels. Distinctive Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are found {{as a function of}} the magnetic flux. The oscillation amplitude strongly depends on the mutual distance between the transport channels and on their width. At an optimal distance the amplitude and thus the interchannel transport is maximized, which determines the maximum <b>visibility</b> <b>condition.</b> On the other hand, the transport is fully suppressed at magnetic fields corresponding to half-integer flux quanta.
