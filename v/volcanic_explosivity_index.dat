40|$|A {{sequence}} of 150 explosive eruptions recorded {{during the past}} century at the Chilean Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) is subjected to statistical time series analysis. The exponential, Weibull, and log-logistic distribution functions are fit to the eruption record, separately for literature-assigned <b>volcanic</b> <b>explosivity</b> <b>indices</b> (VEI) ≥ 2 and VEI ≥ 3. Since statistical tests confirm the adequacy of all the fits to describe the data, all models are used to estimate the likelihood of future eruptions. Only small differences are observed between the different distribution functions {{with regard to the}} eruption forecast, whereby the log-logistic distribution predicts the lowest probabilities. There is a 50 % probability for VEI ≥ 2 eruptions to occur in the SVZ within less than a year, and 90 % probability to occur within the next 2 - 3 years.

40|$|Volcanic events {{comprising}} multiple eruptive stages {{are common}} in the historical and geological record and display activity of variable intensity ranging, in some cases, through to several centuries. To better understand the characteristics of such events globally, this study explores a database of historical events having <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Explosivity</b> <b>Indices</b> 4 or greater. The database was compiled {{for the most part}} from published and unpublished material provided by the Smithsonian Institution. The database was examined to find common statistical relationships, within and between the variables characterising multi-stage explosive events. In concert with common usage, an event is defined here as clearly related activity over days to years whereas a stage represents a shorter duration (hours to weeks) characterised by one distinct style of activity. Over half of all volcanic events investigated exhibited more than one explosive stage and 77 % of these stages occurred within the first 10 % of the total defined duration of the event. This investigation confirmed a general eruptive pattern of declining explosivity with time and reaffirmed a positive correlation between stage column height and volume. Distributions presented in this paper are a first step towards describing the general patterns displayed by multi-stage events; however, it must be cautioned that they may be applicable neither for any particular volcanic centre nor across all eruptive scales and styles. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The 2011 Cordón Caulle {{eruption}} {{represents an}} ideal case {{study for the}} characterization of long-lasting plumes that are strongly affected by wind. The climactic phase lasted for about 1 [*]day and was classified as subplinian with plumes between ~ 9 and 12 [*]km above the vent and mass flow rate (MFR) {{on the order of}} ~ 107 [*]kg[*]s− 1. Eruption intensity fluctuated during the first 11 [*]days with MFR values between 106 and 107 [*]kg[*]s− 1. This activity was followed by several months of low-intensity plumes with MFR[*]<[*] 106 [*]kg[*]s− 1. Plume dynamics and rise were strongly affected by wind during the whole eruption with negligible upwind spreading and sedimentation. The plumes that developed on 4 – 6 and 20 – 22 June can be described as transitional, i. e., plumes showing transitional behavior between strong and weak dynamics, while the wind clearly dominated the rise height on all the other days resulting in the formation of weak plumes. Individual phases of the eruption range between <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Explosivity</b> <b>Indices</b> (VEIs) 3 and 4, while the cumulative deposit related to 4 – 7 June 2011 is associated with VEIs 4 and 5. Crosswind cloud and deposit dispersal of the first few days are best described by a linear combination of gravitational spreading and turbulent diffusion, with velocities between 1 and 10 m[*]s− 1. Downwind cloud velocity for the same days is best described by a linear combination of gravitational spreading and wind advection, with velocities between 17 and 45 [*]m[*]s− 1.

40|$|Lidar {{measurements}} at Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Germany) {{have almost}} continually delivered backscatter coefficients of stratospheric aerosol since 1976. The time series {{is dominated by}} signals from the particles injected into or formed in the stratosphere due to major volcanic eruptions, in particular those of El Chichon (Mexico, 1982) and Mt Pinatubo (Philippines, 1991). Here, we {{focus more on the}} long-lasting background period since the late 1990 s and 2006, in view of processes maintaining a residual lower-stratospheric aerosol layer in absence of major eruptions, as well as the period of moderate volcanic impact afterwards. During the long background period the stratospheric backscatter coefficients reached a level even below that observed in the late 1970 s. This suggests that the predicted potential influence of the strongly growing air traffic on the stratospheric aerosol loading is very low. Some correlation may be found with single strong forest-fire events, but the average influence of biomass burning seems to be quite limited. No positive trend in background aerosol can be resolved over a period as long as that observed by lidar at Mauna Loa. We conclude that the increase of our integrated backscatter coefficients starting in 2008 is mostly due to <b>volcanic</b> eruptions with <b>explosivity</b> <b>index</b> 4, penetrating strongly into the stratosphere. Most of them occurred in the mid-latitudes. A key observation for judging the role of eruptions just reaching the tropopause region was that of the plume from the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull above Garmisch-Partenkirchen (April 2010) due to the proximity of that source. The top altitude of the ash above the volcano was reported just as 9. 3 km, but the lidar measurements revealed enhanced stratospheric aerosol up to 14. 3 km. Our analysis suggests for two or three of the four measurement days the presence of a stratospheric contribution from Iceland related to quasi-horizontal transport, differing from the strong descent of the layers entering Central Europe at low altitudes. The backscatter coefficients within the first 2 km above the tropopause exceed the stratospheric background by a factor of four to five. In addition, Asian and Saharan dust layers were identified in the free troposphere, Asian dust most likely even in the stratosphere...|$|R

5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily {{controlled by the}} style of volcanic eruption. Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the <b>volcanic</b> <b>explosivity</b> <b>index</b> (VEI). Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of basaltic composition produce <105 m3 of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities (>109 m3) of ejecta into the atmosphere. Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is {{the duration of the}} eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected into the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Changes in data {{completeness}} for the Smithsonian Institution's "Volcanoes of the World" (VOTW) eruption catalogue, {{by region}} and for selected countries, are determined and utilised to estimate average eruption recurrence intervals. In the VOTW database, {{the number of}} documented volcanic eruptions has increased markedly {{since the middle of}} the last millennium. This is largely attributed to population expansion, geological investigation and improvements in detection and recording technologies, rather than an increase in volcanic activity. Simple methods, such as break-in-slope or stationarity tests, can be used to determine changes in data completeness, but often require subjective choices, introducing additional uncertainty. A Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method for assessing and determining changes in the completeness of natural hazard event catalogues is adapted to determine the completeness of the database. Data completeness is assumed to follow a step-change model, where the probability of documenting an eruption is <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Explosivity</b> Index-dependent before the change point date and 100 % after. A distribution of candidate change point dates is obtained for each region and country subset which allows uncertainty in the data completeness date to be quantified, and for uncertainty in eruption frequencies to be expressed and propagated through statistical models. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} we discuss a role of volcanic activity in Altai thermal regime. Here we analyses the sulfate and temperature data reconstructed from the natural paleoarchive – ice core from the Belukha Mountain saddle. Sulfate ice-core reconstructions can serve as volcanic markers. The both – sulfate and temperature reconstructions – are for the last 750  years. As the characteristic of volcanic activity we consider <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Explosivity</b> Index (VEI), Dust Veil Index (DVI) and Ice core volcanic index (IVI). The analysis was done using wavelet analysis and analysis of wavelet cross coherence and phase. As the result, we conclude that observed increases in {{the values of the}} indexes VEI, DVI, IVI basically correspond to decreases of temperature and increases of sulfate concentrations. This confirms the dependence of changes in the thermal regime of the Altai from volcanic activity. But in the 1750 – 1850  years period there is a delay of the changes in temperature with respect to the changes in volcanic activity. We suggest that it can be due to the superposition of the influence of solar and volcanic activity on changes in the thermal regime of Altai. </span...|$|R

(2009) reported localized temperature changes {{associated with}} the Mt Chaiten eruption in May 2008 using the deviation of GPS radio occultation temperature data from the NCEP global forecast system model. On 14 April 2010, a large scale eruption started under the glacier Eyjafjallajökull in Southern Iceland, and Puyehue-Cordón Caulle (Puyehue), in Chile, started eruption on 4 June, 2011. Here we study instantaneous and localized temperature changes with these two eruptions following the method of Wang et al. (2009). Post-eruption negative temperature anomalies at the 250 hPa plane were clearly observed in the Eyjafjallajökull eruption. In the Puyehue eruption, however, such anomalies were not so clear due possibly to insufficient accuracy of the forecast model. By comparing the temperature profiles in the downwind areas of the two eruptions, we found that significant temperature decreases occurred at ~ 10. 5 and ~ 11. 5 km altitude in the Eyjafjallajökull and the Puyehue cases, respectively. These results generally agree with Wang et al.

40|$|Volcanoes {{are complex}} {{dynamical}} systems that manifest their activity {{in a wide}} range of eruptions with different explosivity. In this paper, we propose a cellular automaton model aimed at capturing the key features of the magma ascent dynamics that reproduces the great variability of <b>volcanic</b> <b>explosivity.</b> The novelty of our approach consists in considering an eruption not as an event caused by overpressure in the magma chamber but as the result of transport of discrete magma batches from the reservoir to the surface along preformed crack networks. Since gas is lost during the ascent, the time for the rise of magma is crucial. In our model, such a time is related to the opening of connected paths of fractures in the surrounding rocks, which are described by means of a time dependent Self-Organized-Criticality field. We analyze statistical distributions of eruptions in terms of gas losses and find that eruptions with the lowest degree of explosiveness are characterized by small erupted volumes, even if they are much more likely to occur than explosive eruptions. On the contrary, explosive eruptions, which in our model essentially correspond to percolative events that directly connect the magma reservoir to the surface, are rare events that can be very huge...|$|R
40|$|Pacaya volcano is a {{persistently}} active basaltic cone complex {{located in}} the Central American Volcanic Arc in Guatemala. In May of 2010, violent <b>Volcanic</b> <b>Explosivity</b> Index- 3 (VEI- 3) eruptions caused significant topographic changes to the edifice, including a linear collapse feature 600 m long originating from the summit, the dispersion of ~ 20 cm of tephra and ash on the cone, the emplacement of a 5. 4 km long lava flow, and ~ 3 m of co-eruptive movement of the southwest flank. For this study, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images (interferograms) processed from both spaceborne Advanced Land Observing Satellite- 1 (ALOS- 1) and aerial Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data acquired between 31 May 2010 and 10 April 2014 were used to measure post-eruptive deformation events. Interferograms suggest three distinct deformation processes after the May 2010 eruptions, including: (1) subsidence of the area involved in the co-eruptive slope movement; (2) localized deformation near the summit; and (3) emplacement and subsequent subsidence of about a 5. 4 km lava flow. The detection of several different geophysical signals emphasizes the utility of measuring volcanic deformation using remote sensing techniques with broad spatial coverage. Additionally, the high spatial resolution of UAVSAR {{has proven to be}} an excellent compliment to satellite data, particularly for constraining motion components.

40|$|DOI:  10. 17014 /ijog. v 6 i 2. 116 Merapi Volcano in Central Java {{has been}} the most active volcano during Holocene time. As a strato volcano, Merapi {{exhibits}} alternating volcanic activities of effusive and explosive characters and self destruction. The <b>explosivity</b> <b>index</b> has evolved during the last ten thousand years. The effusive activities were characterized by the occurrence of lava flows, the development of lava dome, and the production of the “nuee ardente d’avalanche” called Merapi type. The explosive stage is frequently accompanied by the occurence of pyroclastic flows. The present investigation is attempted to reveal the relationship between the characteristics of lahar and the evolution of the activity of Merapi Volcano. The quantitative analysis was focused on {{the size and shape of}} the lahar components particularly that of pumice as the main indicators in 73 measured stratigraphic columns of lahar deposits. In addition, the main chemical element rim structures of hornblende identified in lahar components indicate the different lahar units. There are five lahar units and five groups of Merapi activities which can be distinguished. It can be concluded that the characteristics of lahar reflect the evolution of the activities in the past. The risk analyses of Merapi Volcano therefore can be enlarged to cover the possible hazard based on the lahar characteristics. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{geological}} {{processes by which}} materials containing high concentrations of volatile substances have been delivered {{to the surface of}} the planet Mercury throughout its history, despite global contraction, which could be expected to impede the replenishment of these materials from depth. With the aid of high-resolution data from the MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) spacecraft, I perform detailed analyses of the two types of geological features most indicative of the action of volatiles at Mercury’s surface: flat-floored depressions known as ‘hollows’, and pits and deposits thought to be the products of explosive volcanism. For hollows, I seek to clarify the nature of the substance lost to form them and the mechanisms by which this has been introduced to, and lost from, the surface recently enough to explain their pristine appearance. I produce a global catalogue of hollows, study their local associations, and investigate their spectral character, finding evidence that they form primarily by sublimation of a moderately volatile substance, potentially a sulfide, from a specific low-reflectance substrate exhumed and exposed by meteorite impacts. To better understand explosive volcanism, I investigate its longevity and the processes promoting it at specific locations. Through identifying, dating and characterising proposed pyroclastic deposits and vents, I show that putative explosive volcanism was more long-lived than voluminous effusive eruptions, that its occurrence is tectonically controlled, and that its eruptive style indicates magma storage prior to eruption, at greater depths than on the more tectonically-neutral Moon. This indicates that, rather than precluding it, global contraction favoured <b>volcanic</b> <b>explosivity</b> by promoting magma storage during which volatiles could become concentrated in the magma. Furthermore, because processes concentrating volatiles have been important in the genesis of both hollows and explosive volcanism, their occurrence does not necessarily indicate a high planetary bulk volatile fraction...|$|R
