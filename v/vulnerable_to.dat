5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E

5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> mines or torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem {{also makes it}} very <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals are among the greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E

5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based trade {{has been recorded}} since the last three millennia.

5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E

5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E
5|$|Among brachiopods {{only the}} lingulids have been fished commercially, and {{only on a}} very small scale. Brachiopods seldom settle on {{artificial}} surfaces, probably because they are <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> pollution.

5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans are <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors.

5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less <b>vulnerable</b> <b>to</b> 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|Attacking and {{destroying}} the radar chain was also difficult.
