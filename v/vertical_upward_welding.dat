40|$|The {{immiscible}} {{displacement of}} oil by {{water in a}} petroleum reservoir has been simulated in the laboratory using a consolidated porous medium constructed out of silica sand particles. Four distinct displacement flow modes were employed, namely horizontal, <b>vertical</b> <b>upward,</b> <b>vertical</b> downward, and transverse. Experiments were carried out by displacing the oil phase (heavy paraffin oil) by the aqueous phase (dyed glycerol solution) at different oil/water viscosity ratios, at different flow rates, and in the presence and absence of connate water (connate water is the name given to the very small amount of water that occurs naturally in petroleum reservoirs). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of viscosity ratio, flow rate, and flow mode on the oil recovery efficiency. In the absence of connate water, a decrease in the oil recovery is observed when the oil/water viscosity ratio increases for all four flow modes but the displacement patterns are different for each flow mode. In the presence of connate water, the dependence of oil recovery on viscosity ratio is similar although in this case the displacement patterns are almost indistinguishable for the four different flow modes on account of coalescence of the connate water phase with the displacing aqueous phase. Without connate water, the highest recovery is obtained in the <b>vertical</b> <b>upward</b> mode where the buoyancy forces stabilize the displacement process. Conversely, in the vertical downward flow mode, the instability promoted by gravity leads to a low recovery. Comparison of the results obtained with and without connate water shows that connate water has a negative effect on the recovery and, moreover, that the synergistic effect between the viscosity ratio and the connate water reduces the oil recovery efficiency significantly...|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} for the speed of {{propagation}} of kinematic waves in <b>vertical</b> <b>upward,</b> bubbly oil-in-water flows has been proposed. The new kinematic wave model {{has been used in}} conjunction with (i) appropriate values for the `distribution parameter' C 0, the single-droplet terminal rise velocity vt 0 and an exponent n, obtained from a drift velocity model; (ii) a statistical relationship for the quantity αUh(dC 0 /dα); and (iii) measurements of a cross correlation velocity Ucc and the volume fraction of oil α to make predictions of the superficial velocities of the mixture, the oil and the water in <b>vertical</b> <b>upward,</b> bubbly oil-in-water flows. The systematic errors in these predicted values of the superficial velocities of the mixture, the oil and the water were 0. 16, - 0. 04 and 0. 04 %, respectively. The kinematic wave model can thus be used in conjunction with a cross correlation flow meter for accurate measurement of flow rates in vertical oil wells. It was inferred from the kinematic wave model and the experimental data that, for low values of the volume fraction of oil α, the distribution parameter C 0 decreases rapidly with increasing α. At higher values of α the decrease in the value of C 0 with increasing α is less marked. This result is consistent with the physical explanation that, at low values of α, the oil droplets tend to preferentially accumulate in the relatively fast moving regions of the flow. As α increases the oil droplets become more uniformly distributed amongst the faster and slower moving regions of the flow...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the gap in}} {{available}} information and the need of the industries such as oil and gas production, energy, and food processing, this study focuses on the two phase flows around bends in process pipe lines. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the influence of 90 ° bends on the gas-liquid two phase flow behaviour in vertical and horizontal orientations using advanced two-phase flow measuring techniques. An experimental study has been conducted using silicone oil with a viscosity of 5 mPa. s and air to examine the transitional flows around 90 ° bends of 68 mm internal diameter (ID) with different configurations. Experiments were conducted at ambient conditions in an open system which consists of a 68 mm ID riser of 4. 5 m long, <b>vertical</b> <b>upward</b> 90 ° bend and two horizontal sections of a 9. 2 m and 5. 5 m long in series with a horizontal 90 ° bend in between. The experimental matrix comprises 60 combinations of gas and liquid superficial velocities, ranging from 0. 045 m. s- 1 to 3. 21 m. s- 1 and 0. 15 m. s- 1 to 0. 53 m. s- 1 respectively. The phase distributions within the pipes were measured using Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) and Wire Mesh Sensors (WMS). The behaviour of the flow was examined qualitatively using high speed imaging. To study the flow development in the riser, both ECT and WMS were placed in series and moved along three axial locations downstream of the mixing section. During the experiments at the bends, the ECT was kept immediately upstream while the WMS was moved to different positions downstream of the bend. The cross-sectional void fraction time series from the ECT and the WMS were used to quantify the main hydrodynamic parameters of the flow including cross-sectional averaged void fraction, bubble size distribution, radial void fraction profiles, slug length, slug frequency, void fraction in liquid slugs, and the slug bubble velocity. Results were compared against the available slug flow correlations. The results show that the phases separate shortly after the vertical to horizontal bend leading to stratified or wavy stratified flow. Beyond a certain threshold of the gas flow rate and liquid level, onset of slugs can be observed at a certain distance downstream of the <b>vertical</b> <b>upward</b> bend. This work suggests that the formation of hydrodynamic slugs downstream of the <b>vertical</b> <b>upward</b> bend is independent of the inlet conditions upstream. The horizontal bend, unlike the <b>vertical</b> <b>upward</b> bend, has a minor influence on the flow evolution, particularly slug flow. This is due to the influence of gravitational force on phase separation and its subsequent effect on the change of momentum in the vertical bend. The flow structures, mainly slugs and disturbance waves, are slightly accelerated as they pass through the horizontal bend with minimum change to the structure frequency and gas holdup within liquid slugs. Most of the existing correlations do not predict the measured void fractions in this work as those correlations were essentially limited to the conditions they were developed for as the basis of them lies in the curve fitting. In this work, the higher viscosity and lower surface tension led to higher gas holdup in liquid slugs causing the discrepancy...|$|R
