50|$|The {{computer}} and <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> {{were designed by}} Gerry Karr. The computer runs the game's computer code, watches the user's inputs, runs the sound generator, and controls the <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> to make the screen drawings. The <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> is an all-analog design using two integrators: X and Y. The computer sets the integration rates using a digital-to-analog converter. The computer controls the integration time by momentarily closing electronic analog switches within the operational-amplifier based integrator circuits. Voltage ramps are produced that the monitor uses to steer the electron beam over {{the face of the}} phosphor screen of the cathode ray tube. Another signal is generated that controls the brightness of the line.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{communications}} systems, {{it is no longer}} possible to adequately test these systems with traditional analog signal generators. This has {{led to the development of}} the <b>vector</b> signal <b>generator,</b> which is also known as a digital signal generator. These signal generators are capable of generating digitally-modulated radio signals that may use any of a large number of digital modulation formats such as QAM, QPSK, FSK, BPSK, and OFDM. In addition, since modern commercial digital communication systems are almost all based on well-defined industry standards, many <b>vector</b> signal <b>generators</b> can generate signals based on these standards. Examples include GSM, W-CDMA (UMTS), CDMA2000, LTE, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16). In contrast, military communication systems such as JTRS, which place a great deal of importance on robustness and information security, typically use very proprietary methods. To test these types of communication systems, users will often create their own custom waveforms and download them into the <b>vector</b> signal <b>generator</b> to create the desired test signal.|$|R
50|$|Back in 1909, Benny is {{scratched}} {{by one of}} the time-travelling Charrls and is implanted with an egg. This has {{the effect}} of placing her {{under the control of the}} Charrl, causing her to replace the missing Time <b>Vector</b> <b>Generator</b> in the TARDIS and reunite it with its other half in the future. This also stabilizes the Great Divide and allows Jared Khan, a Charrel agent, to attempt to use the Great Divide to give him immortality. The TARDIS time rams its other half and sends it and Khan back to Siberia 1908, where it explodes, causing the Tunguska event.|$|E
50|$|Jamie and Zoe get back, and Flannigan {{takes them}} to the control room. He is {{overwhelmed}} by Leo and Enrico Casali, the communications officer, and his conditioning is broken. The Doctor is cornered in the powerhouse by the two Cybermen and they reveal their plans to him. When they try to destroy him, he electrocutes one. A large group of Cybermen start spacewalking towards the Wheel. Jamie and Flannigan go to the loading bay and free Vallance from cyber-control. Flannigan uses quick-setting plastic in a fire extinguisher to kill the last Cyberman and then turns on the deflector shield, which deflects the Cybermen into space. The Doctor uses the time <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> to boost {{the power of the}} x-ray laser and destroys the advancing Cybership.|$|E
50|$|When Sutherland {{moved to}} the University of Utah in the late 1960s, work on {{integrating}} the various components into a single HMD system was begun. By {{the end of the}} decade, the first fully functional integrated HMD system was operational. The first display application was a cube suspended in the air in front of the user. The system itself consisted of six subsystems: a clipping divider, matrix multiplier, <b>vector</b> <b>generator,</b> headset, head position sensor, and a general-purpose computer—which would make these the components of the first virtual reality machine as we know them today. The unit was partially see-through, so the users were not completely cut off from their surroundings. This translucence combined with the other features in their infancy is why the system is often cited as a precursor to augmented reality technology as well.|$|E

50|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube is a Samsung model 240RB40 {{monochrome}} unit measuring 9 × 11 inches, displaying a picture of 240 mm diagonal; it is an off-the-shelf picture tube manufactured for small black/white television sets. The brightness of the CRT is controlled using a circular knob {{on the back of}} the display. A vector CRT display such as the one in the Vectrex does not require a special tube, and differs from standard raster-based television sets only in the control circuits. Rather than use sawtooth waves to direct the internal electron beam in a raster pattern, computer-controlled integrators feed linear amplifiers to drive the deflection yoke. This yoke has similar, if not identical inductances, unlike a TV deflection yoke. The yoke uses a standard TV core. The high-voltage transformer also uses a standard core and bobbin. There is special circuitry to turn off the electron beam if the <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> stops or fails. This prevents burning of the screen's phosphors. This design is a great deal smaller than the electronics found in the free-standing, full-sized Asteroids.|$|E
50|$|Weighted {{down with}} guilt and seeking to free {{himself from his}} past, the Doctor has {{departed}} from the TARDIS in {{a subset of the}} ship which takes the form of Lao Tzu’s Jade Pagoda. Ruby isn’t sure what to make of the Doctor, but accompanies him when he finds a maintenance shaft leading out of the engine room up to the bridge. There, the captain and first mate also conclude that the Doctor must be a stowaway, and the Doctor, seeking to prove his credentials, learns that they are near Snowcap Tracking Station and asks to speak to General Cutler. It isn’t the same Cutler he was somehow expecting, but she proves to be very interested in hearing {{what he has to say}} for himself. Ruby still doesn’t believe the Doctor’s claim to be a time traveller until she accompanies him into the Jade Pagoda, where he finds that his companions have disconnected the main TARDIS’ Time <b>Vector</b> <b>Generator.</b> When he puts it back in place the Jade Pagoda’s interior dimensions are restored, much to Ruby’s shock, but due to the disconnection of the TVG, the Jade Pagoda’s structure is degrading, and it will be forced to return to the parent body of the TARDIS prematurely.|$|E
50|$|The Three Rivers Computer Corporation (3RCC) was a spinoff {{from the}} Research Engineering Laboratory of the Computer Science Department of Carnegie-Mellon University, and {{was founded in}} May 1974 by Brian S. Rosen, James R. Teter, William H. Broadley, J. Stanley Kriz, D. Raj Reddy and Paul G. Newbury in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States to {{manufacture}} advanced technology computer displays, peripherals, and systems. Early products included: the GDP/2A Graphics Display processor with high speed <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> capable of drawing in excess of 50,000 vectors at 60 Hz refresh rates; a CVD/2 Color Video Display System that displayed a full color raster scanned image with a unique data compression algorithm capable of full frame animation display; ADA-16 Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog converters for high fidelity music and speech research, and a UMB-11 Unibus Monitor that was a low-cost test instrument for PDP-11 series minicomputers. In 1979, the company launched its principal products, a line of workstation computers called PERQ, which were single-user high performance workstations {{with the power of}} a medium-scale mainframe computer from that era coupled with a versatile graphics display. In the summer of 1980, the company divested itself of all activities other than those related to PERQ. From 1981 onwards, 3RCC developed and produced the PERQ jointly with ICL in the United Kingdom. 3RCC changed its name to PERQ Systems Corporation in 1984, but became insolvent in 1985.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{implementation}} of a system for analyzing circuits {{with respect to their}} path-delay fault testability is presented. It includes a path-delay fault simulator, and an ATPG for path-delay faults combined into a test tool. The test tool is used to evaluate the performance of several different test <b>vector</b> <b>generators.</b> The test generators exploit weighted pseudo-random stimuli generation, based on arithmetic BIST and SIC patterns. The main goal is to find efficient heuristics that improves path-delay fault detection efficiency in terms of test time. We show that weighted ABIST stimuli are productive for detecting the K-longest path-delay faults for most circuits. On the average, we obtained fault coverage of 92. 6 % for the 20. 000 longest paths on iscas’ 85 circuits. Index Terms Built-in testing, Fault diagnosis, Automatic testing...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a framework for}} constrained simulation-vector generation in an industry setting. The framework consists of two key components: the constraint compiler and the <b>vector</b> <b>generator.</b> The constraint compiler employs various techniques, including prioritization, partitioning, extraction, and decomposition, to minimize the internal representation of the constraints, and thus the complexity of constraint solving. The <b>vector</b> <b>generator</b> then uses the compiled data together with input biasing to generate random simulation vectors. Constraints and input biases are treated in a unified manner in the <b>vector</b> <b>generator.</b> Although there are many alternative ways of generating vectors from constraints, the framework uniquely suits a practical constrained verification environment because {{of its ability to}} handle complicated constraints and its seamless treatment of constraints and biases. We illustrate the effectiveness of the framework with real examples from commercial designs. ...|$|E
