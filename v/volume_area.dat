40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} influencing the mode of laser radiation propagating in a medium (9). In the method, before the medium (9) is used, the index of refraction is modified in a plurality of <b>volume</b> <b>areas</b> (21) within the medium (9) by laser pulses for which the medium (9) is transparent, by adjusting {{the intensity of the}} laser pulses locally in said <b>volume</b> <b>areas</b> (8) to a value at which non-linear absorption occurs in the medium (9). To this end, the selected <b>volume</b> <b>areas</b> (21) are spaced apart from one another in the direction of propagation and/or obliquely with respect to the direction of propagation of the optical radiation. The method according to the invention can be used to easily and cost-effectively influence the modes of the optical radiation propagating in the medium, without having to use additional optical elements with additional adjustment complexity for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{machine vision}} system for estimating {{shape and size}} of pomegranates was developed. The system allows the estimation of <b>volume,</b> surface <b>area,</b> and weight of the fruit using prediction equations developed from the relationship between projected area and shape and size. This procedure resulted in excellent values of the coefficient of determination {{and can be used}} to estimate <b>volume,</b> surface <b>area,</b> and weight of Banati and Manfaluti pomegranates. The analysis of variance indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in shape between Bana and Manfalu cul vars at the 95 % confidence level. A power law equation was obtained to describe the relationship between <b>volume,</b> surface <b>area,</b> and weight and the projected areas. The average measurement error of prediction was in the 1. 5, 0. 7 and 2. 0 % range for <b>volume,</b> surface <b>area,</b> and weight of Bana pomegranate, respectively. The Manfaluti pomegranate had average measurement errors in the range of 1. 1, 1. 4 and 3. 2 % for <b>volume,</b> surface <b>area,</b> and weight, respectively...|$|R

But the location of the viewpoint relative to the boundary would or could be different. However, if the room were non-convex (for example, an L-shaped or partitioned room), then there would be many isovists whose <b>volume</b> (<b>area)</b> would be less than that of the whole room, and perhaps some that were the whole room; and many would have different, perhaps unique shapes: large and small, narrow and wide, centric and eccentric, whole and shredded.|$|E
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about Qin dynasty mathematics, or before, due to the burning of books and burying of scholars, circa 213-210 BCE.

Emperor Qin Shihuang （秦始皇） ordered many men to build large, lifesize statues for the palace tomb along with other temples and shrines, and {{the shape of the}} tomb was designed with geometric skills of architecture.

5000|$|<b>Volume,</b> <b>Area,</b> Dihedral Angle Reporter (VADAR) is a freely {{available}} {{protein structure}} validation web server {{that was developed}} as a collaboration between Dr. Brian Sykes and Dr. David Wishart at the University of Alberta. [...] VADAR consists of >15 different algorithms and programs for assessing and validating peptide and protein structures from their PDB coordinate data. VADAR is capable of determining secondary structure (using three different algorithms), identifying and classifying six different types of beta turns, determining and calculating the strength of C=O -- N-H hydrogen bonds, calculating residue-specific accessible surface areas (ASA), calculating residue volumes, determining backbone and side chain torsion angles (phi, psi, omega and chi angles), assessing local structure quality (through numerous quality indices), evaluating global structure quality and identifying residue “outliers” (residues with unusual structural features). The results have been validated through extensive comparison to published data and careful visual inspection. VADAR produces both text and graphical output {{with most of the}} quantitative data presented in easily viewed tables. In particular, VADAR’s output is presented in a vertical, tabular format with most of the sequence data, residue numbering and any other calculated property or feature presented from top to bottom, rather than from left to right.|$|E
