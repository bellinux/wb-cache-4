In this study, we examined whether FES to the paralyzed laryngeal adductor muscles improves the <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> impaired by unilateral laryngeal paralysis. We confirmed that the FES to the paralyzed thyroarytenoid muscle (TA) induced the adduction of vocal fold in decerebrate cats. Electrical stimulation delivered to periaqueductal grey (PAG) induced vocalization in the cats with unilateral laryngeal paralysis. We estimated the changes in duration of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds,</b> subglottic pressure, and quality of voice during vocalization with or without FES to the paralyzed TA muscle. The duration of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> was prolonged by delivering the FES to paralyzed laryngeal adductor TA muscle. The subglottic pressure increased during vocalization with FES. The intensity of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> increased, and the quality of <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> improved with FES. These results suggested that the FES to paralyzed adductor TA muscle could be expected {{to improve the quality of}} <b>voice</b> <b>sounds</b> in the animals with unilateral laryngeal paralysis. This study indicates the possibility that FES to the paralyzed laryngeal adductor muscles is accepted as a new therapy for patients with unilateral laryngeal paralysis...|$|R

5000|$|The IPA {{diacritics}} under-ring and subscript wedge, {{commonly called}} [...] "voiceless" [...] and [...] "voiced", are sometimes {{added to the}} symbol for a <b>voiced</b> <b>sound</b> to indicate more lax/open (slack) and tense/closed (stiff) states of the glottis, respectively. (Ironically, adding the 'voicing' diacritic to the symbol for a voiced consonant indicates less modal voicing, not more, because a modally <b>voiced</b> <b>sound</b> is already fully voiced, at its sweet spot, and any further tension in the vocal cords dampens their vibration.) ...|$|E

50|$|Aphonia {{is defined}} as the {{inability}} to produce <b>voiced</b> <b>sound.</b> A primary cause of aphonia is bilateral disruption of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which supplies nearly all the muscles in the larynx.

5000|$|Alaryngeal {{speech is}} speech made using sources {{other than the}} glottis in the larynx to create <b>voiced</b> <b>sound.</b> There are three types: esophageal, buccal, and {{pharyngeal}} speech. Each of these uses an alternative method of creating speech-like phonation to that normally provided by the vocal cords. These forms of alaryngeal speech are also called [...] "pseudo-voices".|$|E

5000|$|The eSpeakNG {{synthesizer}} creates voiced speech sounds such as vowels and sonorant consonants by {{additive synthesis}} adding together sine waves {{to make the}} total sound. Unvoiced consonants e.g. s are made by playing recorded sounds., because they are rich in harmonics, which makes additive synthesis less effective. Voiced consonants such as /z/ are made by mixing a synthesized <b>voiced</b> <b>sound</b> with a recorded sample of unvoiced sound.|$|E

Thumb action of the opposite hand (known as cross-shifting) is used to type the characters representing a <b>voiced</b> <b>sound,</b> written in hiragana by adding a diacritic mark (dakuten) on the corresponding voiceless sound characters.

5000|$|What can be {{contracted}} {{is dependent}} upon two major factors, the sound which begins the contracted syllable, and {{the stress of the}} syllable. In order for a syllable to be contracted, it must begin with a +sonorant consonant, that is, a <b>voiced</b> <b>sound</b> with a relatively free passage of air. In Yuchi, this includes sounds such as [...] (where [...] indicates a glottallized sound), the fricative , and [...] A syllable must also be unstressed in order to contract.|$|E
50|$|The basic Mon script {{contains}} 35 consonants (including a null consonant), {{and numerous}} diacritics for vowels; individual alphabets may add additional letters. It makes prominent use of consonant stacking, particularly for Pali-derived vocabulary. There are {{two classes of}} consonant, 'clear' and 'breathy' (light and medium grey in the table below), which have different inherent vowels and affect the values of vowel diacritics differently. The class of the consonant originally depended on whether it represented a voiceless or a <b>voiced</b> <b>sound</b> in Pali.|$|E
