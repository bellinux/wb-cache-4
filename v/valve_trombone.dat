25|$|By {{the time}} the {{trombone}} gained a footing in the orchestra and opera, trombonists were no longer usually employed by a cathedral or court orchestra, and so were expected to provide their own instrument. Military musicians were provided with instruments, and instruments like the long F or E bass trombone remained in military use until around the First World War. However, orchestral musicians adopted the trombone version with the widest range that they could easily apply {{to any of the}} three trombone parts that typically appeared in scores—the tenor trombone. The appearance of valve trombones in the mid-19th century did little to alter the make-up of the orchestral trombone section; though it was ousted from orchestras in Germany and France, the <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> remained popular almost entirely to the exclusion of the slide instrument in countries such as Italy and Bohemia, and composers such as Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini, Bedřich Smetana, and Antonín Dvořák scored for a <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> section.|$|E
25|$|The {{trombone}} is {{a musical}} instrument in the brass family. Like all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Nearly all trombones have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies {{the length of the}} instrument to change the pitch. Many modern trombone models also utilize a rotary valve as a means to lower pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> and superbone have three valves like those on the trumpet.|$|E
50|$|Vienna <b>valve</b> <b>trombones</b> use Vienna <b>Valves</b> {{which were}} one of the {{earliest}} valve systems used in wind instruments. These valves were first publicly reported in 1815 and <b>valved</b> <b>trombones</b> were first introduced in the late 1830s.|$|R

25|$|Founded by {{clarinet}}ist Juan de Dios Alfonso, {{who moved}} to Havana, where he played clarinet in Feliciano Ramos's band La Unión in 1856, and directed La Almendares in 1859. It is not quite clear when he formed La Flor de Cuba, which {{became one of the}} most popular in the middle of the 19th century. They played contradanzas, and other dances of the time. The orchestra was a típica, with cornet, trombone, ophicleide, two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and güíro. The ophicleide (ophicleide) was a sort of bass bugle with keys, invented in 1817; the t-bone would be a <b>valve</b> <b>trombone.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 'slide', {{the most}} {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} trombone (cf. <b>valve</b> <b>trombone),</b> allows the player to extend {{the length of the}} air column, lowering the pitch. To prevent friction from slowing the action of the slide, additional sleeves were developed during the Renaissance, and these stockings were soldered onto the ends of the inner slide tubes. Nowadays, the stockings are incorporated into the manufacturing process of the inner slide tubes and represent a fractional widening of the tube to accommodate the necessary method of alleviating friction. This part of the slide must be lubricated frequently. Additional tubing connects the slide to the bell of the instrument through a neckpipe, and bell or back bow (U-bend). The joint connecting the slide and bell sections is furnished with a ferrule to secure the connection of the two parts of the instrument, though older models from the early 20th century and before were usually equipped with friction joints and no ancillary mechanism to tighten the joint.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} German and Austrian brass instruments, rotary valves {{are used to}} the {{exclusion}} of almost all other types of valve, even in <b>valve</b> <b>trombones.</b> Other features often found on German trombones include long water keys and snake decorations on the slide and bell U-bows.|$|R
25|$|Slide brass {{instruments}} use a slide {{to change the}} length of tubing. The main instruments in this category are the <b>trombone</b> family, though <b>valve</b> <b>trombones</b> are occasionally used, especially in jazz. The trombone family's ancestor, the sackbut, and the folk instrument bazooka {{are also in the}} slide family.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, Olds was {{producing}} trumpets, cornets, slide and <b>valve</b> <b>trombones,</b> alto horns, mellophones, french horns, euphoniums, tubas and sousaphones. They also supplied imported woodwind {{instruments in the}} Ambassador line. Olds was the second U.S. maker to have produced over one million brass instruments. Increases in volume were accompanied by a lessening in quality, however.|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Ingram {{designed}} a B♭ trumpet for the Jupiter Band Instrument company. [...] This trumpet is the XO Series 1600I model, {{known as the}} I-horn, and is the trumpet he uses exclusively. He also performs with the Jupiter XO Series professional flugelhorn and the Jupiter XO Series professional 4-valve B-flat/A piccolo trumpet (Jupiter 1700RS). For fun, he also plays the Jupiter 528L <b>valve</b> <b>trombone.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{trombone}} {{was further}} improved in the 19th century {{with the addition}} of [...] "stockings" [...] {{at the end of the}} inner slide to reduce friction, the development of the water key to expel condensation from the horn, and the occasional addition of a valve that, intentionally, only was to be set on or off, but later was to become the now regular F-valve. Additionally, the <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> came around the 1850s shortly after the invention of valves, and was in common use in Italy and Austria in the second half of the century.|$|E
2500|$|While the brass-only {{configuration}} {{has been}} unvarying since 1934, the instrumentation has {{been subject to}} experimentation over the years. Around 1938, slide trombones {{were removed from the}} band for fear they could not easily navigate the difficult Script Ohio drill. Trombones were originally replaced by tenor horns, and then eventually by the King 3B <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> - a <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> wrapped as a Euphonium - earning the name [...] "Trombonium." [...] By 1970, the band adopted the large-bore Conn 90G, prepared by Conn at the OSUMB's instigation. Slide trombones returned to the band in 1980, with the introduction of Bach Model 36 Stradivarius small shank tenor trombones. Tromboniums last marched in the varsity OSUMB block at the 1982 Alumni Reunion game, but continue to be used by Alumni members of the band. In 1997, the band converted the alto voice of the band from Eb Alto horns, to F Mellophones. Several factors including instrument quality and durability, as well as tone projection, were cited in the switch. The last Eb Alto horns purchased by the OSUMB were Yamaha YAH-203's. The band switched to Getzen G4410 F Mellophones, and continued to use those until 2000, when Getzen discontinued that instrument. The band switched to King 1120SP F Mellophones, and slowly phased these, along with the King 1121SP, which is the newest version of King Mellophone, through 2006. All Getzen Mellophones are now used by Alumni Band or the OSU Athletic Band. In 1999, Dr. Jon Woods, a trombone player himself, added Bass Trombones to the trombone section. This was done in an effort to round out the trombone choir, and to give a bit of an edge to Sousaphone parts in climactic music. The first model, and to date, only model of Bass Trombone used by the OSUMB is the Conn 110H. In 2008, the band received a generous donation which allowed the entire high brass section (Eb Cornets, Trumpets, and Flugelhorns) to be outfitted with new Yamaha Xeno model instruments. These horns greatly influenced the sound of the band, as previous models of trumpets and flugelhorns were student level models, which typically are not constructed with the same quality as professional model instruments, such as the Xeno line. In 2013, the band has begun a switch from King 2104SP tenor trombones to a special order Conn 8HY model.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered trombones today are the tenor and bass, though {{as with many}} other Renaissance instruments, the trombone has been built in sizes from piccolo to contrabass. Trombones are usually constructed with a slide {{that is used to}} change the pitch. [...] <b>Valve</b> <b>trombones</b> use three <b>valves</b> (singly or in combination) instead of the slide. The valves follow the same schema as other valved instruments-the first valve lowers the pitch by one step, the second valve by a half-step, and the third valve by one and a half steps.|$|R

[...] "The Lizard", an improvisation recorded in the studio for Regal Zonophone Records in June, was Bell's first composition. Another early recording was his composition, [...] "Czechoslovak Journey", which was started in his studio in Bourke Street, Melbourne and recorded together with 14 other tracks for Czechoslovak Journey by Supraphon in Prague on 23 September and 13 November 1947 and released in 1981 on LP.|$|E
50|$|Some passages, {{particularly}} fast musical figures, {{are easier}} to execute on a <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> than on a slide trombone. Many players consider the tone of a <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> to be stuffier and less open. Therefore, it is not common in orchestral settings, though Giuseppe Verdi in particular made extensive use of {{the ability of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> to negotiate its way through fast passages. As the B tenor <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> uses the same fingering as the B trumpet, it is occasionally a doubling instrument for jazz trumpeters. Notable jazz musicians who play the B tenor <b>valve</b> <b>trombone</b> include Maynard Ferguson, Bob Brookmeyer, Clifford Thornton, Juan Tizol of the Duke Ellington Orchestra, Rob McConnell and Bob Enevoldsen.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of valve seen for valve {{attachments}} is the rotary <b>valve.</b> Some <b>trombones</b> have piston <b>valves</b> used instead of rotary valves for valve attachments, but it is very rare and is today considered unconventional. Many variations of the rotary valve have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer valve or axial-flow Valve, the Hagmann valve, the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional rotary valve would allow. Many of these new <b>trombone</b> <b>valve</b> designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard rotary valve remains the most common for <b>trombone</b> <b>valve</b> attachments.|$|R

25|$|The two valves on a bass {{trombone}} {{can either}} be independent or dependent. Double rotor dependent <b>valve</b> bass <b>trombones</b> were created in the late 1950s, and double rotor independent <b>valve</b> bass <b>trombones</b> were created in the late 1960s/early 1970s. Dependent means that the second valve only works when used {{in combination with the}} first, as it is located directly on the F- or E-attachment tubing. Newer bass trombones have independent (in-line) valves instead, meaning that the second valve is located on the neckpipe of the instrument and can therefore operate independently of the other. Contrabass trombones also can have <b>valve</b> attachments. Contrabass <b>trombones</b> in the key of F typically have two valves tuned to C and D respectively. Contrabass trombones in B on the other hand typically only have one valve, which is tuned to F, though some have a second valve tuned to G.|$|R
