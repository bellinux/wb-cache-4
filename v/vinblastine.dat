Commonly used doxorubicin-containing regimens are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC), ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, <b>vinblastine,</b> dacarbazine), BEACOPP, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide).|$|E
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and <b>vinblastine,</b> used as anti-cancer drugs, were discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|More than 80percent of Madagascar's 14,883 {{plant species}} are found {{nowhere else in}} the world, {{including}} five plant families. The family Didiereaceae, composed of four genera and 11 species, {{is limited to the}} spiny forests of southwestern Madagascar. Four-fifths of the world's Pachypodium species are endemic to the island. Three-fourths of Madagascar's 860 orchid species are found here alone, as are six of the world's nine baobab species. The island is home to around 170 palm species, three times as many as on all of mainland Africa; 165 of them are endemic. Many native plant species are used as herbal remedies for a variety of afflictions. The drugs <b>vinblastine</b> and vincristine are vinca alkaloids, used to treat Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, and other cancers, were derived from the Madagascar periwinkle. The traveler's palm, known locally as ravinala and endemic to the eastern rain forests, is highly iconic of Madagascar and is featured in the national emblem as well as the Air Madagascar logo.|$|E
5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and <b>vinblastine,</b> the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Rosy ("Malagasy") periwinkle: In 1958, Eli Lilly began {{research}} of Malagasy rosy periwinkle, {{hoping to find}} it would help {{in the administration of}} insulin. This effort was unsuccessful, but additional research led to the discovery of the chemotherapy agents <b>vinblastine</b> and vincristine, the latter of which is credited with increasing the survival rate for childhood leukemia from 20 to 80 percent.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{chemotherapy}} are gonadotoxic and may cause infertility. Chemotherapies with high risk include procarbazine and other alkylating {{drugs such as}} cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and chlormethine. Drugs with medium risk include doxorubicin and platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin. On the other hand, therapies with low risk of gonadotoxicity include plant derivatives such as vincristine and <b>vinblastine,</b> antibiotics such as bleomycin and dactinomycin, and antimetabolites such as methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and 5-fluorouracil.|$|E
25|$|Vinca {{alkaloids}} {{are derived}} from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (formerly known as Vinca rosea). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are natural products that include vincristine and <b>vinblastine.</b> Following {{the success of these}} drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: vinorelbine (used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer), vindesine, and vinflunine. These drugs are cell cycle-specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in S-phase and prevent proper microtubule formation required for M-phase.|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, <b>Vinblastine,</b> and Vincristine.|$|E
25|$|The rosy {{periwinkle}} case {{dates from}} the 1950s. The rosy periwinkle, while native to Madagascar, had been widely introduced into other tropical {{countries around the world}} well before the discovery of vincristine. This meant that researchers could obtain local knowledge from one country and plant samples from another. The use of the plant as a cure for diabetes was the original stimulus for research. Effectiveness in the treatment of both Hodgkin's Disease and leukemia were discovered instead. Different countries are reported as having acquired different beliefs about the medical properties of the plant. The Hodgkin's lymphoma chemotherapeutic drug <b>vinblastine</b> is derivable from the rosy periwinkle.|$|E
25|$|Between 30 and 40 {{percent of}} {{patients}} undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and <b>vinblastine,</b> the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, {{is determined by the}} choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity – in some cases motor nerves are affected, and occasionally, also, the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Bevacizumab {{can also}} be {{combined}} with platinum chemotherapy, a combination that has had positive preliminary results in PFS, but equivocal results regarding overall survival. One disadvantage to these treatments is the side effect profile, which includes {{high blood pressure and}} proteinuria. The drug can also exacerbate bowel disease, leading to fistulae or bowel perforation. Vintafolide, which consists of an antifolate conjugated with <b>vinblastine,</b> is also in clinical trials; it may prove beneficial because folate receptors are overexpressed in many ovarian cancers. Another potential immunotherapy is trastuzumab, which is active against tumors positive for Her2/neu mutations. Other angiogenesis inhibitors are also being investigated as potential ovarian cancer treatments. Combretastatin and pazopanib are being researched in combination for recurrent ovarian cancer. Trebananib and tasquinimod are other angiogenesis inhibitors being investigated. The monoclonal antibody farletuzumab is being researched as an adjuvant to traditional chemotherapy. Another type of immunotherapy involves vaccines, including TroVax.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} to show that ATP binding is indeed the power stroke of the transport cycle was reported. It has been shown that ATP binding induces changes in the substrate-binding properties of the TMDs. The affinity of ABC transporters for substrates has been difficult to measure directly, and indirect measurements, for instance through stimulation of ATPase activity, often reflects other rate-limiting steps. Recently, direct measurement of <b>vinblastine</b> binding to permease-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, e.g. 5’-adenylyl-β-γ-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), showed that ATP binding, in the absence of hydrolysis, is sufficient to reduce substrate-binding affinity. Also, ATP binding induces substantial conformational changes in the TMDs. Spectroscopic, protease accessibility and crosslinking studies have shown that ATP binding to the NBDs induces conformational changes in multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (MRP1), HisPMQ, LmrA, and Pgp. Two dimensional crystal structures of AMP-PNP-bound Pgp showed that the major conformational change during the transport cycle occurs upon ATP binding and that subsequent ATP hydrolysis introduces more limited changes. Rotation and tilting of transmembrane α-helices may both contribute to these conformational changes. Other studies have focused on confirming that ATP binding induces NBD closed dimer formation. Biochemical studies of intact transport complexes suggest that the conformational changes in the NBDs are relatively small. In the absence of ATP, the NBDs may be relatively flexible, but they do not involve a major reorientation of the NBDs with respect to the other domains. ATP binding induces a rigid body rotation of the two ABC subdomains with respect to each other, which allows the proper alignment of the nucleotide in the active site and interaction with the designated motifs. There is strong biochemical evidence that binding of two ATP molecules can be cooperative, that is, ATP must bind to the two active site pockets before the NBDs can dimerize and form the closed, catalytically active conformation.|$|E

2500|$|Surgery may be {{difficult}} due {{to the location of}} these tumors. Surgery alone often leads to recurrence. Chemotherapy is very effective for TVTs. The prognosis for complete remission with chemotherapy is excellent. The most common chemotherapy agents used are vincristine, <b>vinblastine,</b> and doxorubicin. [...] Radiotherapy may be required if chemotherapy does not work.|$|E
2500|$|Removal of {{the mast}} cell tumor through surgery is the {{treatment}} of choice. [...] Antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, are given prior to surgery {{to protect against the}} effects of histamine released from the tumor. [...] Wide margins (two to three centimeters) are required because of the tendency for the tumor cells to be spread out around the tumor. [...] If complete removal is not possible due to the size or location, additional treatment, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy, may be necessary. [...] Prednisone is often used to shrink the remaining tumor portion. [...] H2 blockers, such as cimetidine, protect against stomach damage from histamine. [...] <b>Vinblastine</b> and CCNU are common chemotherapy agents used to treat mast cell tumors.|$|E
2500|$|Drug {{interactions}} may be {{the result}} of altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics due to one of the drugs involved. [...] Cisplatin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, etoposide, and <b>vinblastine</b> are all potentially co-administered with docetaxel and did not modify docetaxel plasma binding in phase II studies. Cisplatin is known to have a complex interaction with some CYPs and has in some events been shown to reduce docetaxel clearance by up to 25%. Anticonvulsants induce some metabolic pathways relevant to docetaxel. CYP450 and CYP3A show increased expression in response to the use of anticonvulsants and the metabolism of docetaxel metabolite M4 is processed by these CYPs. A corresponding increase in clearance of M4 by 25% is observed in patients taking phenytoin and phenobarbital, common anticonvulsants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{substrates}} of mammalian ABCB1 {{are primarily}} planar, lipid-soluble molecules {{with one or}} more positive charges. [...] All of these substrates compete with one another for transport, suggesting that they bind to the same or overlapping sites on the protein. [...] Many of the drugs that are transported out by ABCB1 are small, nonpolar drugs that diffuse across the extracellular medium into the cytosol, where they block various cellular functions. [...] Drugs such as colchicine and <b>vinblastine,</b> which block assembly of microtubules, freely cross the membrane into the cytosol, but the export of these drugs by ABCB1 reduces their concentration in the cell. [...] Therefore, it takes a higher concentration of the drugs is required to kill the cells that express ABCB1 than those that do not express the gene.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Steven Wolff, an oncologist at Vanderbilt University, Armstrong went to the Indiana University medical center in Indianapolis [...] and decided to receive {{the rest of his}} treatment there. The standard treatment for Armstrong's cancer was a [...] "cocktail" [...] of the drugs bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (or Platinol) (BEP). The first chemotherapy cycle that Armstrong underwent included BEP, but for the three remaining cycles, he was given an alternative, <b>vinblastine</b> etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP), to avoid lung toxicity associated with bleomycin. Armstrong credited this with saving his cycling career. At Indiana University, Lawrence Einhorn had pioneered the use of cisplatin to treat testicular cancer. Armstrong's primary oncologist there was Craig Nichols. On October 25, his brain lesions which were found to contain extensive necrosis, were surgically removed by Scott A. Shapiro, a professor of neurosurgery at Indiana University.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{randomized}} controlled trials trials {{failed to find}} any improvement in survival, For example, in a trial of the treatment of advanced lung cancer, with either cisplatin and <b>vinblastine</b> or these drugs plus hydrazine sulfate, saw complete tumor regression in 4% of the hydrazine group, versus 3% in the control group, and tumor progression in 36% of the hydrazine group, versus 30% of the control group; however, none of these differences were statistically significant. Some trials even found both significantly decreased survival and significantly poorer {{quality of life in}} those patients receiving hydrazine sulfate. These consistently negative results have resulted in hydrazine sulfate being described as a [...] "disproven cancer therapy" [...] in a recent medical review. Similarly, other reviews have concluded that there is [...] "strong evidence" [...] against the use of hydrazine sulfate to treat anorexia or weight loss in cancer patients.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{high-resolution}} structure {{reported for}} an ABC exporter {{was that of}} Sav1866 from Staphylococcus aureus. Sav1866 is a homolog of multidrug ABC transporters. It shows significant sequence similarity to human ABC transporters of subfamily B that includes MDR1 and TAP1/TAP2. The ATPase activity of Sav1866 {{is known to be}} stimulated by cancer drugs such as doxorubicin, <b>vinblastine</b> and others, which suggests similar substrate specificity to P-glycoprotein and therefore a possible common mechanism of substrate translocation. Sav1866 is a homodimer of half transporters, and each subunit contains an N-terminal TMD with six helices and a C-terminal NBD. The NBDs are similar in structure to those of other ABC transporters, in which the two ATP binding sites are formed at the dimer interface between the Walker A motif of one NBD and the LSGGQ motif of the other. The ADP-bound structure of Sav1866 shows the NBDs in a closed dimer and the TM helices split into two [...] "wings" [...] oriented towards the periplasm, forming the outward-facing conformation. Each wing consists of helices TM1-2 from one subunit and TM3-6 from the other subunit. It contains long intracellular loops (ICLs or ICD) connecting the TMDs that extend beyond the lipid bilayer into the cytoplasm and interacts with the 8=D. Whereas the importers contain a short coupling helix that contact a single NBD, Sav1866 has two intracellular coupling helices, one (ICL1) contacting the NBDs of both subunits and the other (ICL2) interacting with only the opposite NBD subunit.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vinblastine</b> is a vinca {{alkaloid}} and {{a chemical}} analogue of vincristine. It binds tubulin, thereby inhibiting {{the assembly of}} microtubules. <b>Vinblastine</b> treatment causes M phase specific cell cycle arrest by disrupting microtubule assembly and proper formation of the mitotic spindle and the kinetochore, each of which are necessary for the separation of chromosomes during anaphase of mitosis. Toxicities include bone marrow suppression (which is dose-limiting), gastrointestinal toxicity, potent vesicant (blister-forming) activity, and extravasation injury (forms deep ulcers). <b>Vinblastine</b> paracrystals may be composed of tightly-packed unpolymerized tubulin or microtubules.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vinblastine</b> is {{a highly}} potent drug which also has serious side effects {{especially}} on the neurological system. Therefore, new synthetic analogues were developed {{with the goal of}} obtaining more efficient and less toxic drugs. The stereochemical configurations at C-20', C-16' and C-14' in the velbanamine portion are critical and inversion leads to loss of activity. The C-16' carboxymethyl group is important for activity since decarboxylated dimer is inactive. Structural variation at C-15'- C-20' in the velbanamine ring is well tolerated. The upper skeletal modification of <b>vinblastine</b> gave vinorelbine which shows comparable activity as that of <b>vinblastine.</b> Another analogue prepared was the difluoro derivative of vinorelbine which showed improved in vivo antitumor activity. It was discovered that fluorination at C-19' position of vinorelbine dramatically increased the in vivo activity. Most of the SAR studies involve the vindoline portion of bis-indole alkaloids because modification at C-16 and C-17 offers good opportunities for developing new analogues. The replacement of the ester group with an amide group at the C-16 resulted in the development of vindesine. Similarly replacement of the acetyl group at C-16 with L-trp-OC2H5, d-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2, L-Ala(P)-(OC2H5)2 and I-Vla(P)-(OC2H5)2 gave rise to new analogues having anti- tubulin activity. Also {{it was found that the}} vindoline's indole methyl group is a useful position to functionalize potentially and develop new, potent <b>vinblastine</b> derivatives. A new series of semi-synthetic C-16 -spiro-oxazolidine-1,3-diones prepared from 17-deacetyl <b>vinblastine</b> showed good anti-tubulin activity and lower cytotoxicity. Vinglycinate a glycinate prodrug derived from the C-17-OH group of <b>vinblastine</b> showed similar antitumor activity and toxicity as that of <b>vinblastine.</b>|$|E

Extraction is costly and yields of <b>vinblastine</b> and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed. Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16’S, C14’R stereochemistry of biologically active <b>vinblastine.</b> Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20.
