Older (pre-1970) publications, particularly in Scotland, referred to any coarse-grained volcaniclastic rock as 'agglomerate', which led to debris flow deposits, talus deposits and other types of breccia being mistaken for <b>vents.</b> <b>Agglomerates</b> {{are typically}} poorly sorted, may contain a fine ash or tuff matrix and vary from matrix to clast support. They may be monolithologic or heterolithic, and may contain some blocks of various igneous rocks. There are various differences between agglomerates and ordinary ash beds or tuffs. Agglomerates are coarser and less frequently well-bedded. Agglomerates can be non-welded or welded, such as coarse basaltic 'spatter'. They typically form proximally during Strombolian eruptions, and are common at strongly peralkaline volcanoes. Some large agglomerate deposits are deposited from pyroclastic density currents during explosive caldera-forming eruptions, such as at Santorini, Taal, and Campi Flegrei. They may be massive to crudely bedded, and can attain great thicknesses.|$|R

40|$|Reconnaissance soil {{sampling}} within the catchment of streams containing anomalous levels of copper in drainage samples {{led to the}} discovery of disseminated copper mineralisation in the Black Stockarton Moor area of Galloway, Scotland. Analysis of aeromagnetic data and of a gravity survey of the area, previously mapped as an irregular complex of dykes, suggested that the region was underlain by laminar bodies of granodiorite. Geological mapping r evealed the presence of a major Caledonian multiphase subvolcanic complex intruding LOvler Palaeozoic turbidi tes, {{to the west of the}} Criffe! granodioritic plutonic complex. An induced polarisation survey delineated an arcuate anomaly about 6 km long and the resul t s of a simultaneous geochemical soil survey showed a zone with anomalous levels of copper (> 140 ppm to 5500 ppm) in the southern part of the area to be essentially paralle l to the IP anomaly but partially displaced to the east. A series of three deep angled drill holes and nine shallow holes sited on geochemical and geophysical anomalies confirmed the widespread presence of both veinlet and disseminated pyrite and copper mineralisation of the porphyry type. The Black Stockarton Moor subvolcanic complex is a composite of minor intrusive rocks, the ear l iest phase of which, comprising porphyri te dyke swarms, granodiorite sheet intrusions, small granodiori te stocks, breccia pipes, <b>vent</b> <b>agglomerates</b> with plugs of basic rock and a few basic dykes, predates the adjacent multiphase Crlffel plutonic complex. The second phase of subvo lcanic activity postdates the plutonic rocks and comprises intense en-echelon s igmoidal swarms of porphyrite dykes sharply discordant to the earliest phase rocks. A minor third phase consists of linear porphyrite dykes closely associated with fault - ing. Chemical analysis and mineralogical examination of the borehole material indicates that regular zonation can be observed in the style and intensity of both mineralisation and hydrothermal alteration. This zonation is regular fr om west to east across the IP and soil anomalies. A propylitic alteration zone with the development of chlorite. epidote and minor sericite in igneous rocks and of calcite, quartz, jasperoid, chlorite, amphibole, epidote and albite in sedimentary rocks occurs to the wes t. Within this zone hematite gradually gives way to increasing amounts of pyrite from west t o east. The propylitic zone passes into a sericitic alteration zone where sedimentary rocks are frequently bleached and igneous rocks pink or orange-coloured containing secondary quartz, chlorite and muscovite. Pyrite is most conspicuous within rocks of the outer sericite zone, the outcrop of which coincides roughly with the axis of the IP anomaly. Further east pyrite decreases but chalcopyrite and bornite with some chalcocite become relatively conspicuous and copper levels are the highest attained (in the 400 ppm to 1100 ppm range). save for isolated highly brÂ·ecciated sections. Chemical zonation shows relative enrichment in Mn, Zn, As and Pb in the outer propyli tic zone, Ba in the serid tic 1 zone and Cu in the inner sericitic zone while As, Sb and Au are markedly concentrated with Cu and Mo in isolated brecciated section...|$|R
40|$|The Slieve Gullion {{district}} {{is the site}} of one of the four Tertiary Centres in the North-East of Ireland. The area was mapped during the Geological Survey of Ireland about 1870. Since then a number of more detailed studies of certain aspects of the geology have been carried out. Of these, the more important were the investigations of Richey and Thomas (1932), and Reynolds (1943, 1901). The Tertiary Centre is neatly inset at the south-western end of the Newry granodiorite complex, of Caledonian age. There are at least two distinct units within the Slieve Gullion centre, a ring dyke and, situated within this, a later layered complex. The ring dyke is made up of two major intrusive bodies, the Porphyritic Felsite intruded into vents opened along the ring fracture in the south-west, and a later Porphyritic Granophyre intruded into the other three-quarters of the ring fracture. (Richey, 1932). The ring intrusions were preceeded by violent explosive activity in the south-west of the complex, and within the <b>vent</b> <b>agglomerates</b> of Forkill, Richey recognised the presence of foundered masses of lavas. These Thomas showed to be petrographically similar to lavas seen at the southern edge of the Antrim Lava Sheet, some 10 miles {{to the north of the}} complex, and known to be of Tertiary age. Apart from the very close structural and other similarities with the centres of proven Tertiary age in the west of Scotland, this is the most convincing evidence available in support of a Tertiary age for the Slieve Gullion centre. From the results of a gravity survey of the north of Ireland, it is considered that the Tertiary Centres, including Slieve Gullion, are underlain by a considerable body of basic rock at a depth of four or five miles. (Cook & Murphy, 1952.) During the present investigation, the western half of the ring dyke was remapped on the scale of six inches to the mile, particular attention being paid to the Porphyritic Felsite and its associated agglomerate. Specimens collected from the ring dyke, the Central Complex of Slieve Gullion, and other of the Irish and Scottish Tertiary Centres, were examined petrographically, chemically and spectrographically at Oxford, under the supervision of Professor L. R. Wager. Newry granodiorite forms the country rock to the centre, and at several localities this has been found to be deeply rotted. The rotting is evidently pre-glaciation, since sound granodiorite may readily be found in the overlying drift. Thin sections reveal the preferred alteration of the plagioclase within the granodiorite, and it is considered that the decomposition of the granodiorite is due to hydrothermal alteration of the granodiorite during the evolution of the ring complex. The alteration does not appear to be connected with the Central Layered Complex (Reynolds, 1951). Thin sections of the gabbro from the small plugs along the south-west of the complex show this to be a relatively iron-rich gabbro. Richey demonstrated that there had been two phases of intense dynamic crushing of rocks of the ring dyke complex (Richey & Thomas, 1932), and the crushing was shown to be closely connected in place with the granophyre ring dyke. This has been verified, and it is considered to be possible to confine each phase of crushing within fairly narrow limits during the development of the ring dyke. Possible causes for the extensive crushing are examined and the suggestion is made that the crushing developed as a result of the central block of country rook within the ring dyke being pushed upwards, due to the pressure of underlying acid magma. Comparisons are made with other areas. Reynolds (1951) has advanced the suggestion that gas action played an important, and probably predominant part in the formation of the crush rocks, or Cam Lough breccias as Richey termed them. This suggestion is examined and the conclusion reached that dynamic crushing has played the more important role in the formation of the breccias. The Porphyritic Felsite, which is earlier than the extensively crushed Porphyritic Granophyre, has completely escaped the effects of dynamic crushing. This is shown to be probably accidental. Within the Forkill agglomerates the distribution of the different rock types has been mapped, and from this distribution and other considerations, it appears likely that part of the agglomerate now exposed originated at a deeper level In the vents, being brought into its present position by bodily upwards displacement by the intruding felsite, a suggestion which has also been made by Richey. Small-scale structures within the agglomerates are described and figured. These are attributed to the flow of particle-charged gases through the partially brecciated rocks. The manner of formation of the breccias is examined, and drawing on examples from others of the Tertiary Centres and using the descriptions given by Reynolds (1954) of fluidized systems of solids suspended in gases, the development of the agglomerates is traced and a sequence of decreasing explosive activity described. It is considered that Richey's suggestion that the explosive activity during which the agglomerates were formed is connected with escape of gas from the felsite magma, is correct. The writer would not go so far as to say that the escape of gas took place when the felsite was being intruded into the upper parts of the ring fracture. Within the Porphyritic Felsite a pattern of fluxion structures has been mapped, this indicates several centres of upwelling of the felsite, and strengthens Richey's conclusion that the large masses of felsite were vent intrusions. Macroscopic and microscopic structures within the felsite are described; these lead to the conclusion that the felsite was emplaced as an extremely viscous and relatively cool mass. Chemical, optical and X-ray work on the alkali feldspar phenocrysts from the felsite shows that these were originally homogenous 'high temperature' forms, which now show various stages in unmixing from sanidine-anorthoclases. Some high temperature optics are preserved in marginal specimens. From the chemical composition of phenocrysts and rocks, it appears that prior to emplacement the felsite may have been differentiated into relatively sodic and potassic parts, now reflected in slight differences between the inner and marginal parts of the felsite. Despite this, and the evidence of centres of flow banding, there is no evidence of multiple intrusion in that no internal chilled contact was found. The problem of embayments and apparent corrosion features in phenocrysts, especially quartz, is examined and the suggestion made that for the ring dyke rocks these features may equally well be due to rapid growth of the phenocrysts, though the evidence available is inconclusive either way. Fayalite is described from the felsite (and the granophyre), and the conditions suitable for the precipitation of iron-rich olivine from an acid melt are discussed. It had been suggested that the felsites were possibly welded tuffs. This is not thought to be so, but the presence of numerous fragments of phenocrysts is taken as an indication that at some stage the felsite magma may have violently disintegrated, possibly when the gases were given off to form the agglomerates. It is thought that at this stage the small sedimentary xenoliths found throughout the otherwise inclusion-free felsite, may have been incorporated at this stage. Within the Porphyritic Granophyre ring dyke a zone of inclusions has been mapped. The inclusions are practically identical chemically to their enclosing granophyre, but have a very different, and distinctive, texture consisting of quartz and idiomorphic feldspar intergrown, sometimes in spherulitic aggregates. Through the inclusions there are small pieces of granodiorite, and on Slieve Gullion some of the altered granodiorites develope somewhat similar textural features. The suggestion is made that the inclusions may represent granodiorite altered at depth by basic magma. Texturally identical inclusions are found in two of the Tertiary granites from Skye, these are described. From evidence provided by the contacts of granophyre and felsite, the granophyre would appear to have been emplaced very soon after the felsite, possibly when the inner parts were only partially solid. Reynolds has made the suggestion that the granophyres were emplaced as tuffisites, and altered to granophyre subsequently. This is discussed, and reasons advanced for rejecting her suggestion. Trace element analyses of various rocks from Slieve Gullion, Mourne, Antrim and Skye are described. Variations are found within the rock types of Slieve Gullion and Mourne, and from one to another. It is suggested that the differences may be accounted for if the rocks be considered as representing different stages in differentiation from a more basic parent, or parents. The relatively high Rb/K ratio for the Mourne rocks analysed is thought to indicate that these are extreme differentiates. The high zirconium in certain of the acid rocks from the Tertiary Centres in discussed. The concentration of Zr in the acid rocks may originate through a combination of selective remelting and assimilation of country rock by basic magma, and strong fractionation within the magma. Duplicate analyses were made of rocks from Skye that had been previously analysed for their major and trace elements. The trace element determinations were carried out at the Macaulay Institute, Aberdeen, in the first place, and the duplicates made in the Department of Geology and Mineralogy at Oxford provide a standard by which results from the two laboratories may be compared. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the Tertiary igneous rocks found within an area some twenty square miles in extent on the south-east side of the Skye central intrusion complex. The Tertiary rocks include basic lavas, a small intrusion of granophyre, the margin of the Cuillin Gabbro, and numerous minor intrusions. Extrusive rocks occupy an area of some seven square miles, and have an aggregate thickness of about 1, 000 feet. The greater part of the sequence consists of alkaline olivine basalts, but there is also one horizon of trachybasalt and thin group of picritic flows. Pyroclastic rocks are rare, being limited to one small <b>agglomerate</b> <b>vent</b> and an isolated lens of tuff. It has been found possible to divide the sequence into several mappable units based on groups of flows possessing common petrographical features. The laves which lie within half a mile of the Cuillin Gabbro have been metamorphosed by that intrusion, while an outer zone of lower temperature alteration includes the whole of the strathaird lava outcrop. Within the thermal aureole a narrow zone of pyroxene hornfels along the contact with the Gabbro is followed outwards by a broader zone charaterized by the presence of an actinolitic amphibole. Within this pyroxene hornfels zone the lavas have been thoroughly recrystalized to high temperature mineral assemblages, but within the amphibolezone equilibrium was only locally attained, and many of the lavas still posses much of their original texture and mineralogy. The transition from unmetamorphed lava to pyroxene hornfels was not accomplished by independently under its own particular pressure-temperature conditions. On the basis of both chemical and petrographical evidence it is considered probable that a small amount of silica was added to {{at least some of the}} lavas during metamorphism. The internal structure and composition of the Cuillin Gabbro do not come within the provenence of this thesis, but some attention has been given to the relationships between the Gabbro and its country rocks, especially in the neighbourhood of camasunary. In this latter area there is an extensive development of basic minor instructions pre-dating the Gabbo, and metamorphosed in a similar manner to the nearby lavas. Most of these small intrusions are emplaced into Torridonian sandstones, which locally extend up to several hundred feet from the contact, the Torridonian shows clear evidence of having been partially melted by the high temperatures induced by the intrusion of gabbro magma, and many of the early intrusions are veined and broken into fragments by the mobilized material. The vein material is chemically more basic in composition than the sediments from which it was derived, partly due to reaction with the basic minor intrusions. Parallel to the contact of the Cuillin Gabbro, in Strathaird, there is a series of irregularly shaped outer-ops of granphyre which are thought to be parts of a single intrusion exposed in the vicinity of its roof. The granophyre is fine-grained, is unusual in containing paramorphs after tridymite, and differs chemically from other Skye granitic rocks. Through there is sometimes a well-defined, chilled margin, many of the contacts against sedimentary rocks are complex and highly xenolithin. The granophyre post-dates the Cuillin Gabbro, but is earlier than the large granitic intrusions which lie to the north and north-east of the areas. One of the most impressive features of the local geology is the great profusion of north-west dykes, all but a few of which are basic in composition. Most of the dykes are later date than the Cuillin Gabbro, but their distribution shows that they are closely related to that centre. Other minor intrusions include a few acid and basic skills which are, in general, of earlier date then the dyke swarm, while basic cone-sheets occur in the vicinity of the Cuillin Gabbro and are later than most of the north-west dykes. In Strathaird, erosion to a relatively deep level allows the structural relationships between lavas, intrusions, and pre-Tertiary sediments to be more easily examined than elsewhere in Syke. Most of the sediments are of Jurassic age, and these rest uncon-formably on Torridonian sandstones. There were several phases of warping in Mesozic times, but the main period of deformation occurred after the outpouring of the lavas and gave rise to large arcuate folds. It is believed that these folds are one result of the stresses set up by the intrusion of the Cuillin Gabbro...|$|R
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of Esja {{is described}} and the chronology of the succession established {{by means of}} the geomagnetic time scale. The Esja volcanic succession is about 2. 4 km thick, and comprises olivine tholeiites (25 %), tholeiites (68 %), basaltic andesites (5 %), icelandites and rhyolites (2 %). Volcanism was active in the Esja region for just over one million years, and during this time span,. at least ten glaciations occurred in the region. The stratigraphic succession is therefore characterized by sequences of lava flows intercalated, at intervals, by thick subglacial hyaloclastite units. Two central volcanoes were active in the Esja region; the Kjalarnes volcano was active for about 0. 6 million years and was succeeded after a short interval by the Stardalur volcano, which remained active for about 0. 3 million years. Flood-basalt volcanism was concomitant with the central volcanism, and most of the olivine tholeiites are considered to have been erupted in fissures and shield volcanoes unrelated to the central volcanoes. Igneous activity apparently migrated eastwards with time, reflecting the westward crustal drift away from the active volcanic zone, which is a subaerial extension of the mid-Atlantic ridge. The volcanics are tilted and downfaulted towards the east. The irregular topography created by the glaciations in Esja repeatedly prevented lavas erupted in the active volcanic zone from spreading over the tectonically less active neighbour- hood, thus producing angular unconformities in the stratigraphic succession from which the tectonic history of the region can be read. The Esja evidence suggests that tectonic activity is chiefly restricted to the active volcanic zone, and that the crust becomes tectonically inactive soon after it has drifted away from the active zone. Intrusive activity in Esja can be divided into three phases. The oldest dykes in the region trend N 25 ÃÂ°E and contemporaneous sheets dip towards the Kjalarnes peninsula, where the intrusive activity culminated in the formation of a multiple dolerite sheet. This intrusion may have been preceded by a caldera collapse in the Kjalarnes area. After the intrusion of the Kjalarnes dolerites the regional trend of dykes changed to N 40 ÃÂ°E, and a narrow dyke swarm (representing up to 20 % dilation) cut across the Kjalarnes central volcano. The dyke swarm was succeeded by cone sheets focussing to the south of Leidhamrar, and the second phase culminated in the intrusion of large dolerite sheets in ÃÂverfell and LauganÃÂ­pa. Following a brief interval, during which flood-basalt volcanism was dominant in Esja, the Stardalur central volcano became active and, during its life span, minor intrusions were predominantly in sheet form. Caldera collapse in the Stardalur volcano was followed by the intrusion of basic cone sheets, large dolerite sheets, a sill and finally a laccolith within the caldera. Long after the caldera had been filled the caldera fault zone dominated over the regional fault pattern at depth so that basic and acid volcanics alike were erupted concentrically with and parasitically to the Stardalur caldera. Large dolerite intrusions in Esja are found chiefly within or at the boundaries of the thick hyaloclastite units, and there is evidence of dykes cutting straight through lava successions, but spreading out laterally to form sill-like bodies once they enter the less coherent hyaloclastites. A survey of the literature shows that the majority of large basic intrusions. in Iceland are accommodated in relatively soft and "structureless" host rocks, such as tuffaceous hyaloclastites, sediments, <b>vent</b> and caldera <b>agglomerates,</b> hydrothermally propylitized lavas, and "hot" and still partly liquid acid intrusive material. The majority of the large intrusions are in the form of inclined sheets, but sills and laccoliths are formed when the intrusions are emplaced at shallow levels (perhaps less than 1 km) in the crust. The coincidence of central volcanoes having a great bulk of shallow level intrusions, with positive gravity anomalies, and the sites of shallow depth to layer 3 in Iceland strongly suggests that crustal layer 3 consists mostly of basic intrusions. A comparison of the densities of primary and secondary minerals of tholeiitic rocks suggests that infilling of vesicles of porous basalt lavas by secondary minerals will not make the rock as dense as a non-porous rock of the same composition. The estimated density difference of 0. 2 g/cm 3 between crustal layers 2 and 3 can apparently not be ascribed to secondary alteration of subaerial lavas, but can readily be explained by a transition from altered lavas to non-porous intrusives. It is proposed that the sharp boundary between layers 2 and 3 results from the lavas at the base of layer 2 reaching a degree of alteration at which the rock becomes sufficiently incoherent to accommodate large basic intrusions. The "metamorphic boundary" proposed by PÃÂ¡lmason (1971) to explain the correlation between the thermal gradient and depth to layer 3 in Iceland is not therefore primarily a density boundary, but a boundary at which the lavas loose their strength as a result of alteration and host voluminous dense intrusives. The large scale features of crustal layer 3 in Iceland can be explained within the framework of this model. There is a complete range in composition from olivine tholeiites to rhyolites in the Esja volcanic succession, and the majority of the rocks contain some phenocrysts. Crystal fractionation appears to be a feasible mechanism to explain the chemical variation within at least the basaltic rocks in Esja, but whether the intermediate and acid rocks are formed by extensive fractionation or by partial melting of crustal material cannot be answered. The apparent coincidence in time of the emplacement of large basic intrusives and the commencement of intermediate and acid volcanism in eastern Esja may suggest that the rise of voluminous basic magmas has raised the thermal gradient sufficiently to produce the intermediate and acid rocks by partial melting {{at the base of the}} crust. Positive gravity anomalies associated with the Kjalarnes and Stardalur central volcanoes are attributed to high level intrusives in the core regions of the two centres. Specific gravity measurements of the chemically analysed rocks from Esja show a range of densities from about 2. 5 (rhyolite) to about 3. 15 g/cm 3 (olivine tholeiite). Local gravity anomalies commonly found associated with central volcanoes are probably due both to local concentrations of rocks of different chemistry and to a high percentage of intrusives. A comparison of the average density of the crust in eastern Iceland and that of the crust on the Iceland-Faeroe ridge suggests that a considerable part of the negative Bouguer gravity anomaly of Iceland (Einarsson 1954) can be explained in terms of geochemical differences between the volcanics of Iceland and those of the surrounding areas. The similarity of the gravity profiles from the aseismic Iceland-Faeroe ridge and from the active Reykjanes ridge to the centre of Iceland suggests that, if a hot spot contributes to the bowl-shaped gravity anomaly of Iceland (Bott et al 1971), then it is not connected with layer 4 under the Reykjanes ridge. A positive magnetic anomaly associated with the Stardalur caldera is explained in terms of a thick pile of normal polarity eruptives within the caldera being surrounded essentially by reverse polarity eruptives. The combined effects of a high magnetite content (which may be caused by unusually high partial pressure of oxygen in the melt) and a high palaeofield strength may cause the very high magnetic intensity of lavas, which give rise to a sharp maximum within the Stardalur magnetic anomaly. Assuming a common cause for three other strong magnetic anomalies, which, with Stardalur, lie on a straight line and are separated regularly in space and time, the possibility of a mantle controlled "high partial pressure of oxygen spot" migrating at half the spreading speed along the spreading axis is discussed. </p...|$|R
