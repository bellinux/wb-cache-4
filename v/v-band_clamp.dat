40|$|V-band clamps are {{utilised}} in a {{wide range}} of industries to connect together a pair of circular flanges, for ducts, pipes, turbocharger housings and even to form a joint between satellites and their delivery vehicle. In this paper, using a previously developed axisymmetric finite element model, the impact of contact pressure on the contact surface of the <b>V-band</b> <b>clamp</b> was studied and surface roughness measurements were used to investigate the distribution of contact pressure around the circumference of the V-band...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a finite element {{technique}} {{to predict the}} torsional load capacity of <b>V-band</b> <b>clamp</b> joints is presented. The development of this complex, multi-step analysis is explained and the results compared with alternate theories which ignore or take account of transverse friction in the band to flange contact region. It is shown that accounting for transverse friction yields a better comparison with the finite element results for lower coefficients of friction whilst ignoring this component gives better results for higher coefficients of friction. Torsional load capacity is shown to increase with band diameter and T-bolt tension but to be less dependent on the coefficient of friction...|$|E
40|$|<b>V-band</b> <b>clamp</b> joints {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} to connect circular flanges, for ducts, pipes and the turbocharger housing. Previous studies and research on V-bands are either purely empirical or analytical with limited applicability on the variety of V-band design and working conditions. In this paper models of the V-band are developed based on the classical theory of solid mechanics and the finite element method to study the behaviour of the V-bands under axial loading conditions. The good agreement between results from the developed FEA and the classical model support the suitability of the latter to model V-band joints with diameters greater than 110 mm under axial loading. The results from both models suggest that the axial stiffness for this V-band cross section reaches a peak value for V-bands with radius of approximately 150 mm across a wide range of coefficients of friction. Also, it is shown that the coefficient of friction and the wedge angle have a significant effect on the axial stiffness of V-bands...|$|E
40|$|Band clamps {{with a flat}} {{bottomed}} V-section {{are used}} to connect a pair of circular flanges to provide a joint with significant axial strength. Despite the wide application of <b>V-band</b> <b>clamps,</b> their behaviour is not fully understood and the ultimate axial strength is currently only available from physical testing. This physical testing has indicated that the ultimate strength is determined by {{two different types of}} structural deformation, an elastic deformation mode and a plastic deformation mode. Initial finite element analysis work has demonstrated that analysis of this class of problem is not straightforward. This paper discusses the difficulties encountered when simulating this type of component interaction where contact is highly localised and contact pressures are high and therefore presents a finite element model to predict the ultimate axial load capacity of <b>V-band</b> <b>clamps...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical method {{for determining the}} axial load distribution generated by the <b>V-band</b> <b>clamps</b> around the flanges. The method utilizes a hydraulic fixture and uniquely designed flanges. The load is measured through strain gauges and a pressure transducer. Tests were conducted successfully on a V-band and a non-uniform distribution of axial load was obtained, fitting well with the previous theoretical and finite element studies about the non-uniform loading distribution of load...|$|R
40|$|V-band {{retainers}} {{are widely}} used in the automotive, aircraft and aerospace industries to connect a pair of circular flanges to provide a joint with good axial strength and torsional rigidity. V-band retainers are manufactured using a cold rolling process. Despite their wide application, once assembled {{to a pair of}} flanges {{little is known about the}} interaction between flange and band. Moreover the failure mode of <b>V-band</b> <b>clamps</b> when applying an axial load is not fully understood...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{presents an}} analysis of the torsional loads on V-band clamps. In some applications, the relative rotational movement of the flanges connected by V-band clamps can result in catastrophic system failure. The ability to understand the factors impacting on torsional load capacity is therefore essential. In this research project, a theoretical model of a V-band joint subjected to torsional loads was developed. This model is used to identify those parameters that will impact on the joint’s reliability. An experimental investigation was conducted to validate a theoretical model using a newly developed test rig. The development and features of this test rig are presented in this report. This experimental investigation also allowed the impact of those parameters that are difficult to control, to be determined. A total of three V-bands were used with different diameters but nominally identical cross sections were studied. In the research results, the initial slip point between flanges and the <b>V-band</b> <b>clamp</b> was identified by experimentation within this research project. Different sizes of Vbands were used under boundary conditions and loads. From the simulation results it was determned that the friction effect on the V-band depends {{on the size of the}} V-band. For the largest size of V-band, there was moderate correlation of the experimental and theoretical results. For the smallest size, the results suggest that with band tightening, flange contact is localised, rather than being throughout the band’s entire circumference. The research demonstrated the significant relevance of the band and flanges’ contact points and the coefficient of friction, especially that between the flanges, on the V-band clamp’s theoretical torsional load capacit...|$|E
40|$|<b>V-band</b> <b>clamps</b> {{offer an}} {{efficient}} clamping solution in diverse applications including process equipment, exhaust systems and air handling. This paper studies {{the distribution of}} interface contact pressure between the V-band and flange when the coupling is established. The determination of the contact area and pressure distribution in a joint is essential information, as it determines {{the integrity of the}} coupling. A three dimensional finite element model has been developed for this purpose. Contrary to the previous assumption in developing axisymmetric models, the 3 D results showed that the contact pressure is non-uniform around the circumference of V-band with maximum contact pressure near the T-bolt area. This is in agreement with the theory in the literature. The presence and magnitude of friction has a noticeable influence on the form of the interface pressure distribution curve. It is also shown that the diameter of the band interacts with the effect of friction...|$|R
40|$|<b>V-Band</b> <b>Clamps</b> are {{manufactured}} using a cold roll forming process consisting of six passes which plastically deform an initially flat strip by bending {{to produce the}} band’s V-section. In this paper a new method of validating numerically predicted plastic deformation in a cold formed metal strip is presented. Tensile testing of samples of the band’s material was used to obtain a direct link between plastic strain and work hardness of this particular material. Using this correlation, the equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) values predicted by finite element simulations were converted into hardness values. These values were compared to experimental work, in which samples of each pass of the roll forming process were taken to determine the work hardness in the {{cross section of the}} V-band using a micro-hardness machine. The error in strain predicted by the numerical method and hardness obtained by testing was found to be between 0. 4 % and 16. 9 %. This error was mainly due to uncertainty in material properties and the accuracy of the measurement technique. Compared to the more classical approach of measuring strain distribution with strain gauges, this method is more precise and accurate, as it is able to pick up even small changes in strain distribution...|$|R
40|$|Using {{manipulators}} with a fixed configuration {{for specific}} tasks is appropriate when the task requirements are known beforehand. However, in less predictable situations, {{such as an}} outdoor construction site or aboard a space station, a manipulator system requires {{a wide range of}} capabilities, probably beyond the limitations of a single, fixed-configuration manipulator. To fulfill this need, researchers have been working on a Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator System (RMMS). Researchers have designed and are constructing a prototype RMMS. The prototype currently consists of two joint modules and four link modules. The joints utilize a conventional harmonic drive and torque motor actuator, with a small servo amplifier included in the assembly. A brushless resolver is used to sense the joint position and velocity. For coupling the modules together, a standard electrical connector and <b>V-band</b> <b>clamps</b> for mechanical connection are used, although more sophisticated designs are under way for future versions. The joint design yields an output torque to 50 ft-lbf at joint speeds up to 1 radian/second. The resolver and associated electronics have resolutions of 0. 0001 radians, and absolute accuracies of plus or minus 0. 001 radians. Manipulators configured from these prototype modules will have maximum reaches in the 0. 5 to 2 meter range. The real-time RMMS controller consists of a Motorola 68020 single-board computer which will perform real time servo control and path planning of the manipulator. This single board computer communicates via shared memory with a SUN 3 workstation, which serves as a software development system and robot programming environment. Researchers have designed a bus communication network to provide multiplexed communication between the joint modules and the computer controller. The bus supports identification of modules, sensing of joint states, and commands to the joint actuator. This network has sufficient bandwidth to allow servo sampling rates in excess of 500 Hz...|$|R
