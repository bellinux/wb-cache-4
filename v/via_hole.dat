5000|$|A via fence {{consists}} of a row of via holes, that is, holes that pass through the substrate and are metallised on the inside to connect to pads {{on the top and}} bottom of the substrate. In a stripline format both {{the top and bottom of}} the dielectric sheet are covered with a metal ground plane so any via holes are automatically grounded at both ends. In other planar formats such as microstrip there is a ground plane only at the bottom of the substrate. In these formats it is the usual practice to connect the top pads of the via fence with a metal track (see figure 2). This still does not completely fence off the field as can be done in stripline. In stripline the field can only propagate between the ground planes, but in microstrip it is able to leak over the top of the via fence. Nevertheless, connecting the top pads improves isolation by 6-10 dB. [...] In some technologies it is more convenient to form the fence from conducting posts rather than vias.Isolation can be further improved by placing a metal wall on top of the via fence. These walls commonly form part of the device enclosure. The large holes in the via fences seen in figures 1 and 5 are screw holes for clamping these walls in place. The wall casting belonging to this circuit is shown in figure 3.The design of the fence needs to consider the size and spacing of the vias. Ideally, vias should act as short circuits, but they are not ideal and a via equivalent circuit can be modelled as a shunt inductance. Sometimes, a more complex model is required such as the equivalent circuit shown in figure 4. L1 is due to the inductance of the pads and C is the capacitance between them. R and L2 are, respectively, the resistance and inductance of the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> metallisation. Resonances must be considered, in particular the parallel resonance of C and L2 will allow electromagnetic waves to pass at the resonant frequency. This resonance needs to be placed outside the operating frequencies of the equipment concerned. Spacing of the fences needs to be small in comparison to a wavelength (λ) in the substrate dielectric so as to make the fence appear solid to impinging waves. If too large, waves will be able to pass through the gaps. A common rule of thumb is to make the spacing less than λ/20 at the maximum operating frequency.|$|E
40|$|A silicon {{heterojunction}} {{solar cell}} based on amorphous and crystalline silicon {{is combined with}} the metal wrap through technology. In this novel solar cell concept one critical process is the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> conditioning. Raman measurements reveal that the amorphous silicon emitter layer hardly penetrates the via holes and that thereby the via surface is not fully covered. In the conventional process sequence with <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> formation prior to wet chemical cleaning, the effective carrier lifetime is reduced by about 50 % {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>via</b> <b>hole.</b> An improved process sequence is presented, which bases on <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> formation after the thin film depositions. In this sequence, the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> formation process is crucial for the via surface passivation. The passivation remains poor when applying a 1064 nm laser process. However, very good surface passivation is achieved with a 532 nm laser process. The lifetime reduction was below 20 % at the <b>via</b> <b>hole.</b> The superior performance of the 532 nm laser process is correlated to a smoother via surface and enhanced via sidewall oxidation. Finally, large area SHJ-MWT solar cells based on the optimized via formation process are processed and analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Dependence of {{electromigration}} (EM) lifetime for via chains wi th conventional sputtered A I-S i-Cu {{films on}} slope angles of via holes has been investigated. EM testing for tapered (slope angle of 55 ~ and vertical (slope angle of 85 ~ via chains with 11 ~m long first metal lines and 12 ~m long second metal lines was per formed {{under the same}} stress condition. Mean time to failure (MTF) of the E IK for the tapered via chains is one order of magn i tude shorter than that for the vertical via chains, although the step coverage of the A i-S i=Cu films in the vias is improved by controlling the slope angle of the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> for the tapered via. It {{was found that the}} MTF for the via chains degrades with decreasing the slope angle of the <b>via</b> <b>hole.</b> In this case, thicknesses of the local passivation layer in the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> increase with decreasing the slope angle of the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> because of improvement in the step coverage of the passivation layer. The MTF for the tapered via chains with a S iN /PSG dual passivation layer was i 0 h, while that with a PSG single passivation layer was at least over 2000 h.

In this work the strength of monocrystalline silicon wafers with different number of <b>via</b> <b>holes</b> was investigated in detail using experimental and theoretical methods.

Thus, besides the maximum stress also the size of the stress field and the probability of existing critical defect are important.

IOP Publishing Ltd is not responsible for any errors or omissions in this version of the manuscript or any version derived from it. The Version of Record is available online at [URL] penetration limit has been experimentally demonstrated for inkjet etching of holes in thin polymer layers. A mechanism combining the competing coffee ring flow, polymer dissolution and diffusion into the solvent drop, and the interaction between the contact line during evaporation and the softened deformable polymer, is proposed to explain the existence of such a penetration limit. The height-averaged velocity of the coffee ring flow within the evaporating sessile drop is calculated during the initial stage of this etching process when the spherical cap geometry assumption is valid. This is compared with the diffusion velocity of the disentangled polymer into the solvent. The two competing flows are used to elucidate why a hole could be formed initially. The complex wetting dynamics of the receding contact line is included to explain the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> profile evolution in the later stage of the etching process and the existence of a penetration limit. These two stages are differentiated by the drop volume with respect to the volume of the <b>via</b> <b>hole</b> produced by the preceding drop.
