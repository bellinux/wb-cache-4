5|$|The Seventh <b>Victim</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on LaserDisc in 1986 by RKO Home Video, and on VHS in 2002. It made its DVD debut on October 8, 2005, in a five-disc box set titled the Val Lewton Collection, comprising nine horror films released by RKO and produced by Lewton. Other {{films in the}} set include Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Ghost Ship. The Seventh <b>Victim</b> <b>was</b> also paired on a single-disc DVD alongside Shadows in the Dark, a documentary on Lewton's career. The film {{has not yet been}} {{released on}} Blu-ray.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen of the {{nineteen}} <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> teenagers while ten {{out of the}} nineteen <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{women of}} aboriginal descent.|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 30,146 {{identified}} and presumed <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> {{registered in the}} 28 EU Member States in 2010-2012, out of which over a thousand were children trafficked for sexual exploitation. 80 percent of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> female, and 65 percent of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> EU citizens. Of the registered <b>victims</b> who <b>are</b> confirmed as EU citizens, the top 5 countries of citizenship are Bulgaria, Romania, the Netherlands, Hungary and Poland. Over the three years, the top 5 non-EU countries of citizenship of registered <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> Nigeria, Brazil, China, Viet Nam and Russia. There {{has been an increase}} in the number of ¨unknown¨ citizenships from 2010 to 2011. In addition, 71 percent of labor exploitation <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> male in the EU Member States during these three years.|$|R
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{sacrificial}} <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> to {{have been}} danced by Nijinsky's sister, Bronislava Nijinska; when she became pregnant during rehearsals, she {{was replaced by the}} then relatively unknown Maria Piltz.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed more detail. German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190, not a Bf 109, {{and that he}} was a major at the time, confirming Johnson's <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> most likely to have been Engel. Johnson's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109, not an Fw 190. The ID card of Johnson's <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German. This individual stated that the rank was given as lieutenant colonel. The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks. This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht. Johnson died in October 1976, and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events.|$|E
5|$|In {{compliance}} with Indian law, the real {{name of the}} <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> initially not released to the media, so pseudonyms were used for her by various media houses instead, including Jagruti ("awareness"), Jyoti ("flame"), Amanat ("treasure"), Nirbhaya ("fearless one"), Damini ("lightning", after the 1993 Hindi film) and Delhi braveheart.|$|E
50|$|In Greece, {{victims of}} crime enjoy rights before, {{during and after}} the trial process. In certain circumstances, such cases where the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> a minor or has {{suffered}} sexual abuse, <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> afforded additional rights, support and protection. There is no discrimination by support services against foreigners. Foreign <b>victims</b> <b>are</b> entitled to an interpreter when testifying to the police.|$|R
50|$|In no {{circumstances}} shall the <b>victim</b> <b>be</b> {{considered to have}} given consent if the <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> {{under the age of}} 14 or has a mental disability or illness.|$|R

5|$|One such {{incident}} occurred in 2004 when a stray bullet {{shot by a}} member of the Ghetto Boys hit the narrow metal wire in Helen Kelly's bra and was deflected away from her heart. In 2008, a robbery <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> saved from being stabbed in the chest when the attacker's knife was caught and deflected by the underwire of her bra.|$|E
5|$|Southwark Crown Court found Harris {{guilty of}} all twelve counts of indecent assault. During the trial, it was learned that, while making Kids Can Say No!, Harris was {{involved}} in a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend; the relationship began when the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> 13 years old and lasted for 15 years. Harris had committed nine of the twelve counts by the film's release, including the assault of fifteen-year-old Tonya Lee in London three months before the release. The first <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> about the age of the children in Kids Can Say No! The last assault of which Harris was convicted occurred several weeks after his meeting with officials in Western Australia to propose another film about child sexual abuse. A former child actor from the Barbara Speake Stage School who appeared in Kids Can Say No! said that Harris' behavior with older girls at the school made Harris' eventual arrest unsurprising.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} teams worked intensively {{for nearly}} seven {{weeks in a}} dense jungle environment, searching for and identifying the victims' remains. The final <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> recovered and identified by DNA testing by 22 November 2006.|$|E
2500|$|All {{but one of}} his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> black women. One of his {{suspected}} <b>victims</b> <b>was</b> a black man. Many of his <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> sex workers. One witness {{recalls that}} Franklin frequently brought sex workers into his home. He shot all of his victims with a [...]25 caliber gun. Franklin took many photographs of nude women and kept the records in his garage.|$|R
25|$|Twelve more murders followed, {{often with}} {{multiple}} bodies {{found on the}} same day. In addition to the earlier sprees, two <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> found each day from 14 July to 16. <b>Victims</b> <b>were</b> seemingly selected at random. Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, elderly, vagrants, or people {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Most <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction bars. Blows were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her fetus cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any <b>victim</b> <b>were</b> reported. Some <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> also robbed of their cell phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area. However, most victims had their possessions intact. The murders covered a large geographical area. Aside from Dnepropetrovsk, many occurred in outlying areas of the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.|$|R
50|$|The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> casual {{workers and}} either Irish or Romani people. The Romanis were all from one {{extended}} family. The <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> aged between 59 years and 2 years old.|$|R
5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Although immobilizing {{a victim}} {{in front of}} a gun before firing the cannon {{is by far the most}} {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges that the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> actually put into the gun and executed in that manner. Reports exist that attest that on occasion, people were fastened to rockets and blown into the air, this is said to have occurred for a Brahmin under Hyder Ali's reign (1761–1782), and also, in an 1800 treason case, in the Maratha Empire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{surviving}} <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> customer Jeff Schaffart, 34, who {{was treated}} and released at UNMC for {{a gunshot wound}} to the left arm and the little finger of his left hand. The Omaha Police Department announced on December 22, 2007, that Mandy Hyda, 34, received a bruise when a bullet fragment struck her left leg. She was neither transported nor treated for the injury. It was initially reported that there were five people injured (not including Hyda), but two of those at the scene who were sent to local hospitals were sent {{for reasons other than}} being shot by Hawkins.|$|E

5|$|Smith's third <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> Carol Jordan, a 39-year-old {{care home}} worker {{and mother of}} six from Balsall Heath, who was killed as she walked to work. Smith hit her from behind with his car while driving back from Worcestershire, {{fracturing}} her hip. Fearing {{that he would be}} caught, Smith moved her to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse. The body was discovered at 8:50am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road, Lee Bank.|$|E
5|$|While {{recording}} Doggystyle with Dr. Dre in August 1993, Snoop Dogg {{was arrested}} {{in connection with the}} death of Phillip Woldermarian, a member of a rival gang who was shot and killed in a gang fight. According to the charges, the rapper's bodyguard, McKinley Lee, shot Woldermarian as Snoop Dogg drove the vehicle; the rapper claimed it was self-defense, alleging the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> stalking him. He spent most of 1995 preparing the case which went to trial in late-1995. He was cleared of all charges in February 1996 when he began working on his second album, Tha Doggfather.|$|E
5|$|With a {{total of}} ten people killed, it was the deadliest peacetime attack in Finnish history, surpassing the {{previous}} highest count of eight in the Jokela school shooting.

50|$|The {{identifiable}} <b>victim</b> {{effect has}} <b>been</b> contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a <b>victim</b> <b>is</b> identified, {{information such as}} age and gender of the <b>victim</b> <b>are</b> revealed and people are especially sympathetic {{in response to that}} information rather than to identifiability per se.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 {{the remains}} of the 86 <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> reinterred in one {{location}} in the Cronenbourg-Strasbourg Jewish Cemetery. On 11 December 2005 memorial stones engraved with the names of the 86 <b>victims</b> <b>were</b> placed at the cemetery. One is {{at the site of the}} mass grave, the other along the wall of the cemetery. Another plaque honoring the <b>victims</b> <b>was</b> placed outside the Anatomy Institute at Strasbourg's University Hospital.|$|R
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they deny any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows to her head. Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> cut by a chain saw while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bree's first <b>victim</b> <b>was</b> Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} butane gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E
