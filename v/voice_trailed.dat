60|$|Lane's <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off. Then {{the stony}} {{face of the}} {{listener}} changed for a fleeting second.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off. The {{muscles of}} Jimmy's back {{tightened}} and quivered. But {{he could find}} no words.|$|E
60|$|Again his <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> {{away into}} a mumbling whisper, but now Uncle John and Donald looked into one another's eyes with sudden interest.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you were}} the only person left, and there wasn't any princess [...] " [...] Whiskers cried out abruptly, and then let his <b>voice</b> <b>trail</b> away to embarrassed silence.|$|R
5|$|The {{world of}} Citizen Kane, that mysterious, dark, and {{infinitely}} deep world {{of space and}} memory where <b>voices</b> <b>trail</b> off into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to providing the audience warm-up for Australias Got Talent, Wheel of Fortune and Deal or No Deal, [...] "Deeksie" [...] is a continuity announcer for Seven Network stations across Australia, <b>voicing</b> <b>trails,</b> promos and ratings & announcements. He also voices commercials for Australian retailers such as JB Hi-Fi.|$|R
60|$|Something {{across the}} room seemed to attract his {{attention}} and his <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off. He inspected this for some time with bland interest, then turned to Adams once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{she cried}} in sudden panic. [...] "You must go away." [...] Again her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off, as she said, [...] "But I can't let you go." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off. Her mouth relaxed. And {{suddenly}} my old {{love for}} her seemed to gush back into my heart. A burning, inarticulate pity rose up in me.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s he {{regularly}} <b>voiced</b> <b>trails</b> {{for one of}} the first UK breakfast TV channels, TV-am. Other voice-over work was for Channel 4's Right to Reply, BBC One and numerous radio, film and commercial companies. His is one of the voices on the computer game, Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon.|$|R
60|$|Archie's <b>voice</b> had <b>trailed</b> off. He {{was looking}} across the room.|$|R
50|$|In February 2013 {{the band}} {{took part in}} RTÉ's Other <b>Voices</b> Music <b>Trail,</b> an event which celebrated the City of Culture for that year, Derry.|$|R
60|$|Billy Byrne was bending low {{to catch}} his feeble words, and when the <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> out into nothingness he lowered the tousled red head to the hard earth and turned away.|$|E
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off and {{she broke}} into stormy sobbing, while Andrew, {{with his arm}} around her, awkwardly tried to comfort her. His touch {{seemed to have a}} {{soothing}} influence, for Elsie got calmer.|$|E
60|$|His fading <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> {{away into}} silence. A cough shook him, and the faint crimson foam {{on his lips}} was increased. But he rallied again, and lay there panting, his fingers {{plucking}} at the coverlet.|$|E
50|$|She is now {{the senior}} {{announcer}} for the station, providing live announcements during primetime, pre-recorded announcements overnight and during daytime and <b>voicing</b> various <b>trails</b> and promos. She is also a trained actress.|$|R
60|$|My <b>voice</b> {{must have}} <b>trailed</b> away and muffled itself in {{uncertainty}} and despair.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{when her}} broken <b>voice</b> had <b>trailed</b> away into gentle catchings of the breath, the older woman, {{knowing that the}} time come for comfort, took her in her strong arms, holding her face wet against her own, their tears mingling.|$|R
6000|$|... "--I don't know," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "I must have time, either {{to work it}} out myself or to let it work itself out. If it only weren't for Dick..." [...] her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off pathetically.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{looking for}} work," [...] Cole murmured. [...] "Any kind of work. I can do anything, fix {{any kind of}} thing. I repair broken objects. Things that need mending." [...] His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off uncertainly. [...] "Anything at all." ...|$|E
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off. He {{was not a}} very {{intelligent}} young man, but even he could see that his was not a position where righteous indignation could be assumed with any solid chance of success. As a substitute he tried pathos.|$|E
6000|$|For {{several minutes}} after An-Tak ceased speaking, his <b>voice</b> having <b>trailed</b> off weakly into silence, neither spoke again. Then the Galu recommenced his, [...] "Food! Food! There {{is a way}} out!" [...] Bradley tossed him another bit of dried meat, waiting patiently until he had eaten it, this time more slowly.|$|R
500|$|After {{the band}} track ends, the song moves into avant-garde territory, with Yoko Ono reciting some prose over an unknown, vaguely operatic {{recording}} (possibly captured {{live from the}} radio). Ono's piece begins with the words [...] "Maybe, it's not that…", with her <b>voice</b> <b>trailing</b> off at the end; Harrison jokingly replies, [...] "It is 'that'!" [...] As the piece continues, Lennon quietly mumbles [...] "Gonna be alright" [...] a few times. Then follows a brief piano riff, some comments from Lennon and Ono on how well the track has preceded, and final appearances of the tape loops. Most of this coda was lifted {{for the end of}} [...] "Revolution 9", with a little more piano at the beginning (which monitor mixes reveal was present in earlier mixes of [...] "Revolution") and minus Lennon's (or Harrison's) joking reply.|$|R
60|$|I pledged {{him and we}} {{set down}} our glasses hastily. We heard <b>voices</b> and the <b>trailing</b> of dresses in the corridor. In a moment they all came trooping in.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am very sorry, my dear, but--oh, no! oh, no! oh, no--' His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> {{away into}} an unintelligible mutter. He {{was a very}} old man, {{and he was not}} always able to {{concentrate}} his thoughts on a subject for any length of time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove!' There was {{apprehension}} in his voice, but {{mingled with}} it a certain pleased surprise. 'Perhaps they were after my picture. I'll light the lamp. Good Lord, picture thieves--Romneys --missing Gainsboroughs--' His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off as he found the lamp and lit it. Relief and disappointment were nicely blended in his next words: 'No, it's still there.' ...|$|E
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off, {{and there}} was silence for a moment. Then Freddie burst into speech. His good-natured face was hard with unwonted scorn. Its cheerful vacuity had changed to stony contempt. For {{the second time in}} the evening the jolly old scales had fallen from Freddie's good old eyes, and, as Jill had done, he saw Derek as he was.|$|E
50|$|The Red Hill Mine at Sovereign Hill is a mine in Ballarat East, Victoria, Australia, {{that was}} one of the first major mines in the Eureka Stockade. It has tours led by a <b>voice</b> that <b>trails</b> the visitor through the mine. It is 76 steps down and roughly 100 steps across. Another major mine is The Sovereign Hill Quartz Mine which {{produces}} quartz.|$|R
50|$|Pope later {{moved to}} Granada TV where he {{remained}} {{for the rest}} of his career as a continuity announcer and newsreader of Granada Reports bulletins. His most well known contemporaries were Charles Foster and Colin Weston. While working primarily as a continuity announcer, he also <b>voiced</b> Granada-produced <b>trails</b> and promos for the ITV network and was a narrator for the highly regarded current affairs programme, World in Action.|$|R
5000|$|By 1916, the 29th Division {{had moved}} on to the Western Front where it would remain for the {{duration}} of the war. There, Shadwell and Gillam once again partnered to establish what would eventually become one of the most successful entertainment troupes or [...] "concert parties" [...] of the war: the Diamond Troupe. Together with Gilliam, Shadwell supervised the <b>voice</b> <b>trails</b> and selection of troupe members. He also contributed to the troupe's subsequent repertoire by supplying what Division chronicler S. Gillion described as [...] "... the light, topical, frivolous comic matter, so dear to the average Briton". Typical of this genre were two songs, In these Hard Times and 365 Days. Shadwell also scripted the Harlequin and Columbine scene, which Gillon described as [...] "... probably the most finished production of the troupe". Though Shadwell never served as the Troupe's official commanding officer, he remained actively involved in its work, supervising rehearsals, assuming command on occasions, and eventually writing the lyrics to accompany the Division's anthem, Song of the 29th Division by composer and organist Wilfred Ernest Sanderson (1878-1935).|$|R
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off {{and failed}} from excess of emotion. Kate Bland {{closed her eyes}} and leaned her head on his breast. Duane felt her heart beat against his, and {{conscience}} smote him a keen blow. If she loved him so much! But memory and understanding of her character hardened him again, and he gave her such commiseration as was due her sex, and no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{points the}} way," [...] came {{the voice of}} the oracle. [...] "The spirits are {{pointing}} the way to penitence, and urging the thief to restitution. I can see nothing more." [...] His <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off into a silence that lasted solidly for many minutes, like the long silence below when the theft had been committed. Then it was broken by the ring of metal on the floor, and the sound of something spinning and falling like a tossed halfpenny.|$|E
60|$|When Professor Keith {{came up to}} bid Miss Rangely good-bye {{on the eve of}} her {{departure}} from Harbour Hill, he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy. But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects. After all, it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye. She {{was in the middle of}} some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short, and her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> off in a babyish quiver.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly his upraised hand fell. Both {{men stood}} as though turned to stone, listening, yet {{scarcely}} daring to glance toward the door. It {{was the sound}} of Morton's quiet <b>voice</b> and the <b>trailing</b> of skirts which had checked Mr. Brown's passionate speech.|$|R
50|$|Summer {{arrives and}} Dawn is {{relieved}} that school is {{over for the}} time-being. Mark tells Dawn that she cannot expect school life to get any better until she starts high school. As Dawn's parents continue mistreating and ignoring her, Dawn signs herself up to attend a summer camp in Florida. On a school trip to Walt Disney World, Dawn sits among other girls from her school and joins them in singing the school anthem. Unnoticed, her <b>voice</b> slowly <b>trails</b> off as she sits looking out a bus window.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 40 clubs and {{organizations}} on campus, including MTHS Robotics Club, MTHS Video Game Club, Key Club (of which Monterey Trail High School {{is part of}} Division 7 South), Gay-Straight Alliance, Academic Decathlon, California Scholarship Federation, National Honor Society, Mathletes, the Debate Team, and the online-student publication <b>Voices</b> from the <b>Trail.</b>|$|R
