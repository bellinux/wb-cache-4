40|$|In the {{previous}} report. a new method of composing Sandwich Curtain Wall is 	proposed. The Curtain Walls {{are made in}} the following way. 	 1. Steel-bar-grid is attached to the structural frame. 	 2. This grid is sandwiched between two special concrete plates. 	 3. These two are combined by concrete set between them. 	The present paper deals with the experimental study on composing the Sandwich 	Curtain Wall in the following two cases. 	 1. One side of Sandwich Curtain Wall is composed by special concrete panels 	and the other side is composed by urethane foam panels. 	 2. One side of Sandwich Curtain Wall is composed by concrete panels and the 	other side is composed by urethane plywood panels. 	The results obtained are as follows : 	 1. The weight of a urethane foam panel is only 0. 20 kg. 	 2. Process of making each paner is simple and is fit for mass production. 	 3.

40|$|Abstract: The {{climate of}} Thailand {{is hot and}} humid and {{air-conditioning}} for thermal comfort is used in all tall buildings. Buildings with <b>curtained</b> <b>walling</b> are perceived to possess specific aesthetic value by many developers. As a consequence, such buildings cannot accommodate external shading device. In order to reduce transmission of solar radiation into such building, heat reflective glazing has been popularly used. Inadvertently, the building is subject to high cooling load from high heat gain through the <b>curtained</b> <b>walling.</b> However, as Thailand is located near the equator. For a northern or a southern façade, an exterior horizontal shading device can effectively shade radiation of the sun beam from a window below it while allowing skylight to enter the window to give a soft natural daylight in the room. The use of multiple-slat, sufficiently spaced horizontal shading device on the exterior of a facade on appropriately sized window will allow sufficient view out through the window, enables application of daylighting and reduces cooling load. This paper presents results of {{a study on the}} use of such shading device on windows under different combinations of glazing types, ratios of window area to wall area, and with un-insulated and insulated wall. When diffuse daylight from sky is used for daylighting, glazing that allows more daylight penetration is shown to offer a monetary worth of savings on electric lighting over its cost, and the cost of air-conditioning energy when the value of the ratio of window to wall ratio falls within certain range. The net benefit can be optimized at an appropriate ratio of window to wall area. When wall insulation is applied, the benefit is even enhance...|$|R
50|$|In the mid-fourteenth century, {{the height}} of the <b>curtain</b> <b>walling</b> at the {{south-western}} corner of the inner ward was increased, and the round tower and the inner gatehouse were also raised in height. This process is particularly noticeable because a greenish stone was used for the alterations that was significantly different in colour from the red sandstone used {{in the rest of the}} building. In the sixteenth century, the castle was remodelled into a substantial Tudor mansion with a more comfortable accommodation block and with mock battlements added to the curtain walls. Excavation has shown the remains of the Tudor cobbled courtyard, the presence of a pitched stone kitchen floor and the ground plans of the building at the different periods of its existence.|$|R
