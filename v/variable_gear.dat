5|$|It was {{the first}} LS with {{continuous}} controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature, {{the first of its}} kind in the U.S., allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces. Other drive-assist features included a brake-hold system, radar cruise control, electric <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio power steering, and electronically controlled braking. The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios. The suite of new safety features extended from an eye-tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system. The pre-collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time, along with millimeter-wavelength radar, stereo cameras, and infrared night vision projectors. A rear pre-collision system with whiplash-preventing active seat headrests and dual-chamber front airbags was also introduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical layers to the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E

5000|$|The late 20s {{and early}} 30s were {{an era of}} {{transition}} in relation to bicycle equipment and race conditions. Areas of controversy were the use of <b>variable</b> <b>gears</b> and two sprocket wheels, single tyres, the use of butterfly or wing nuts [...] {{and the provision of}} outside assistance. The Dunlop Grand Prix permitted <b>variable</b> <b>gears</b> but prohibited butterfly or wing nuts and singles. The riders were required to repair their own bikes during the stage, were not able to change bicycles unless it was bona fide damaged [...] and no spare parts or other assistance were permitted. Similarly the riders were not permitted to accept food or drink other than from officials at feeding stations or procured by rider from established store, hotel or refreshment room.|$|R

25|$|In July 2004, on the Crown Majesta, Toyota {{offered a}} Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system that {{incorporated}} formerly independent systems, including ESC. This worked not {{only after the}} skid was detected but also to prevent the skid from occurring in the first place. Using electric <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio steering power steering, this more advanced system could also alter steering gear ratios and steering torque levels to assist the driver in evasive manoeuvres.|$|E
25|$|New to the GS {{line was}} an {{electric}} power steering (EPS) system, and both the V8 and hybrid models featured a <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered suspension damper firmness. Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.|$|E
25|$|Also {{new to the}} GS {{line was}} an Electric Power Steering (EPS) system {{replacing}} the previous model's hydraulic steering pump, while the V8 model featured a <b>Variable</b> <b>Gear</b> Ratio Steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of brake-by-wire system. In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness. Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor’s {{thesis is}} focused on the present states and {{development}} trends of valve gears. Thesis is sorted chronologicaly.

Isn't it better to triumph by the {{strength}} of your muscles than by the artifice of a derailleur? We are getting soft. Come on fellows. Let's say that the test was a fine demonstration - for our grandparents! As for me, give me a fixed gear!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{others had}} {{derailleur}} gears {{for a higher}} ratio for the sprint. Holland had a single 81-inch freewheel, meaning he had no <b>variable</b> <b>gears</b> {{and that he had}} to pedal faster than he could manage to stay with the others. He eased back 20 metres before the line and came fourth. Stallard and Ghilks didn't finish for another two minutes, Stallard seventh and Ghilks 26th.|$|R
25|$|The IS F Sport models include {{enhanced}} {{handling and}} performance, Adaptive Variable Suspension and <b>Variable</b> <b>Gear</b> Ratio Steering (IS 350). Not {{only does the}} F Sport handle differently, but its more aggressive styling certainly sets it apart from the basic production model. F-Sport styling includes an edition specific F-Sport pattern front grill, F-Sport logo badges, and five spoke split graphite wheels. Inside the cabin, you'll find bright, carbon fiber-like trim, extra bolstered performance seats, an all-black headliner, and an impressive moving vessel gauge cluster that displays navigation and audio information. The F-Sport models have an edition specific Ultra White exterior and vibrant, Rioja Red interior. The 2014 model year also served as the first year to offer all-wheel drive in the IS F Sport line up.|$|E
25|$|For the 2014 model year, {{changes to}} GS 350 {{includes}} eight-speed automatic transmission with steering for rear-wheel drive (RWD) model, introduction of F SPORT package (optional Lexus Dynamic Handling system with dynamic rear steering (DRS), electric power steering, <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio steering (VGRS)), integrated Siri Eyes Free mode from Apple (compatible with iPhone 4S and newer), flush mounted sensors for available intuitive park assist, full color display {{added to the}} optional head-up display, available blind spot monitor adds rear cross traffic alert and power-folding mirrors, Luxury Package changes (LED foglamps, Superchrome finish for 18-inch wheels, and the rear armrest control panel display adds display option to view radio station and song title information), optional power trunk opener, Lexus Night View system discontinued.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Mochet was the inventive {{maker of}} {{lightweight}} powered cyclecars (Le P'tit Auto) and pedal-powered cars (quadricycles), mainly two-seaters, {{built on a}} tubular-steel chassis with bicycle-sized wheels, <b>variable</b> <b>gears</b> and aerodynamic bodywork, in effect a faired-in [...] "sociable". The popularity of the little cars declined in the late 1930s as cheaper, powered cars became available, only to rise rapidly when petrol became almost unobtainable during WW-2, 1939-1945.|$|R

50|$|Bradbury Motor Cycles was a British {{motorcycle}} manufacturer {{based in}} Oldham, England and established in 1902. Originally {{involved in the}} manufacture of machine tools, sewing machines and cycles, their first motorcycles were bicycles with clip-on Minerva engines. The Bradbury factory went on to develop and produce a range of single-cylinder motorcycle, V-twins and horizontally opposed twins. The 1912 Bradbury motorcycles were one of the earliest with <b>variable</b> <b>gearing.</b> Although the factory survived the First World War it closed in 1924.|$|R
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes {{have two or three}} chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E
2500|$|Segmented musculature, like pennate muscle, has fibers aligned at {{an angle}} and due to this feature of design, when muscle fibers {{increase}} in angle {{with respect to the}} medial axis, along with the direction and amount of muscle bulging, the Architectural gear ratio increases. A <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, based upon different anatomical position, loading and movement conditions, has since been dubbed spatially varying gear ratio. The occurrence of spatially varying gear ratio gives rise to a new insight of muscle biology; “inhomogenous muscle mechanics.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{domestic}} market received the Type V edition starting in mid-2000. It included <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio steering (VGS), {{a steering system}} that continuously changes steering ratio based upon vehicle speed and steering angle to provide improved handling. Honda announced the S2000 Type V on July 7, 2000 as the first system of its kind. The lock-to-lock steering ratio was reduced to 1.4 turns (stock is 2.4). Honda outfitted Type V cars with revised damper units, stabilizers and limited slip differentials to [...] "complement the VGS". Equipped cars came with a special steering wheel and a VGS badge on the rear.|$|E
50|$|Architectural {{gear ratio}} (AGR) relates the {{contractile}} velocity {{of an entire}} muscle to the contractile velocity of a single muscle fiber. AGR {{is determined by the}} mechanical demands of a muscle during movement. Changes in pennation angle allow for <b>variable</b> <b>gearing</b> in pennate muscles. Variable pennation angle also influences whole-muscle geometry during contraction. The degree of fiber rotation determines the cross-sectional area {{during the course of the}} movement which can result in increases of the thickness or width of the muscle.|$|R
25|$|The {{increase}} in pennation angle following full-thickness tendon tears {{will result in}} a change to the PCSA of the supraspinatus and infraspinutus muscles. This would reduce the force producing capacity of these muscles. However, partial tendon tears, which did not result in a change to pennation in any of the rotator cuff muscles, may not impair the force producing properties of the muscles. Azizi’s observations on <b>variable</b> <b>gearing</b> in pennate muscles further suggests tendon tears will affect the AGR of the supraspinatus and infraspinutus. The greater pennation angle could result in an increased AGR.|$|R
50|$|Fell’s {{intention}} {{had been}} to sidestep the energy conversion losses being encountered in the diesel-electric locomotives then coming into service. To this end, he devised an all-mechanical power transmission system which provided the required <b>variable</b> <b>gearing</b> and which was claimed to be lighter than a standard arrangement. No fewer than four 500 hp V12 Paxman-Ricardo diesel engines were specified, along with an additional pair of AEC-Ricardo marine diesels, whose job was to power the superchargers feeding the four main engines. Two large banks of radiators and fans ensured cooling for all six engines, and twin cabs and duplicated controls enabled the locomotive to operate in either direction.|$|R
2500|$|In 1957 engine {{displacement}} grew to [...] with the [...] "Super Turbo Fire V8" [...] option producing [...] {{with the help}} of continuous (closed loop) mechanical fuel injection. These so-called [...] "fuelie" [...] cars are quite rare, since most Bel Airs were fitted with carburetion. The 1957 Bel Air is among the most recognizable American cars of all time; well-maintained examples, especially Sport Coupes and Convertibles are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. They are roomy, with tastefully restrained, period use tail fins and chrome. A second automatic transmission, Turboglide, was optional. [...] While the original two-speed Powerglide continued unchanged, Turboglide provided a continuously <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> ratio which made [...] "shifting" [...] imperceptible.

50|$|He {{believed}} the Tour de France {{had to be}} gruelling, {{to the extent that}} the perfect race for him would be one that only one rider could finish, because he needed it to inspire, to extend the limits of human achievement. Many of his rules, which now seem arcane, were to that end. He forbade riders to cooperate with each other, banning tactics now taken for granted, such as sharing the pacemaking. He insisted competitors mend their own bicycles and accept no outside help because independence and self-sufficiency were everything to him. For the same reason, he stood out against <b>variable</b> <b>gears</b> long after they had become common elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{models were}} {{produced}} both powered by J.A.P air-cooled V-twin engines with friction disc transmission and belt drive. The friction drive {{consisted of a}} vertical driven disc and a smaller wheel which could be moved {{across the face of}} the driven disc so the distace from the drive axis would give <b>variable</b> <b>gearing.</b> A clutch action was made by lifting the driven wheel off the drive disc. Moving the driven wheel past the centre gave a reverse gear. The smaller car with an engine rated for taxation at 5/6hp had tandem seating with the driver sitting behind the passenger. The larger model had a 7/9hp engine.|$|R
25|$|The Boarhound was {{evaluated}} alongside the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, de Havilland Hyena and Vickers Vespa. The Jupiter's <b>variable</b> timing <b>gear</b> gave poorer power at low altitudes, a disadavantage for an army cooperation aircraft, and the Atlas was considered superior.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the only}} {{standalone}} LC options is Lexus Dynamic Handling (LDH), an active rear steering system that augments the <b>Variable</b> <b>Gear</b> Ratio Steering (VGRS) and Electric Power Steering (EPS). These systems work together to increase maneuverability.|$|E
50|$|He is {{a cousin}} of the late Edward Hartley Clay, {{inventor}} of the infinitely <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> which resides in the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, and designer of an early prototype portable building used by Holst and Co, which Mr Clay showed to the instigator of the Portakabin.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 {{he decided}} that cars didn’t need a clutch, a gear lever, or brakes, {{and took out a}} {{provisional}} patent on what he described as his ‘Infinitely <b>variable</b> <b>gear</b> Box’. Motor engineers, who checked the plans, pronounced the invention foolproof and gave their opinion that it could be mass-produced quite cheaply.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} form found in {{automobiles}} is the hydraulic automatic transmission. Similar but larger devices {{are also used}} for heavy-duty commercial and industrial vehicles and equipment. This system uses a fluid coupling {{in place of a}} friction clutch, and accomplishes gear changes by hydraulically locking and unlocking a system of planetary gears. These systems have a defined set of gear ranges, often with a parking pawl that locks the output shaft of the transmission to keep the vehicle from rolling either forward or backward. Some machines with limited speed ranges or fixed engine speeds, such as some forklifts and lawn mowers, only use a torque converter to provide a <b>variable</b> <b>gearing</b> of the engine to the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the safety}} bicycle, {{bicycles}} {{did not have}} chains and the pedals were typically attached directly to the drive-wheel, thus limiting top speed by {{the diameter of the}} wheel and resulting in designs with front wheels as large as possible. Various linkage mechanisms were invented to raise the effective gear ratio, but with limited success. Using chain drive allowed the mechanical advantage between the drive and driven sprockets to determine the maximum speed, thereby enabling manufacturers {{to reduce the size of}} the driving wheel for safety. It also allowed for the development of <b>variable</b> <b>gearing,</b> allowing cyclists to adjust their gearing on the fly, to terrain or road inclination and their strength, obtaining an efficient and workable cadence at various speeds.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for optimal sizing {{of the electric}} powertrain based on vehicle level objective functions. The design <b>variables</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, rated torque and rated speed of the motor are size dependant on the objective functions energy demand over a driving cycle, powertrain mass, and high speed gradeability. Multi-objective optimization handles these conflicting objective functions simultaneously and produces the Pareto-optimal solutions in both objective function and design variable domains. The novelty of the proposed approach is the utilization of analytical scalable saturated flux-linkage and loss motor model which is used for fast and accurate calculation of drive cycle energy consumption and motor mass. The concept is demonstrated on an example of in-wheel motor electric powertrain with four synchronous permanent magnet outer rotor machines...|$|R
