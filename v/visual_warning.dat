25|$|This is a {{standard}} production car, visibly marked, but without audible and <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> devices. It is used by community police officers to show a presence, transport them between jobs and make appearances at community events. These cars {{do not respond to}} emergencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} {{accelerated the}} introduction of Automatic Warning Systemâ€“ {{by the time the}} report had been published British Railways had agreed to a five-year plan to install the system that gave drivers an audible and <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> that they were about to pass a distant signal at caution.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of an incident in 1999 in which the pilot of a Beechcraft Super King Air suffered hypoxia, the ATSB published Report 199902928 and recommended an aural warning be fitted on the flight deck of all Australian Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft. The flight deck of the Beechcraft Super King Air only has <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> of inadequate cabin pressure.|$|E
50|$|For these reasons, {{emergency}} vehicles {{in many countries}} worldwide, are fitted with <b>visual</b> <b>warnings</b> to alert {{members of the public}} (and in particular, other motorists and road users), either as they approach the vehicle, or it approaches them. <b>Visual</b> <b>warnings</b> can be of two types - passive warning or active warning.|$|R

25|$|Police {{vehicles}} are often fitted with audible and <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> systems to alert other motorists of their approach or {{position on the}} road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such {{as the right to}} exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a yield sign) and may also suggest a duty on other motorists {{to move out of the}} direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The nose-gear light {{indicators}} {{were designed}} to be fail safe by having two separate light bulbs. This proved to be inadequate, as {{it was impossible to}} look through the cover to check whether one of the bulbs had been compromised, meaning that a failure of one bulb would not be detected until both bulbs malfunctioned. The first bulb was thus presumed to have gone inoperative some time before the day of the flight, while the second bulb broke during Flight 933. The NTSB therefore advised the Federal Aviation Administration to articulate means to avoid similar compromised fail-safe designs in the future. Both pilots had minimum-descent altitude light warnings, which were presumed to have given a <b>visual</b> <b>warning,</b> but because of the work overload, neither pilot directed his attention to these alerts.|$|E
25|$|The AN/AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System (MWS) {{is used on}} {{slow moving}} {{aircraft}} such as helicopters and military transport aircraft to notify the pilot of threats and to trigger the aircraft's countermeasures systems. Its main users are the U.S Army, Navy and Air Force, but is also operated by other countries. Originally developed by Loral Space & Communications, it has been solely a product of ATK since 2002. The AN/AAR-47 passively detects missiles by their infrared signature, and uses algorithms to differentiate between incoming missiles and false alarms. Newer versions also have laser warning sensors and are capable of detecting {{a wider range of}} threats. After processing the nature of the threat, the system gives the pilot an audio and <b>visual</b> <b>warning,</b> and tells the direction of the incoming threat. It also sends a signal to the aircraft's infrared countermeasures system, which can then for example deploy flares. The development of the original AN/AAR-47(V)1 began in 1983 by Loral. ATK became a second production source in the mid 90s and eventually became the primary contractor. In 1998 ATK began production of the improved AN/AAR-47(V)2, which added laser warning functionality.|$|E

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of graphic <b>visual</b> <b>warnings</b> on cigarette packaging {{is used in}} more than 45 countries and has been mandated for U. S. tobacco packaging and advertising by Public Law 111 - 31. This study develops and tests a simple, parsimonious methodology to evaluate visual stimuli appropriate for use with text-based package and advertisement warnings. Some 2000 ratings of 27 graphic <b>visual</b> <b>warnings</b> are collected from adolescent smokers and nonsmokers. Cluster analysis and follow-up analysis of variance results show that a high performing visual stimuli group is perceived as effective in preventing adolescent smoking initiation and in helping current adolescent smokers quit. More than 60 % {{of the variance in}} outcome variables can be explained by these results. These findings addressing characteristics of the <b>visual</b> <b>warnings</b> perceived as effective have implications for the ongoing litigation and anticipated battles between tobacco companies and the U. S. government regarding use of highly graphic pictorial warnings...|$|R

2500|$|The raids {{caught the}} Japanese unprepared. Their New Guinea airbases were {{inadequate}} {{in terms of}} the concealment of planes, in hangars and other shelters, and they relied almost completely on a <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> system, which did not allow enough time for aircraft on the ground to take off or be taken under cover. These problems were compounded by the poor quality of runways, a shortage of maintenance staff and a lack of heavy equipment at forward bases. [...] These problems were not restricted to Wewak. According to Australian official historian, during this period, at least 50% of the Japanese aircraft lost were destroyed on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The {{third and}} least common version was a pole mounted lower-quadrant signal {{suspended}} above an octagonal steel frame {{that surrounded the}} target, presumably to protect both banner and motor box from being damaged by passing vehicles. Dubbed the [...] "peach basket" [...] because of the protective framework, the apparatus was crowned by another <b>visual</b> <b>warning,</b> the traditional X-shaped [...] "RAILROAD CROSSING" [...] sign, or crossbucks. The majority of peach baskets were used by the Union Pacific Railroad. [...] One version of this signal had the lower stripe on the banner replaced with the word stop that was lighted. [...] When the signal was at rest, the words were hidden behind a screen that was painted {{to look like the}} missing stripe. [...] They were either mounted on an island {{in the center of the}} road or on the side of the road.|$|E

2500|$|Passive visual {{warnings}} are {{the markings}} on the vehicle. Police vehicle markings usually {{make use of}} bright colors or strong contrast with the base color of the vehicle. Modern police vehicles in some countries have retroreflective markings which reflect light for better visibility at night. Other police vehicles may only have painted on or non-reflective markings. Most marked police vehicles in the United Kingdom and Sweden have reflective Battenburg markings on the sides, which are large blue and yellow rectangles. These markings are designed to have high contrast and be highly visible on the road, to deter crime and improve safety. [...] Another passive <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> of police vehicles is simply the interceptor's silhouette. [...] This is easily observed in the United States, where the ubiquitous nature of the Ford Crown Victoria in police fleets has made the model synonymous with police vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency vehicle {{lighting}} is {{one or more}} <b>visual</b> <b>warning</b> lights fitted to a vehicle for use when the driver wishes to convey to other road users the urgency of their journey, to provide additional warning of a hazard when stationary, {{or in the case}} of law enforcement as a means of signalling another driver to stop for interaction with an officer. [...] These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a light bar, or may be modified stock lighting, such as a wig-wag or hide-away light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as hazard lights. [...] Often, they are used along with a siren (or occasionally sirens) in order to increase their effectiveness. [...] In many jurisdictions, the use of these lights may afford the user specific legal powers, and may place requirements on other road users to behave differently, such as compelling them to pull to the side of the road and yield right of way so the emergency vehicle may proceed through unimpeded.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first evaluation of multimodal language-based warnings for handovers {{of control in}} autonomous cars. A set of possible handover situations varying in urgency is described. A set of multimodal, language-based warnings for these situations is then introduced. All combinations of audio, tactile and <b>visual</b> <b>warnings</b> for handovers were evaluated in terms of perceived urgency, annoyance and alerting effectiveness. Results showed clear recognition of the warning urgency in this new context, as well as low perceived annoyance overall, and higher perceived effectiveness for critical warnings. The time of transition from self-driving to manual mode {{in the presence of}} the warnings was then evaluated. Results showed quicker transitions for highly urgent warnings and poor driving performance for unimodal <b>visual</b> <b>warnings.</b> These results provide a novel set of guidelines for an effective transition of control between car and driver in an autonomous vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{collision}} warning systems {{depends on how}} well the algorithm and driver interface are tailored to driver capabilities and preferences. An effective collision warning system must promote a timely and appropriate driver response while minimizing annoyance associated with nuisance warnings. A within-subject experimental design examined warning strategy and modality by contrasting graded and imminent warning strategies with auditory and haptic warning modalities. Presented on a high, head-down display placed {{directly in front of}} the driver, <b>visual</b> <b>warnings</b> were displayed in the form of graded bars representing severity, or by an imminent collision icon. <b>Visual</b> <b>warnings</b> were paired with either an auditory warning or a haptic warning in the form of a vibrating seat. Results suggest that haptic warnings may be preferred over auditory warnings, with graded haptic warnings being preferred more than imminent haptic warnings. These results support previous findings of greater acceptance of graded compared to imminent warnings, and no decrement in performance or acceptance of a haptic versus an auditory warning...|$|R
