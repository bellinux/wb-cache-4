40|$|One crucial aspect in {{building}} engineering is {{to accomplish the}} trade-off between reduction of energy consumption and high level thermal comfort for the occupants. To this aim, advanced control algorithms are fundamental to guarantee a certain optimality of the system performance in working conditions that can be {{quite different from the}} nominal ones due to the presence, for example, of <b>variable</b> external <b>wheatear</b> conditions or parameter uncertainties. To impose an optimal behavior of the indoor air temperature while assuring robustness to plant parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, in this paper we propose an extension of the optimal model reference adaptive scheme presented in [6] that embeds additional adaptive actions to improve tracking performance. Performance of the novel strategy are investigated both analytically, by exploiting hyperstability theory, and numerically. In particular the numerical validation has been carried out by using a detailed thermal-hygrometric simulation code (DETEC 2. 1). Results confirm the effectiveness of the control in exemplar case of studies referred to buildings of different sizes and located in different European weather zones...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsually, optimal {{percentages}} of additives {{used to improve}} the characteristics of soils, are determined by laboratory tests of different complexity. Then, these optimal combinations are used directly in the pavement structures, without analysis of time or scale differences between laboratory and field conditions. This paper {{presents the results of}} a full-scale accelerated pavement test on a base course that has been improved by using fly ash and an alkali activator. Initially, the main characteristics of the testing equipment are presented. The optimal amount of the different components was previously obtained by laboratory tests. The components were mixed, the material was extended and compacted in layers and a curing time was permitted. After that, a wheel loaded with a vertical hydraulic actuator, simulating a rear half-axis of a truck, passed on the top layer repeated times. During the test, vertical deformations of the surface were measured in several points along the track. Results after around 10000 loading repetitions were compared against simultaneous measurements on a non-treated material subjected to identical loading application, showing the advantages of the alkali activation in reducing deformability of base courses and the effect of <b>variable</b> natural <b>wheatear</b> conditions on both type of pavement structures...|$|R
