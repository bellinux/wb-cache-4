40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in fulfillment of the requirements for the Master’s degree of Research. The purpose {{of this research is}} to establish whether different voice qualities evoke an emotional response within the listener. To assist the research, a study was conducted under controlled conditions using eight participants. They were asked {{to take part in a}} modified version of Donald Winnicott’s squiggle game. This involved allowing the hand to draw freely whilst listening to an original composition for solo voice. The voice qualities demonstrated in the composition were those defined by researcher, <b>voice</b> <b>scientist</b> and teacher, Jo Estill. Participants were informed that a squiggle in an upward direction would indicate an increase in intensity of emotional response. The results revealed that the voice qualities featured in the composition evoked some form of emotional response within the listener. However, an inability to control all variables meant that it was not possible to decipher whether these responses were elicited as a result of voice quality alone...|$|E
40|$|Since his {{untimely}} death in 1987, {{the work of}} John W. Large continues to be relevant to current voice research and pedagogy. He pushed for specificity in voice terminology. For instance, he drew the distinction between speech science register nomenclature (for example, pulse/fry, modal, loft, flute) and singing register nomenclature (for example, chest, middle, head). He also proposed the usage of isoparametric tones (different register tones compared on the same fundamental, phoneme/vowel, and dynamic level) in order to standardize voice research protocols. A pedagogical descendant of Manuel Garcia II, {{one of the first}} <b>voice</b> <b>scientist</b> and teachers, Large researched aspects of all three components of the vocal instrument: the actuator (breath), the vibrator (vocal folds and laryngeal structure), and the resonators (the bucco-pharyngeal cavity and nasal cavities as well as the sinuses and other supra- and sub-glottal spaces including the pyriform sinuses). He investigated airflow rate (actuator) in the passaggio, the vocal fold wavelength configuration (vibrator), formants (emphases of the harmonic partials), and the sub-glottal and supra-glottal coupling of resonators. Large, who agreed with Garcia’s “mechanical principle, ” thought that vocal fold wave configuration was a primary determinant of vocal register. However, like his bel canto colleagues, he recognized the importance of the vowel in phonation as well as its use in pedagogy. In summary, while Large’s pedagogy was informed by science, it was also firmly rooted in the bel canto tradition...|$|E
30|$|However, {{despite many}} years of effort devoted to {{developing}} algorithms for speech signal processing, and despite the elaboration of automatic speech recognition and synthesis systems, {{our knowledge of the}} nature of the speech signal and the effects of pathologies is still limited. In spite of this, <b>voice</b> <b>scientists</b> and clinicians take profit of the simple models and methods developed by speech signal processing engineers to build up their own analysis methods for the assessment of disorders of voice (DoV).|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Amott {{made his}} voice acting debut when he {{appeared}} on the Adult Swim show Metalocalypse. In the episode [...] "Snakes 'n Barrels", he <b>voiced</b> <b>scientist</b> Dr. Amomolith Chesterfield and Snakes 'n Barrels bassist Antonio Tony DiMarco Thunderbottom, who would end up getting his memory erased during the first song of their reunion show. Amott returned for more voice acting in the second season of Metalocalypse in the episode [...] "Snakes n' Barrels II" [...] (Part 1 and 2).|$|R

50|$|As a singer, Vennard {{was active}} in opera, oratorio and solo song; as a teacher of singing, many of his {{students}} achieved worldwide success. His renowned text, Singing, the Mechanism and the Technique, is a constant resource for teachers and researchers alike. Vennard’s collaboration with Janwillem van den Berg resulted in his film Voice Production: the Vibrating Larynx. Winning several awards, including best medical research film from a festival in Prague in 1960, it shows the anatomy and physiology of voice production in the excised larynx. He was {{a pioneer in the}} science of singing and in voice pedagogy and was instrumental in fostering collaborative efforts between singers, physicists, psychologists and <b>voice</b> <b>scientists.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the (in his view) pejorative connotation of the term falsetto, Giles refuses to use it, calling the upper register [...] "head voice." [...] Many voice experts would disagree with this choice of terminology, reserving the designation [...] "head voice" [...] for the high damped register accompanied by a relatively low larynx that is typical of modern high operatic tenor voice production. The latter type of head voice is, {{in terms of the}} vocal cord vibration, actually more similar to [...] "chest voice" [...] than to falsetto, since it uses the same [...] "speaking voice" [...] production (referred to as [...] "modal" [...] by <b>voice</b> <b>scientists),</b> and this is reflected in the timbre.|$|R

5000|$|This theory {{states that}} the {{frequency}} of the vocal fold vibration is determined by the chronaxie of the recurrent nerve, and not by breath pressure or muscular tension. Advocates of this theory thought that every single vibration of the vocal folds was due to an impulse from the recurrent laryngeal nerves and that the acoustic center in the brain regulated the speed of vocal fold vibration. [...] Speech and <b>voice</b> <b>scientists</b> have long since left this theory as the muscles have been shown to not be able to contract fast enough to accomplish the vibration. In addition, persons with paralyzed vocal folds can produce phonation, which would not be possible according to this theory. Phonation occurring in excised larynges would also not be possible according to this theory.|$|R
50|$|Starting with Walter Koenig, first {{guests were}} actors {{from the various}} Star Trek series, but later also {{included}} actors and co-workers from other series like Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, Buffy, Farscape, Andromeda, Stargate and Xena: Warrior Princess. Other special guests attending the FedCon include authors, <b>voice</b> artists, <b>scientists</b> and astronauts.|$|R
40|$|Singers are {{sometimes}} instructed to breathe or sing as though into roots beneath the stage floor, or imagine the breath or sensations {{of the voice}} shooting out {{the top of the}} head and up to a star. Often no explanations are offered by the teacher as to what these images aim to achieve, other than to improve vocal quality. Some singing pedagogues believe such imagery should not be taught as it conflicts with physiological and acoustic reality. Yet similar imagery is used in Eastern meditation and recommended, often as a pre-performance mental exercise, by teachers who instruct actors, dancers, orchestral players and pianists. How do <b>voice</b> <b>scientists,</b> singers and performing arts pedagogues account for such imagery? Explanations in vocal literature suggest that acoustic changes in the partials, changes in phonetic quality, spinal alignment and muscular response from the diaphragm to th...|$|R

5000|$|William Vennard (31 January 1909 Normal, Illinois [...] - [...] 10 January 1971 Los Angeles, California) was {{a famous}} American vocal pedagogist who {{devoted his life to}} researching the human voice and its use in singing. He was one of the driving forces behind a major shift within the field of vocal {{pedagogy}} {{during the middle of the}} 20th century. Along with a few other American singing teachers, such as Ralph Appelman at Indiana University, Vennard introduced contemporary scientific research in the areas of human anatomy and physiology into the study of singing. This shift in approach led to the rejection of many of the beliefs and practices held since the bel canto era, most particularly in the areas of vocal registration and vocal resonation. Vennard was renowned as an excellent teacher whose written works have influenced generations of singers, vocal pedagogues and <b>voice</b> <b>scientists.</b> He taught many successful singers including acclaimed mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, who studied under him at the University of Southern California.|$|R

5000|$|An {{example of}} false balance is the [...] "debate" [...] on global warming; {{although}} {{the scientific community}} almost unanimously attributes global warming {{to the effects of}} the industrial revolution, there is a very small number, a few dozen scientists out {{of tens of thousands of}} scientists, who dispute the conclusion. Giving equal <b>voice</b> to <b>scientists</b> on both sides makes it seem like there is a serious disagreement within the scientific community, when in fact there is an overwhelming scientific consensus [...] that anthropogenic global warming exists.|$|R

5000|$|A scene filmed during {{production}} gives {{a possible}} explanation as to why one particular model of Terminators all look like Schwarzenegger: a character named Chief Master Sergeant William Candy (played by Schwarzenegger) explains in a Cyber Research Systems (CRS) promotional video that he was chosen to be {{the model for the}} Terminator project. Schwarzenegger's character has a Southern accent; when one of the politicians questions the appropriateness of Candy's Southern accent for the Terminator's <b>voice,</b> another <b>scientist</b> replies, [...] "We can fix it" [...] in Schwarzenegger's (overdubbed) voice. The scene was added as a bonus feature on the film's DVD.|$|R
