5|$|The Animaniacs series theme song, {{performed}} by the Warners, was a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the show. In the series' first season, the theme won an Emmy Award for best song. Stone composed the music for the title sequence and Ruegger wrote the lyrics. Several Animaniacs albums and sing-along VHS tapes were released, including the CDs Animaniacs, Yakko's World, and Variety Pack, and the tapes Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World and Animaniacs Sing-Along: Mostly in Toon.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{was a new}} era for Indian {{women and}} is defined as 'feminism' that was {{responsible}} for the creation of localised women's associations. These associations emphasised women's education issues, developed livelihood strategies for working-class women, and also organised national level women's associations such as the All India Women's Conference. AIWC was closely affiliated with the Indian National Congress. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, it worked within the nationalist and anti-colonialist freedom movements. This made the mass mobilisation of women an integral part of Indian nationalism. Women therefore were a <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> various nationalist and anti-colonial efforts, including the civil disobedience movements in the 1930s.|$|E

While Denham discusses Gammage in a bit more depth (pages 82 and 83), he cites Hirshleifer for more narrow reasons. Hirshleifer, a micro-economist, {{was one of the}} original modern thinkers on how biological and cultural evolution can be treated as one subject.
