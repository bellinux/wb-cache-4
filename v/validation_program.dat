30|$|The {{challenge}} of passing the <b>validation.</b> <b>Programs</b> often validate the inputs before parsing and handling. The validation {{works as a}} guard of programs, saving the computing resource and protecting the program against invalid inputs and damage caused by malicious constructed inputs. Invalid testcases are always ignored or discarded. Magic numbers, magic strings, version number check, and checksums are common <b>validations</b> used in <b>programs.</b> Testcases generated by black box and gray box fuzzers are hard to pass the validation for a blind generation strategy, which results in quite low efficient fuzzing. Thus, how to pass the validation is another key challenge.|$|R

This <b>validation</b> <b>program</b> checks three things. (1) That the file has properly originated from an approved type of recorder, (2) That the recorder has not been altered from its IGC-approved state, (3) That the data in the downloaded file that is being validated is identical to when it was originally downloaded form the recorder. This allows the data {{to be used for}} the validation of flight performances up to and including world records.|$|E

It is the foundation for the <b>validation</b> <b>program</b> and should include process validation, facility and utility qualification and validation, equipment qualification, cleaning and computer validation. The regulations also set out an expectation that the different parts of the production process are well defined and controlled, such that the results of that production will not substantially change over time.|$|E
