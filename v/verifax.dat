50|$|Another {{handwriting}} analysis {{system is}} Neuroskill by <b>Verifax,</b> Boulder, Colorado, USA, {{which was founded}} in 1990 by Dr. Ruth Shrairman and Alex Landau. Neuroskill was designed for biometric measurement, security purposes, and Parkinson medication effects and has many applications in movement disorders. <b>Verifax</b> began operations with the aim of developing a biometric tool for the verification of signatures from a distance (<b>VeriFax</b> Autograph Technology). <b>Verifax</b> developed two more applications using application-specific modifications of their customized Neuroskill software: Applications for substance abuse screening and detection, monitoring for toxic inhalants and environmental distress, and accurate signature identification for security/privacy protection and forgery detection. Target markets could include neuromuscular disease centers, drug and alcohol abuse clinics, occupational health centers and the security industry. In the process, they applied their technology to biometric measurements as a clinical monitoring tool for physicians investigating neuromuscular diseases.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{widespread}} adoption of xerographic copiers, photo-direct copies produced by machines such as Kodak's <b>Verifax</b> were used. A primary obstacle {{associated with the}} pre-xerographic copying technologies was {{the high cost of}} supplies: a <b>Verifax</b> print required supplies costing USD $0.15 in 1969, while a Xerox print could be made for USD $0.03 including paper and labor. The coin-operated Photostat machines still found in some public libraries in the late 1960s made letter-size copies for USD $0.25 each, {{at a time when the}} minimum wage for a US worker was USD $1.65 per hour; the Xerox machines that replaced them typically charged USD $0.10.|$|E

50|$|After the Model A, Haloid {{released}} {{a number of}} xerographic copiers to the market, but none yet particularly easy to use. Meanwhile, competitors such as Kodak and 3M brought out their own copying devices using other technologies. Kodak's <b>Verifax,</b> for instance, could sit {{on one side of}} a desk and sold for $100; Haloid's competing machines were more expensive and substantially larger.|$|E
50|$|The Kodak <b>verifax,</b> is a photo copying {{approach}} {{that uses a}} wet colloidal diffusion transfer technique patented by Yutzy, H.C. and Yackel, E.C. (1947) The light source is projected to the top crossing the negative being reflected -more or less, according to the color- against the original to be copied exposing the negative. Has a base that contains the recipient with the liquid developer and the exposure Timer.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} was to evaluate persons with critical skills (e.g., airline pilots, bus drivers) for {{physical and mental}} performance impairments caused by stress, physiological disorders, and {{alcohol and drug abuse}} using their proprietary <b>VeriFax</b> Impairoscope writing instrument. This last application raised the possibility of using a space-qualified Impairoscope variant to evaluate astronaut performance with respect to the impacts of stress, fatigue, excessive workload, build-up of toxic chemicals within the space habitat, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The first artists {{recognized}} to make copy art are Charles Arnold, Jr. and Wallace Berman. Charles Arnold, Jr. {{an instructor}} at Rochester Institute of Technology, made the first photocopies with artistic intent in 1961 using a large Xerox camera on an experimental basis. Wallace, called the [...] "father" [...] of assemblage art, would use a <b>Verifax</b> photocopy machine (Kodak) to make copies of the images which he would often juxtapose in a grid format. [...] Berman was influenced by his San Francisco Beat circle, and by Surrealism, Dada, and the Kabbalah. Sonia Landy Sheridan began teaching the first course {{in the use of}} copiers at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Berman {{has been}} called the [...] "father" [...] of {{assemblage}} art. He created [...] "Verifax collages", which consist of photocopies of images from magazines and newspapers, mounted onto a flat surface in a collage fashion, mixed with occasional solid areas of acrylic paint [...] Berman would use a <b>Verifax</b> photocopy machine (Kodak) to make copies of the images which he would often juxtapose in a grid format. Berman sought influence in not only those of his Beat circle, but in Surrealism and Dada as well as the Kabbalah. The influence of Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism is seen in his collages and other works such as his later inscriptions in-situ in Hebrew letters, and his only film, Aleph, a silent film that explores life, death, politics, and pop culture. His involvement with the jazz scene allowed him opportunities to work with jazz musicians, creating bebop album covers for Charlie Parker.|$|E
50|$|Wallace Berman {{was born}} in Staten Island, New York in 1926. In the 1930s {{his family moved to}} Boyle Heights, Los Angeles. Berman was {{discharged}} from high school for gambling in the early 1940s and became involved in the West Coast jazz scene. Berman wrote a song with Jimmy Witherspoon. He attended classes at Jepson Art Institute and Chouinard Art Institute in the 1940s. For a few years from 1949 he worked in a factory finished furniture. It was at the factory where he began creating sculptures from wood scraps. This led to him becoming a full-time artist by the early 1950s, and an involvement in the Beat Movement. He moved from Los Angeles to San Francisco in late 1957 where he mostly focused on his magazine Semina, which consisted of poetry, photographs, texts, drawings and images assembled by Berman. In 1961 he came back to L.A., then moved to Topanga Canyon in 1965. He started creating his series of <b>Verifax</b> Collages in 1963 or 1964. Director Dennis Hopper, a collector of Berman's work, gave Berman a small role in his 1968 film Easy Rider. He produced work until his sudden death in a car accident caused by a drunk driver, in 1976. Interestingly, Berman had said to his mother as a child he would die on his 50th birthday, and indeed he did die February 18, 1976...his fiftieth birthday. ref.

40|$|In 1956 in Los Angeles, California, Wallace Berman, a Beat {{assemblage}} artist, {{poet and}} founder of Semina magazine, began to make a film. Over ten years, the film now known as Aleph became Berman's personal record, documenting family, friends, <b>Verifax</b> collage artwork and inspirations from popular culture. Paint and Letraset were applied across the film celluloid, creating a palimpsest of code and gesture. Aleph is also delineated with Hebrew letters, representing Berman's interest in the Jewish mystical Cabala. Translated as "tradition," "reception" or "transmission," the Cabala ascribes the word of God with hidden meaning, creating a channel from the divine to the human [...] a transmission of secret codes. The core of this thesis frames Wallace Berman's film Aleph as both a transmission and an unfinished, unstable document. The form and content of Aleph enact the process of transmission and represent transmission itself. However, since the film is unfinished, abandoned and left with excess fragments, it possesses unstable meaning. This thesis will not substantiate a stable art object; rather, it will frame a process [...] transmission [...] through which multiple meanings are carried, and through which the unfinished, unstable film object operates as a catalyst towards one possible unity of message: "Art is Love is God.
