25|$|Episode 11 briefly reunited the sliders with Wade (actress Sabrina Lloyd {{performing}} a <b>voice-over</b> <b>while</b> actress Maria Stanton stood in as a Wade double), who {{was trapped in}} a Kromagg experiment, but able to telepathically communicate with Rembrandt. She is able to help them escape, but {{at the cost of}} her own life.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} scene, a bombing attack on Tokyo is finally {{announced}} to {{a roomful of}} bomber crews, among them several familiar faces from the Mary-Ann, including Rader, now a B-17 pilot. As their aircraft take off, President Roosevelt words are heard in a stirring <b>voice-over,</b> <b>while</b> the assembled air armada heads towards the rising sun and victory.|$|E
50|$|Setsuko Kageyama (Kageyama Setsuko): Doctor Kageyama's {{former wife}} {{and the mother of}} Shūichi. After Kageyama became Doctor Man, she left her husband and gave away their son Shūichi for {{adoption}} by the Nakamura family. 17 years later, the Bioman team and Shūichi stumble onto a letter she left behind, along with a video recording, which revealed Doctor Man's true identity. She never actually appears in the series besides a photograph of herself with Kageyama and Shūichi as an infant, and a <b>voice-over</b> <b>while</b> Shūichi reads her letter.|$|E
50|$|After leaving Abrams-Rubaloff, Romano joined Special Artists, {{a smaller}} agency, and began their <b>voice-over</b> department. <b>While</b> at Special Artists, she would also direct the {{potential}} client auditions. It was during her time at Special Artists that Romano began attending {{some of her}} clients' recording sessions at Hanna-Barbera. After a short time at Special Artists, {{she was asked to}} audition at Hanna-Barbera for the position of casting director.|$|R
50|$|Jenkins {{also has}} three movie credits, {{one of which}} was an on-camera appearance. In order to be realistic, the race {{announcer}}s in the movie Days of Thunder were the actual ESPN crew of the time, which meant Jenkins was the announcer in several <b>voice-over</b> scenes. <b>While</b> at Speed Channel in 2005, he was the Speed anchor in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. He also did voice over work in the movie Kart Racer.|$|R
50|$|Currently, dubbing {{of films}} and TV series for {{teenagers}} {{is made by}} Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of Shrek, which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and {{pay more attention to}} the dubbing actors. However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of DVD releases, most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, <b>while</b> <b>voice-over</b> is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.|$|R
50|$|Broad started <b>voice-over</b> <b>while</b> {{working for}} Godfrey Ho. During the 1980s he was voicing up to 170 films in a year. By 1999 he {{estimated}} {{that he had}} voiced more than 700 films. They included, to that time, all Chow Yun-fat films and most of Jet Li's. He had also voiced a couple of Jackie Chan films and the rerelease of Bruce Lee's Way of the Dragon. In a South China Morning Post article Broad was described as Hong Kong's viceroy of the voice-over; the doyen of dubbers.|$|E
5000|$|Germany is {{invaded by}} the Soviet Union. Nina {{knows that the}} Russians want revenge for the {{millions}} of countrymen murdered by the Third Reich. Attempting to hide in the cellar, they are caught by the Russians and forced outside. Nina yells to the soldiers that Fritz is Jewish, but they ignore her. Once outside, Fritz is forced to kneel as the Russians prepare to shoot him. He starts singing [...] "Shema Israel". The Russian soldier lowers his gun and says that he is Jewish too. During the <b>voice-over</b> <b>while</b> the camera pans over a bombed-out and devastated Berlin, Nina tells the audience that Ruth Friedlaender is eventually transferred from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz, where she is gassed. Eventually she and Fritz marry; Fritz dies in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The {{films were}} {{generally}} narrated {{in the style}} typical of newsreel films with a principal <b>voice-over</b> <b>while</b> letting the images tell the story. The narration was generally spoken over the natural sounds of the subject being discussed such as motor traffic or the activities within a workplace and with musical accompaniment. People who were featured in the programmes were seldom heard to speak unless as background sound, their activities and interactions with others generally being commented upon by the narrator. Otherwise {{the subject of the}} film or clip would address the camera directly or perform in a given situation, both in a staged and a scripted manner whereby the narrator could often add a humorous or ironic comment {{in the context of the}} subject. On occasions an expert or professional in the field of the subject could be seen to present the film directly to camera and provide voiceovers. However, in the most part, the narration of the films was provided by well known celebrities and presenters of the time including Raymond Baxter, Eamonn Andrews, Wynford Vaughan-Thomas, and Sid James, but the majority of the films were narrated by actor Tim Turner. At the end of each film the caption [...] "Take a Look at Life Again Soon" [...] would appear on screen.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} his {{production}} career, he actively began his pursuit of a career in <b>voice-over.</b> In 1999, <b>while</b> working on what {{would turn out to be}} his last full-time position in television production, a voice-over agent named Pat Brady, after discovering Ferguson the week prior in a voice-over workshop in Toluca Lake, California, and before even officially signing with him for representation, sent him out on what would be his first professional voice-over audition (a sound-alike for Keanu Reeves in a 60-second radio spot satirizing The Matrix for the former Hollywood Video movie-rental franchise). He ended up booking the role from this first VO audition, after which he officially signed with Pat Brady who, through two talent agencies, would continue to represent him to this day.|$|R
50|$|Just JeremyA segment {{exclusively}} featuring Jeremy Warner {{and focused}} on offbeat and quirky humor. Each segment begins with Warner facing stage right in the dark <b>while</b> a <b>voice-over</b> introduces Warner <b>while</b> making a ridiculously fake claim about him. The Just Jeremy theme is sung, Warner turns to face the audience, the lights are raised, and Warner addresses the audience about {{the subject of the}} segment. The set background is a wall with a vertical wood pattern and typically is adorned with framed pictures and shelves with objects which generally all have a matching theme. Warner wears a different t-shirt for each segment, typically featuring an animal. The segment concludes with Warner turning to face stage right again as the lights fall while the Just Jeremy theme is repeated. The only other person to have appeared on this segment is James Perry, who was impersonating Warner at the time. Debuted Season 2, Episode 2. There have been seven segments of Just Jeremy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{designers}} {{are given a}} budgeted stipend to select and purchase fabric and notions, and then provided {{a limited amount of}} time to finish their designs (the shortest being 5 hours and the longest being two or three days, with the exception of fashion week when they are given 12 weeks). Often, the designers work independently, although on some challenges, contestants must work in teams or as a single collective group. Once the deadline is reached, the designers must dress their models and select their hair, make-up, and accessories. Each model walks down the runway, and the garment the contestant made is rated by a panel of judges, who score each look in several categories from 0 to 5, and often provide personal annotations and comments regarding the presented designs. Each contestant does a <b>voice-over</b> <b>while</b> the model is walking down the runway. The judges then interview the remaining designers (usually six) who garnered the highest and the lowest scores (usually a top 3 and a bottom 3), and share their opinions while listening to the designers' defense of their outfits, then confer as a group in private. The panel then announces the winning and losing designers based on their scores and other considerations. Typically, the winner receives immunity for the next challenge, and therefore cannot be eliminated. As the season progresses, immunity is disregarded during later challenges to prevent the designers from getting an easy pass to make it into the final round. Other incentives given to the contestants aside from winning immunity include: The winning garment may be featured in print media, integrated into a limited edition look for a particular clothing brand, or sold at an online fashion store (e.g., BlueFly.com beginning in Season 4 onwards). Generally, the loser of each challenge is eliminated from the competition, with host Klum giving him or her a double air kiss on the runway and wishing the eliminated designer farewell her catchphrase, Auf Wiedersehen (formal German for goodbye with literal translation [...] "until we meet again"), before they depart. Thus, elimination from the show is sometimes called [...] "being auf'd"—a play on words as it can be interpreted as offed.|$|E
