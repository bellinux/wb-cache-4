50|$|Hirsch {{was born}} on 29 March 1893 in Glina, Croatia to a Jewish family of Bertold and Josefina Hirsch. After high school {{education}} Hirsch studied medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, Innsbruck Medical University and University of Prague. During World War I, as a student, he was recruited and mobilized in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was stationed in the village Bršadin, near Vukovar in the Vukovar-Syrmia County. During the war Hirsch gained extensive experience {{in the field of}} <b>venerology</b> and other communicable diseases. In 1919 he finished specialization at the Rudolf Virchow Hospital in Berlin, where he studied epidemiology of bacterial meningitis. In 1923 Hirsch was appointed as head of the newly founded Community health center Osijek and head of the infectious diseases department at the Osijek Hospital. Hirsch was also named, in 1924, director of the Epidemiological Institute Osijek which he founded. His great merit was in combating infectious diseases, not only in the Osijek area but also in the wider Slavonia region. During World War II physician Miroslav Schlesinger organized the departure of the Croatian Jewish doctors to Bosnia to combat endemic syphilis in 1941. 80 Jewish doctors were sent to Bosnia by Independent State of Croatia authorities, as a Jew among them was Hirsch. Most of those doctors would later flee to join the Partisans. Hirsch was married to Josefine (née Roubitschek), with whom he had a daughter Ruth. In 1942 Hirsch was deported from Derventa to Jasenovac concentration camp where he was killed together with his wife, daughter, granddaughter and sister.|$|E

Construction works of the Ophthalmic Block with 80 beds was completed in 1932. The Out Patient (OP) block and Casualty was constructed in 1940. A Children's ward with 36 beds was constructed nearby in 1943 and later merged with the Gynaec block. A new administrative block and the twin operation theatres and special ward was constructed in 1951. The need for expansion of the hospital gave rise to construction of the Bhavanagar Ward, which was later inaugurated by Shri Krishna Kumar Sinhji of Bhavnagar, then governor of Madras in December 1949. The 'Rajendra Prasad Ward' was inaugurated by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, then President of India in August 1955 and the 'Amrit Kaur Pediatric Block' was inaugurated by Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, then Union Minister of Health in January 1956. The new Cardiology Block with Intensive Cardiac Care Unit (ICCU) was inaugurated in June 1986 and subsequently, {{the first and second}} floors with the Open Heart Surgery Unit. The 24-hour Clinical laboratory block was renovated in 1992. The Nuclear Medicine block, the first-of-its-kind in the state government was opened on 8 October 1993.

To obtain more data, we performed a clinical cohort pilot study {{about the influence of}} pollen on AE between sensitized and nonsensitized subjects and an experimental study addressing the cutaneous penetration of pollen into the skin. Fifty-five patients were monitored during birch pollen season. To study the cutaneous penetration, grass pollen allergens were applied on excised skin and the uptake in CD 1 c-expressing dendritic cells was investigated. The correlation between environmental pollen load and severity of the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score and pruritus was observed, regardless of the status of sensitization. The sensitized group recovered significantly worse after the birch pollen season. Remarkably higher amounts of pollen allergens taken up by CD 1 c cells were detected in epidermal cells derived from skin explants with a disturbed epidermal barrier. These findings suggest an exacerbating role of pollen in AE utilizing the epidermal route.

40|$|Pia Moinzadeh, Nicolas Hunzelmann, Thomas Krieg Department of Dermatology and <b>Venerology,</b> University of Cologne, Germany Abstract: Systemic {{sclerosis}} (scleroderma) is a chronic, multisystem, fibrotic disease. Although {{the pathogenesis}} {{is not completely}} understood, early vascular damage leads to an inflammatory reaction and a severe fibrotic response. Therapy of systemic sclerosis is still not convincing and is mainly restricted to the management of organ complications. A wide choice of immunosuppressive and antifibrotic drugs {{has been used to}} try to modify the course of the disease, but significant breakthroughs are still lacking. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to regulate growth, proliferation, and differentiation as well as apoptosis of cells and is already widely used for several malignancies, eg, chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It has been used in preclinical as well as clinical studies to modulate the fibrotic process in patients with systemic sclerosis. This is based on its activity to interfere selectively with both the transforming growth factor-ß and platelet-derived growth factor signaling pathway. Preclinical studies in mouse models of scleroderma showed significant anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects; however, several clinical, proof-of-concept trials have not yet confirmed these initially promising results.

40|$|Background: Melasma is {{a common}} {{acquired}} cause of facial hyperpigmentation seen predominantly among females with significant psychological and social impact. It is often recalcitrant to treatment. Several topical hypopigmenting agents {{have been used to}} combat melasma. Hydroquinone and Kojic Acid are well established monotherapeutic agents for treating melasma. Objectives: This study focuses mainly on the efficacy of once daily application of 4 % Hydroquinone and 0. 75 % Kojic Acid cream (containing 0. 75 % Kojic acid and 2. 5 % vitamin C) so as to determine an effective modality of treatment for facial melasma. Materials and Methods: A total number of 60 patients with facial melasma attending the Out-patient department of Dermatology, <b>Venerology</b> and Leprosy, Fr. Muller Medical College Hospital, Mangalore from Oct 2008 -April 2010 were studied. Patients were allocated alternately to group A and group B. Group A patients received 4 % Hydroquinone cream and group B patient received a Kojic Acid cream (which contained 0. 75 % Kojic acid and 2. 5 % vitamin C) and were advised to apply topically once daily at night. Patients were followed up on 4 th, 8 th and 12 th week. At each visit side effects were noted and clinical response to treatment was calculated using the MASI score. Statistical Methods: Chi square test, student ′t′ test. Results: At the 4 th week post treatment evaluation, facial hyperpigmentation responded early to 4 % Hydroquinone cream than to 0. 75 % Kojic Acid cream.

40|$|The Achilles {{project was}} set up because of the general poor {{awareness}} of foot disease, espe- cially of fungal foot infections. Foot diseases are often not viewed as a real problem, {{and the general public}} has limited knowledge of them. Most previous studies have involved small and specific population groups, such as school children, subjects visiting swimming baths, populations with specific occupations, or patients with underlying diseases like diabetes. Moreo- ver, patients often had to diagnose the condition themselves. The results of these self-assess- ments, was an underestimation of the prevalence of foot infections. (1, 2) The Achilles project was the largest epidemiological study ever to be carried out on foot health in Europe and other countries, related to the part of the body below the Achilles heel (e. g. foot, toes, toenails). Started in 1998, the aim of the project was {{to gain a better understanding}} of diseases affecting the feet and their prevalence among different patient groups with a view to improve the timely diagnosis and optimal treatment of this significant medical problem. The project also allowed an insight to be gained into the predisposing factors and quality of life in a large population, and to generate clinical data from a sample of the population. The data also served as the basis for epidemiological studies, allowing both medical professionals and pa- tients to benefit from this knowledge. The ultimate goal is therefore to increase the chance for timely diagnosis and treatment of foot disorders. Several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK), have thus far participated in this foot-screening project, which was endorsed by the European Academy of Dermatology and <b>Venerology</b> (EADV) and the European Nail Society.

40|$|Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis have {{important}} role among the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases. AIM: The {{aim of the}} study was to determine the frequency and antibiotic resistance of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis in genital samples obtained from patients examined in the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Centre of the Department of Dermatology, <b>Venerology</b> and Dermatooncology, Semmelweis University, Budapest between May 1, 2008 and July 31, 2010. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were taken from the urethra in men and from the cervix and urethra in women by universal swab (Biolab(R)) into Urea-Myco DUO kit (Bio-Rad(R)) and were incubated for 48 hours at 37 C degrees. Antibiotic sensitivity of positive samples was determined in U 9 bouillon using SIR Mycoplasma kit (Bio-Rad(R)). RESULTS: Samples for 4154 patients aged 16 - 60 years were examined. In 247 / 4154 samples (6 %) U. urealyticum and in 26 / 4154 samples (0. 63 %) M. hominis was isolated from the genital tract. Most U. urealyticum and M. hominis strains (75 % and 77 %, respectively) were cultured from cervix, while the remaining 25 %, and 23 % from the male and female urethra, respectively. U. urealyticum and M. hominis were most commonly detected in patients aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of U. urealyticum strains were sensitive to tetracycline (94 %), doxycycline (95 %), azithromycin (88 %) and josamycin (90 %), but were resistant to ofloxacin (21 %), erythromycin (85 %) and clindamycin (79 %). Seventy-seven percent of the U. urealyticum strains were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, suggesting that ex iuvantibus therapies may select cross-resistant strains to both antibiotics. The resistance of M. hominis to clindamycin, doxycycline, ofloxacin and tetracycline varied between 4 % and 12 %. CONCLUSIONS: Because none of the strains was sensitive to all examined antibiotics, the antibiotic sensitivity of U. urealyticum and M. hominis strains should be determined. The high rate of ofloxacin, erythromycin and clindamycin resistance should be considered in the therapy of U. urealyticum infections in Hungary. This is the first such a clinical microbiological study in this topic in Hungary...|$|E

Tkachenko Kharkiv National Medical University Department of Dermatology, <b>Venerology</b> and medical cosmetology Abstract Beautiful, well-groomed appearance often ensures greater success and great opportunity. Therefore, a successful woman understands how important it is to pay attention not only to his intellectual development, but also to keep their external beauty and attractiveness, youthfulness and health. In recent years there is a very effective method to combat all signs of skin aging, which gives the result almost immediately after the first application and does not require rehabilitation period. This procedure is called plasmotherapy, which you can use to solve many problems not only aesthetics but skin health.

The {{so-called}} „oncogenic balanitis“ is a not so rare nosological entity, whose pathogenesis {{is related}} {{in most cases}} to infection with oncogenic strains of the human papilloma viruses (HPVs). In {{the early stages of}} the disease the clinical presentation of the infection with some oncogenic or high risk human HPVs is often non-specific, contributing to its persistance for a long time, often misdiagnosed as a candidous or bacterial balanitis. Clinically the lesions may also be confused with lichen planus or lichen sclerosus, as well as penile eczema or psoriasis. Local and/or systemic therapy with corticosteroids can lead to unmasking of the symptoms and rapid progression of the disease, with potential risk of malignant transformation. Additionally, some patients decline a biopsy, further hampering the confirmation of the diagnosis. In all these problematic cases a diagnostic PCR examination of material taken from lesional skin could be of help for the diagnosis of Bowen’s disease, erythroplasia Queyrat, consequently preventing its progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. We present a rare case of erosive and partially verrucous balanitis, in which HPV 56 strains were identifed by PCR in repeated samples from lesional skin. Additionaly, HPV 16 was also identified in the second sample. The clinical findings were entirely consistent with erythroplasia of Queyrat but histopathological examination was not possible. A local therapy with imiquimod was started. After complete clinical recovery a vaccination with Gardasil was additionaly planned with the hope that the patient would be protected from possible recurrence due to the generation of cross-immunity against HPV 56. Due to the risk of malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, HPV-associated “oncogenic balanitis” is a disease portending a potentially unfavorable prognosis. In patients with longstanding genital lesions unresponsive to topical treatments usually used for balanitis, the possibility of HPV-induced “oncogenic balanitis” should be a strong consideration. PCR testing from lesional skin is probably one of the most sensitive, accurate, and reliable methods that help the clinician identify oncogenic and nononcogenic HPV-strains in problematic patients who refuse invasive and semi-invasive diagnostic options such as biopsy and cytological examination. Subsequent therapy should be complemented by regular clinical follow-up due to the possibility of relapse...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the current}} issues widely {{discussed}} among numerous research groups and in lots of scientific papers refers {{to the role of}} the free radicals and their adversaries, specifically in the human skin. The objective of this thesis was to investigate whether there is a correlation, and if so which, between the cutaneous antioxidative status and the roughness of the skin as a macroscopic measurand. From the group of carotenoids, lycopene and β-carotene were selected as indicator substance for the antioxidative protective system. These two components could be determined noninvasively, in vivo, at high accuracy and reproducibly using a Raman resonance spectroscopic system specifically developed at the Center of Experimental and Applied Cutaneous Physiology (CCP), Department of Dermatology, <b>Venerology</b> and Allergology of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This permitted to address a second objective of the present thesis, namely to influence the bio-availability of β-carotene by varying the cooking conditions for carrots, pepper, broccoli and potatoes, and by varying the storage conditions for regular plums. Using the PRIMOS- 3 D-measuring system, it could be demonstrated in the experiments that the roughness of the skin of the volunteers, whose age variance was restricted to only 10 years (40 - 50 years), was the lower the higher their antioxidative status of the skin. This correlation, which could be successfully detected for the first time via the lycopene content, clearly showed that an optimum supply of the skin with carotenoids considerably influences the ageing process and that the intake of healthy food is an excellent preventive strategy against premature skin aging. The determined changes in the β-carotene concentrations during the cooking process permitted to roughly divide carrots, pepper, broccoli and potatoes into two groups. While in group I the β-carotene values increased with extended cooking time (carrot, yellow pepper, potato type „Rosaria“),the group II vegetables, i. e., broccoli, red pepper and potatoes of types „Arkula“ and „Adretta“ showed a decline of bio-available β-carotene. This could be due to the different composition of the total of antioxidants functioning as protective chains in the respective vegetables. Surprisingly, the β-carotene content of the „Rosaria“ type potato with its red peel, was comparably high to that of carrots or yellow pepper. Different storage conditions of stone fruit (Prunus domestica) resulted in strong changes of the measured β-carotene concentrations. If stored at room temperature, the bio-availability increases with storage time; if stored at 6 °C, β-carotene remains stable for 96 h. The addition of alcohol increases the bio-availability of carotene in the fruits with time until a decay due to transition into the alcoholic phase results in a reduction of β-carotene in the fruits. This thesis shows that antioxidants, above all carotenoids like lycopene and β-carotene, play an extremely important role for the condition of the skin. For an optimum supply with these substances, the results of the cooking and storage experiments permit a simple recommendation. Vegetables should be eaten raw but not completely cooked, duly considering that fruit and vegetables contain not only carotenoids but a variety of different antioxidants which protect each other against the destructive action of the free radicals. A highly efficient antioxidant, such as Vitamin C, is temperature-sensitive, although stabilised by a high carotenoid concentation. Regular plums should preferably be stored 72 h in alcohol before eating. The antioxidative protective system of the skin should be affected scarcely or not at all by the low alcohol amount in the stored plums...|$|E
