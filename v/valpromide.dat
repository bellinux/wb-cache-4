50|$|<b>Valpromide</b> (marketed as Depamide by Sanofi-Aventis) is a carboxamide {{derivative}} of valproic acid {{used in the}} treatment of epilepsy and some affective disorders. It is rapidly metabolised (80%) to valproic acid (another anticonvulsant) but has anticonvulsant properties itself. It may produce more stable plasma levels than valproic acid or sodium valproate and may be more effective at preventing febrile seizures. However, it is over one hundred times more potent as an inhibitor of liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase. This makes it incompatible with carbamazepine and can affect the ability of the body to remove other toxins. <b>Valpromide</b> is no safer during pregnancy than valproic acid.|$|E
50|$|Lithium was {{discovered}} in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, <b>valpromide</b> came into play. This antibiotic was {{the origin of the}} drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. <b>Valpromide</b> had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.|$|E

During VCD treatment, the half-life of CBZ-E was prolonged significantly compared with control (19. 7 +/- 6. 7 h vs 6. 9 +/- 2. 0 h, means +/- s. d., P less than 0. 01), and its oral clearance decreased four-fold (from 109. 6 +/- 30. 7 to 28. 8 +/- 11. 1 ml h- 1 kg- 1, P less than 0. 01).

40|$|Type I interferons (IFNs), {{including}} IFNα and IFNβ, possess antitumoral {{activity and}} have been proposed to be potentially useful {{in the treatment of}} neuroblastoma. We have previously shown that IFNβ causes cell death of human SHSY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells by inducing apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (Dedoni et al. J. Neurochem. 115, 14211433, 2010). As valproic acid, an histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) has been reported to enhance the antitumoral effects of type I IFNs, in the present study we have examined the effects of this drug on IFNβinduced apoptosis of neuroblastoma cells. We found that prolonged exposure (24 h) of SHSY 5 Y cells to therapeutic concentrations of valproic acid (0. 61 mM) had no effect on cell viability. However, when combined with IFNβ, valproic acid markedly enhanced cell apoptosis induced by the cytokine, as demonstrated by the increase in annexin V staining, caspase activation and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Acetylation of histone 2 B at Lys 5 was markedly enhanced by valproic acid, but this response was not affected by cotreatment with IFNβ. Conversely, valproic acid enhanced the IFNβstimulated Tyrphosphorylation of STAT 1, which is crucial for cytokineinduced apoptosis. Sodium butyrate (1 mM), another HDACi, elicited similar potentiating effects on IFNβinduced apoptosis and STAT 1 phosphorylation, whereas <b>valpromide</b> (1 mM), which did not enhance histone acetylation, had no effects. MYCNamplified human LAN 1 neuroblastoma cells displayed no sensitivity to the proapoptotic activity of IFNβ, but underwent apoptosis when treated with either valproic acid or sodium butyrate. Cotreatment of LAN 1 cells with IFNβ and HDACi, but not <b>valpromide,</b> resulted in a significant increase in cell apoptosis. These data show a synergistic interaction of IFNβ and valproic acid in promoting neuroblastoma cells apoptosis, which appears to be related to enhancementof histone acetylation...|$|E
40|$|In utero {{exposure}} to valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, causes neural tube, heart, and limb defects. <b>Valpromide</b> (VPD), the amide derivative of VPA, does not inhibit HDAC activity {{and is a}} weak teratogen in vivo.

Murine gestation day- 12 embryonic forelimbs were excised and exposed to VPA or VPD in a limb bud culture system. VPA caused a significant concentration-dependent increase in limb abnormalities, which was correlated with its HDAC inhibitory effect.

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of the}} BMBF-project “Development of a biotransformating {{system for}} the {{metabolic}} activation of validated in-vitro-systems to assess embryotoxicity” is to further develop already established alternative methods for animal testing. In this dissertation, embryotoxic substances and their metabolites (cyclophophamide/acrolein, retinol/all-transretinoic acid, valpromide/valproic acid, albendazole/albendazole sulfoxide, acetylaminofluorene/ N-hydroxy-acetylaminofluorene) have been tested in the WEC with rat embryos to simulate the maternal metabolism and to establish precise concentration-response-curves, followed by examination of substance combinations (in 80 / 20 and 50 / 50 ratios) on the embryo. Substances and methods: First, the substances were tested at increasing concentrations und then combined with their associated metabolite {{as part of a}} 80 / 20 and 50 / 50 ratio, in the WEC with rat embryos (9, 5 days old). The embryos were incubated under defined conditions in a rotating system for 48 hours and the results were evaluated {{on the basis of a}} morphologic scoring system. Results: The five examined substances (cyclophosphamide, retinol, <b>valpromide,</b> albendazole, acetylaminofluorene) originate from different substance groups, however, they displayed similarities in the evoked malformations of rat embryos. With increasing concentrations, all substances led to a reduction of size, protein content, somites, and yolk sac vasculogenesis and a decrease in scoring parameters. More specifically, substance-specific alterations were detected. Mostly, the development of the telencephalon was affected. From a concentration of 200 μg/ml (716, 5 μM) upward, cyclophosphamide led to the missing of the eye anlage and a stunted telencephalon. Retinol caused also alterations of the telencephalon (at 2, 5 μg/ml / 8, 73 μM) : 66, 6 % of the embryos had an open cranial neuroporus. At a concentration of 5, 0 μg/ml (17, 5 μM), 100 % of the embryos were abnorm, the telencephalon displayed an uneven surface and several hamorrhagies; the eye- and ear anlagen were completely missing. Albendazole caused an impared development of the telencephalon, but with a closed neural tube. Acetylaminofluorene (50 μg/ml bzw. 223, 9 μM) led to the development of placodes of the nose and open neural tubes. At a concentration of 200 μg/ml (895, 7 μM) or higher, the telencephalon did not exist anymore, but placodes of the nose and hamorrhagies could be found in all rat embryos. The cranial neural tube was open. <b>Valpromide</b> did not cause any microscopically visible alterations of the telencephalon. Characteristic for cyclophosphamide, <b>valpromide</b> and acetylaminofluorene was the incomplete rotation of the trunk, causing a “squirrel-like” position. Retinol and albendazole showed an effect on the heart. At 2, 5 μg/ml, retinol caused an incomplete amnion development, displaying microscopic malfunctions of the cardiac loop, and albendazole caused a malformation of the pericard. Characteristically, retinol also caused a complete adhesion of amnion and trunk at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (17, 5 μM). At 2, 5 μg/ml (8, 7 μM) the composition of the hind limbs and tail was retarded. <b>Valpromide</b> did not induce specific or characteristic malformations. At higher concentrations, the rat embryos did not completely rotate, and at the highest tested concentration, most embryos were malformed. The 80 / 20 and 50 / 50 combinations of most of the substances caused effects and were in agreement with the results observed with compounds when tested alone. Discussion: Comparing the test compounds with their metabolites, alterations of the rat embryos were found to be mostly in the same body parts and similar to effects described in earlier publications. Most notably was the higher toxicity found among the retinol/all-transretinoic acid-combination in comparison to the testings of retinol and its metabolite alone. At the second concentration (0, 83 μM) of 80 / 20 combination, open cranial neuropori and an incomplete rotation of the trunk was visible, while by testing retinol and its metabolite alone, statistically significant alterations occurred only at concentrations of 1, 66 μM and higher. This effect was even more pronounced with the 50 / 50 combination: The first alterations (incomplete rotation and open neuropori) were already observed at levels of 0, 33 μM (0, 1 μg/ml). Converse results, however, were found with albendazole/albendazole sulfoxide combination. The metabolite was less toxic than the parent compound. As a result, both combinations displayed less pronounced effects than the parent substance alone. Conclusion: The WEC with rat embryos is appropriate for analysing various substances in combination, thus simulating the situation induced by maternal metabolic activity. The results will be an essential prerequisite for the development and integration of a metabolizing system into the WEC...|$|E
40|$|Epoxide hydrolases are {{essential}} for the processing of epoxide-containing compounds in detoxification or metabolism. The classic epoxide hydrolases have an / hydrolase fold and act via a two-step reaction mechanism including an enzyme¿substrate intermediate.

This enzyme represents a completely different structure and a novel one-step mechanism. The fold features a highly curved six-stranded mixed -sheet, with four -helices packed onto it to create a deep pocket.

Site-directed mutagenesis supports the conclusion that this is the active site.

The AED valproic acid (VPA) holds out particular promise as it is engaging a variety of different anticonvulsant mechanisms simultaneously. However, the clinical use of VPA is limited by two rare but potentially life-threatening side effects: teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity. We synthesized VPA’s corresponding amide: <b>valpromide</b> (VPD), two of VPA’s isomers and their corresponding amides; valnoctic acid (VCA), valnoctamide (VCD), diisopropyl acetic acid (DIA), diisopropylacetamide (DID) and VPD”s congener N-methyl-VPD (MVPD). VCD, DID and VPD are non-teratogenic, potentially non-hepatotoxic, and exhibit better anticonvuslant potency than VPA.

In this study we have assessed the antiallodynic activity of these compounds in comparison to VPA and gabapentin (GBP) using the rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain.

40|$|Reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from latency {{into the}} lytic phase {{of its life}} cycle allows the virus to spread among cells and between hosts. Valproic acid (VPA) {{inhibits}} initiation of the lytic cycle in EBV-infected B lymphoma cells. While VPA blocks viral lytic gene expression, it induces expression of many cellular genes, {{because it is a}} histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Here we show, using derivatives of VPA, that blockade of EBV reactivation is separable from HDAC inhibition. <b>Valpromide</b> (VPM), an amide derivative of valproic acid that is not an HDAC inhibitor, prevented expression of two EBV genes, BZLF 1 and BRLF 1, that mediate lytic reactivation. VPM also inhibited expression of a viral late gene, but not early genes, when BZLF 1 was exogenously expressed. Unlike VPA, VPM did not activate lytic expression of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Expression of cellular immediate-early genes, such as FOS and EGR 1, is kinetically upstream of the EBV lytic cycle. VPM did not activate expression of these cellular immediate-early genes but decreased their level of expression when induced by butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor. VPM did not alter expression of several other cellular immediate-early genes, including STAT 3, which were induced by the HDAC inhibitors in cells refractory to lytic induction. Therefore, VPM selectively inhibits both viral and cellular gene expression. VPA and VPM represent a new class of antiviral agents. The mechanism by which VPA and VPM block EBV reactivation may be related to their anticonvulsant activity...|$|E
40|$|The β-amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) represents a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is ubiquitously expressed. In the brain, it {{is a key}} player in the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Its physiological function is however less well understood. Previous studies showed that APP is up-regulated in prostate, colon, pancreatic tumor, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. In this study, we show that APP has an essential role in growth control of pancreatic and colon cancer. Abundant APP staining was found in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colon cancer tissue. Interestingly, treating pancreatic and colon cancer cells with valproic acid (VPA, 2 -propylpentanoic acid), a known histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, leads to up-regulation of GRP 78, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone immunoglobulin-binding protein. GRP 78 is involved in APP maturation and inhibition of tumor cell growth by down-regulation of APP and secreted soluble APPα. Trichostatin A, a pan-HDAC inhibitor, also lowered APP and increased GRP 78 levels. In contrast, treating cells with <b>valpromide,</b> a VPA derivative lacking HDAC inhibitory properties, had no effect on APP levels. VPA did not modify the level of epidermal growth factor receptor, another type I transmembrane protein, and APLP 2, a member of the APP family, demonstrating the specificity of the VPA effect on APP. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of APP also resulted in significantly decreased cell growth. Based on these observations, the data suggest that APP down-regulation via HDAC inhibition provides a novel mechanism for pancreatic and colon cancer therapy...|$|E

However, VPD (20 – 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), VCD (20 – 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and DID (20 – 90 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) produced dose-related reversal of tactile allodynia with ED 50 values of 61, 52 and 58 [*]mgkg− 1, respectively.

40|$|Interspecies {{differences}} {{in regard to}} the teratogenicity of drugs can be the result of differing pharmacokinetic processes that determine the crucial concentration-time relationships in the embryo. Maternal absorption, as well as distribution, of the drugs does not usually show great species differences. The firstpass effect after oral application is often more pronounced in animals than man (e. g., valproic acid, 13 cis-retinoic acid), although in some cases the reverse was found (e. g., hydrolysis of <b>valpromide).</b> Existing differences can be adjusted by appropriate choice of the administration route and measurements of drug levels. Many variables determine the placental transfer of drugs: developmental stage, type of placenta, properties of the drug. Even closely related drugs (e. g., retinoids) may differ greatly in regard to placental transfer. Maternal protein binding is an important determinant of placental transfer, since only the free concentration in maternal plasma can equilibrate with the embryo during organogenesis; this parameter differs greatly across species (e. g., valproic acid: five times higher free fractions in mouse and hamster than in monkey and man). The metabolic pattern has not yet been demonstrated to be a major cause of species differences, although recent evidence on phenytoin and thalidomide support the hypothesis that some species differences can be the result of differing activation/deactivation pathways. Laboratory animals usually have a much higher rate of drug elimination than man. Drastic drug level fluctuations are therefore present during teratogenicity testing in animals, but not to the same degree in human therapy. It must, therefore, be investigated if peak concentrations (such as for valproic acid and possibly caffeine) or the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) (such as for cyclophosphamide and possibly retinoids) correlate with the teratogenic response. Only then is a rational and scientific basis for interspecies comparison possible. It is concluded that the prediction of the human response based on animal studies can be improved by consideration of the appropriate pharmacokinetic determinants...|$|E
40|$|Styrene 7, 8 -oxide and {{ethylene}} oxide {{are widely used}} genotoxic bulk chemicals, which {{have been associated with}} potential carcinogenic hazard for occupationally exposed workers. Both epoxides alkylate DNA preferentially at the N- 7 position of guanine and consequently produce single-strand breaks and alkali labile sites in the DNA of exposed cells. In order to study the role of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase (hmEH) in protecting cells against genotoxicity of styrene 7, 8 -oxide and {{ethylene oxide}}, we expressed the cDNA of hmEH in V 79 Chinese hamster cells. We obtained a number of cell clones that expressed functionally active epoxide hydrolase. Among these, the clone 92 hmEH-V 79 revealed an especially high enzymatic mEH activity toward styrene 7, 8 -oxide (10 nmol converted per mg of protein per min, measured in the 9, 000 x g supernatant of the cell homogenate), that was 100 times higher than that determined in mock-transfected cells and within the range of mEH activity in human liver. Styrene 7, 8 -oxide-induced DNA single-strand breaks/alkali labile sites (dose range 10 microM to 1 mM styrene 7, 8 -oxide) measured by the alkaline elution technique were significantly lower in the 92 hmEH-V 79 cells as compared to the mock-transfected cells. The protection against styrene 7, 8 -oxide genotoxicity in 92 hmEH-V 79 cells could be abolished by addition of <b>valpromide,</b> a selective inhibitor of microsomal epoxide hydrolase. These results clearly show that the metabolism of styrene 7, 8 -oxide by hmEH in 92 hmEH-V 79 cells was responsible for the protection against styrene 7, 8 -oxide genotoxicity. On the other hand, no protective effect of epoxide hydrolase expression could be observed on ethylene oxide-induced DNA damage with the recombinant cell line over a dose range of 0. 5 - 2. 5 mM ethylene oxide. This selectivity of the protective effect on epoxide genotoxicity thus appears to be an important factor that {{must be taken into account}} for the prediction of the genotoxic risk of epoxides themselves or compounds that can be metabolically activated to epoxides...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoid {{receptor}} (GR) {{is known}} to associate with KATs and KDACs to regulate transcription. The current model of GR-mediated transcription focuses on agonist-dependent recruitment of KATs to acetylate histones and casts KDACs as corepressors {{in the presence of}} antagonist. Recent studies have shown KDACs to function as coactivators in the GR-mediated activation of the MMTV promoter and inhibition of KDACs impairs this activation. Nevertheless, the effect of KDAC inhibition on the GR-regulated transcriptome is unknown. Our expression profiling studies in a glucocorticoid (GC) responsive hepatoma-derived cell line, show that the class I-selective KDACi, VPA, has a profound impact on the GR-regulated hepatic transcriptome. VPA treatment alone mimics GC signaling at some GR-target genes and cooperates with GC to activate a small number of genes. However, the predominant effect of VPA, seen in more than 50 % of the GR-target genes, is impairment of normal GR-mediated activation. This suggests that KDACs {{play a significant role in}} facilitating GR signaling. We have shown that VPA does not impair GR processing and that the inhibitory effects of VPA are due to impaired transcription. We have also determined that apicidin, a structurally distinct class I-selective KDACi, impairs GR-transactivation similar to VPA, while <b>valpromide,</b> a structural analog of VPA without KDACi activity, does not. In addition, siRNA-mediated depletion of KDAC 1 fully or partially mimics the effects of VPA at most of the VPA impaired GR-target genes and co-depletion of KDACs 1 and 2 caused full or partial impairment of Dex-activation at a few other genes. Collectively, our results show that class-I KDACs facilitate GR-mediated transcription at most of the GR-target genes and that KDAC 1 alone or in co-operation with KDAC 2 is required for efficient GR-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, ChIP assays have shown that active KDACs are constitutively present at the gene promoters and that KDAC inhibition does not affect GR binding to the DNA. Thus KDACs could potentially deacetylate the coregulators necessary for transcriptional activation. Finally, KDACs are known targets of a group of drugs either being used or evaluated in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. These results also pose ramifications for the clinical use of these drugs...|$|E
