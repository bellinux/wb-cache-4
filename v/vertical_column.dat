5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>column</b> in the {{periodic}} table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a <b>vertical</b> <b>column</b> of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a <b>vertical</b> <b>column</b> of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E

5|$|An ice core is a <b>vertical</b> <b>column</b> {{through a}} glacier, {{sampling}} the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E

500|$|Some {{meteorological}} {{processes are}} too small-scale or too complex to be explicitly included in {{numerical weather prediction}} models. Parameterization is a procedure for representing these processes by relating them to variables on the scales that the model resolves. For example, the gridboxes in weather and climate models have sides that are between [...] and [...] in length. [...] A typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. [...] Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. [...] In the earliest models, if a column of air within a model gridbox was conditionally unstable (essentially, the bottom was warmer and moister than the top) and the water vapor content at any point within the column became saturated {{then it would be}} overturned (the warm, moist air would begin rising), and the air in that <b>vertical</b> <b>column</b> mixed. [...] More sophisticated schemes recognize that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. [...] Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between [...] can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they need to parameterize cloud microphysics which occur at a smaller scale. [...] The formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based; they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. [...] Sub-grid scale processes need to be taken into account. [...] Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical value of relative humidity less than 100%, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that occurs in the real world.|$|E

2500|$|The {{combustion}} flue gases {{inside the}} chimneys or stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes {{the bottom of}} the <b>vertical</b> <b>column</b> of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure {{at the bottom of a}} corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney. That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called [...] "natural draught/draft", [...] "natural ventilation", [...] "chimney effect", or [...] "stack effect". The taller the stack, the more draught or draft is created. There can be cases of diminishing returns: if a stack is overly tall in relation to the heat being sent out of the stack, the flue gases may cool before reaching the top of the chimney. [...] This condition can result in poor drafting, and in the case of wood burning appliances, the cooling of the gases before emission can cause creosote to condense near the top of the chimney. The creosote can restrict the exit of flue gases and may pose a fire hazard.|$|E
40|$|Spatial proxies used in {{bottom-up}} emission inventories {{to derive}} the spatial distributions of emissions are usually empirical and involve additional levels of uncertainty. Although uncertainties in current emission inventories {{have been discussed}} extensively, uncertainties resulting from improper spatial proxies have rarely been evaluated. In this work, we investigate the impact of spatial proxies on the representation of gridded emissions by comparing six gridded NO x emission datasets over China developed from the same magnitude of emissions and different spatial proxies. GEOS-Chem-modeled tropospheric NO 2 <b>vertical</b> <b>columns</b> simulated from different gridded emission inventories are compared with satellite-based columns. The results show that differences between modeled and satellite-based NO 2 <b>vertical</b> <b>columns</b> {{are sensitive to the}} spatial proxies used in the gridded emission inventories. The total population density is less suitable for allocating NO x emissions than nighttime light data because population density tends to allocate more emissions to rural areas. Determining the exact locations of large emission sources could significantly strengthen the correlation between modeled and observed NO 2 <b>vertical</b> <b>columns.</b> Using vehicle population and an updated road network for the on-road transport sector could substantially enhance urban emissions and improve the model performance. When further applying industrial gross domestic product (IGDP) values for the industrial sector, modeled NO 2 <b>vertical</b> <b>columns</b> could better capture pollution hotspots in urban areas and exhibit the best performance of the six cases compared to satellite-based NO 2 <b>vertical</b> <b>columns</b> (slope [*]=[*] 1. 01 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0. [*] 85). This analysis provides a framework for information from satellite observations to inform bottom-up inventory development. In the future, more effort should be devoted to the representation of spatial proxies to improve spatial patterns in bottom-up emission inventories...|$|R
