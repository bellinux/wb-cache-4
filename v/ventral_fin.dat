5|$|Assigned {{the serial}} number 1440, the XSO2U-1 flew for the first time, as a landplane, in July 1939; its first flight as a {{seaplane}} took place that December. Flight testing of the SO2U showed that the aircraft lacked directional stability; {{the addition of a}} large <b>ventral</b> <b>fin,</b> connecting the rear of the float to the tail, helped to cure the problem.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{changes from}} the XF-104 to {{production}} {{versions of the}} Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting nose landing gear (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem.|$|E

50|$|The {{color of}} the body is reddish orange, {{sometimes}} with three wide darker bands, one behind the eye, one {{in the center of the}} body, and one on the caudal peduncle. During the breeding season, sexual dimorphism is striking; the male's body is covered with sinuous orange lines and the dorsal and <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> become red, while the female is orange with a faint dark band in the middle of the body and has belly and basal part of the <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> white silver, and the final part of the <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> is rather dark orange. It feeds on crustaceans, especially copepods and mysid shrimps, or on molluscs and worms.|$|R

25|$|The new {{trainers}} {{were designated}} CT-134 Musketeer in the then Canadian Armed Forces. The aircraft purchased were standard Model B23s {{equipped with the}} O-360-A4G engine of , modified {{by the addition of}} a cowling strake, horizontal stabilizer strake and <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> to improve spin recovery performance. They were initially serial numbered as 13401-13424, but were re-numbered 134001-134024 to avoid confusion with other CF aircraft serial numbers.|$|E
25|$|The tail is whip-like and {{measures}} 11.5 {{times as long}} as the disc is wide. A long, serrated spine originates in the first third of the tail, and is followed by a low dorsal keel and a <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> fold. Young rays have smooth skin, while adults have a patch of small dermal denticles between and behind the eyes, and a row of thorns along the midline of the back. There are 16 tubercles in front of the tail spine, and numerous small denticles behind. This species is plain brown above, often with yellow or orange coloring before the eyes, behind the spiracles, around the disc margin, and laterally on the tail in front of the spine. The tail darkens to nearly black towards the tip and on the <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> fold. The underside is white with bright orange-red patches. The Mekong freshwater stingray (D. laosensis) is also characterized by orange ventral coloration and has some similar meristic counts to this species, but differs in disc shape, denticle coverage, and dorsal coloration.|$|E
50|$|This fish reaches 25 to 30 centimeters in length. It {{is light}} brown with darker saddle-marks and spots. The <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> are yellow. These fins are fused {{to form a}} cup. There are two dorsal fins. The species can be {{identified}} by the arrangement of pores on its head, the spines and rays in the dorsal fins, and the scales and papillae {{on the head and}} face. The yellow <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> also distinguish it from other gobies. The lifespan is generally up to 3 years, but some individuals may get older.|$|R
50|$|Most {{species are}} rheophilic, living in swift, clear and well-oxygenated streams. Several {{species of the}} family live in fast-flowing streams or torrents and have {{modified}} <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> used for clinging to rocks.|$|R
50|$|Color:Silvery bodied {{fish with}} {{numerous}} small {{spots on the}} flanks. Anal fin is hyaline with a broad black margin. Pectoral and <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> are clear. A humeral spot may be present. Eyes silvery to reddish-orange.|$|R
25|$|In 2009 the Colombian Air Force ordered 25 {{modified}} Legacy FGs {{to be used}} {{as basic}} trainers. The aircraft feature 15% more wing area than the standard Legacy FG wing, leading-edge cuffs and a <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> to improve stability and low-speed handling along with a reshaped vertical tail and rudder. The aircraft are known as the Lancair Synergy and were delivered as kits for assembly in Colombia. The first Synergy was flown in September 2010.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft's {{aerodynamic}} {{design has}} been modified {{based on the}} test flights completed {{and the use of}} computer models with the aim of increasing performance. Changes include altering the engine thrust angle, which has made a large improvement. On the final production aircraft the right side door has been eliminated to save weight. The door will be replaced by an emergency egress hatch. The production aircraft will also have a more pointed nose, larger belly section, redesigned wing-root fairing, reduced tail sweep and a larger or even dual <b>ventral</b> <b>fin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} stabilizers were seemingly undersized, {{and mounted}} {{below the line}} of the wing. The larger vertical fin was supplemented by a <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> for high-speed stability. This fin folded to the right, as seen from behind, during takeoff and landing to avoid hitting the ground. Two petal-style air brakes were mounted directly behind the horizontal surfaces, opening out and up at about a 45° angle into the gap between the horizontal and vertical surfaces. A provision for a braking parachute is not evident on the mock-up or the various artwork, although this was common for aircraft of the era.|$|E

50|$|Development test aircraft, one built. OKB {{designation}} was 128. In the West, Fiddler-A {{was used}} for all the aircraft with twin <b>ventral</b> <b>fins</b> — these included a prototype {{and a few of}} initial production (perhaps two planes).|$|R
25|$|The {{airframe}} followed contemporary {{aircraft construction}} techniques, with weight savings {{from the use}} of advanced materials and the short airborne life of the missile. The fuselage was essentially tubular, tapering to a point at the nose, housing the guidance equipment, warhead and systems equipment. The engine was fed with air through a distinctive wedge shaped intake under the center fuselage. Its swept wings attached to its fuselage at the middle position, roughly halfway along its length, and a large swept fin attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage at the rear which was sometimes augmented by a large <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> at the extreme rear of the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010 {{the company}} {{announced}} that customer deliveries of production 162s would be delayed by six to ten months. The company indicated {{that most of the}} delay was due to modifications required to aircraft produced by Shenyang Aircraft as a result of further spin testing and the earlier crashes of the prototypes. The first production aircraft were delivered from China, assembled by Cessna contractor Yingling Aviation and then modified by adding the <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> and decreasing the elevator and aileron travel. In February 2012, the assembly of the plane was moved to Cessna's Independence, Kansas factory, ending Yingling's participation. Cessna had planned to incorporate the airframe changes into the Chinese production line.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> {{consists}} of 1 spine and 5 soft rays, while the caudal fin is strongly forked. The species lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, with 50 to 60 scales in this section, while the straight section contains 0 to 4 scales and 30 to 40 strong scutes. The pattern of breast scales is variable, ranging from fully scaled to naked ventrally. The species has moderately well developed adipose eyelids, while its dentition {{consists of}} an outer row of widely spaced canines and an inner band of villiform teeth in the upper jaw and a row of widely spaced conical teeth on the lower jaw. The blacktip trevally has 24 to 27 gill rakers and 24 vertebrae.|$|E

500|$|The tail is short, barely {{exceeding}} {{the length of}} the disc when intact, and has a broad and flattened base leading to usually two stinging spines. After the stings, the tail becomes slender and bears a long <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> fold and a much shorter, lower dorsal fin fold. Most of the body lacks dermal denticles; a midline row of 4–13 small, closely spaced thorns is present behind the spiracles, and another row of 0–4 thorns before the stings. The dorsal coloration is grayish green, becoming pinkish towards the disc margins; there is a dark mask-like shape around the eyes and a pair of small dark blotches behind the spiracles. The tail behind the stings has alternating black and white bands of variable width, ending with black at the tip. The underside is plain white and the <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> fold is light grayish in color. This species grows to [...] across and [...] long.|$|E
500|$|The estuary {{stingray}} (Dasyatis fluviorum), {{also called}} the estuary stingaree or brown stingray, is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. Endemic to eastern Australia, it typically inhabits shallow, mangrove-lined tidal rivers, estuaries, and bays in southern Queensland and New South Wales. This yellow-brown to olive ray grows to at least [...] across. It has a diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc and a mostly smooth, whip-like tail bearing both dorsal and <b>ventral</b> <b>fin</b> folds. It can additionally be identified by its long, narrow nostrils and the row of thorns along the midline of its back.|$|E
500|$|The round ribbontail ray (Taeniura meyeni) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Dasyatidae, found throughout the nearshore waters of the tropical Indo-Pacific, as well as off islands in the eastern Pacific.
