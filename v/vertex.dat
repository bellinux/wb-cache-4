5|$|A {{connected}} component of an undirected graph is the subgraph {{consisting of the}} vertices and edges that {{can be reached by}} following edges from a single given starting <b>vertex.</b> A graph is connected if every <b>vertex</b> or edge is reachable from every other <b>vertex</b> or edge. A cycle in an undirected graph is a connected subgraph in which each <b>vertex</b> is incident to exactly two edges, or is a loop.|$|E
5|$|A path in a {{directed}} graph {{can be described}} by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending <b>vertex</b> of each edge in the sequence {{is the same as}} the starting <b>vertex</b> of the next edge in the sequence; a path forms a cycle if the starting <b>vertex</b> of its first edge equals the ending <b>vertex</b> of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a {{directed graph}} that has no cycles.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{also exist}} for {{describing}} polygonal tilings. When the tessellation {{is made of}} regular polygons, the most common notation is the <b>vertex</b> configuration, which is simply {{a list of the}} number of sides of the polygons around a <b>vertex.</b> The square tiling has a <b>vertex</b> configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{hierarchical}} clustering of graph <b>vertexes</b> is suggested. In the method, the graph partition is determined with an equivalence relation satisfying a recursive definition stating that <b>vertexes</b> are equivalent if the <b>vertexes</b> {{they point to}} (or <b>vertexes</b> pointing to them) are equivalent. Iterative application of the partitioning yields a hierarchical clustering of graph <b>vertexes.</b> The method {{is applied to the}} citation graph of hep-th. The outcome is a two-level classification scheme for the subject field presented in hep-th, and indexing of the papers from hep-th in this scheme.

40|$|In this article, we {{analyze the}} {{boundary}} behaviors of pure Yang-Mills amplitudes under adjacent and non adjacent BCFW shifts in Feynman gauge. We introduce reduced <b>vertexes</b> for Yang-Mills fields, prove that these reduced <b>vertexes</b> are {{equivalent to the}} original <b>vertexes</b> as {{for the study of}} boundary behaviors, which greatly simplifies our analysis of boundary behaviors. Boundary behaviors for adjacent shifts are readily obtained using reduced <b>vertexes.</b> Then we prove a theorem on permutation sum and use it to prove the improved boundary behaviors for non-adjacent shifts.

5|$|In graph theory, a {{bipartite graph}} is a graph whose {{vertices}} are {{split into two}} colors, such that neighboring vertices have different colors. If a connected graph has no odd cycles, then a bipartition can be constructed by choosing a base <b>vertex</b> v and coloring every <b>vertex</b> black or white, depending on whether its distance from v is even or odd. Since the distance between v and itself is 0, and 0 is even, the base <b>vertex</b> is colored differently from its neighbors, which lie {{at a distance of}} 1.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} goal-bias RRT {{is mentioned}} {{to improve the}} efficiency, but it has an inherent problem, when there are lesser <b>vertexes,</b> the search toward the goal is often invalid; however, when there are more <b>vertexes,</b> the search toward other regions is often unnecessary. To solve this problem, we introduce a kind bidirectional variable probability RRT algorithm. In this paper, we build two trees, and one tree expands toward to the other tree at a variable probability. This probability is {{in proportion to the}} coverage of the trees, that is, when there are lesser <b>vertexes,</b> the searches are mainly toward unexplored regions, and when there are more <b>vertexes,</b> we attach more importance to the connection of two trees. The results show the good performance and convergence speed of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A <b>vertex</b> {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every <b>vertex</b> point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each <b>vertex</b> is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every <b>vertex.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tessellations {{in three}} or more {{dimensions}} are called honeycombs. In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron <b>vertex.</b> Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron <b>vertex.</b> However, there are many possible semiregular honeycombs in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E

40|$|The Bose–Einstein {{condensation}} of vacancies in {{a three-dimensional}} decorated lattice is considered. The model describes possible scenario of superfluidity of solid helium, {{caused by the}} presence of zero-point vacancies in a dislocation network. It is shown that the temperature of Bose–Einstein condensation decreases under increase of the length of the network segments, and the law of decrease depends essentially on the properties of the <b>vertexes</b> of the network. If the <b>vertexes</b> correspond to barriers with a small transparency, the critical temperature is inversely as the square of the length of the segment. On the contrary, if the <b>vertexes</b> correspond to traps for the vacancies (it is energetically preferable for the vacancies to be localized at the <b>vertexes),</b> an exponential lowering of the temperature of transition takes place. The highest temperature of Bose–Einstein condensation is reached in the intermediate case of <b>vertexes</b> with large transparency, but in the absence of tendency of localization at them. In the latter case the critical temperature is inversely as the length of the segment...|$|R

5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their <b>vertex</b> configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the <b>vertex</b> configuration 4.82 (each <b>vertex</b> has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|A third, more {{graphical}} way {{of describing}} a 2-satisfiability instance is as an implication graph. An implication graph is a directed graph {{in which there}} is one <b>vertex</b> per variable or negated variable, and an edge connecting one <b>vertex</b> to another whenever the corresponding variables are related by an implication in the implicative normal form of the instance. An implication graph must be a skew-symmetric graph, meaning that it has a symmetry that takes each variable to its negation and reverses the orientations of all of the edges.|$|E
5|$|A uniform tiling is a tiling {{in which}} each tile is a regular polygon and in which every <b>vertex</b> can be mapped to every other <b>vertex</b> by a {{symmetry}} of the tiling. Usually, uniform tilings additionally are required to have tiles that meet edge-to-edge, but if this requirement is relaxed then there are eight additional uniform tilings. Four are formed from infinite strips of squares or equilateral triangles, and three are formed from equilateral triangles and regular hexagons. The remaining one is the Pythagorean tiling.|$|E
