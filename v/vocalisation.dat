5|$|Both sexes drum, {{although}} the male does {{so much more}} often, mostly from mid-January until the young are fledged. The far-carrying drumming is faster than for any other woodpecker in its range at around 10–16strikes per second, typically in one-second bursts, although repeated frequently. As late as {{the early twentieth century}} it was thought that the drumming might be a <b>vocalisation,</b> and it was not until 1943 that it was finally proved to be purely mechanical.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their <b>vocalisation</b> when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
40|$|Recordings of {{elephant}} <b>vocalisations</b> {{can be used}} {{to determine}} the size and composition of the herd, the sexual state, as well as the emotional condition of an elephant. Manual analysis of recordings (by listening to these and by visual inspection of spectrograms) to locate <b>vocalisations</b> is tedious. The automatic detection of <b>vocalisations</b> in recordings is explored. Important signal characteristics of elephant <b>vocalisations</b> were identified from spectrograms and a technique, based on the principles of existing voice activity detection algorithms, was developed to exploit these. Results obtained suggest that the algorithm can reliably detect elephant <b>vocalisations</b> from noisy recordings as long as the harmonic structure of <b>vocalisations</b> is not buried in background noise...|$|R
40|$|The {{duration}} of three infants’ <b>vocalisations</b> were examined during a six-month longitudinal study. In contrast to most other infant research, this {{study included in}} its analysis all <b>vocalisations</b> including those deemed vegetative or those having nonmodal voice quality. All three infants produced <b>vocalisations</b> which decreased in duration in the initial months. However between the 3 rd and 5 th month a significant increase (p< 0. 001) in the {{duration of}} <b>vocalisations</b> was found (from mean 207 ms to 431 ms). When <b>vocalisations</b> were analysed using perceptual voice quality categories, all {{were found to have}} significant differences (p< 0. 05) in duration relative to modal voice. Nonmodal voice qualities showed initial decreases in duration before increasing in duration in later months. In contrast those <b>vocalisations</b> produced using modal voice showed a positive linear trend and had the greatest linear rate of change across the study. These findings highlight the importance of including a wide variety of infant <b>vocalisations</b> including those with nonmodal voice quality in infant linguistic developmental studies...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of {{listener}} <b>vocalisations</b> {{is one of}} the focused research {{areas to}} improve emotionally coloured conversational speech synthesis. To communicate different intentions, a synthesiser should be capable of generating a broad range of <b>vocalisations</b> with different kinds of acoustic properties. However, the data collection for corpus based methods is necessarily limited in acoustic variability. This paper describes our approach to increase the acoustic variability of <b>vocalisations</b> in terms of intonation. After selecting the best candidate for a given target from among the available <b>vocalisations,</b> we use prosody modification techniques to impose a target intonation contour. In an experiment, we combine markedly distinct intonation contours with <b>vocalisations</b> differing in segmental form, using the prosody modification techniques MLSA vocoding, FD-PSOLA, and HNM. In a listening test, we evaluate the perceived naturalness of the resulting synthesised <b>vocalisations,</b> and assess the effect of segmental form, intonation contour and modification technique on perceived meaning...|$|R
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's <b>vocalisation.</b> Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.|$|E
5|$|Frogs {{are much}} more vocal, {{especially}} during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates. The presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself. In most species, the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or {{at the corner of}} the mouth. This may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator, helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere, or the water at times when the animal is submerged. The main <b>vocalisation</b> is the male's loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory. This call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near. Calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy. Other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus. When a frog is attacked, a distress or fright call is emitted, often resembling a scream. The usually nocturnal Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours.|$|E

40|$|Infant giant pandas {{are highly}} vocal {{during the first}} few weeks of life, {{producing}} <b>vocalisations</b> that are characterised by noisy, aperiodic segments. The aperiodic character of many animal <b>vocalisations</b> results from irregular vibratory regimes of the vocal folds, and one proposed function of this so-called nonlinear phenomena (NLP) in animal <b>vocalisations</b> is to convey information about the caller's arousal state. This hypothesis was tested in the <b>vocalisations</b> of six hand-reared giant panda cubs recorded during handling and feeding procedures that had been categorised into low- and high-arousal contexts based on quantified motor activity. Ninety-three per cent of the <b>vocalisations</b> contained NLP, including deterministic chaos and subharmonics. <b>Vocalisations</b> produced in the high-arousal contexts, however, were characterised by an increase in chaos, as well as increased call duration and x¯ fundamental frequency (pitch). These results suggest that infant giant panda vocal signals have the potential to express different arousal states. Furthermore, because giant panda cubs are the smallest placental mammal offspring at birth compared with adult size, acoustically conveying arousal state to the mother might be crucial for infant survival under natural rearing condition...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated perceptual aftereffects for emotionally expressive faces, but {{the extent to which}} they can also be obtained in a different modality is unknown. In two experiments we show for the first time that adaptation to affective, non-linguistic <b>vocalisations</b> elicits significant auditory aftereffects. Adaptation to angry <b>vocalisations</b> caused voices drawn from an anger-fear morphed continuum to be perceived as less angry and more fearful, while adaptation to fearful <b>vocalisations</b> elicited opposite aftereffects (Experiment 1). We then tested the link between these aftereffects and the underlying acoustics by using caricatured adaptors. Although caricatures exaggerated the acoustical and affective properties of the <b>vocalisations,</b> the caricatured adaptors resulted in aftereffects which were comparable to those obtained with natural <b>vocalisations</b> (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that these aftereffects cannot be solely explained by low-level adaptation to acoustical characteristics of the adaptors but are likely to depend on higher-level adaptation of neural representations of vocal affect...|$|R

25|$|Hamsters become fertile at {{different}} ages {{depending on their}} species. Both Syrian and Russian hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing {{at a young age}} (4–5 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually begin reproducing at two to three months of age, and Roborovskis at three to four months of age. The female's reproductive life lasts about 18 months, but male hamsters remain fertile much longer. Females are in estrus about every four days, which is indicated by a reddening of genital areas, a musky smell, and a hissing, squeaking <b>vocalisation</b> she will emit if she believes a male is nearby.|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{analysed}} the behaviour of chimpanzees, {{with particular}} reference to copulation calling. Copulation calling {{is a type}} of <b>vocalisation</b> used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then be one way to ensure that the female can mate with as many different males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring.|$|E

40|$|Abstract There are {{relatively}} few quantitative descriptive {{studies of the}} <b>vocalisations</b> and vocal behaviour of tropical bird species, {{in spite of the}} tropic’s rich avian biodiversity and the extensive variety of <b>vocalisations</b> produced by tropical birds. This lack of information inhibits our under-standing of tropical animals, including our ability to perform comparative analyses on vocal behaviours from an evolu-tionary perspective. In this study, we present the first quan-titative description of the vocal repertoire and daily vocal activity of White-eared Ground-sparrows (Melozone leuco-tis), using focal and autonomous recordings collected during two consecutive breeding seasons in Costa Rica.

Established as a Wagnerian, in 1894 she made her first tour of the United States of America with the Damrosch Company, and in {{addition}} to those two roles also appeared as Brangäne in Tristan und Isolde and Brünnhilde in Die Walküre. Her Brünnhilde was considered especially fine, not only for her splendid <b>vocalisation</b> but also for her stature and handsome appearance.

25|$|In extratropical Eurasia and the Americas {{almost all}} song is {{produced}} by male birds; however in the tropics and {{to a greater extent}} the desert belts of Australia and Africa it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been {{known for a long time}} and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cannot breed in many years because food supply never increases above a minimal level. With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and <b>vocalisation,</b> especially duetting, serves this purpose. The high frequency of female vocalisations in the tropics, Australia and Southern Africa may also relate to very low mortality rates producing much stronger pair-bonding and territoriality.|$|E

40|$|Study {{funded by}} Leverhulme Trust (F/ 00268 /AP) and European Research Council (PRILANG 283871) Grants. We present {{empirical}} evidence {{showing that the}} acoustic properties of non-linguistic <b>vocalisations</b> produced by human infants in different cultures can be used cross-culturally by listeners to make inferences about the infant’s current behaviour. We recorded natural infant <b>vocalisations</b> in Scotland and Uganda in five social contexts; declarative pointing, giving an object, requesting an action, protesting, and requesting food. Using a playback paradigm, we tested parents and non-parents, who either had regular or no experience with young children, from Scotland and Uganda {{in their ability to}} match infant <b>vocalisations</b> of both cultures to their respective production contexts. All participants performed above chance, regardless of prior experience with infants or cultural background, with only minor differences between participant groups.

500|$|In its display flight, {{the storm}} petrel gives a call {{consisting}} of eight or more repetitions of a fast ter-CHICK sounds {{ending in a}} trill (rapid alternation of notes). This chattering, staccato call is highly variable in pitch, stress and length. Both sexes make the call, which is used as an advertisement for a mate, for pair recognition, and in the nuptial flight. The details of the <b>vocalisation</b> vary geographically, including between the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, and birds recognise calls from their own breeding area. The chatter-call of the Mediterranean subspecies is distinctive. It has the first two notes running into each other, and the final element is sometimes doubled. The storm petrel is usually silent at sea, but sometimes gives the chattering call. A purring song arrr-r-r-r-r-r-r… [...] ending with a sharp chikka is given in the burrow by the male only; it was described by Charles Oldham as [...] "like a fairy being sick". Other vocalisations include a fast wick-wick-wick, sometimes given in flight, and an up-CHERRK alarm which resembles the chatter-call. Chicks give a whistling pee-pee-pee call when being fed, and a faster version of this <b>vocalisation</b> is used by adults and young to signal distress.|$|E
500|$|Aggressive males give a trilled {{version of}} their call, {{transcribed}} as [...] "chur-chur-r-r-it-it-it-it". This call {{is also used}} by females in the breeding season, to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs. House sparrows give a nasal alarm call, the basic sound of which is transcribed as quer, and a shrill chree call in great distress. Another <b>vocalisation</b> is the [...] "appeasement call", a soft quee given to inhibit aggression, usually given between birds of a mated pair. These vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow, but are shared, with small variations, by all sparrows.|$|E
500|$|The call {{is a low}} drumming, {{accompanied}} by a tuk, tuk, tuk made with the wings. The nature of the <b>vocalisation</b> led to a local legend that the sound is made by the bird beating on a hollow tree or branch with its feet. Gerd Heinrich noted the local name [...] "soisa", meaning drum, and described the call as being a subdued drumming purre – purre – purre – purre – purre which sometimes ends in a loud shrill scream. The bird also produced a dull hum similar {{to the voice of}} the banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus) and reminiscent of the call of the snoring rail (Aramidopsis plateni). Calling is most frequent in the early morning or late evening, and a human tapping a sago stem with a machete may elicit a response from the bird. A quieter version of the call is given at the nest.|$|E

The antelope displays two characteristic leapsit can jump up to , over vegetation and even other impala, covering distances of up to the other type of leap involves a series of jumps in which the animal lands on its forelegs, moves its hindlegs mid-air in a kicking fashion, lands on all fours and then rebounds. It leaps in either manner in different directions, probably to confuse predators. At times, the impala may also conceal itself in vegetation to escape {{the eye of the}} predator. The most prominent <b>vocalisation</b> is the loud roar, delivered through one to three loud snorts with the mouth closed, followed by two to ten deep grunts with the mouth open and the chin and tail raised; a typical roar can be heard up to [...] away.

500|$|The russet sparrow's vocalisations are {{described}} by most sources as [...] "the sweetest and most musical" [...] of any sparrow. Its basic call is a cheep or chilp, {{similar to that}} of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as cheep chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes {{similar to those of the}} white wagtail. A thin swee swee <b>vocalisation</b> not unlike that of an Indian robin has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded.

The song is confusable {{with that of the}} blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp kek-kek, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping tchurr-r-r-r resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard. [...] The juvenile has a quia alarm <b>vocalisation.</b> The garden warbler will occasionally mimic other birds, and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap. Both Sylvia warblers will also sing against common nightingales, which have a similar song despite being unrelated.
