25|$|Lady Nugent {{was built}} at Bombay in 1813. She made four <b>voyages</b> under <b>contract</b> to the British East India Company (EIC).

50|$|The freight market {{consists}} of shipowners, charterers and brokers. They use {{four types of}} contractual arrangements: the <b>voyage</b> charter, the <b>contract</b> of affreightment, the time charter and the bareboat charter.

Although the show was {{initially}} scheduled to run for 13 weeks, it was cut short after six when Formby suffered again from dysentery and depression. He again announced his retirement, but continued to work. After some television appearances on Ask Pickles and Top of the Town, in late 1954 and early 1955 respectively, Formby travelled to South Africa for a tour, where Beryl negotiated {{an agreement with the}} South African premier Johannes Strijdom to play in venues of Formby's choice, and then sailed to Canada for a ten-day series of performances. On the return <b>voyage</b> he <b>contracted</b> bronchial pneumonia, but still joined the cast of the non-musical play Too Young to Marry on his arrival in Britain.|$|R
50|$|The type of {{insurance}} contract {{depends on the}} Incoterm adopted by the parties in a sale contract. A CIF sale contract requires the seller to obtain insurance cover for the <b>voyage.</b> An FOB <b>contract</b> however places no obligation on the buyer or seller to obtain insurance, although it is prudent for the buyer to protect against potential losses. It {{is not uncommon for}} the buyer in a FOB contract to request the seller to arrange insurance on an understanding that they will reimburse the insurance costs incurred.|$|R

50|$|Anna was a {{merchant}} vessel originally {{employed as a}} collier taking coal from Yorkshire to London. For her final <b>voyage,</b> she was <b>contracted</b> by the Admiralty to carry additional stores for the squadron of Commodore George Anson on his voyage {{around the world in}} 1740-44. She was often referred to as 'Anna Pink', as a 'Pink' is a type of ship with a narrow stern. She lost company with the squadron on 24 April 1741, but rejoined it at the Juan Fernández Islands on 16 August 1741 (Julian calendar) after sheltering for two months in a natural harbour on the South Chilean coast. A subsequent survey found her timbers were too badly damaged for a re-fit, therefore her stores and crew were distributed about the squadron and she was scuttled on 18 August 1742 in Cumberland Bay, Juan Fernández.|$|R
2500|$|Bligh {{originally}} intended to tour Australia in 1882/3 with a team consisting only of Cambridge University cricketers. (Oxford and Cambridge Universities had very highly rated teams at the time.) This plan did not come fully to fruition, however, and Bligh ended up taking a team of eight amateurs and four professionals on the long <b>voyage.</b> Bligh was <b>contracted</b> to play three games against the same team that had beaten A N Hornby's side in England during the 1882 season, and he responded to the joke about the Ashes at dinner parties by saying his team would [...] "beard the kangaroo in his den and try and recover those ashes". In response, at a banquet at the Melbourne Town Hall, Australian captain Billy Murdoch said, [...] "Our boys fairly won the ashes and we confidently rely on them to retain possession or {{at least for the}} present. When, as we hope, we have shown our visitors that they cannot recover the ashes, we can then place the sacred dust in a suitable urn in our Public Library, as a curiosity to be shown to visitors with respect and esteem {{as the result of the}} Australian prowess in the cricket field." ...|$|R
5000|$|Squanto's chief fame {{resulted}} from {{his efforts to}} bring about peaceable contact and alliance between the English Separatists and other colonists who had come aboard the Mayflower and the Pokanoket. Owing to his facility with English, Squanto {{played a key role}} in the early meetings in March 1621. He soon became attached to the English settlers, whom he assisted in plantings of native vegetables, obtaining trade with local peoples and dealings with other native tribes, in at least one case endangering his safety in the process. He accompanied the settlers on a variety of missions to surrounding Natives as a result of which the English settlers created a peace and trade regime that ensured their security against attack and gave them the opportunity to obtain food supplement when their own supplies became insufficient, which became the case as more unprovisioned settlers were sent by their London commercial underwriters. Jealousy grew between Squanto and Hobomock, another Pokanoket living with the settlers. Just as Squanto and a group of settlers had launched their boat to trade for more corn, an alarm arose in Plymouth that the colony was under attack. Squanto was accused of fomenting hostilities between the Pokanoket and the English, allegations that were believed by both the sachem of the Pokanoket and the governor of Plymouth. A last minute reprieve saved Squanto from being handed over for execution. Despite the treaty Squanto helped broker between them, the settlers' governor, William Bradford, had been reluctant to part with Squanto, owing to his value to the colony. The standoff between the English colonists and the Pokanoket over Squanto increased Native hostilities around the colony's borders. It also put a stop to the colony's trade for native food at a time when its own store was becoming depleted. As food shortages increased, Bradford relied on Squanto to pilot a ship of English settlers a trading expedition around Cape Cod and through dangerous shoals that only Squanto had experience with. During that <b>voyage</b> Squanto <b>contracted</b> what the governor called an [...] "Indian fever." [...] Despite their urgent need for food for the colony, Bradford stayed with Squanto for several days until he died. Bradford wrote that his death was a [...] "great loss." ...|$|R
40|$|The “charterer’s {{liability}} insurance” {{is a type}} {{of marine}} insurance. Most ships are chartered either on a time charter or <b>voyage</b> charter <b>contract.</b> In both cases the charterer assumes liabilities towards the shipowner because of damage caused to the ship in the course of cargo-handling or because of damage resulting from an unsafe port or berth. And also, the charterer becomes liable similarly to the shipowner, with P&I liability to cargo, pollution claims and etc. All charterers require cover for both damage to hull and other P&I liabilities. The so-called “charterer’s liability insurance” provides coverage for such risks. I choose charterer’s liability insurance as the topic mostly because of the fast development of chartering ships in the market and the large number of disputes arising thereof. During my research, I found that there might be disputes arising out of the charter party, most of which is in relation to the damage to ships and general average after the casualties. The disputes become a major problem facing the charterer if he does not have a charterer’s liability insurance policy or he did not rightly enter such a policy. Moreover, the disputes may hinder the development of shipping market. In international P&I associations like Sculd and Gard, quite a number of vessels are enterers on the basis of charterer’s entry. To better understand this particular type of insurance and to discover certain practical problems about it, I will discuss sup-topics in the following chapters: Legal Sources (chapter 2), Charterer’s Risks (chapter 3), Overview of Charterer’s Liability Insurance Policy (chapter 4), Liability Cover (chapter 5), General Average Cover (chapter 6), Legal Expenses Cover (chapter 7) and Exclusions and Limitations of Coverage (chapter 8). For this mission, this thesis will adopt the comparative method by comparing the legislation and P&I Association rules of China, Norway and England, and by referring to different charter parties, different charterer’s liability insurance policies and several cases. The differences in relation to charterer’s liability insurance such as the legal framework, the cover of risks insured and limitation of risk between countries can be found anywhere especially when you are trying to make them clear by comparing eastern laws like China with western systems like Norway and U. K. However the situation is changing with the globalization...|$|R
