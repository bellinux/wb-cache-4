25|$|The {{increase}} of sugars in the grapes {{comes from the}} storage of carbohydrates in the roots and trunk of the grapevines {{as well as through}} the process of photosynthesis. Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transferred from the leaves to the berries as it is broken down into glucose and fructose molecules. The rate of this build up will depend on several factors including the climate (such as a string of cloudy weather which prohibits sunlight from reaching the vine) as well as the potential yield size of grape clusters and young <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> tips which compete for the resources of the mother grapevine. As the concentration of sugars build up, the concentration of acids decrease due, in part, to simple dilution but also to the consumption of acids in the process of plant respiration. The decrease in free acids, as well as the buildup of potassium, triggers a rise in the pH level of the grape juice.|$|E

These included activated carbons produced from novel precursors, namely rapeseed, <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> and kenaf, and samples oxidised with nitric acid in liquid phase. The results {{have shown the}} significant potential of rapeseed, <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> and kenaf for the activated carbon production. The activated carbons produced by carbon dioxide activation were mainly microporous with BET apparent surface area up to 1224 m 2 g- 1 and pore volume 0. 5 cm 3 g- 1. The effects of concentration and pH were studied. The phenol adsorption isotherms at 25 ºC followed the Freundlich model with maximum adsorption capacities of approximately 80 mgg- 1 and 60 mgg- 1 for the pristine and oxidised activated carbons, respectively. The influence of pH on the phenol adsorption has two trends for pH smaller and bigger than 10. The maximum adsorption capacity of mercury adsorption onto activated carbon made from <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> reaches 1103 mgg- 1.

50|$|Phototropism is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. Phototropism {{is one of the}} many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called negative phototropism (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit negative phototropism, although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{agri-food}} industry {{has resulted in a}} strong increase in its sludge generation. This type of waste is often produced in high amounts, concentrated in certain areas, and shows characteristics similar to those of municipal sewage sludge (except for the absence of heavy metals). Composting has been widely studied as a viable alternative for the treatment and recycling of municipal sewage sludge, but little information is currently available concerning the composting of agri-food sludge. Thus, the aim of this work was to increase our knowledge of how the vegetable-derived sludge produced by the agri-food sector can be managed using different co-composting strategies. The work was concerned mainly with the characteristics of the bulking agents used (type and particle size) and their effects {{on the development of the}} process and on the potential added value of the composts obtained. For this, four composting piles were prepared using agri-food sludge and two bulking agents (<b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> prunings and pepper plant pruning waste) at two particle sizes (< 1 cm and < 3 cm). The evolution of the process and the final properties of the composts obtained were studied using classical analytical methods together with advanced instrumental methods (thermal analysis and excitation–emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy). In addition, their physical characteristics and potential suppression of phytopathogens (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. melonis) were determined. The results showed differences according to the type and size of bulking agent, the mixtures with <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> prunings having a higher biodegradability, which was confirmed by thermogravimetry and EEM fluorescence spectroscopy. Melon plants grown in a mixture which included compost produced using vine pruning waste had a greater shoot weight than those grown on peat alone, while the mixture including compost derived from pepper pruning waste gave a shoot weight similar to that of peat-grown plants. Furthermore, the composts elaborated using <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> prunings had added value with respect to their use as growing media components for seedling production of melon, due to their suppression of F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis. Therefore, this study has shown that the nature of the bulking agent used is of major importance not only for the development of the composting process, but also for the final properties and potential added value of the end-products obtained.

40|$|Every year {{thousands}} of tonnes of biomass {{waste in the}} form of pruned <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> are produced in the Spanish region of La Rioja. This study, {{the first of its kind}} to be conducted in the region, examines how this waste can be valorised, mainly as an energy source. Representative samples were taken from the different varieties and vineyards in the region. Each batch of samples was then chemically characterised to learn its moisture content, percentage of ash, composition in terms of elements and heating power. The influence of various factors on these chemical properties was analysed. Only two factors proved to be of statistically significant importance: variety and training method. The expected performance in combustion of <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> of the region's predominant variety, Tempranillo, was estimated. Undoubted advantages were found, such as a significantly higher heating value (16 900 kJ/kg), moderate quantities of ash, medium aerosol emission rates, no expected problems of corrosion due to S or Cl, and a very low heavy metal content. In actual collection conditions, thermal energy from <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> after chopping (to between 30 and 100 mm), with a moisture content of less than 20 %, would cost 2. 45 euro cents/kWh to produce.

40|$|Biocomposites {{reinforced}} with lignocellulosic fillers is gaining {{more and more}} interest in different industries. The cheapest and most environmentally virtuous lignocellulosic fillers are those obtained from either agricultural, forestry or food industries wastes and by-products. It is now well-known that functional properties of composite materials are mainly related to the intrinsic properties each constituent, the filler content and the dispersion state and the properties at the filler/matrix interface. However, modify only one criterion often generates structural changes of either the matrix or the filler, resulting in a tricky understanding of reinforcing effects. To better understand structure/properties relationships in biocomposites the production of lignocellulosic fillers with controlled and contrasted characteristics is essential. Additionally, properties of fillers are generally system-dependant due to the variability of both structure and composition of lignocellulosic biomass (Montano et al., 2013; Berthet et al., 2015). Previous work {{has shown that the}} size and the surface hydrophobicity of wheat straw particles can be controlled by combining dry grinding and sorting processes (Montano et al., 2013). In this work, we focused on the production of fillers by dry fractionation processes, from <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> which is a regional valuable by-product of vine culture. <b>Vine</b> <b>shoot</b> was comminuted by a combination of grinders which generated different mechanical stresses as shear, impact and compression (A.

25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the ripening process cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of the grapevine but also how the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that the grapevine can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, but too much leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as bunch rot and powdery mildew which can hamper the ripening process. A very vigorous vine with many clusters and <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and <b>vine</b> <b>shoots</b> on the <b>vine</b> but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the ripening process.|$|R

40|$|Downwardly-growing grapevine shoots have {{smaller and}} more {{frequent}} vessels than upwardly-growing ones and, as a consequence, a lower hydraulic conductivity. Here, grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) shoot growth orientation was manipulated to test whether downward shoot orientation negatively affects vessel growth in the apex via a shortage of water and nutrients. The orientation of the central <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> portion was inverted by two consecutive 135 degrees bends, resulting in double-bent N-shaped vines; the central downward shoot portion was of different lengths in the experimental treatments to induce increasing reductions of shoot conductivity. These treatments reduced shoot conductivity and water flow, but had no effects on vessel development and frequency in the apex. In a second experiment, auxin concentration was assessed in shoots of upwardly- and downwardly-growing plants. IAA concentration at the apical internodes was higher in downwardly-oriented shoots than in shoots growing upwards. In addition, a higher density and a lower vessel diameter were observed in the lower, than the upper side, of the downwardly-oriented shoot, suggesting increased accumulation of auxin in the lower side.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of photoperiod on the duration from <b>vine</b> (<b>shoot)</b> emergence to flowering in white or Guinea yam (Dioscorea rotundata). The duration from vine emergence to flowering in two clonal varieties of yam (TDr 131 and TDr 99 - 9) was recorded at 10 different sowing dates/locations in Nigeria. Durations to flowering varied from 40 to > 88 days. Mean daily temperature and photoperiod between vine emergence and flowering varied from 25 to 27 degrees C and 13. 1 to 13. 4 h day(- 1), respectively. Both clones had similar responses to temperature, with base and optimum temperatures of 12 and 25 - 27 degrees C, respectively. Thermal durations to flowering were strongly related (r(2) > 0. 75 - 0. 83) to absolute photoperiod (h) at vine emergence as well as to rate of change of photoperiod (s day(- 1)) at vine emergence. The response to absolute photoperiod suggests that white yams are quantitative LDPs, flowering sooner in long than short days. Yams also flowered earlier when the rate of change of photoperiod was positive but small, or was negative. It is suggested that yams may use a combination of photoperiod and rate of change in order to fine tune flowering time. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Methods for assessing water deficit stress were compared. Methods and results: Vine water status was assessed on three soil types during four vintages by means of stem water potential and carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugar. Regional water deficit was compared {{for a range of}} over 30 vintages by means of water balance modelling. It was shown that water deficit stress anticipated shoot growth slackening, limited berry weight and enhanced berry anthocyanin content. Berry sugar content was greatest when water deficit was mild. It was shown that stem water potential measurements and carbon isotope discrimination are accurate tools for assessing vine water status at plot scale. Seasonal water deficit at a regional scale can be correctly estimated by water balance models. Vintage quality in Bordeaux is determined by the intensity of water deficit stress rather than by the level of the temperatures. Conclusions: Vine phenology and grape ripening are highly dependent on water uptake conditions. Mild water deficit stress enhances grape quality for the production of red wines. Vine water status can accurately be assessed by means of stem water potential or carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugars. Quality losses through severe water stress can be avoided through the use of drought-adapted plant material, appropriate canopy management, yield reduction or the implementation of deficit irrigation. Significance and impact of the study: This study shows the key role of water deficits in the production of quality grapes for red wine production. Methods for assessing vine water status are compared and discussed. Among many existing methods, the accuracy of stem water potential, carbon isotope discrimination measured on grape sugar and water balance modelling are emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Viticulture is {{characterized}} by a high use of pesticides compared to other crop industries (Gary et al., 2010),which generates concerns for human health and quality of the environment. Yet the use of pesticides, andother variables of economic importance such as yield, vary a lot among regions and farms within the same region(Meziere et al, 2009). A thorough analysis of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainabilityis then needed to assess and compare existing cropping systems or prototypes of innovative ones. To this end, DEXiPM, a qualitative multi-criteria assessment tool (Pelzer et al, 2013), was adapted to grapevine. A strong interaction with the first users (members of the FP 7 Pure project from France, Germany andItaly) has brought to significant modifications, mainly on the economic and environmental branches. Theworking group has detailed some aspects of the grapevine management such as soil cover and choice of cropprotection products. These changes have been validated by assessing some case studies. A regards the economic sustainability, the selling price considers the expected yield (that may be linked togeographical indications), the certification of specific cultivation practices and the existence of marketingstrategies. The specific case of biocontrol products is considered: they are included in the production cost butnot in the environmental assessment. In the social sustainability branch, few criteria have been modified, such as the risk of contamination by mycotoxinesand the risk of pesticide residues. The three components of the environmental sustainability have been adapted: resource use, environmentalquality and biodiversity. A major change is that the period of cover cropping and percentage of soil coveredhave been introduced as they relate to a number of criteria: water use, pesticide leaching, nitrate leaching,compaction risk, runoff risk and soil organic matter. Pesticide ecotoxicity is assessed with the TFI of a list ofhighly toxic products. The energy consumption criterion has been adapted to include cultivation practicesspecific to viticulture. The organic matter is assessed in relation to specific organic amendments used inviticulture, <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> management and soil cover. At last biodiversity has been adapted for both the flora(by considering cover crops, flower strips and hedges) and fauna (by considering the natural enemies in thephyllosphere and pollinators.

This colour enhancement was due to an increase in coloured pigments in copigmented or polymeric form, that is in association with other anthocyanins or phenolic compounds. This is a significant finding, as it shows that the colour of wine is not dependent upon anthocyanin concentration alone, but rather on reactions taking place during winemaking and wine-ageing. The colour enhancement was found to be maintained after a year's ageing in the bottle. A key question which arises from this work is which component(s) of total phenolics in PRD-treated wines is responsible for this effect. Preliminary investigation of seed proanthocyanidins and flavan- 3 -ols showed that their content per berry was unaltered by the PRD treatment. However, where berry weight was decreased due to PRD, the concentration of these seed tannins was increased on a per gram basis. This could potentially lead to an increased contribution of seed tannins to total wine phenolics in PRD wines. The effect of this is two-fold. Firstly, seed tannins are known to be weak copigments and could in part account for the increased copigmentation and polymerisation of anthocyanins observed with PRD. Secondly, an increased concentration of seed tannins in PRD wines could alter wine astringency and mouth feel properties. In both fruit and wine samples, PRD was found to cause a decrease in the contribution malvidin-glucosides to total anthocyanins. Thus, levels of non-malvidin glucosides, namely delphinidin and cyanidin, were increased by PRD. This effect was investigated as fruit matured post-veraison, and was evident from early in berry development. Preliminary results indicate that this response requires the presence of high incident light levels to the fruit during development, but is not mediated by increased bunch exposure alone. Shading of fruit led to a significant decrease in all anthocyanin types, and caused a shift in the ratio of acetyl- and 3 p-coumary 1 -glucosides to mono-glucosides. The PRD treatment, however, did not cause changes in the proportions of acetyl-, 3 p-coumary 1 -and mono-glucoside anthocyanins. These results show that the response of the anthocyanin pathway to the PRD treatment is most likely mediated by physiological signals within the fruit and vine, rather than due to a change in bunch zone microclimate. An important class of potential flavour and aroma compounds in grapes are the C₁₃-norisoprcnoids. As the precursors to these compounds are fruit-derived, rather than by-products of fermentation, the potential exists for their manipulation using viticultural practices. Previously, bunch exposure has been thought to be the primary factor mediating the final levels of C₁₃-norisoprenoids in fruit. The current study has shown that total shading of developing bunches using artificial means led to a significant decrease in the levels of these compounds in both fruit and wine samples of Shiraz. However, when fruit of this variety was subjected to natural changes in bunch exposure, resulting from alterations in canopy structure, the response of the C₁₃-norisoprenoids to these conditions was either small or insignificant. Of the three C₁₃-norisoprenoids studied, namely ß -damascenone, ß -ionone and TDN, only TDN showed a significant response to bunch exposure under these conditions. Preliminary results of this study on Shiraz indicated that the concentration of the C₁₃-norisoprenoids ß -damascenone and TDN can potentially be influenced by changes in <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> vigour and canopy architecture, induced by a water-deficit. This finding was validated by a study on Cabernet Sauvignon, where the effect of PRD on fruit C₁₃-norisoprenoids was investigated. The concentrations of the C₁₃-norisoprenoids ß -damascenone, ß -ionone and TDN were shown to be increased by up to 30 % in response to PRD in Cabernet Sauvignon fruit over two vintages. The changes in these compounds in the fruit were associated with increased levels of the carotenoids lutein and ß -carotene, which are potential precursors to the C₁₃-norisoprenoids. The results of the current study have shown that the regulation of C₁₃- norisoprenoid concentration in grapes and wine may not be primarily due to the level of incident light on developing bunches, although the presence of light is necessary for their production. Rather, the effect of deficit irrigation practices on whole-vine physiology and <b>vine</b> <b>shoot</b> vigour holds stronger potential as a tool for the viticultural manipulation of these compounds in fruit and wine.
