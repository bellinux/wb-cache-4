40|$|Abstract — Vehicular <b>communication,</b> {{providing}} <b>vehicle-to-vehicle</b> and vehicle-to-roadside communica-tion, can considerably improve {{traffic safety}} and com-fort of driving and traveling. For communication in vehicular ad hoc networks, position-based routing {{has emerged as}} a promising candidate. For Internet ac-cess, Mobile IPv 6 is a widely accepted solution to pro-vide session continuity and reachability to the Internet for mobile nodes. While integrated solutions for usage of Mobile IPv 6 in (non-vehicular) mobile ad hoc net-works exist, we propose a solution that, built upon on a Mobile IPv 6 proxy-based architecture, selects the opti-mal communication mode (direct in-vehicle, <b>vehicle-to-vehicle,</b> and vehicle-to-roadside <b>communication)</b> and provides dynamic switching between <b>vehicle-to-vehicle</b> and vehicle-to-roadside <b>communication</b> mode during a communication session in case that more than one com-munication mode is simultaneously available.

50|$|Additional {{advantages}} {{could include}} higher speed limits; smoother rides; and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds. Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity {{according to the}} U.S. Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. According {{to a study by}} researchers at Columbia University, autonomous cars could increase capacity by 273% (~8,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using <b>vehicle-to-vehicle</b> <b>communication,</b> capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 445% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h with a following gap of about 6 m of each other. Currently, at highway speeds drivers keep between 40 to 50 m away from the car in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.|$|E

40|$|<b>Vehicle-to-vehicle</b> {{wireless}} <b>communication</b> is a {{key component}} of tomorrow’s cooperative safety applications. However, the wireless link is susceptible to effects such as shadowing which can cause communication failures. Such failures may in turn lead to hazardous traffic situations when safety applications cease to function. By monitoring communication QoS and adapting to changes, effects of link failure may be mitigated, however this requires a specification of the application QoS requirements. In this paper we combine the T-Window reliability QoS metric with a spatial component, allowing us to capture the dependencies between VANET QoS requirements and road geometry.

30|$|Regardless of the effort, {{environmental}} challenges {{may result}} in malfunctions occurring in these monitoring devices and sensors. Given these challenges, the idea of <b>vehicle-to-vehicle</b> [117] <b>communication</b> (V 2 V), together with vehicle-to-infrastructure [118] communication (V 2 I) has been proposed. The idea is to share knowledge compiled from a fleet of connected vehicles and the infrastructure, leaving little or no room for error. The success of this idea relies on how this communication takes place. A plethora of studies have been devoted to developing communication standards better known as dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) [119]. Recently, the University of Michigan formed a consortium of industrial, government and academic partners to conduct a pilot study {{in the city of}} Ann Arbor [14]. As a result, this is still an evolving subject.|$|R
5000|$|These {{services}} {{relate to}} Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), {{that depend on}} the sensory input {{of more than one}} vehicle and enable instant reaction through automatic monitoring, alerting, braking and steering activities. They depend on instant <b>vehicle-to-vehicle</b> <b>communication,</b> as well as infrastructure, functioning across brands and national borders and offering cross-brand and cross-border levels of privacy and security. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for that reason has argued for regulation in its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on V2V Communication and argued the case in US Congress. NHTSA began the rule-making process on December 13, 2016, proposing to mandate dedicated short-rnage communications (DSRC) technology in new light vehicles.https://icsw.nhtsa.gov/safercar/v2v/ Under this proposed rule, vehicles would broadcast a defined data packet, the [...] "basic safety message" [...] (BSM) up to ten times per second, indicating vehicle location, heading, and speed. In March, 2017, GM became the first US automaker to provide DSRC as standard equipment on a production automobile, the Cadillac CTS. The US also has appropriate standards - IEEE 802.11p - and frequency rules in place. In Europe a frequency is harmonised for transport safety and a harmonised standard, called ETSI ITS-G5, are in place. In the EU there is no push to oblige vehicle manufacturers to introduce connect. Discussions about a regulatory framework for privacy and security are ongoing.|$|E

We propose two solutions to this problem. One is a centralized approach where exact information about the number of concurrent transmitting vehicles is used to calculate the optimal window size, and the other is a distributed approach in which vehicles use local observations to adapt the window size. We show that these schemes can provide significant improvements over the standard MAC protocol under dense and dynamic conditions. I...|$|R

As basic communication mechanism VANET-equipped vehicles broadcast periodic safety beacons to keep the neighboring vehicles aware of the situation at all times.
