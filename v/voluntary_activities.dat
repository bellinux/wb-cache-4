40|$|This article investigates {{different}} {{concepts of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> {{as they are}} manifested at the local government level in Australia. It identifies the challenges faced by local councils as they develop strategies for engaging <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> and the responses to these challenges. The responses can be analysed within two paradigms, the volunteer paradigm and the active citizenship paradigm. The article argues that responses that operate within the active citizenship paradigm offer an approach to <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> that is more appropriate to building active, supportive and sustainable communities than traditional approaches to volunteering...|$|R

25|$|Modern {{societies}} share {{a common}} value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level. Despite having similar objectives, tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> {{are seen as a}} challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).|$|E
2500|$|The {{perceived}} {{slow process}} of efforts for countries {{to agree to}} a comprehensive global level binding agreements has led some countries to seek independent/voluntary steps and focus on alternative high-value <b>voluntary</b> <b>activities</b> like the creation of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants by the United States, Canada, Mexico, Bangladesh, and Sweden which seeks to regulate short-lived pollutants such as methane, black carbon and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) which together are believed to account for up to 1/3 of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught with wide economic impacts and opposition. [...] The Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC) was launched on February 16, 2012 to regulate short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) that together contribute up to 1/3 of global warming. The coalition's creation is seen as a necessary and pragmatic step given the slow pace of global climate change agreements under the UNFCCC.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade or so a body of {{geographical}} work has begun to emerge that examines, in various ways, the interrelationship between people, place, volunteering and the voluntary sector. Work in this field is spread across a number of geographical subdisciplines, from social, health and development to political geography. As a body of work it is increasingly being referred to as ‘geographies of voluntarism’. Focusing specifically on <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> around health and welfare, this article reviews how geographers have begun to critically engage with issues of <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> and space. It draws out how geographical perspectives on voluntarism are contributing to a wider understanding of how and why disparities in <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> occur and the implications for people and places at a range of spatial scales from the global to the local...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between statutory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the field of}} support to family carers of older people in Sweden. The relationship is considered in regard to substitution theory. A survey was conducted comprising 80 local authorities and 358 voluntary organisations. All the local authorities and {{about a third of the}} voluntary organisations arranged support activities. The number of activities varied substantially across the municipalities. However, correlation analysis found no significant relationship between local authority and <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity,</b> even though both sometimes arranged the same kinds of activities. In other words, this study finds no support for substitution theory. On the contrary, it shows that a higher level of <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> is found in municipalities where the local authority cooperates with or supports voluntary organisations. </p...|$|R

40|$|The current {{kindergarten}} {{education is}} {{based on the idea that}} play as <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> of children should be centered in educational activities in kindergarten However, that is not always the case. This paper aims to reveal the fundamental basis of kindergarten education and care, which leads to understanding of the importance of play as <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> of children, by analyzing narratives. The interviewees were four kindergarten teachers, who had had a career of more than ten years when the National curriculum was revised in 1989. It was shown that the following four factors were important in order to really understand play as a <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> of children: (1) Some experiences that trigger to reconsider kindergarten education and care after a certain years of that career: (2) Cooperation and sharing of the same problems with their colleagues; (3) Remaining consciousness of kindergarten education and care; and (4) Personality to live their lives spontaneously...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Mirror {{movements}} are unintended movements accompanying <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> in homologous muscles {{on the opposite}} side of the body. Mirror {{movements are}} seen particularly in distal arm muscles. Case Presentation: A 21 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital with involuntary movements that accompany <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> in homologous muscles {{on the opposite side}} of his body. His neurological examination was normal except bilateral mirror movements. Brain CT showed callosal hypogenesis. In the study of transcranial magnetic stimulation, Motor evoked potential responses were obtained from the bilateral APB muscles with cortical stimulation. Conclusion: This case was presented in order to guide for clarifying the etiopathogenesis of the mirror movements using electrophsiological studies...|$|R

40|$|An electromyographic {{technique}} {{was used to}} record the tonic stretch reflex (TSR) responses to passive sinusoidal stretching of biceps brachii muscle in athetotic patients. The TSR transmission characteristics measured while the patient was in a relaxed state were compared with those measured while the patient was voluntarily active. The resting TSR and action TSR were found to differ markedly. Sensitivity, pattern, duration, and timing of the TSR responses were all changed during <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity.</b> The {{results suggest that the}} TSR in athetosis is functionally reorganized by supraspinal influences during <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity.</b> It is proposed that athetoid movements and action tremor may be a manifestation of abnormal action TSR caused by faulty supra-spinal control during activity...|$|R

The aim is not to offer a detailed legal analysis, but more to consider how these changes to the definition of ‘charity’ impact on <b>voluntary</b> <b>activity</b> more widely...|$|R
