40|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>starch</b> <b>gel</b> {{electrophoresis}} and trefoil immunodiffusion {{were used}} to study the systematics of some ascaridoid nematodes. Within the Ascarididae, the time scale of divergence was too great for intergeneric electrophoretic comparisons. Congeneric electrophoretic comparisons of Baylisascaris procyonis (host- raccoon) versus Baylisascaris transfuga (host- Black bear), and Toxocara canis (host- domestic dog) versus Toxocara cati (host- domestic cat) yielded Nei genetic distance coefficients of 1. 21 and 1. 55, respectively. Estimates of times of divergence made from 1 electrophoretic clock calibration suggest that the Baylisascaris species have not shared a common ancestor for 25 million years (Myr), and that the Toxocara species diverged 33 Myr ago. The Baylisascaris divergence estimate corresponds to host-family divergence estimates based on immunological and paleontological evidence, which suggests that cospeciation has occurred. In contrast to this, Ascaris suum (host- pig) and Ascaris lumbricoides (host- human) have a distance coefficient of 0. 09. This indicates that these species diverged comparatively recently and may represent a case of host rance expansion. Trefoil immunodiffusion comparisons of ascaridoid albumins yielded reactions of identity of A. suum, A. lumbricoides, Parascaris equorum, B. procyonis, B. transfuga, T. canis, and T. cati.

40|$|In {{previous}} communications (1, 2) {{evidence has}} been presented demonstrating the in vtvo syn-thesis of haptoglobin by the canine liver. The re-sults suggested, but did not prove, that the liver was the sole organ of synthesis. The {{purpose of the present}} investigation is to obtain information about the cellular sites of haptoglobin synthesis by means of specific immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescent localization does not dis-tinguish between sites of synthesis and sites of clearance or storage. In an attempt to distinguish between them, we have studied canine tissues ob-tained at different moments during the increase in concentration of haptoglobin in the plasma that follows the onset of acute inflammation. The mo-ments chosen were the resting state, the time when the rate of haptoglobin synthesis was maxi-mal (2), and the time when its concentration in the plasma was maximal but its synthesis dimin-ished. We expected that the number of cells con-cerned with haptoglobin synthesis or the intensity of their specific fluorescence, or both, would parallel the rate of haptoglobin synthesis at the sites of production, whereas the number of cells concerned with clearance or storage of haptoglobin and the intensity of their specific fluorescence would paral-lel the concentration in the plasma.

This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i. e. <b>starch)</b> <b>gel</b> to limit CdS growth. The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading.

Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the <b>starch</b> <b>gel,</b> which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile. The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters> 10 nm; Vmeso> 0. 5 cm 3 g− 1) and surface areas (SBET> 170 m 2 g− 1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading.
