5|$|It was {{released}} in February 2014 to various stores; a promotional poster and a commercial shot by English music video director Jake Nava were released the same month with the latter featuring Beyoncé surrounded by golden glitter. Upon their release, the perfume and the commercial were positively received by critics with Rise's various scents and its feminist inspiration being particularly hailed. Rise features top notes of Italian bergamot orange, golden apricot and a basil sorbet middle notes of gold symphony orchid freesia blossom and jasminum sambac and base notes of autumn woods accord, cashmere musk and a <b>vetiver</b> extract.|$|E
5|$|Kerala's fauna are {{notable for}} their {{diversity}} and {{high rates of}} endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic). These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number {{among the more than}} 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic <b>vetiver</b> grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna. In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as kadu; stinging catfish and choottachi; orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus are found.|$|E

25|$|Woody: Fragrances {{that are}} {{dominated}} by woody scents, typically of agarwood, sandalwood, cedarwood, and <b>vetiver.</b> Patchouli, with its camphoraceous smell, is commonly found in these perfumes. A traditional example here would be Myrurgia's Maderas De Oriente or Chanel Bois des Îles. A modern example would be Balenciaga Rumba.|$|E
25|$|Haiti is the world's leading {{producer}} of <b>vetiver,</b> a root plant {{used to make}} luxury perfumes, essential oils and fragrances, providing for half the world's supply. Half of all Haitians work in the agricultural sector. Haiti relies upon imports for half its food needs and 80% of its rice.|$|E
25|$|His Texas-grounded impact {{stretched}} {{farther than}} country.

Folk musician Shakey Graves has credited his fast-paced, rhythmic style of finger picked guitar playing partially to Van Zandt's influence.|$|E
25|$|Being an Eco Resort, Banasura Hill Resort {{has taken}} {{measures}} to conserve the ecological {{balance of the}} place and preserve its natural heritage and biodiversity. For example, Guadua bamboo saplings have been planted {{in and around the}} resort to create a bio-fencing. Its environmental benefits include regulating water levels, absorbing huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, producing oxygen, preventing soil erosion and conserving bio diversity. Also planted in thousands are seedlings of the highly aromatic <b>Vetiver</b> grass whose cluster roots run vertically like a mesh to a depth of almost 5m, effectively preventing soil erosion and arresting water run-off. These measures help to conserve the ecological balance of the place and preserve its natural heritage and biodiversity.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} {{revealed}} that the perfume {{was inspired by a}} poem by African-American author Maya Angelou. Journalists Katy Waldman of Slate, Kathleen Hou of New York and Treye Green of the International Business Times noted [...] "Still I Rise" [...] from Angelou's book And Still I Rise as a potential inspiration. The fragrance features various notes. The top notes consist of an Italian bergamot orange, golden apricot and a basil sorbet. The middle notes contain gold symphony orchid (identified as Beyoncé's favorite flower), freesia blossom and jasminum sambac. Rise concludes with base notes of autumn woods accord, cashmere musk and a <b>vetiver</b> extract.|$|E
500|$|Kristin Booker of {{the fashion}} website Refinery29 {{described}} the scent as a [...] "voluptuous, sexy floral". Kathleen Hou writing for New York opined that the perfume's best part {{was that it was}} inspired by a poem by Angelou. Hou also noted feminist influences in the scent with usual additions of orchid and masculine notes of autumn woods, cashmere, musk, and <b>vetiver</b> extract. She concluded her review by stating [...] "Maya Angelou-reading perfume sounds (and will surely smell) pretty good". With a similar opinion, Treye Green of the International Business Times noted more masculine notes with the addition of woods, cashmere, musk. She hailed Rise as a [...] "sweet treat" [...] for her fans along her self-titled album's surprise release a week earlier and noted, [...] "Beyoncé's definition of feminism has stirred quite the debate following her new album's release. But maybe her perfume version of it will be more openly embraced – plus who can deny the genius of a Maya Angelou-inspired scent." [...] Madison Lafayette in an article for VIBE Vixen praised Beyoncé's decision to release Rise [...] "capitaliz off" [...] her success and [...] "giving us another reason to talk about her".|$|E
500|$|Tor Cardona of the {{magazine}} Grazia Daily praised the fact the perfume was announced a week after Beyoncé's fifth album, noting she was set for a [...] "world domination" [...] in 2014. Focusing on the scent, Cardona advised female readers to buy it {{and went on to}} state [...] "With hints of orchid, golden apricot and jasmine- we reckon this might just be 2014's hottest scent." [...] BET editor Dorkys Ramos described the scent as a mixture of [...] "sexy, floral" [...] notes. The Daily Telegraphs Katy Young called the gold symphony orchid used in the scent [...] "the queen of orchids". She also said that notes of cashmere musk and <b>vetiver</b> [...] "give the whole blend a grounding element" [...] before concluding [...] "the notes are not wrong". Charlie Gowans Eglinton of Elle, noted that the perfume promised to be [...] "almost as intoxicating as Bey herself" [...] with a [...] "sexy scent" [...] of musk according to reports she had read. In a guide for spring perfumes to buy in 2014, editors of E! Online included Rise, calling it [...] "exactly what you think it would be: vivacious, strong and bold" [...] and concluding [...] "it is certainly not a dainty spring scent". Cinya Burton of the same publication noted the fragrance was different than other floral perfumes during the season, deeming it [...] "plain fierce".|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Beyoncé {{embarked}} {{her fourth}} concert tour, The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. In June 2013, {{it was announced}} that a limited edition of Heat, titled Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour, would be released the same month, inspired by the tour. Speaking about the fragrance, Beyoncé said: [...] "I love my music, I love performing and most of all I love and appreciate my fans. I wanted to give them a special remembrance of this tour and I created this scent to reflect the power, passion and playfulness I put into my performances." [...] The fragrance opens with mangosteen, black pepper and Açaí palm as its top notes and later continues with violet petals, Indian Sambac Jasmine and a Brassia Edua Loo orchid as its middle notes before finishing with bourbon vanilla, Australian sandalwood and <b>vetiver</b> as its base notes. Gaby Wilson of MTV noted that the ingredients introduced a lighter scent than her previous releases. According to Beyoncé's official perfume website, the fragrance is [...] "paying tribute to Beyoncé's amazing momentous journey" [...] and further [...] "transport you into Beyoncé's world and the intensity of her shows. [...] will make you feel the power, passion and playfulness she gives to her fans." [...] It was also meant to celebrate Beyoncé's accomplishments and her [...] "historic life journey". Gregory DelliCarpini Jr. of Billboard magazine described the scent of the fragrance as [...] "strong and feminine". Holly Carter of People magazine noted that the scent was [...] "the best-smelling alternative" [...] for people who missed The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour.|$|E
2500|$|The patent {{medicine}} makers {{moved from}} selling nostrums to selling deodorants and toothpastes, which {{continued to be}} advertised using the same techniques that had proven themselves selling nostrums for tuberculosis and [...] "female complaints." [...] One survival of the herbal exoticism that once characterized the patent medicine industry is the marketing of shampoos, which are often promoted as containing perfumes such as <b>vetiver</b> or ylang-ylang, and foods such as mangoes, bananas, or honey; consumers are urged to put these ingredients in their hair despite lack of any evidence that these ingredients do anything other than make the hair smell like the ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|Barely a year later, these {{measures}} {{were found to}} be inadequate when a second major accident occurred on the line on 16 June 2004. The Matsyaganda Express bound to Mumbai from Mangalore derailed and fell off a bridge after colliding with boulders on the tracks, killing 20 people. Again, the corporation insisted that the mishap was a result of nature's fury. After the accident, questions were raised about the safety and credibility of the Konkan Railway. An enquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety revealed the cause of the accident to be due to [...] "falling of boulders and earth" [...] on the tracks. After the report, the corporation swung into action, implementing all its recommendations, including limiting the speed of trains during the monsoon to [...] as opposed to the regular speed limit of , as well as undertaking several geo-technical engineering works, including boulder netting, shotcreting, rock bolting, micropiling and <b>vetiver</b> plantations along the line to increase safety.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vetiver</b> {{is mainly}} {{cultivated}} for the fragrant essential oil distilled from its roots. In perfumery, the older French spelling, vetyver, is often used. Worldwide production {{is estimated at}} about 250 tons per annum. Due to its excellent fixative properties, <b>vetiver</b> is used widely in perfumes. It is contained in 90% of all western perfumes. <b>Vetiver</b> is a more common ingredient in fragrances for men; some notable examples include Dior's Eau Sauvage, Guerlain <b>Vetiver,</b> Mr. <b>Vetiver</b> by Une Nuit a Bali, Zizan by Ormonde Jayne and <b>Vetiver</b> by L'Occitane.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Vetiver</b> System (VS) is {{a system}} of soil and water {{conservation}} whose main component is the use of the <b>vetiver</b> plant in hedgerows. It is promoted by the <b>Vetiver</b> Network International (TVNI), an international non-governmental organization.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vetiver</b> is {{the debut}} album by folk band <b>Vetiver.</b> It was {{released}} in 2004 on DiCristina.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vetiver</b> can be {{used for}} crop protection. It attracts the stem borer (Chilo partellus), which lay their eggs preferably on <b>vetiver.</b> Due to the hairy {{architecture}} of <b>vetiver,</b> the larvae can not move on the leaves, fall to the ground and die.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} <b>vetiver</b> {{used in the}} <b>Vetiver</b> System does not have stolons or rhizomes, does not produce fertile seed, and stays where it was planted. In some {{countries}} <b>vetiver</b> has even been used to define property lines. Hedgerows will not invade {{other areas of the}} property.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Vetiver</b> system, a {{technology}} of soil conservation {{and water quality}} management, {{is based on the}} use of the <b>vetiver</b> plant.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used commercial genotypes of <b>vetiver</b> are sterile (do not produce fertile seeds), and because <b>vetiver</b> propagates itself by small offsets instead of underground stolons, these genotypes are noninvasive and can easily be controlled by cultivation of the soil at the boundary of the hedge. However, care must be taken, because fertile genotypes of <b>vetiver</b> have become invasive.|$|E
50|$|The {{root system}} of <b>vetiver</b> is finely {{structured}} and very strong. It can grow 3 m to 4 m {{deep within the}} first year. <b>Vetiver</b> has no stolons nor rhizomes. Because of all these characteristics, the <b>vetiver</b> plant is highly drought-tolerant and can help to protect soil against sheet erosion. In case of sediment deposition, new roots can grow out of buried nodes.|$|E
50|$|Studies by Prof. Gregg Henderson {{found that}} <b>vetiver</b> {{extracts}} could repel termites. However, <b>vetiver</b> grass alone, unlike its extracts, {{cannot be used}} to repel termites. Henderson planted <b>vetiver</b> in trash cans and hammered wooden stakes into the soil filled cans. He offered large population of termites {{the ability to move}} into the trash cans via another trash can, but found that although the <b>vetiver</b> root completely filled the cans in 6 months, the stakes were still attacked. The termites had moved around the roots and got to the wood. Unless the roots are damaged, the anti-termite chemicals, such as nootkatone, are not released. Henderson reports that his research on the idea of protection of a home with <b>vetiver</b> planted as a barrier ended at that point. Another study found a similar result.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Sarah Lee and Johnny {{signed with}} Berkeley {{independent}} record label, Ninth Street Opus and released Bright Examples. The collaborative project features producers Andy Cabic (lead singer/songwriter {{in the band}} <b>Vetiver</b> (band)) and Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, <b>Vetiver</b> (band)).|$|E
50|$|<b>Vetiver</b> is {{planted in}} long, neat rows across the slope for easy {{mechanical}} harvesting. The soil should be wet. Trenches are 15 cm to 20 cm deep. A modified seedling planter or mechanical transplanter can plant {{large numbers of}} <b>vetiver</b> slips in the nursery. Flowering and nonflowering varieties are used for cultivation. Sandy loam nursery beds ensure easy harvest and minimal damage to plant crowns and roots. Open space is recommended, because shading affects <b>vetiver</b> growth.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves of}} <b>vetiver</b> are a useful {{byproduct}} to feed cattle, goats, sheep and horses. The nutritional content depends on season, growth stage and soil fertility. Under most climates, nutritional values and yields are best if <b>vetiver</b> is cut every 1-3 months.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vetiver</b> plant, Chrysopogon zizanioides, is {{the main}} {{component}} to all <b>Vetiver</b> System bioengineering and conservation applications. It {{can be used in}} the tropics and semi-tropics, and areas that have a Mediterranean climate where there are hot summers, and winters are temperate.|$|E
50|$|Masks {{made out}} of lavancha (sogade beru in Kannada {{language}} which is <b>vetiver)</b> are the souvenirs to carry as gifts from the temple. Lavancha or <b>vetiver</b> in the raw state gives out a pleasant scent if soaked in water and it has medicinal qualities.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Vetiver</b> System is a {{developing}} technology. As a soil conservation technique and, more recently, a bioengineering tool, the effective {{application of the}} <b>Vetiver</b> System in large-scale projects that involve significant engineering design and construction requires an understanding of biology, soil science, hydraulics, hydrology, and geotechnical principles.|$|E
50|$|In the Indian Subcontinent, khus (<b>vetiver</b> roots) {{is often}} used to replace the straw or wood shaving pads in {{evaporative}} coolers.When cool water runs for months over wood shavings in evaporative cooler padding, they tend to accumulate algae, bacteria and other microorganisms. This causes the cooler to emit a fishy or seaweed smell into the house. <b>Vetiver</b> root padding counteracts this smell. A cheaper alternative is to add <b>vetiver</b> cooler perfume or even pure khus attar to the tank. Another advantage is that they do not catch fire as easily as dry wood shavings.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} <b>vetiver</b> that is {{promoted}} for VS applications originates in south India, is non-fertile, non-invasive, {{and has to}} be propagated by clump subdivision. Its massive, finely structured root system can grow very fast - in some applications, rooting depth can reach 10-12 ft (3-4 m) in the first year. This deep root system makes the <b>vetiver</b> plant very drought-tolerant and difficult to dislodge by strong current. It also has stiff and erect stems, which can stand up to relatively deep water flow. New shoots will develop from the underground crown, making <b>vetiver</b> resistant to fire, frosts, traffic and heavy grazing pressure. <b>Vetiver</b> grass is not affected to any significant extent by pests and diseases, nor does it act as a host for pests or diseases that might attack crop or garden plants.|$|E
50|$|To control {{termites}} {{that attack}} dead material, hexachlorobenzene, {{also known as}} benzene hexachloride-BCH, {{can be applied to}} the <b>vetiver</b> hedge. Brown spot seems to have no effect on <b>vetiver</b> growth. Black rust in India is vetiver-specific and does not cross-infect other plants. In China, stemborers (Chilo spp.) have been recognised, but they seem to die once they get into the stems. Further, <b>vetiver</b> is affected by Didymella andropogonis on leaves, Didymosphaeria andropogonis on dead culms, Lulworthia medusa on culms and Ophiosphaerella herpotricha. Only in Malaysia, whiteflies seem to be a problem. Pest management is done not only by using insecticides, but also by appropriate cultural management: hedges are cut to 3 cm above ground at the end of the growing season. In general, <b>vetiver</b> is highly tolerant to herbicides and pesticides.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Vetiver</b> Network International (TVNI) is an {{international}} NGO, with members in over 100 countries promoting the <b>Vetiver</b> System (VS)for a sustainable environment particularly in relation to land and water. Its active members include people working in government, research institutions, international development agencies, NGOs {{and the private sector}} and farming communities.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Sunshine" [...] type of <b>vetiver</b> grass, whose roots {{have long}} been used in Louisiana as an insect repellent, was given that name by the USDA in 1989 for Sunshine, Louisiana, where Eugene LeBlanc Sr. grew a {{heritage}} clone given to his grandparents by Felix Perilloux, who in turn had acquired it from his wife Myrthee Froisy Perilloux in the 1860s. <b>Vetiver</b> was clonally introduced throughout the tropics in the 19th century, and DNA fingerprinting has shown that almost all the <b>vetiver</b> grown worldwide for perfumery, agriculture, and bioengineering {{is essentially the same}} nonfertile cultigen as Sunshine. This type of essential-oil <b>vetiver</b> is known by various names in different locations (e.g., 'Monto' in Australia), but because [...] "Sunshine" [...] was the earliest name used in modern times, that is how it is collectively known throughout the world today.|$|E
