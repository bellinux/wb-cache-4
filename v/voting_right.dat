5|$|Sejmiks were {{significantly}} reformed by the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional sejms, passed on 24 March 1791 and subsequently recognized {{as part of}} the Constitution of 3 May. This law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance, as it reduced the enfranchisement of the noble class. The <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> became tied to a property qualification; to be eligible to vote, a noble had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to another who did. Some 300,000 out of 700,000 otherwise eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. A document from 1792 lists only 47 sejmiks.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{wealthy and}} educated women in Madras were granted <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> in 1921, in Punjab the Sikhs granted women equal voting rights in 1925 {{irrespective}} of their educational qualifications or being wealthy or poor. This {{happened when the}} Gurdwara Act of 1925 was approved. The original draft of the Gurdwara Act sent by the British to the Sharomani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee (SGPC) did not include Sikh women, but the Sikhs inserted the clause without the women having to ask for it. Equality of women with men is enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikh faith.|$|E
500|$|ArticleVI also {{recognized}} the Prawo o sejmikach, the act on regional assemblies (sejmiks) {{that had been}} passed on March 24, 1791. By reducing the enfranchisement of the noble classes, this law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance. Previously, all nobles had been eligible to vote in sejmiks, which de facto meant {{that many of the}} poorest, landless noblesknown as [...] "clients" [...] or [...] "clientele" [...] of local magnatesvoted as the magnates bade them. Now the <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> was tied to a property qualification: one had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to somebody who did, to be eligible to vote. 300,000 of 700,000 previously eligible nobles were thus disfranchised, much to their displeasure. Voting rights were restored to landowners who were in military service. They had lost these rights in 1775. Voting was limited to males of at least 18 years of age. The eligible voters elected deputies to local powiats, or county sejmiks, which elected deputies to the General Sejm.|$|E

50|$|Felony disenfranchisement was a {{topic of}} debate during the 2012 Republican presidential primary.

2500|$|The {{first round}} of voting was marked by a scandal {{concerning}} {{the small number of}} polling stations in countries with large communities of Romanian citizens. 294 polling stations were organized in 95 states, given that over 3 million Romanians with <b>voting</b> <b>right</b> are living and working abroad. In cities like London, Paris, Madrid, Vienna, Munich, Stuttgart, Turin, Rome or Chișinău huge queues of voters were reported at embassies or other polling stations. They claim they were prevented from exercising their right to vote, inasmuch as thousands of voters were locked outside the embassies and could not vote until the polls closed. Presidential candidates Klaus Iohannis, Elena Udrea and Monica Macovei urged the prolongation of the voting process in these countries. Moreover, the Presidential Administration demanded in a release the immediate resignation of Foreign Minister Titus Corlățean and Minister Delegate for Romanians Abroad Bogdan Stanoevici for poor organization of election in diaspora. Likewise, independent candidate Gheorghe Funar submitted an application to the President of BEC, demanding the cancellation of the {{first round of}} voting and its resumption because he considers that the equality of citizens before the law was not ensured, and the right to vote of Romanians abroad was seriously violated. These problems determined Gunther Krichbaum, the chairman of the Commission for European Affairs in the Bundestag to declare that the issue at stake does not concern [...] "possible difficulties in the organisation of elections, but a wilful hinderance of the free expression of the votes", based on the current leftist government's knowledge of the fact that [...] "Romanians living abroad have the tendency to vote with the parties and candidates of the centre-right". [...] Irregularities were also reported in the country's major university centers, where students were forced to form queues of hundreds of people or were redirected to other polling stations, as the standardized affidavit forms had run out.|$|E
