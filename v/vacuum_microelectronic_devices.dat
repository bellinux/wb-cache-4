Compact vacuum {{devices of}} output power even at 1 W and at {{terahertz}} (THz) frequencies above 100 GHz offer enormous applications for wide band communication, imaging radars, and spectroscopy. These active vacuum devices are also required in many more unexplored areas of scientific, industrial and medical applications. Such vacuum devices at frequency above 100 GHz {{are very small}} in dimension and microelectronic technology is needed for their fabrication. Successful development of THz <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> therefore needs fusion of vacuum tube technology with the semi-conductor technology. Significant efforts are being carried out worldwide to develop successfully such compact vacuum devices using available LIGA and DRIE semiconductor technologies. This paper presents some details on THz <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>devices.</b> Initially vacuum devices were developed {{in the form of}} diode, triode, tetrode, pentode, that are being used as high power amplifiers and oscillators at low RF frequency. Subsequently ultra-high vacuum devices were developed in the form of magnetrons, klystrons, travelling wave tubes (TWTs) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of active molybdenum field emission microcathode arrays with oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, methane, {{hydrogen and helium}} gases was studied. Experiments were setup to measure the emission characteristics {{as a function of}} gas exposures. The resulting changes in the surface work function of the tips were determined from the Fowler-Nordheim plots. The kinetics of the FEA-gas interaction were studied by observing the ion species originating from the array during and after gas exposures with a high resolution quadrupole mass spectrometer. With the work function data and the mass spectrometry information, the mechanisms responsible for emission degradation and subsequent device recovery after exposures have been determined. The data obtained was used in estimating the device lifetimes under various vacuum environments. Also {{it was found that the}} gas exposure effects are similar in dc and pulsed modes of operation of the arrays, thus permitting the use of dc mode testing as an effective acceleration method in establishing the device lifetimes under various vacuum conditions. The vacuum conditions required for the long term emission current stability and reliability of <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> employing FEAs are established. Exposure of Mo field emitter arrays to oxygen bearing species like oxygen, water and carbon dioxide resulted in serious emission current degradation. Whereas, exposure to methane and hydrogen caused a significant increase in emission current. The control of residual gases like 02, C 02 and H 20 in the vacuum envelope is essential for the emission current stability and long term reliability of <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> employing field emission microcathode technology...|$|E
30|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} (CNT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising materials for a field emitter due to its remarkable electrical conductivity, chemical and mechanical stability, and characteristics having unique structures such as high aspect ratio [1 – 5]. Many researches have been highly devoted to developing a practical application for the commercialization of field emitter, but there are still some problems to be solved such as the lifetime of the emitter [6 – 10]. There are many factors that affect the emitter lifetime working in a state of vacuum. Among them, outgassing generated during emission is inarguably one of the most critical factors [11 – 13]. Especially, some organic binders can still remain after firing when the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) emitter is made in paste and be the source to release gas in the vacuum panel. The outgassing can give a severe damage to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>device</b> by electrical arcing and ion bombardment onto a cathode or an anode. In addition to the physical damages, some gases can cause chemical etching to the MWCNT emitter. These highlight that controlling the outgassing is a key issue for emission devices prepared from the paste.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{have used}} a facile, {{economical}} and scalable synthetic technique for the fabrication of super long V 2 O 5 nanobelts. The as synthesized product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The nanobelts had an optical bandgap of 2. 3 eV. The Raman spectrum confirmed the pure state of the V 2 O 5 nanobelts. A low turn-on field of 1. 4 V µm- 1 and a threshold field of 2. 13 V µm- 1 were obtained for the V 2 O 5 super long nanobelts.

40|$|Improper base {{vacuum level}} in any <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>device,</b> {{such as a}} Plasma Display Panel(PDP), will damage the overall {{performance}} of the device due to impurities such as H 2, O 2, CO, CO 2, and N 2. In conventional tubulation packaging technology, the obtainable base vacuum level before plasma gas filling will be very poor because of the pumping conductance limitation for such a large panel size with a small gap of 150 µm, especially due to the barrier ribs inside the PDP panel. The time required to reach any reasonable level will be too long. In this study, we performed the sealing of the two glass plates composing the PDP panel, a plasma gas filling into the panel and a hole-off (named instead of a conventional ‘tip-off’) process, all in a vacuum chamber, called as ‘vacuum in-line sealing’. Several factors related with the heating process of a frit glass were investigated. A prepared frit glass was successfully applied for the vacuum in-line sealing approach without suffering bubbles. We successfully have fabricated an operable PDP panel with a 2 -inch diagonal size by using the fully vacuum in-line sealing technology {{for the first time}} in the world. The sealing temperature of the two plates was around 330 °C which corresponded to a temperature about 120 °C lower than that used in a conventional air environment. The base vacuum level inside the panel before gas filling was about 5 × 10 - 6 Torr at the time of sealing.

In this paper the behaviour of a typical gridded field emitter in different operation modes is discussed using a simple simulation model, and is {{compared with that of}} a conventional FIM tip. The simulation shows that gridded emitters still preserve the projection geometry of FIM and FEM which is essential to the interpretation of FIM and FEM images. The design considerations for an ideal FIM/FEM/AP system for studying VME devices are also discussed. A wide view angle detector and low voltage operation are the two key elements. Our system has been tested on silicon-based VME devices. The results show that in-situ chemical analysis and FIM images with atomic resolution are achieved. The geometrical field factor k of the tested VME devices is found to be in the range of 1 - 2.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have recently}} emerged as promising candidates for electron field emission (FE) cathodes in integrated FE devices. These nanostructured carbon materials possess exceptional properties and their synthesis can be thoroughly controlled. Their integration into advanced electronic devices, including not only FE cathodes, but sensors, energy storage devices, and circuit components, has seen {{rapid growth in}} recent years. The results of the studies presented here demonstrate that the CNT field emitter is an excellent candidate for next generation vacuum microelectronics and related electron emission devices in several advanced applications. The work presented in this study addresses determining factors that currently confine the performance and application of CNT-FE devices. Characterization studies and improvements to the FE properties of CNTs, along with Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) design and fabrication, were utilized in achieving these goals. Important performance limiting parameters, including emitter lifetime and failure from poor substrate adhesion, are examined. The compatibility and integration of CNT emitters with the governing MEMS substrate (i. e., polycrystalline silicon), {{and its impact on}} these performance limiting parameters, are reported. CNT growth mechanisms and kinetics were investigated and compared to silicon (100) to improve the design of CNT emitter integrated MEMS based electronic <b>devices,</b> specifically in <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>device</b> (VMD) applications. Improved growth allowed for design and development of novel cold-cathode FE devices utilizing CNT field emitters. A chemical ionization (CI) source based on a CNT-FE electron source was developed and evaluated in a commercial desktop mass spectrometer for explosives trace detection. This work demonstrated the first reported use of a CNT-based ion source capable of collecting CI mass spectra. The CNT-FE source demonstrated low power requirements, pulsing capabilities, and average lifetimes of over 320 hours when operated in constant emission mode under elevated pressures, without sacrificing performance. Additionally, a novel packaged ion source for miniature mass spectrometer applications using CNT emitters, a MEMS based Nier-type geometry, and a Low Temperature Cofired Ceramic (LTCC) 3 D scaffold with integrated ion optics were developed and characterized. While previous research has shown other devices capable of collecting ion currents on chip, this LTCC packaged MEMS micro-ion source demonstrated improvements in energy and angular dispersion as well as the ability to direct the ions out of the packaged source and towards a mass analyzer. Simulations and experimental design, fabrication, and characterization were used to make these improvements. Finally, novel CNT-FE devices were developed to investigate their potential to perform as active circuit elements in VMD circuits. Difficulty integrating devices at micron-scales has hindered the use of vacuum electronic devices in integrated circuits, despite the unique advantages they offer in select applications. Using a combination of particle trajectory simulation and experimental characterization, device performance in an integrated platform was investigated. Solutions to the difficulties in operating multiple devices in close proximity and enhancing electron transmission (i. e., reducing grid loss) are explored in detail. A systematic and iterative process was used to develop isolation structures that reduced crosstalk between neighboring devices from 15 % on average, to nearly zero. Innovative geometries and a new operational mode reduced grid loss by nearly threefold, thereby improving transmission of the emitted cathode current to the anode from 25 % in initial designs to 70 % on average. These performance enhancements are important enablers for larger scale integration and for the realization of complex <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> circuits. Dissertatio...|$|R

40|$|Field {{emission}} arrays (FEAs) {{have been}} studied extensively as potential electron sources {{for a number of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>device</b> applications. For most applications, temporal current stability and spatial current uniformity are major concerns. Using the kinetic model of electron emission, field emission can be described as two sequential processes- the flux of electrons to the tip surface followed by the transmission of the electrons through the surface barrier. Either of these processes could be the determinant of the emission current. Unstable emission current is usually due to absorption/desorption of gas molecules on the tip surface (barrier height variation) and non-uniform emission is usually due to tip radius variation (barrier width change). These problems could be solved if the emission current is determined by the electron supply to the surface instead of the electron transmission through the surface barrier. In this thesis, we used the inversion layer of a MOSFET to control the electron supply. It results in additional benefits of low turn-on voltage and low voltage swing to turn the device on and off. A novel CMP-based process for fabricating integrated LD-MOSFET/FEA is presented. We obtained FEA devices with an extraction gate aperture of 1. 3 [mu]m and emitter height of 1 [mu]m. We present a comprehensive study of field emitter arrays with or without MOSFET. The silicon field emitter shows turn-on voltage of [approximately] 24 V with field enhancement factor (b[sub]FN) of [approximately] 370. We demonstrated that the LD-MOSFET provides excellent control of emission current. The threshold voltage of the LD-MOSFET is [approximately] 0. 5 V. The integrated device can be switched ON and OFF using a MOSFET gate voltage swing of 0. 5 V. This results in an ON/OFF current ratio of 1000 : 1. The current fluctuation is significantly reduced when the MOSFET is integrated with the FEA device and the device is operated in the MOSFET control regime. The emission current of the integrated LD-MOSFET/FEA remains stable regardless the gas and vacuum condition. The saturation current level of the integrated devices in the MOSFET controlled region is also the same regardless the emitter array size or the FEA's position on the wafer. We also present a comprehensive study of three-dimensional oxidation in silicon emitter tip(cont.) formation. Stress {{plays an important role in}} the oxidation mechanism. A new sharp emitter tip formation mechanism is proposed: rather than a continuous oxidation process, an emitter neck breaking stage occurs before the sharp emitter tip is formed. Stress from volume difference of silicon and silicon dioxide is the main cause for the emitter neck breaking. Initial formation of microcracks around the neck occurs at high temperature due to volume difference stress, oxide grows into the cracks right after crack formation, and a sharp emitter tip is then formed by further oxidation. by Ching-yin Hong.

The resonant frequency shift and mode shape of the fixed-free SWCNTs caused by the addition of a nanoscale particle to the beam tip are examined in order to explore the suitability of SWCNTs as a mass detector device. The simulation results reveal that the volume of the added particle has little effect on the first resonant frequency. In contrast, the second resonant frequency decreases with increasing the volume of the added particle. Furthermore, the resonant frequency shift of the first mode is very obvious for the amount of added mass, and the second resonant frequency decreases rapidly with increasing volume of added particle.

Recently, an approach for the synthesis of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (C-SWNT) has been reported by S-doping with the method of graphite arc discharge.

In the same time, the workfunction is another critical quantity in understanding the field emission properties of carbon nanotubes.

Yue, and later Madduri extracted electrons into the vacuum in a diode configuration, but no attempt to build a triode device had ever been successful.

40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>Microelectronic</b> <b>devices</b> can be {{described}} as vacuum transistors or micro-miniature vacuum tubes, as one chooses. The fundamental reason behind this new technology is the very large current densities available from field emitters, namely as high as 10 (8) A/sq cm. Array current densities as high as 1000 A/sq cm have been measured. Total electron transit times from source to drain for 1 micron feature size devices have been predicted to be about 150 fs. This very short transit time implies the possibility of submillimeter wave transmitters and rectennas in devices which can operate with reasonably high voltages and which are small in size and are lightweight. In addition, they are expected to be extremely radiation hard and very temperature insensitive. That is, they are expected to have radiation hardness characteristics similar to vacuum tubes, and both the high temperature and low temperature limits should be determined by the package. That is, there should be no practical intrinsic temperature or carrier freezeout problems for devices based on metals or composites. But the technology is difficult to implement at the present time because it is based on 300 to 500 angstrom radius field emitters which must be relatively uniform. There is also the need to understand the non-equilibrium transport physics in the near-surface regions of the field emitters...|$|E

The Ag-SiO 2 nanocomposites are synthesised by Ag implantation into thermally oxidised SiO 2 layers on Si substrates and their fabrication processes are fully compatible with existing integrated circuit technology and their threshold fields are less than 20 V/mum. The local field enhancement mechanisms were studied and the fabrication processes of these layers optimised. Secondly, the electron field emission (FE) properties of two-dimensional quantum confinement structure were studied. Band gap modulated amorphous carbon (alpha-C) nanolayers were synthesised by pulsed laser deposition. In these structures, electrons are confined in a few nm thick low band gap sp 2 rich alpha-C layer, which is bound by the vacuum barrier and a 3 nm thick high band gap sp 3 rich alpha-C base layer.

40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> (VME) <b>devices</b> are of {{interest}} {{for the development of}} flat-screen displays and microwave devices. In many cases, their operation depends on the field emission of electrons from micron-sized cathodes (semiconductor or metal), into a vacuum. Major challenges to be met before these devices can be fully exploited include obtaining - low operating voltages, high maximum emission currents, uniform emission characteristics, and long-term emission stability. The research in this thesis concerns the production of silicon field emitters and the improvement of their emission properties by the process of anodisation. Anodisation was carried out for short times, in order to form a very thin layer of porous silicon (PS) at the surface of both p and p + -type silicon emitters. The aim in doing this was to form a high density of asperities over the surface of the emitters. It was the intention that these asperities, rather than the "macroscopic" apex of the emitter, would control emission. This was the first work of its kind to be carried out. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterise the morphology of p and p + -type silicon emitters before and after anodisation. Both the structure and arrangement of the surface fibrils, the thickness of the PS layers at the apex and nature of PS cross-sections were studied. The morphology was correlated to subsequent field emission measurements. Field emission characteristics, before and after anodisation, were obtained using a scanning electron microscope adapted for field emission measurements, and a field emission microscope. Extensive measurements showed that, following anodisation, there was substantial improvement in emission behaviour. After anodisation, the following was found to be true: i) The starting voltage was reduced by up to 50 % (with p +</sup -type PS emitters exhibiting a greater reduction in starting voltage than p-type PS emitters). ii) Number of emitting tips per array was increased. iii) Higher maximum currents (up to 3 times higher) were obtained before tips underwent destruction. iv) The resistive effect of the PS layer at the apex was important in determining the maximum current obtained from a tip. In addition, both field emission and field ion microscopy were used to identify the emission source following anodisation. It was shown that individual fibrils on the emission surface caused an increase in field enhancement over a flat plane, leading to emission at lower voltage. Overall, porous silicon appears to be a very promising material for field emission displays. </p...|$|R

Demonstration of the efficient incorporation of these impurities to form donor states with low activation energies into polycrystalline diamond would facilitate efficient room temperature operation of pn junctions devices. The effectiveness of boron as a p-type dopant in CVD diamond films has enabled the investigation of potential field emitter structures using different boron concentrations in order to identify their respective conduction mechanisms and to make a comparison of their relative electron emission performance. It has been concluded that efficient electron emission is observed to originate from the interface of n"+-p, silicon/diamond heterojunctions that employ thin p-type regions which are less than 5 #mu#m thick. The emission current may be controlled by the application of a low voltage forward bias of less than 1 volt. Only the np junction containing 400 ppm of boron in the p-diamond layer demonstrated forward biased electron emission. It is proposed that carrier conduction across the junction interface involves recombination and tunnelling steps between interface trap states. Furthermore it is believed that due to the junction interface being in direct contact with vacuum, within this region of the emitter structure, a surface conduction emission mechanism may operate that facilitates the field emission of electrons from the p-diamond side of the interface into free space. A number of aspects relating to the junction structure could be considered to improve its performance as a cold cathode emitter: a p-diamond layer exhibiting a higher carrier mobility; a controlled number, distribution and type of defect residing at the interface; an emission surface conditioned to exhibit a stable Negative Electron Affinity (NEA). To more clearly define the operation of a diamond cold cathode emitter based upon this junction structure further exploratory effort would be required to be undertaken in the future.

40|$|Field-emission devices (cold cathodes) having low {{electron}} affinities can be fabricated through lattice-mismatched {{epitaxial growth}} of nitrides of elements from group III of the periodic table. Field emission of electrons from solid surfaces is typically utilized in <b>vacuum</b> <b>microelectronic</b> <b>devices,</b> including some display devices. The present field-emission devices and {{the method of}} fabricating them were developed to satisfy needs {{to reduce the cost}} of fabricating field emitters, make them compatible with established techniques for deposition of and on silicon, and enable monolithic integration of field emitters with silicon-based driving circuitry. In fabricating a device of this type, one deposits a nitride of one or more group-III elements on a substrate of (111) silicon or other suitable material. One example of a suitable deposition process is chemical vapor deposition in a reactor that contains plasma generated by use of electron cyclotron resonance. Under properly chosen growth conditions, the large mismatch between the crystal lattices of the substrate and the nitride causes strains to accumulate in the growing nitride film, such that the associated stresses cause the film to crack. The cracks lie in planes parallel to the direction of growth, so that the growing nitride film becomes divided into microscopic growing single-crystal columns. The outer ends of the fully-grown columns can serve as field-emission tips. By virtue of their chemical compositions and crystalline structures, the columns have low work functions and high electrical conductivities, both of which are desirable for field emission of electrons. From examination of transmission electron micrographs of a prototype device, the average column width was determined to be about 100 nm and the sharpness of the tips was determined to be characterized by a dimension somewhat less than 100 nm. The areal density of the columns was found to about 5 x 10 (exp 9) /sq cm. about 4 to 5 orders of magnitude greater than the areal density of tips in prior field-emission devices. The electric field necessary to turn on the emission current and the current per tip in this device are both lower than in prior field-emission devices, such that it becomes possible to achieve longer operational lifetime. Moreover, notwithstanding the lower current per tip, because of the greater areal density of tips, it becomes possible to achieve greater current density averaged over the cathode area. The thickness of the grown nitride film (equivalently, the length of the columns) could lie between about 0. 5 microns and a few microns; in any event, a thickness of about 1 micron is sufficient and costs less than do greater thicknesses. It may be possible to grow nitride emitter columns on glass or other substrate materials that cost less than silicon does. What is important in the choice of substrate material is the difference between the substrate and nitride crystalline structures. Inasmuch as the deposition process is nondestructive, an ability to grow emitter columns on a variety of materials would be advantageous in that it would facilitate the integration of field-emitter structures onto previously processed integrated circuits...|$|E
