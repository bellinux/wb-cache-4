40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Many U. S. communities face difficulties attracting physicians to meet their health care needs. To address this problem, states and federal agencies have turned to foreign physicians who have just completed their graduate medical education in the United States under J- 1 visas. Ordinarily, these physicians are required to return home after completing their education, but this requirement can be waived {{at the request of}} a state or federal agency if the physician agrees to practice in, or work at a facility that treats residents of, an underserved area. In 1996, GAO reported that J- 1 <b>visa</b> <b>waivers</b> had become a major means of providing physicians for underserved areas, with over 1, 300 requested in 1995. Since 2002, each state has been allotted 30 J- 1 <b>visa</b> <b>waivers</b> per year, but some states have expressed interest in more. GAO was asked to report on its preliminary findings from ongoing work on (1) the number of J- 1 <b>visa</b> <b>waivers</b> requested by states and federal agencies and (2) states' views on the 30 -waiver limit and on their willingness to have unused waiver allotments redistributed. Such redistribution would require legislative action. GAO surveyed the 50 states, the District of Columbia, 3 U. S. insular areas [...] the 54 entities that are considered states for purposes of requesting J- 1 <b>visa</b> <b>waivers</b> [...] and federal agencies about waivers they requested in fiscal years 2003 - 05. ...|$|R

50|$|Countries which grant visa-free or visa-on-arrival {{entry to}} ROC {{passport}} holders may restrict this privilege to {{persons who are}} guaranteed to be removable to Taiwan. The {{presence or absence of}} a National Identification Card number in the passport is used to make this determination. As NWOHRs do not hold identification cards, their ROC passports thus do not get them visa-free treatment from a number of countries and territories, including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Deputy-Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lyushun (沈呂巡) stated that during the visa-exemption negotiations with Australia in 2010, he requested the extension of visa-free treatment to NWOHRs, but the Australian side rejected the idea precisely over concerns regarding lack of returnability. Similarly, the United States only grants <b>visa</b> <b>waivers</b> to ROC passport holders with an identification card imprinted in the ROC passport; bearers of an ROC passport without an identification card number are considered them to be stateless persons for visa-issuing purposes, and the Taiwan visa reciprocity schedule does not apply to them. NWOHRs using ROC passports to travel to Singapore must have a Taiwan Area Entry/Exit Permit (臨人字號入出國許可).|$|R
40|$|Australia’s current health {{requirement}} for migration {{to this country}} is prejudiced against people with a disability and their families, according to this report.  The Committee report makes 18 recommendations to Government to ensure migration assessment across the visa streams is fairer families where a member is {{a person with a}} disability. These recommendations support changes so that: • The theoretical cost of migration known as ‘significant cost threshold’ is modernised to reflect likely actual costs associated with disabilities or conditions. The committee also recommends that information on the costing methodology be made public. • Where a person does not meet the new updated Health Requirement, some visas provide for a waiver to allow for the assessment of the social and economic contributions made by a prospective immigrant or their families.   • Families including skilled immigrants should not be unfairly disadvantaged under the Health Requirement {{as a result of a}} family member having a disability – the ‘one fails, all fail’ rule. • For offshore refugee applicants who have a disability or other health condition, compelling and compassionate <b>visa</b> <b>waivers</b> are relevant considerations, including those applying on a family reunion basis.   • Australia’s migration legislation distinguishes between conditions which may impose a public health risk versus those linked to disability...|$|R
