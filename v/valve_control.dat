25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a drain <b>valve</b> <b>control.</b> A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|E

2500|$|Scorpions {{original}} [...] "full overhaul" [...] {{was reduced}} in scope. Long-overdue SUBSAFE work, {{such as a}} new central <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> system, was not performed. Crucially, her emergency system was not corrected for the same problems that destroyed Thresher. While Charleston Naval Ship Yard claimed the Emergency Main Ballast Tank Blow (EMBT) system worked as-is, SUBLANT claimed it did not, and their EMBT was [...] "tagged out" [...] or listed as unusable. Perceived problems with overhaul duration led to a delay on all SUBSAFE work in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2013 International Engine of the Year Awards {{which took}} place on 5 June 2013, Mini won an award for its 1.6 liter four-cylinder TwinPower Turbo from the Mini Cooper S {{for the third time}} in a row in the {{category}} of 1.4 to 1.8 liter engines. The engine has [...] "twin-scroll turbocharging with an overboost function, direct petrol injection and <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> based on the Valvetronic system" [...] and has an output of 135kW/184hp and provides enough power for the Mini Cooper S to accelerate from 0-100 in 7.0 seconds and in 2013 is available for Mini Cooper S Countryman and Mini Cooper S Paceman and an ALL-4 transmission can also be added to the configuration.|$|E

50|$|Automatic <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> include: {{pressure}} reducing <b>valves,</b> flow <b>control</b> <b>valves,</b> back-pressure sustaining valves, altitude valves, and relief valves. An altitude <b>valve</b> <b>controls</b> {{the level of}} a tank. The altitude valve will remain open while the tank is not full and it will close when the tanks reaches its maximum level. The opening and closing of the valve requires no external power source (electric, pneumatic, or man power), it is done automatically, hence its name.|$|R

50|$|Variable <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> systems {{optimize}} {{power and}} torque by varying valve opening times and/or duration. Some of these <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> systems optimize performance at low and mid-range engine speeds, while others focus on enhancing only high-rpm power. The MIVEC system provides both of these benefits by controlling valve timing and lift. The basic operation of the MIVEC system is altering the cam profiles and thus tailoring engine performance in response to driver input.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic punch presses, which {{power the}} ram with a {{hydraulic}} cylinder {{rather than a}} flywheel, and are either <b>valve</b> <b>controlled</b> or <b>valve</b> and feedback <b>controlled.</b> <b>Valve</b> <b>controlled</b> machines usually allow a one stroke operation allowing the ram to stroke up and down when commanded. Controlled feedback systems allow the ram to be proportionally controlled to within fixed points as commanded. This allows greater control over the stroke of the ram, and increases punching rates as the ram no longer has to complete the traditional full stroke up and down but can operate within a very short window of stroke.|$|R
50|$|A Pneumatic {{actuator}} mainly {{consists of}} a piston or a diaphragm which develops the motive power. It keeps {{the air in the}} upper portion of the cylinder, allowing air pressure to force the diaphragm or piston to move the valve stem or rotate the <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> element.|$|E

The {{operating}} principle of cartridge <b>valve</b> <b>controlled</b> by high-speed on/off valve is expounded, the mathematical models are established {{on the basis}} of the principle.

5000|$|<b>Control</b> <b>valves</b> {{can also}} work with {{hydraulic}} actuators ({{also known as}} hydraulic pilots). These types of valves are also known as Automatic <b>Control</b> <b>Valves.</b> The hydraulic actuators will respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open/close the <b>valve.</b> Automatic <b>Control</b> <b>Valves</b> do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close the valve.|$|R
