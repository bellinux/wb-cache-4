5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7). Some dances, such as traditional dance in 1 and ballet in 2, need a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of skill and training; others, such as the can-can, require a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves (9).|$|E

Hoppus commented to NME that he was {{surprised}} {{it took so long}} to leak and was relieved rather than annoyed that it had, reading warm comments about the album online.|$|E
5|$|Considerable {{scholarship}} has been concentrated on researching {{the level of}} living standards during the Song dynasty. A recent study by economic historian Cheng Minsheng estimated the average income for lower-class laborers during the Song dynasty as 100 wen a day, about 5 times the estimated subsistence level of 20 wen {{a day and a}} <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> for preindustrial economies. Per capita consumption of grain and silk respectively was estimated by Cheng to be around 8 jin (about 400 g each) a day and 2 bolts a year, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, {{how long a}} turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and how powerful individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{was elected}} to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a {{research}} university with a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of research activity; research expenditures totaled $718.2 million in 2009. The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million. MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty. In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties. Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{inclined}} elevators {{was intended}} to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with a shorter, easier path to the train platform {{as well as to}} reduce tunneling costs. The two elevators were manufactured by Maspero Elevatori, in Appiano Gentile, Italy, using a controller made on Long Island, speed governors made in Ohio, and buttons and other parts in Queens. The software for the elevator was written in the United States. Maspero Elevatori assembled the elevators in Italy, and they failed an operational test there, prior to being shipped to the United States. The MTA said the manufacturer chose to use American subcontractors in place of local Italian suppliers after reading the specifications the transit agency submitted. The MTA worked with the manufacturer to try to resolve the problems caused by a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of customization.|$|E

A dynasty was born in Greek basketball and Alvertis would soon become its captain.|$|E
25|$|Tantalum {{capacitors}} are reliable on {{the same}} <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> as other electronic components with very low failure rates. However, they have a single unique failure mode called “field crystallization". Field crystallization is the major reason for degradation and catastrophic failures of solid tantalum capacitors. More than 90% of the today's rare failures in tantalum solid-state electrolytic capacitors are caused by shorts or increased leakage current due to this failure mode.|$|E

Ward extracted a number of important concessions from the party, insisting on a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of personal control – he felt that the party's previous lack of direction was the primary cause for its failure. He also worked to build alliances with the growing labour movement, which was now standing candidates in many seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{remarkable}} and accomplished poems {{in the manuscript}} are both long exercises in a late form of alliterative verse with a superimposed rhyme-scheme: Pater Noster and The Three Dead Kings. Some modern commentators have suggested that these poems cannot be by Audelay, as they show a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of technical skill not immediately apparent in other poems in the manuscript, but others have maintained that they were most probably Audelay's own work.|$|E
25|$|The Highlands Gallery {{contains}} {{native plants}} from South to Central America. Its plants collect {{moisture from the}} air, and from water that drips from the trees above. Due to its drastically higher elevation (3,000–10,000 feet), this room is kept cooler than the Lowlands Gallery (around 65°F) and is kept at a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of humidity {{through the use of}} a misting system, as the Highland Tropics typically receive 200 inches of rain per year.|$|E

But the innovative anthropomorphic Buddha image immediately reached a <b>very</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of sculptural sophistication, naturally inspired by the sculptural styles of Hellenistic Greece.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 presidential {{election}} {{were carried out}} on 4 January 2004.

All other candidates received less than 2% of the votes. In total, 1,763,000 eligible voters participated in the election.|$|E
25|$|The Lowlands Gallery {{contains}} {{plants from}} the tropics of South America (near the equator).
