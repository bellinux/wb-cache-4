40|$|Wear due to {{cavitation}} in non-aqueous liquids can be serious, {{leading to}} premature failures of <b>valves,</b> <b>bearings,</b> and even pumps. Although {{it can be}} shown that the coIlapse of vapour cavities will cause more damage than those containing some gas {{it is not possible}} to predict theoretically and with any certainty the stresses produced in materials. Thus, at present, laboratory erosion tests offer the best means of determining the relative behaviour of materials in a single liquid. However, previous experimental investigations using the vibratory cavitation test with different liquids have also been inadequate because of the many variables in the process and the lack of control over the test liquid conditions. An improved test devicc of the same type has been built at NEL in which temperature, pressure, and gas content can be varied independently. This has eliminated many of the disadvantages of former equipment and permitted a study of the effects of fluid properties to be started...|$|R

To find the value of frictional losses of every component is necessary in order to reduce engine losses. The piston-liner system, <b>valve</b> train and <b>bearings</b> are the most important components for mechanical friction losses in reciprocating engines. In this paper both theoretical and experimental works published within the last ten years about the losses related to the motion of pistons, <b>valves</b> and <b>bearings</b> have been reviewed.

40|$|The M. A. N. -KZ type is one {{of large}} two-cycle marine diesel engines. In order to save the system oil in engines, it is {{important}} to reduce the leakage loss and to keep the oil in good quality as far as possible. Leakage tests and measurements of acid value, performed on the Hôsei Maru during her three voyages in 1960, gave the following results. 1) The mean total consumption was 130 l/day, and the rate of consumption as ""piston rod scraped oil"" was largest (Table 1, Table 2, Fig. 2). It should be collected carefully, and be returned into the system after a chemical treatment (Fig. 3). 2) Water and combustibles gave heavy injuries to the system oil. 3) A mass of exhaust gas leaking into the crank case through control <b>valve</b> <b>bearings</b> caused a severe deterioration to the system oil. For the purpose of intercepting exhaust gas, it seems useful to reinforce Labyrinth seals and apply a special grease to bearings (Fig. 1, ① ④). 4) Heavy duty oil is not suitable to this kind of engine, because it makes emulsion with water and gives fatal damages not only to the oil but also to the engine (Table 3). ...|$|R

50|$|Crankcase heat {{is common}} in air {{conditioning}} (cooling) systems where R-22 {{has been used for}} many years. The home owner often shuts off the disconnect to the outdoor condensing unit for the winter, leaving the compressor without crankcase heat. If the homeowner then starts the unit without some time for the heat to boil the refrigerant out the oil, damage likely occurs to the compressor. On start-up, the crankcase pressure reduces as soon as the compressor starts to turn. The refrigerant boils and turn the oil to foam. The oil and refrigerant (some of the refrigerant may be in liquid state) is pumped out of the compressor. <b>Valve</b> and <b>bearing</b> damage may occur and the compressor may be operated with a limited oil charge until it returns to the crankcase from the evaporator.|$|R

40|$|During, last {{decades the}} power {{increasing}} of mechanical {{systems and the}} request for increasing service life leads mechanical components of a system to work in extreme conditions. In particular actual mechanical systems include surfaces in sliding contact that are subjected to wear if exposed to high vibration. In fact, the vibration of components in contact results ill large oscillations of the local contact stresses, due to the local deformation of the components at the contact interfaces. Thus the necessity to approach an interdisciplinary problem dealing with dynamics (system vibrations) and tribology (contact behavior). This paper presents an analysis concerning {{the influence of the}} vibrations induced by aircraft engines oil the wear of contact surfaces of rolling bearings of the bleed system valves. The study is developed on the framework of an European project. To study the wear. resulting of fretting and false Brinelling known to occur in quasi-static assemblies in vibratory environment, at the contact surfaces between balls and rings of the <b>valve</b> <b>bearings</b> it is then necessary to achieve the forces dues to the system vibrations and acting at the bearings connections with the structure. In order to perform a numerical transient analysis of the system dynamics a nonlinear simplified model of the valve is developed. The model includes the stiffness of the preloading springs, the nonlinearity of the bearings stiffness and the nonlinearity due to the possible detachments and impacts between the bearings and the frame of the valve. The input of the models is the induced vibrations by the aircraft engine. The outputs are the relative vibration between the frame of the valve and the shaft charring the butterfly, which corresponds to the relative displacements between the outer and the inner rings of the bearings (the bearings are sited between these two components) and the time behaviour of the forces between the bearings and the frame of the valve [...] The model is validated by comparing the numerical results of the relative displacement with experimental results from vibration tests carried out on valve assembly. The time behaviour of the forces and the respective displacements between the contact surfaces, achieved with the presented analysis, will be the inputs for a Finite Element Model developed to reproduce and analyze the local contact constraint...|$|R

In addition, {{the motion of the}} pilot valve has large effects on the response of the relief valve itself.
