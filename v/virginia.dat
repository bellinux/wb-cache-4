5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} weather was issued for northern Kansas into southern Nebraska and from eastern West <b>Virginia</b> through <b>Virginia,</b> Maryland and Delaware. An ongoing line of thunderstorms moved east across West <b>Virginia</b> as the atmosphere began to destabilize. The thunderstorms {{resulted in a}} threat for isolated tornadoes in eastern sections of West <b>Virginia,</b> <b>Virginia,</b> Delaware and Maryland. In the central Great Plains region, a warm front extended northeast in northeastern Kansas from a surface low in central sections of Kansas. Strong instability occurred {{in the vicinity of}} the area as a result of surface heating. An intensifying low-level jet stream broke the cap in the region and resulted in the development of thunderstorms. During the afternoon, numerous thunderstorms formed across the Mid-Atlantic States. An EF0tornado was produced from one of the thunderstorms that impacted portions of Chesapeake Beach, tearing off sections of roof and siding from 10to 20single family homes. EF1tornadoes were produced in Culpeper, Clarke and Stafford counties in <b>Virginia.</b> Several other EF0 and EF1 tornadoes formed throughout the Great Plains region.|$|E

5|$|After halftime, the Hokies {{threatened}} Miami for {{the first}} time all game. <b>Virginia</b> Tech mounted an 80-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown, cutting Miami's lead to 14–10.

5|$|As the American Revolution {{intensified}} in 1775, Scott {{raised a}} company of volunteers in Cumberland County. It was the first company formed south of the James River {{to participate in the}} Revolution. The company stood ready to aid Patrick Henry in an anticipated clash with Lord Dunmore at Williamsburg, <b>Virginia,</b> in May 1775, but Dunmore abandoned the city in June, and they joined units from the surrounding counties in Williamsburg later that month. In July, the <b>Virginia</b> Convention created two regiments of <b>Virginia</b> troops, one under Patrick Henry and the other under William Woodford. As those leaders departed for Williamsburg, the Conventions acknowledged Scott as temporary commander-in-chief of the volunteers already assembled there. On August 17, 1775, he was elected lieutenant colonel of Woodford's regiment, the 2nd <b>Virginia.</b> His younger brother, Joseph, served as a lieutenant in the regiment. In December, Woodford dispatched Scott and 150 men to Great Bridge, <b>Virginia,</b> to defend a crossing point on the Elizabeth River. Days later, this force {{played a significant role in}} the December 9, 1775, Battle of Great Bridge by killing British Captain Charles Fordyce, thereby halting the British advance on the crossing. Following the battle, colonial forces were able to occupy the city of Norfolk, <b>Virginia,</b> and Lord Dunmore eventually departed from <b>Virginia.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Improving <b>Virginia's</b> {{transportation}} infrastructure and increasing its revenues {{was one of}} his signature accomplishments. Recognized by colleagues for his emphasis on strategic planning and preparation, Baliles was known as <b>Virginia's</b> [...] "transportation governor" [...] because of the premium he placed on improving transportation in the state. In 1986, Baliles guided a $422 million-a-year revenue package through a special session of the General Assembly to improve <b>Virginia's</b> transportation system, and observers still credit him with the foresight of that effort. Another key priority was ensuring the state's ability to participate and compete in world markets, and during his administration <b>Virginia’s</b> international trade grew substantially.|$|R
