5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the <b>virus</b> <b>affects</b> {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E

Some of these can include brain tumors, traumatic brain injury, and progressive neurological disorders. In rare cases, aphasia may also result from herpesviral encephalitis. The herpes simplex <b>virus</b> <b>affects</b> the frontal and temporal lobes, subcortical structures, and the hippocampal tissue, which can trigger aphasia.|$|E

2500|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus, an enveloped single-stranded negative RNA <b>virus,</b> <b>affects</b> {{nearly all}} body systems. Puppies {{from three to}} 6 months old are particularly susceptible. [...] CDV spreads through aerosol droplets and through contact with infected bodily fluids, including nasal and ocular secretions, feces, and urine, 6 to 22 days after exposure. It can also be spread by food and water contaminated with these fluids. The time between infection and disease is 14 to 18 days, although a fever can appear from 3 to 6 days after infection.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} common forms of herpes {{are caused by}} {{infection}} with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site. Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, Flu like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The <b>virus</b> <b>affects</b> the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. The primary attack is the most severe because the body {{does not have any}} antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (Valtrex). Although HSV-1 is typically the [...] "oral" [...] version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the [...] "genital" [...] version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either {{at the top of the}} spine, producing the [...] "oral" [...] outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.|$|E

50|$|Tissue tropism is {{the cells}} and tissues {{of a host}} that support growth of a {{particular}} virus or bacterium.Some bacteria and viruses have a broad tissue tropism and can infect many types of cells and tissues.
