40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate, within the Italian National Influenza Epidemiological and <b>Virological</b> <b>Surveillance,</b> the rate of vaccination coverage, the incidence of Influenza Like-Illness (ILI), the incidence of Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI), and to identify the virus strains circulating in Apulia from 1999 to 2003. METHODS: Vaccination coverage rates were calculated based on the number of doses administered to individuals > 65 years of age. Every week, sentinel physicians reported ILI and ARI cases having occurred among their patients. Voluntary general practitioners (GPs) and paediatricians (Ps) collected oropharyngeal swab samples from patients suspected with ILI. Influenza viruses were isolated and identified by cell culture (MDCK cells) and RT-PCR. <b>Virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> was carried out by the ISS, in collaboration with a network of peripheral laboratories. RESULTS: In Apulia, vaccination coverage progressively increased to 68. 6 % during the 2002 - 2003 season. The analysis of ILI cases showed higher incidence rates during the 1999 - 2000 and 2002 - 2003 seasons. ARI rates appeared to have a more constant trend. ILI and ARI incidence rates were higher in the 0 - 14 year age group.

40|$|Because of its {{peculiar}} epidemiology, influenza requires adequate surveillance {{in order}} to collect scientifically correct data on its activity through the population of a specific geographic area. During the 1999 - 2000 influenza season, a network of clinical, epidemiological and <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> has been created in the Area of Lecce within a national program (InfluNet). According to the protocol, a network of physicians had to survey a sample equivalent to 1 % of the entire population. Each physician has recorded each week {{the number of patients}} with influenza infection (ILI) or other acute febrile respiratory infection (ARI), pointing out if patients had,or had not, received influenza vaccine. In parallel with the clinical and epidemiological surveillance, a <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> has been carried out on {{a relatively small number of}} biological specimens derived from patients meeting the ILI criteria.

The vaccination coverage has increased in the last two years, in particular, as expected, among the elderly (> 64 years) and people in the high-risk groups. The epidemiological surveillance carried out in the Area of Lecce has shown that most cases occurred in children, among people aged 15 - 64 years, and among non-vaccinated people.

40|$|Since an {{outbreak}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) was averted in 2004, many novel coronaviruses have been recognized from different species, including humans. Bats have provided the most diverse assemblages of coronaviruses, suggesting that they may be the natural reservoir. Continued <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> has proven to {{be the best way to}} avert this infectious disease at the source. Here we provide the first description of a previously unidentified coronavirus lineage detected from wild Asian leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chinese ferret badgers (Melogale moschata) during <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> in southern China. Partial genome analysis revealed a typical coronavirus genome but with a unique putative accessory gene organization. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein structural proteins and the two conserved replicase domains, putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, of these novel coronaviruses were most closely related to those of group 3 coronaviruses identified from birds, while the spike protein gene was most closely related to that of group 1 coronaviruses from mammals. However, these viruses always fell into an outgroup phylogenetic relationship with respect to other coronaviruses and had low amino acid similarity to all known coronavirus groups, indicating that they diverged early in the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. These results suggest that these viruses may represent a previously unrecognized evolutionary pathway, or possibly an unidentified coronavirus group.

40|$|Abstract: Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) H 5 N 1 has posed a significant threat to both humans and birds, {{and it has}} spanned large geographic areas and various ecological systems throughout Asia, Europe and Africa, but especially in mainland China. Great efforts in control and prevention of the disease, including universal vaccination campaigns in poultry and active serological and <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance,</b> have been undertaken in mainland China {{since the beginning of}} 2006. In this study, we aim to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of HPAI H 5 N 1, and identify influencing factors favoring the occurrence of HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry in mainland China.

The analysis by age group suggests that the overall distribution of circulating (sub) types may mask substantial differences between age groups. Thus, in cases aged 5 – 14 years, 75 % tested positive for influenza B virus whereas all other age groups had an even distribution of influenza A and B viruses. This means that the intepretation of syndromic surveillance data without age group-specific virological data may be misleading.

40|$|To {{complement}} traditional influenza surveillance {{with data}} on disease occurrence {{not only among}} care-seeking individuals, the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) has tested an Internet-based monitoring system (IMS) with self-recruited volunteers submitting weekly on-line reports about their health in the preceding week, upon weekly reminders. We evaluated IMS acceptability and to which extent participants represented the Swedish population. We also studied the agreement of data on influenza-like illness (ILI) occurrence from IMS with data from a previously evaluated population-based system (PBS) with an actively recruited random sample of the population who spontaneously report disease onsets in real-time via telephone/Internet, and with traditional general practitioner based sentinel and <b>virological</b> influenza <b>surveillance,</b> in the 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013 influenza seasons. We assessed acceptability by calculating the participation proportion in an invited IMS-sample and the weekly reporting proportion of enrolled self-recruited IMS participants. We compared distributions of socio-demographic indicators of self-recruited IMS participants to the general Swedish population using chi-square tests. Finally, we assessed the agreement of weekly incidence proportions (%) of ILI in IMS and PBS with cross-correlation analyses. Among 2, 511 invited persons, 166 (6. 6 %) {{agreed to participate in}} the IMS. In each season, 2, 552 and 2, 486 self-recruited persons participated in the IMS respectively. The weekly reporting proportion among self-recruited participants decreased from 87 % to 23 % (2011 - 2012) and 82 % to 45 % (2012 - 2013). Women, highly educated, and middle-aged persons were overrepresented among self-recruited IMS participants (p< 0. 01). IMS (invited and self-recruited) and PBS weekly incidence proportions correlated strongest when no lags were applied (r = 0. 71 and r = 0. 69, p< 0. 05). This evaluation revealed socio-demographic misrepresentation and limited compliance among the self-recruited IMS participants.

We sequenced the complete coding region of the haemagglutinin (HA) segment of 685 H 1 N 1 pandemic viruses selected without bias during two waves of pandemic in the UK (April-December 2009). Phylogenetic analysis showed that although temporal accumulation of amino acid changes was observed in the HA sequences, the overall diversity was less than that typically seen for seasonal influenza A H 1 N 1 or H 3 N 2. There was co-circulation of multiple variants as characterised by signature amino acid changes in the HA. A specific substitution (S 203 T) became predominant both in UK and global isolates. No antigenic drift occurred during 2009 as viruses with greater than four-fold reduction in their haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre ("low reactors") were detected in a low proportion (3 %) and occurred sporadically.

While human infections with avian influenza viruses are usually associated with subtypes prevalent in poultries, A(H 10 N 8) isolates were mostly found in migratory birds and only recently in poultries. Although not possible to predict whether this single intrusion by A(H 10 N 8) is an accident or the start of another epidemic like the preceding A(H 7 N 9) and A(H 5 N 1), several features suggest that A(H 10 N 8) is a potential threat to humans. Recombinant H 10 could attach to human respiratory epithelium, and A(H 10 N 4) virus could cause severe infections in minks and chickens.

Seven contacts {{are considered to be}} at high risk of infection and are being actively monitored for 21 days. Background Lassa fever is caused by an arenavirus and is an acute illness of between one and three weeks duration. The incubation period is usually seven to 12 days but may range between three and 21 days. About 80 % of human infections in endemic areas are asymptomatic. The overall case fatality rate is 1 %, although it is reported to be 15 %- 20 % in hospitalised patients [1, 2]. The natural host of Lassa virus is the multimammate rat (Mastomys spec.) which sheds the virus in urine and droppings. Transmission of the virus to humans usually occurs via direct or indirect contact with rodent excreta. Person-to-person transmission occurs through direct contact with blood, saliva, urine, faeces or semen [1]. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in parts of West Africa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOn Reunion Island, in {{response}} to the threat of emergence of the pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus, we implemented enhanced influenza surveillance from May 2009 onwards in order to detect the introduction of pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza and to monitor its spread and impact on public health. The first 2009 pandemic influenza A(H 1 N 1) virus was identified in Réunion on July 5, 2009, in a traveller returning from Australia; seasonal influenza B virus activity had already been detected. By the end of July, a sustained community pandemic virus transmission had been established. Pandemic H 1 N 1 influenza activity peaked during week 35 (24 – 30 August 2009), 4 weeks after the beginning of the epidemic. The epidemic ended on week 38 and had lasted 9 weeks. During these 9 weeks, an estimated 66 915 persons who consulted a physician could have been infected by the influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 virus, giving a cumulative attack rate for consultants of 8. 26 %. Taking into account the people who did not consult, the total number of infected persons reached 104 067, giving a cumulative attack rate for symptomatics of 12. 85 %. The crude fatality rate (CFR) for influenza A(H 1 N 1) 2009 and the CFR for acute respiratory infection was 0. 7 / 10 000 cases. Our data show that influenza pandemic did not have a health impact on overall mortality on Réunion Island. These findings demonstrate the value of an integrated epidemiological, <b>virological</b> and hospital <b>surveillance</b> programme to monitor the scope of an epidemic, identify circulating strains and provide some guidance to public health control measures...|$|R
40|$|Background: Google Flu Trends was {{developed}} to estimate influenza activity in many countries; however there is currently no Google Flu Trends or other Internet search data used for influenza surveillance in China. Methods and Findings: Influenza surveillance data from 2008 through 2011 were obtained from provincial CDC influenzalike illness and <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> systems of Guangdong, a province in south China. Internet search data were downloaded from the website of Google Trends. Pearson's correlation coefficients with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated to compare surveillance data and internet search trends. The correlation between CDC ILI surveillance and CDC virus surveillance was 0. 56 (95 % CI: 0. 43, 0. 66). The strongest correlation was between the Google Trends term of Fever and ILI surveillance with a correlation coefficient of 0. 73 (95 % CI: 0. 66, 0. 79). When compared with influenza <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance,</b> the Google Trends term of Influenza A had the strongest correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0. 64 (95 % CI: 0. 43, 0. 79) in the 2009 H 1 N 1 influenza pandemic period. Conclusions: This study shows that Google Trends in Chinese {{can be used as}} a complementary source of data for influenza surveillance in south China. More research in the future should develop new models using search trends in Chinese language to estimate local disease activity and detect early signals of outbreaks. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. RNA {{amplification}} by {{nucleic acid}} sequence-based amplification (NASBA) {{was used to}} detect serotype specific dengue viruses in artificially-infected female Aedes mosquitoes, in comparison with RT-PCR technique. NASBA could detect dengue virus serotype 2 and 4 below 0. 1 PFU, which was more sensitive than RT-PCR, but this technique was as sensitive as RT-PCR when detecting dengue virus serotype 1 and 3. Dengue viruses could be detected at the thorax of mosquitoes at 0, 7, and 14 days after inoculation with dengue virus serotype 2. This method should be useful for <b>virological</b> <b>surveillance</b> of dengue infected Aedes mosquitoes, as an early warning system to predict outbreaks of dengue viruses...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} the frequency of isolation of polioviruses and non polio enteroviruses from different categories of the investigated children. The percentage of detection of polioviruses from the patients with acute flaccid paralysis was lower than that from the children from groups at risk.

40|$|Abstract Background The recent avian {{influenza}} epidemic in Asia and the H 1 N 1 pandemic demonstrated that influenza A viruses {{pose a threat}} to global public health. The animal origins of the viruses confirmed the potential for interspecies transmission. Swine are hypothesized to be prime "mixing vessels" due to the dual receptivity of their trachea to human and avian strains. Additionally, avian and human influenza viruses have previously been isolated in swine. Therefore, understanding interspecies contact on smallholder swine farms and its potential role in the transmission of pathogens such as influenza virus is very important. Methods This qualitative study aimed to determine swine-associated interspecies contacts in two coastal areas of Peru. Direct observations were conducted at both small-scale confined and low-investment swine farms (n = 36) and in open areas where swine freely range during the day (n = 4). Interviews were also conducted with key stakeholders in swine farming. Results In both locations, the intermingling of swine and domestic birds was common. An unexpected contact with avian species was that swine were fed poultry mortality in 6 / 20 of the farms in Chancay. Human-swine contacts were common, with a higher frequency on the confined farms. Mixed farming of swine with chickens or ducks was observed in 36 % of all farms. Human-avian interactions were less frequent overall. Use of adequate biosecurity and hygiene practices by farmers was suboptimal at both locations. Conclusions Close human-animal interaction, frequent interspecies contacts and suboptimal biosecurity and hygiene practices pose significant risks of interspecies influenza virus transmission. Farmers in small-scale swine production systems constitute a high-risk population and need to be recognized as key in preventing interspecies pathogen transfer. A two-pronged prevention approach, which offers educational activities for swine farmers about sound hygiene and biosecurity practices and guidelines and education for poultry farmers about alternative approaches for processing poultry mortality, is recommended. <b>Virological</b> and serological <b>surveillance</b> for influenza viruses will also be critical for these human and animal populations. </p...|$|R
