40|$|Too often, {{validation}} of computer models is {{considered as a}} "once and forget" task. In this paper a systematic and graduated approach to evacuation model validation is suggested.

While the first three components of the <b>validation</b> <b>protocol</b> pose little or no significant problems, the task of quantitative validation poses a number of challenges, the most significant being a shortage of suitable experimental data.

40|$|Abstract—Current trust {{mechanisms}} {{employed by}} the existing P 2 P systems are faced with various threats from malicious nodes, which have seriously affected the performance of whole system. To protect P 2 P network, an adaptive and robust reputation mechanism (ARRep) is proposed. ARRep balances direct trust and recommended trust according {{to the experience of}} the requester. Our contribution lies in three aspects. Firstly, a transaction decay function is adopted to distinguish the importance of direct experience. Secondly, ARRep utilizes the transaction numbers and the size of common set to gain the higher accuracy of the recommended trust value. Finally, to verify the transaction information, we develop a simple transaction <b>validation</b> <b>protocol.</b> Simulation experimental results show that ARRep is highly effective in front of on-off, bad mouthing and collusive cheating attacks.

40|$|International audienceThe {{issue of}} {{co-registration}} distortions between images {{is one of}} major problems involved in data fusion processes. This conclusion can be extended to change detection generally also performing on a pixel basis. Accurate methods are therefore required for co-registration of images in these particular cases. It {{is the reason why}} we present a co-registration method using multi-resolution analysis and local deformation models. This work includes a <b>validation</b> <b>protocol</b> that enables the assessment of the accuracy, the robustness and the quality provided by any co-registration method. This <b>validation</b> <b>protocol</b> has been then applied to the presented method and the results have been compared to those provided by a standard one. According to this validation, this method provides a very fine correction of the geometric distortions that is better than those generally provided by standard co-registration methods. As a conclusion, this method seems to constitute an answer to the need of high quality co-registration as a pre-processing of fusion and change detection processes. Moreover, it is a fully automatic method that potentially enables an operational utilisation of high quality...|$|E

40|$|Laboratories working towards {{accreditation}} by the International Standards Organization (ISO) 15189 standard {{are required}} {{to demonstrate the validity}} of their analytical methods. The different guidelines set by various accreditation organizations make it difficult to pro-vide objective evidence that an in-house method is fit for the intended purpose. Besides, the required performance characteristics tests and acceptance criteria are not always de-tailed. The laboratory must choose the most suitable <b>validation</b> <b>protocol</b> and set the ac-ceptance criteria. Therefore, we propose a <b>validation</b> <b>protocol</b> to evaluate the performance of an in-house method.

The fun-damental parameters tested were, selectivity, calibration model, precision, accuracy (and uncertainty of measurement), contamination, stability of the sample, reference interval, and analytical interference. We have developed a protocol that has been applied success-fully to quantify lead in whole blood by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). In particular, our method is selective, linear, accurate, and precise, making it suitable for use in routine diagnostics...|$|E
