40|$|Recently, the U. S. nuclear {{industry}} has proposed replacing current <b>volumetric</b> and/or surface <b>examinations</b> of certain components in commercial nuclear power plants, {{as required by}} the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XI, “Inservice Inspection of Nuclear Power Plant Components, ” with a simpler visual testing (VT) method. The advantages of VT are that these tests generally involve much less radiation exposure and time to perform the <b>examination</b> than do <b>volumetric</b> <b>examinations</b> such as ultrasonic testing. The issues relative to the reliability of VT in determining the structural integrity of reactor components were examined. Some piping and pressure vessel components in a nuclear power station are examined using VT because they are either in high radiation fields or their component geometry precludes the use of ultrasonic testing (UT) methodology. Remote VT with radiation-hardened video systems has been used by nuclear utilities to find cracks in pressure vessel cladding in pressurized water reactors, core shrouds in boiling water reactors, and to investigate leaks in piping and reactor components. These visual tests are performed using a wide variety of procedures and equipment. The techniques for remote VT use submersible closed-circuit video cameras to examine reactor components and welds. PNNL conducted a parametric study that examined the important variables influencing the effectiveness of a remote visual test. Tested variables included lighting techniques, camera resolution, camera movement, and magnification. PNNL also conducted a limited laboratory test using a commercial visual testing camera system to experimentally determine the ability of the camera system to detect cracks of various widths under ideal conditions.

40|$|In December 2006, the Boiling Water Reactor Vessel and Internals Project (BWRVIP) {{issued a}} letter mandating two-sided {{coverage}} for the <b>volumetric</b> <b>examination</b> of BWR core shroud welds. In this letter, they noted that: “Ultrasonic flaw detection and sizing performance is degraded by stainless steel or nickel allow weld metal. The base metal examination volumes {{on both sides of}} the weld should be examined using sound beams that have not passed through the weld metal. Whenever possible, stainless steel or nickel-alloy weld joints should be examined by scanning on both of the two components that are jointed by the weld. When one side of the weld is examined using only beams that have passed through the weld metal, that side of the weld should be considered to have received a “best effort” examination. ” This long awaited letter and the associated new requirements coupled with continued customer interest in improved coverage and reduced outages have supported AREVA’s comprehensive program to modify their core shroud inspection tools and techniques. The basic approach was to address all welds from the annulus between the vessel and the shroud so as to minimize interference with refueling, to examine horizontal, vertical, and ring segment welds with maximum coverage, and to complete the task in the shortest possible time. This paper will discuss: the UT techniques adopted to achieve twosided phased array coverage of the welds; the tool modifications particularly regarding the reduction in tool height to maximize coverage; software features to enhance the tool ergonomics and minimize the possibility of operator errors; and auxiliary tool features to facilitate completion of the inspection in the shortest possible time and with minimal dependence on site resources including the polar crane.

Description This dataset contains anonymized images of the human prostate (N= 3 patients) collected during two sessions for each patient: 	MRI examination of the prostate for the purposes of disease staging. 	US examination of the prostate for the purposes of <b>volumetric</b> <b>examination</b> in preparation to the brachytherapy implant. These are three-dimensional (multi-slice) scalar images. Image files are stored using NRRD file format (files with. nrrd extension), see details at [URL] Each image file includes a code for the case number (internal numbering at the research site) and the modality (US or MR). Image annotations were prepared by Dr. Fedorov (no professional training in radiology) and Dr. Tuncali (10 + in prostate imaging interpretation). Annotations include 	Manual contouring (segmentation) of the whole prostate gland, performed in 3 D Slicer software. These segmentation images are coded in the same fashion as the image files, and saved in NRRD format, with "-label" suffix. 	Manually placed points (fiducials) corresponding to the location of urethra entry into the prostate at base (coded as UB), verumontanum (VM), urethra entry into the prostate at apex (UA), as well as centroids of cysts and calcifications. UB, UA and VM locations are annotated both in MR and US for all cases, while cysts and calcifications are annotated when applicable. Fiducial points are stored in comma-separated CSV-style format adopted by 3 D Slicer software (. fcsv file extension). There is one row per point in these files, encoding the location of the point in RAS coordinate space relative to the image data, {{and the name of the}} point.

In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of pancreas MRI segmentation using state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Methods and materialsT 2 -weighted half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo and T 1 weighted <b>volumetric</b> interpolated breath-hold <b>examination</b> images were acquired on 3 patients and 2 healthy volunteers {{for a total of}} 12 imaging volumes. A novel dictionary learning (DL) method was used to segment the pancreas and compared to t mean-shift merging, distance regularized level set, and graph cuts, and the segmentation results were compared with manual contours using Dice's index, Hausdorff distance, and shift of the center of the organ (SHIFT). ResultsAll <b>volumetric</b> interpolated breath-hold <b>examination</b> images were successfully segmented by at least 1 of the autosegmentation method with Dice's index > 0. 83 and SHIFT ≤ 2 mm using the best automated segmentation method. The automated segmentation error of half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo images was significantly greater. DL is statistically superior to the other methods in Dice’s overlapping index. For the Hausdorff distance and SHIFT measurement, distance regularized level set and DL performed slightly superior to the graph cuts method, and substantially superior to mean-shift merging. DL required least human supervision and was faster to compute.

Our aim was to demonstrate the utility of radial <b>volumetric</b> interpolated brain <b>examination</b> with the golden-angle radial sparse parallel technique to evaluate permeability characteristics of the individual components (anterior and posterior gland and the median eminence) of the {{pituitary gland}} and areas of differential enhancement and to optimize the study acquisition time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 52 patients (group 1, 25 patients with normal pituitary glands; and group 2, 27 patients with a known diagnosis of microadenoma). Radial <b>volumetric</b> interpolated brain <b>examination</b> sequences with golden-angle radial sparse parallel technique were evaluated with an ROI-based method to obtain signal-time curves and permeability measures of individual normal structures within the pituitary gland and areas of differential enhancement.

RESULTS: Signal-time curves from the posterior pituitary gland and median eminence demonstrated a faster wash-in and time of maximum enhancement with a lower peak of enhancement compared with the anterior pituitary gland (P. 005).

40|$|The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a multi-year {{program at}} the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to provide {{engineering}} studies and assessments of {{issues related to the}} use of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods for the reliable inspection of nuclear power plant components. As part of this program, there is a subtask 2 D that was set up to address an assessment of issues related to the NDE of high density polyethylene (HDPE) butt fusion joints. This work is being driven by the nuclear industry wanting to employ HDPE materials in nuclear power plant systems. This being a new material for use in nuclear applications, {{there are a number of}} issues related to its use and potential problems that may evolve. The industry is pursuing ASME Code Case N- 755 entitled “Use of Polyethylene (PE) Plastic Pipe for Section III, Division 1, Construction and Section XI Repair/Replacement Activities” that contains the requirements for nuclear power plant applications of HDPE. This Code Case requires that inspections be performed after the fusion joint is made by visually examining the bead that is formed and conducting a pressure test of the joint. These tests are only effective in general if gross through-wall flaws exist in the fusion joint. The NRC wants to know whether a volumetric inspection can be conducted on the fusion joint that will reliably detect lack-of-fusion conditions that may be produced during joint fusing. The NRC has requested that the work that PNNL is conducting be provided to assist them in resolving this inspection issue of whether effective volumetric NDE can be conducted to detect lack of fusion (LOF) in the butt HDPE joints. PNNL had 24 HDPE pipe specimens manufactured of 3408 material to contain LOF conditions that could be used to assess the effectiveness of NDE in detecting the LOF. Basic ultrasonic material properties were measured and used to guide the use of phased arrays and time-of-flight diffraction (TOFD) work that was conducted. Millimeter (mm) waves were also used to inspect these assemblies. Fluor and NDE Innovations, Inc. conducted TOFD inspections using their commercially available equipment on all 24 specimens. These NDE inspection results were reviewed and several of the specimens were selected for destructive evaluation using a microtome to slice small blocks of blank and fusion joint material. This interim report provides a status/summary of the work that has been conducted to date. In the areas selected for destructive testing where there were strong acoustic responses, LOF was verified. In areas where there were no NDE responses, no LOF was found. It needs to be noted that only a small amount of material has been destructively characterized at this point and further work is planned to determine if these trends hold up. Some of the material from three of the assemblies was sent off for mechanical testing but the results were not available to be included in this status report. The initial work shows that at least some of the LOF is providing NDE responses that have been verified through destructive testing. Thus, there is promise that a <b>volumetric</b> <b>examination</b> can be conducted on HDPE butt fusion joints. The future work will lead to quantifying what various NDE methods can detect, what they miss, and what they incorrectly characterize as defective...|$|E
40|$|Objectives In {{chemotherapy}} monitoring, an {{estimation of}} the change in tumour size is an important criterion for the assessment of treatment success. This requires a comparison between corresponding lesions in the baseline and follow-up computed tomography (CT) examinations. We evaluate the clinical benefits of an automatic lesion tracking tool that identifies the target lesions in the follow-up CT study and pre-computes the lesion volumes. Methods Four radiologists performed <b>volumetric</b> follow-up <b>examinations</b> for 52 patients with and without lesion tracking. In total, 139 lung nodules, liver metastases and lymph nodes were given as target lesions. We measured reading time, inter-reader variability in lesion identification and volume measurements, and the amount of manual adjustments of the segmentation results. Results With lesion tracking, target lesion assessment time decreased by 38 % or 22 s per lesion. Relative volume difference between readers was reduced from 0. 171 to 0. 1. Segmentation quality was comparable with and without lesion tracking. Conclusions Our automatic lesion tracking tool can make interpretation of follow-up CT examinations quicker and provide results that are less reader-dependent. Key Points. Computed tomography is widely used to follow-up lesions in oncological patients.. Novel software automatically identifies and measures target lesions in oncological follow-up examinations..

40|$|Fully {{integrated}} PET/MR imaging holds {{great promise}} as a novel hybrid imaging modality in oncology and might offer advantages to PET/CT in many instances, especially {{because of the}} superior soft-tissue contrast of MR imaging, compared with CT. However, lung metastases are a frequent finding in oncologic patients, and for im-aging of the lung CT is still the modality of choice. Thus, we prospectively evaluated differences in quality, detection rate, size, and radiotracer uptake of pulmonary lesions in 18 F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MR imaging. Methods: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. Forty patients (23 men, 17 women; mean age ± SD, 53. 2 ± 13. 1 y) underwent a single-injection dual-imaging protocol with 18 F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MR imaging. Pulse sequences for the lung included T 1 -weighted VIBE (<b>volumetric</b> inter-polated breath-hold <b>examination)</b> Dixon for attenuation correction and contrast-enhanced VIBE pulse sequences. All patients underwent a di...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this pilot}} study was to {{investigate}} the potential of calcium phosphate cement in the treatment of orbital wall defect fractures in an adult sheep model, and to compare this alloplastic material to autologous calvaria split-bone grafts. Clinical, <b>volumetric</b> and histological <b>examinations</b> were carried out of both reconstruction materials. The use of cement made intraoperative corrections easier to perform, and increased the precision of reconstruction of the orbital volume. This material also proved to be osseoconductive. The two materials were used successfully in combination. Regions of most intensive remodelling were the anterior orbital floor and the adjacent orbital rim. The preliminary results of this study demonstrate the potential of calcium phosphate cement as a useful biomaterial in the reconstruction of the anterior orbital region. Further animal and clinical trials are necessary to investigate its ability as a carrier for mediators where bone healing requires influence or support...|$|R
30|$|Nine of 18 68 Ga-Pentixafor PET and all 18 F-FDG PET scans were {{performed}} on a Sensation 64 Biograph PET/CT scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), whereas 9 of 18 68 Ga-Pentixafor scans {{were performed}} on a PET/MRI device (Siemens Biograph mMR, Siemens Medical Solutions, Germany). The CT-scan protocol included a low-dose CT (26  mAS, 120  kV, 5  mm slice thickness) {{from the base of}} the skull to the mid-thigh for attenuation correction followed by the PET scan and a diagnostic CT (240  mAS, 120  kV, 5  mm slice thickness) in the portal venous phase in case of 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans. Injected activities for 68 Ga-Pentixafor ranged from 177 to 223  MBq and for 18 F-FDG from 201 to 349  MBq. PET acquisition was performed after a mean of 51  min post injection for 68 Ga-Pentixafor and 75  min post injection for 18 F-FDG PET/CT respectively. All PET/CT scans were acquired in 3 D mode with an acquisition time of 3  min per bed position. Images were reconstructed by an attenuation-weighted ordered-subset expectation maximization algorithm (four iterations, eight subsets) followed by a post-reconstruction smoothing Gaussian filter (5  mm full-width at half-maximum). In PET/MR, a coronal 2 -point Dixon 3 D <b>volumetric</b> interpolated <b>examination</b> (VIBE) T 1 w sequence was performed for generation of attenuation maps as recently published [22]. In addition, diagnostic dedicated sequences dependent on the examined malignancy were performed. PET data was acquired simultaneously in three-dimensional mode with 3 -min emission time per bed position.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: T 1 -weighted, 3 D gradient-echo MR {{sequences}} can be {{optimized for}} rapid acquisition and improved resolution through asymmetric k-space sampling and interpolation. We compared a <b>volumetric</b> interpolated brain <b>examination</b> (VIBE) sequence with a magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP RAGE) sequence and a 2 D T 1 -weighted spin-echo (SE) sequence. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients known or suspected to have focal brain lesions underwent postcontrast studies (20 mL of gadopentetate dimeglumine) with VIBE, MP RAGE, and 2 D T 1 -weighted SE imaging. Source and 5 -mm VIBE and MP RAGE reformations, and 5 -mm T 1 -weighted SE images were compared qualitatively and by using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). SNRs in a gadolinium-doped water phantom were also measured {{for all three}} sequences. RESULTS: On the source images, SNRs for gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and CNRs for WM-to-GM and contrast-enhancing lesion-to-GM were slightly, but significantly higher for the VIBE sequence than for the MP RAGE sequence (...|$|R
30|$|Borrowing from {{extensive}} experience with perianal fistulas, MRI has intrinsically superior soft tissue contrast compared to CT and may, therefore, better define the fistulous tract; furthermore, MRI is appealing to both radiologists and patients because of absent ionising radiation exposure. However, in critically ill patients {{such as those}} in the early postoperative days, MRI is hampered by respiratory and peristaltic artefacts from bowel obstruction or ascites. In patients who can sufficiently cooperate, MRI protocols to investigate ECFs should rely on multiplanar fluid-sensitive T 2 -weighted images including the anterior abdominal wall; the use of fat suppression techniques in at least one plane is recommended to improve detection of oedema and inflammation in the intra-abdominal and subcutaneous fat. Additionally, intravenous administration of gadolinium CM is helpful to visualise hypervascularity of ECF walls, abscess collections and surrounding fat planes, which is best appreciated on volumetric fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted gradient-echo sequences such as T 1 high-resolution isotropic volume excitation (THRIVE), liver acquisition with volume acquisition (LAVA) or <b>volumetric</b> interpolated breath-hold <b>examination</b> (VIBE).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In {{evaluating}} intracranial tumors, a safe low-cost {{alternative that}} provides information {{similar to that}} of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) may be of interest. Our purpose was to determine the utility and limitations of a combined MR protocol in assessing (neo-) vascularity in intracranial tumors and their relation to adjacent vessels and to compare the results with those of DSA. METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients with an intracranial tumor who underwent preoperative stereoscopic DSA were examined with contrast-enhanced dynamic T 2 *-weighted perfusion MR imaging followed by a T 1 -weighted three-dimensional (3 D) MR study (<b>volumetric</b> interpolated brain <b>examination</b> [VIBE]). The maximum relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) of the tumor was compared with tumor vascularity at DSA. Critical vessel structures were defined in each patient, and VIBE images of these structures were compared with DSA findings. For full exploitation of the 3 D data sets, maximum-intensity projection algorithms reconstructed in real time with any desired volume and orientation were used. RESULTS: Tumor blush scores at DSA were significantly correlated with the rCBV measurements (r = 0. 75;...|$|R
