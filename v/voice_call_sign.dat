50|$|JD {{has been}} pivotal in CB radio in Sydney, {{as he has}} been the driving force behind several other {{well-known}} repeaters, such as VMG3 at Appin/Razorback and VMC4 at Port Kembla as well as VMB7 Mt Bindo (never commissioned) and an AUSTRALIA Wide Transportable UHF CB Repeater licensed to operate from channels 1-8. Jason (JD) also provided a <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> sample for VMB4 in Newcastle. At one point in time it was said that he held a monopoly on CB repeater licenses in Sydney, as he owned three repeaters, all within 100 km of each other, at a time when no other licenses were available. He is also a licensed radio amateur operator.|$|E
5000|$|Each flight {{maintained}} a Quick Reaction Team (QRT) {{of six to}} thirteen security policemen to respond to penetrations of the perimeter, transported in trucks storing weaponry needed. The security force was supplemented by manpower augmentation ("augmentees" [...] officially; [...] "Augie Doggies" [...] familiarly) of approximately 100 non-security police airmen, and from August 1969 to December 1969 by two 33-man sections of combat security police deployed on temporary duty to Vietnam. Nightly air cover was provided by an orbitting AC-47 Spooky gunship, which patrolled mainly the [...] "rocket belt" [...] surrounding the air base, but operational control was not given local commanders. Because Phù Cát never experienced a direct infantry attack, the AC-47 patrol was commonly diverted to priority missions resulting in a lapse of coverage of up to 50 minutes while a replacement AC-47 was scrambled from Nha Trang. A forward observation post was maintained outside the perimeter, approximately one mile from the flight line, atop Hill 151, also known as [...] "Bordner Hill," [...] in bunkers and trenches previously held by Korean troops. A four-man security team was flown by HH-43 Pedro helicopters of the rescue detachment to the position, known in the defense plan by its <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Oregon, for seven-day rotations. Beginning in April 1969 the intelligence section of the 37th SPS conducted aerial reconnaissance of the perimeter twice a day aboard an HH-43 or an O-1 Bird Dog forward air control aircraft of the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron. Command and control of all operations, both security and law enforcement, was conducted by Central Security Control (CSC), located in a controlled access building behind the Base Operations facility on the flight line.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to steel, Long Beach was built with 450 tons of structural aluminum. Because of this unusually high quantity of aluminum, she was assigned the <b>voice</b> radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Alcoa".|$|R
50|$|When {{identifying}} a station by <b>voice,</b> the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{may be given}} by simply stating the letters and numbers, or using a phonetic alphabet. Some countries mandate {{the use of the}} phonetic alphabet for identification.|$|R
2500|$|The 73rd Bomb Wing began {{combat in}} October 1944 from Isley Field, Saipan, and marked its {{aircraft}} similarly {{to that of}} the Fifteenth Air Force 55th CBW. A letter denoting the group was painted on the upper third of the tail fin, with a square symbol in the center, and an aircraft identifier, known as the [...] "victor number," [...] in the lower third. Aircraft commonly used their tail identifiers as radio <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> (<b>call</b> <b>signs),</b> i.e. Lucky Irish (serial 42-24622) of the 870th Bomb Squadron, 497th Bomb Group (lost November 24, 1944, over Tokyo) had the <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> [...] "A Square 26".|$|R
5000|$|SYD01 is a UHF Citizens Band (CB) {{repeater}} {{located in}} Hurstville, {{a suburb of}} Sydney, NSW, Australia. It was owned and operated for 10 years by long-time controversial CB operator and enthusiast, Jason Daniels, who {{is also known as}} JD. JD's voice could originally be heard on the SYD01 <b>voice</b> identification and <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> announcement every 10 minutes. There was also a [...] "quack" [...] sound on the dekey tail. The [...] "Quack" [...] was known as [...] "Chuck The Duck".|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 11 th International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD 2005) A command {{operator}} {{of fire and}} rescue units may {{need to pay attention}} to several radio calls in the coordination of simultaneous emergency missions. An experiment investigated command operators' ability to discern stereo and 3 D-audio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> presented in background noise of added voice sources. Each of 10 command operators listened to one to four <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> combined with two to four background voices, with the primary task to discriminate the <b>voice</b> of each <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> A secondary visual and manual response task induced an overall high mental workload. 3 D-audio presentation resulted in a slightly increased number of correctly identified <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> Four background <b>voices</b> reduced accuracy compared to two, and both three and four simultaneously presented <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> resulted in lower accuracy compared to sets of one and two, respectively. The results are discussed in relation to the potential for improving the 3 D-audio presentation aiming for increased intelligibility and operator effectiveness...|$|R
50|$|After {{undergoing}} restructuring {{during the}} period 1996-98, CBS broadcast to mainland China {{and the rest of}} the world under the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> Radio Taipei International and the Voice of Asia. Radio Taipei International essentially replaced the international radio services of the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), known as the Voice of Free China. Radio Taipei International broadcast to China and to an international audience; by contrast, the Voice of Asia was broadcast to the Asia-Pacific region only and offered a lighter format than RTI. In 2002 the <b>Voice</b> of Asia <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was dropped to leave Radio Taipei International as the sole broadcasting name for the service. This was in turn changed to Radio Taiwan International, to avoid confusion on the part of listeners, who had trouble associating Taipei with Taiwan.|$|R
50|$|Conventional ("tailhook") {{aircraft}} {{rely upon}} a landing signal officer (LSO, radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> paddles) to monitor the aircraft's approach, visually gauge glideslope, attitude, and airspeed, and transmit that data to the pilot. Before the angled deck emerged in the 1950s, LSOs used colored paddles to signal corrections to the pilot (hence the nickname). From the late 1950s onward, visual landing aids such as Optical Landing System have provided information on proper glide slope, but LSOs still transmit <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> to approaching pilots by radio.|$|R

5000|$|In most countries, the {{aircraft}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also known as registration marks) {{are linked to}} the international radio <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, {{the aircraft}} itself) receive <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian aircraft <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> (see below).|$|R
50|$|Amateur radio <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are {{allocated}} to amateur radio operators around the world. The <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used to}} legally identify the station or operator, with some countries requiring the station <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> to always be used and others allowing the operator <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> instead.|$|R
50|$|Military <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{assigned}} {{as unique}} identifiers to military communications. In wartime, monitoring an adversary's communications {{can be a}} valuable form of intelligence. Consistent <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> can aid in this monitoring, so in wartime, military units often employ tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and sometimes change them at regular intervals. In peacetime, some military stations will use fixed <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> in the international series.|$|R
50|$|The {{radio station}} {{has had the}} WAZX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> since 1993, when it changed from its long-time WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b> The WYNX <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> dates back to 1965 when the station {{switched}} to a Top 40 radio format from an MOR radio format and original <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> of WSMA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> in South America {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} identifying radio and TV stations. Argentina and Brazil both have broadcast <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> systems. Some stations still broadcast their <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> a few times a day, but this practice is becoming very rare. <b>Call</b> <b>signs</b> were first assigned to South American countries in 1913, and the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> blocks were expanded to include amateur radio in 1947.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{countries}} have specific conventions for classifying <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> by transmitter characteristics and location. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> format for {{radio and television}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> follows a number of conventions. All <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> begin with a prefix assigned by the International Telecommunications Union. For example, the United States has been assigned the following prefixes: [...] "AAA"-"ALZ", [...] "K", [...] "N", [...] "W". For a complete list, see international <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> allocations.|$|R

40|$|In this study, we aim {{to analyse}} the {{relationship}} between various characteristics of a communication system with data and <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> requests. Queuing theory and Markov chain analysis are effectively used for this purpose. Such a study is useful for understanding how the proposed mathematical models behave which represents a system with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> in homogenous wireless networks. We also propose to optimise the system characteristics {{in an attempt to}} provide better Quality of Service (QoS) for systems with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The proposed models have two dimensions; one for <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> and one for data calls. A channel is assigned for two input traffic <b>call,</b> namely, <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The incoming <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> are queued when the channel is busy. Since <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are delay-sensitive, priority is given to <b>voice</b> <b>calls.</b> Also, since there is only one channel, data calls are only serviced if there are no <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> in the system. For such systems, it is important to analyse the impact of buffering the <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> as well as data calls for various mean rates of call requests, and mean service times. The analytical models presented are generic which is applicable for various systems with similar characteristics. Numerical results are also provided. The results show that the proposed models can be used for optimisation of the performance of a given network...|$|R
50|$|The United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, and United States Coast Guard use {{a mixture}} of {{tactical}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> and international <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> beginning with the letter N. For example, the carrier USS John F. Kennedy had the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> NJFK for unclassified and navigation communications with other vessels, but uses tactical <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> that vary with its mission. In tactical situations, the Marine Corps utilizes <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> naming conventions similar to the Army's.|$|R
5000|$|Some aviators use {{the same}} <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{throughout}} their careers; in other cases an aviator might {{have a series of}} <b>call</b> <b>signs.</b> For example, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen was originally given the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Hulk" [...] because of her ability to bench-press 200 pounds. Later, after a television appearance in which she wore detectable makeup, she received the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> [...] "Revlon", and a 1998 biography was entitled <b>Call</b> <b>Sign</b> Revlon.|$|R
50|$|The station's <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{used to be}} CBJ-FM until 1999. At that time, that <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> {{started to}} be used by its sister station CBJ as it moved from AM to the FM band; that station got the <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> CBJ-FM, and the old CBJ-FM thus had to change its own <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Formerly one of {{the rarest}} <b>call</b> <b>signs,</b> [...] "Concorde", was once used to {{identify}} British Airways' Concorde aircraft. The intent of this <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was to raise the air traffic control operators' awareness of the unique performance of the aircraft and the special attention it required. The <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> was appended to British Airways' normal radio <b>call</b> <b>sign,</b> e.g. [...] "Speedbird-Concorde One". Air France, the only other airline to operate the Concorde commercially, {{did not use the}} [...] "Concorde" [...] <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> at all in normal service; its Concorde flights simply used the standard Airfrans <b>call</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R
50|$|Four-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are the norm. Three-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> {{are only}} {{permitted}} to CBC Radio stations or to commercial stations which {{already had a}} three-letter <b>call</b> <b>sign</b> before the current rules were adopted, and five-letter <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> exclusively identify CBC transmitters (which may be either rebroadcasters or Ici Radio-Canada Télé owned-and-operated stations outside of Quebec).|$|R
50|$|In Australia, {{broadcast}} <b>call</b> <b>signs</b> are optional, but are allocated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority and {{are unique}} for each broadcast station.
