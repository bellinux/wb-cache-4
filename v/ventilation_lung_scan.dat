40|$|Regional lung {{function}} {{has been studied}} with xenon- 133 in 25 adult patients with different types of heart disease. In cases of mitral and aortic valve disease, perfusion and ventilation tend to be shifted from the lung bases towards the apices, more markedly so when the pulmonary wedge pressure is elevated. The primum movens of these changes seem to be accumulation of extravascular lung water in the bases, the anatomical lesions of the vessels playing a complementary role. In cases of congenital heart disease the pulmonary artery pressure level also influences regional perfusion, whereas ventilation seems little affected. Nine children with complex congenital heart malformations were also studied with a krypton- 81 m <b>ventilation</b> <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> as well as classical perfusion scintigraphy.

40|$|Our consensus-based {{strategy}} in the diagnostic management of patients with pulmonary embolism involves a perfusion lung scan, a <b>ventilation</b> <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> compression ultrasonography and pulmonary angiography, in sequence. We compared the diagnostic approach in patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism before the active implementation of this strategy (retrospective analysis of 618 patients, April 1992 -March 1995) and after (prospective study of 250 patients, April 1995 -March 1996), with another assessment 1 year later. The measured outcomes were: (i) final diagnosis of pulmonary embolism either directly by pulmonary angiography, indirectly by compression ultrasonography of the leg veins, or with a high probability from a ventilation/perfusion lung scan; (ii) prescription of anticoagulant therapy. Before strategy implementation, pulmonary embolism was adequately confirmed or excluded in 11 % of patients with an abnormal perfusion lung scan; in 55 % the diagnosis remained uncertain, but the patient received anticoagulants.

Particle deposition and the degree of penetration differed between the two lungs with there being generally more deposition in the perihilar region of the right lung.

40|$|The {{clinical}} diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is highly nonspecific {{because none of}} the symptoms or signs of pulmonary embolism is unique and all {{may be caused by}} other cardiorespiratory disorders. Thus, objective testing is mandatory to either confirm or exclude a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Based on current available information, a diagnostic approach for the management of clinically suspected pulmonary embolism is proposed. After a history and physical examination, electrocardiogram and chest X-ray film, all patients should undergo perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scanning.</b> The finding of a normal perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> rules out clinically significant pulmonary embolism, and anticoagulant therapy is withheld. The management of patients with an abnormal perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> is more complex. If this scan demonstrates one or more segmental (or greater) perfusion defects, <b>ventilation</b> <b>lung</b> <b>scanning</b> should be performed because the probability of pulmonary embolism is markedly increased if a mismatch is found, with a high probability scan (positive predictive value 86 %) providing an end point for commencing anticoagulant therapy in the majority of patients. In an abnormal ventilationperfusion study, the presence of a ventilation-perfusion match does not rule out the possibility of pulmonary embolism, and further objective testing is required in these patients with nonhigh probability scans. Similarly, in patients with small perfusion defects (one or more subsegmental defects) or indeterminate <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> findings (in which the perfusion scan defects correspond to a defect on a chest X-ray film), the predictive values obtained from these ventilation-perfusion scan patterns are not sufficiently high or low to confirm or exclude the presence of pulmonary embolism. Alternative approaches are available that would reduce the need for pulmonary angiography in patients with abnormal but nonhigh probability ventilationperfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scans.</b> In these patients, venography or impedance plethysmography could be performed as the next step of the diagnostic evaluation. If the presence of deep vein thrombosis is confirmed by these tests, anticoagulant therapy can be commenced without the need to perform pulmonary angiography. If the tests are negative, pulmonary angiography is required to confirm {{the presence or absence of}} pulmonary embolism because a negative venogram occurs in up to 30 % of patients with pulmonary embolism by angiography and, therefore, may not be used to exclude venous thromboembolism. Other approaches (for example, serial impedance plethysmography) are being explored in selected patients...|$|R

Diagnosis was based on clinical probability assessment, plasma D-dimer testing, then sequential testing to include lower limb venous compression ultrasonography, <b>ventilation</b> perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> and chest multidetector CT (MDCT) imaging. METHODS: We included 321 consecutive patients presenting at Brest University Hospital in Brest, France, with clinically suspected PE and positive d-dimer or high clinical probability.

40|$|BACKGROUND—A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} usefulness of the SimpliRED D-dimer test, arterial oxygen tension, and respiratory rate measurement for excluding pulmonary embolism (PE) and venous thromboembolism (VTE).  METHODS—Lung scans were performed in 517 consecutive medical inpatients with suspected acute PE over a one year period. Predetermined end points for objectively diagnosed PE in order of precedence were (1) a post mortem diagnosis, (2) a positive pulmonary angiogram, (3) a high probability <b>ventilation</b> perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> when the pretest probability was also high, and (4) the unanimous opinion of an adjudication committee. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was diagnosed by standard ultrasound and venography.  RESULTS—A total of 40 cases of PE and 37 cases of DVT were objectively diagnosed. The predictive value of a negative SimpliRED test for excluding objectively diagnosed PE was 0. 99 (error rate 2 / 249), that of PaO 2 of ⩾ 80 mm Hg (10. 7 kPa) was 0. 97 (error rate 5 / 160), and that of a respiratory rate of ⩽ 20 /min was 0. 95 (error rate 14 / 308). The best combination of findings for excluding PE was a negative SimpliRED test and PaO 2 ⩾ 80 mm Hg, which gave a predictive value of 1. 0 (error rate 0 / 93). The predictive value of a negative SimpliRED test for excluding VTE was 0. 98 (error rate 5 / 249).  CONCLUSIONS—All three of these observations are helpful in excluding PE. When any two parameters were normal, PE was very unlikely. In patients with a negative SimpliRED test and PaO 2 of ⩾ 80 mm Hg a <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> is usually unnecessary. Application of this approach for triage in the preliminary assessment of suspected PE could lead to a reduced rate of false positive diagnoses and considerable resource savings. ...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionPulmonary Hypertension (PH) is {{frequent}} among {{elderly patients}} and frequently due to severe valve diseases or heart failure with decreased left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction. The part of other causes is less known. The {{aim of this}} prospective study {{is to determine the}} aetiology of PH in older patients with preserved LV ejection fraction and no valve disease. MethodsWe included prospectively patients over 70 years of age with LV ejection fraction > 50 %, no valve disease. PH was suspected during echocardiography and confirmed by pressure mesurements during right heart catheterization. Each patient had complementary tests (blood tests, pulmonary function tests, <b>ventilation</b> perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> chest CT, abdominal ultrasound scan), conditioned by the haemodynamic characteristics of PH, in order to determine its cause. ResultsBetween November 2010 and November 2011, we included 26 patients (17 women), 78 +/-years old, with peak systolic pulmonary pressure of 68 +/- 15 mmHg. Nine patients (35 %) had a precapillary PH. Among them, PH was the consequence of thromboembolism (n= 3), idiopathic (n= 3), due to a connective tissue disease (n= 1) and to a chronic lung disease (n= 2). Six patients (23 %), all with LV distolic dysfunction, had a post capillary PH. Two of them had previously undergone cardiac surgery for atrial septal defect and mitral valve remplacement. Eleven patients (42 %) had a reactive post capillary PH. PH was idiopathic in 2 cases and drug induced for one patient. We found 2 connective tissue diseases, one thromboembolic disease, 2 chronic lung diseases. Four patients had a LV distolic dysfunction. One patient had two causes of PH. When LV diastolic dysfunction was the only cause of PH, it was always associated with persistent atrial fibrillation. ConclusionReactive post capillary PH is predominant in elderly patients with preserved systolic LV function and no valve disease. The main cause of PH is diastolic dysfunction associated to atrial fibrillation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Recent {{findings}} have demonstrated a high frequency of activated protein C resistance in patients suffering from {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT). This abnormality has been related to a mutation in the factor V gene (at nucleotide position 1, 691, guanine to adenine [G [...] >A] substitution). AIM: To assess {{the frequency of the}} mutation in unselected inpatients with a proved DVT. To study the clinical characteristics of such patients. METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the hospital because of a clinical suspicion of DVT were eligible. Diagnosis of DVT with the help of venous ultrasound imaging or venography. <b>Ventilation</b> and perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> was performed in all patients, and interpreted according to the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis criteria; in patients with a low- or intermediate-probability <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> pulmonary angiography was requested. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed in patients with a proved DVT. A control group consisted of bone marrow volunteer donors. RESULTS: From July 1994 to November 1995, 165 patients were included. Thrombosis was considered as distal in 77 and proximal in 88; an associated pulmonary embolism (PE) was found in 75 patients. Of 165 patients, 24 (14. 5 %) showed the factor V gene mutation (95 % confidence interval, 9. 4 to 19. 8); the mutation was present in 3. 5 % of 200 bone marrow volunteer donors; odds ratio for having DVT {{in the presence of the}} mutation was 4. 1. No difference in the level of DVT, or the presence of an associated PE was observed according to the presence of the mutation. Patients with the mutation have a significantly more frequent history of DVT (p= 0. 04) and more previous reported episodes (1. 1 vs 0. 6; p= 0. 04). CONCLUSION: The factor V mutation is frequent in unselected DVT patients. No difference in the severity of the thrombosis episode was observed in these patients...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} and therapeutic management of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism. A prospective survey of the management of patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism {{was carried out in}} two teaching hospitals in Amsterdam, without the knowledge of the attending physicians. Use and timing of lung scintigraphy and other tests for venous thromboembolism, therapeutic consequences and duration of hospitalization were evaluated. Of 89 outpatients and 116 inpatients, 97 % of patients underwent <b>lung</b> scintigraphy. <b>Lung</b> <b>scan</b> results were normal in 51 % of outpatients and 20 % of directly admitted patients; high probability in 10 % and 22 % and non-diagnostic in 39 % and 58 %, respectively. Twenty-two outpatients were subsequently admitted (1 normal, 9 high-probability and 12 non-high-probability <b>lung</b> <b>scans).</b> Pulmonary angiography and tests for deep vein thrombosis were performed in 7 (10 %) and 21 (29 %) of admitted patients with a non-diagnostic <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> outcome, respectively. Of 138 admitted patients, 75 (54 %) received heparin for 5 or more days. All patients with high-probability <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> and none with a normal <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> received long-term anticoagulants. Of patients with non-diagnostic <b>lung</b> <b>scans,</b> therapeutic decisions were mainly based on clinical grounds, and 44 % were prescribed oral anticoagulants.

40|$|Laboratory {{findings}} {{were compared with}} <b>lung</b> <b>scans</b> in a prospective study of 260 patients undergoing ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) <b>lung</b> <b>scanning</b> for suspected pulmonary thromboembo-lism. The best discrimination between different <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> results {{was obtained from the}} level of plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation products, every patient with a scan indicating a high probability of thromboembolism having detectable levels. An acute phase response was demonstrated in patients with pulmonary thromboembolism by a raised neutrophil count and elevated levels of plasma fibrinogen and serum C-reactive protein. A normal level of serum C-reactive protein and/or plasma cross-linked fibrin degradation productions in blood taken within 4 days of onset of symptoms virtually excluded the diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism. Detection of free plasma DNA was not helpful in discriminating between groups with different <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> results. Discriminant analysis was used to assess the variables examined and to derive diagnostic models. An accuracy of 78 per cent was obtained with one model for classifying test patients according to the three <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> classes of low, intermediate and high probability. A second model, for distinguishing patients with a low and a high probability of pulmonary thromboembolism on the basis of <b>lung</b> <b>scans,</b> and a third for predicting those with a low probability on <b>lung</b> <b>scan,</b> were accurate in 94. 6 per cent and 83. 5 per cent of patients respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endobronchial {{radiotherapy}} by a {{high dose}} rate remote after-loading technique (high dose rate brachytherapy) has become an established treatment for major airway occlusion by inoperable carcinoma of the bronchus. Only limited objective data on its effect on pulmonary physiology and on radiographic and bronchoscopic appearances are available. The {{aim of this study}} was to make a detailed assessment of patients before and after high dose rate brachytherapy to determine which investigations were useful and to generate data for comparing this with other methods of treatment. METHODS: Twenty patients with major airway obstruction by inoperable lung cancer underwent a detailed assessment before receiving endobronchial radiotherapy (15 Gy at 1 cm in a single fraction) and six weeks after treatment. This included chest radiography, computed tomography of the thorax, bronchoscopy including an obstruction index, five minute walking tests, isotope <b>ventilation</b> and perfusion <b>lung</b> <b>scanning,</b> and full <b>lung</b> function tests with maximum inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (mean age 69 years) completed the study. Symptomatic improvement occurred in 17 patients. A collapsed lobe or lung, seen on the chest radiograph in 13, reexpanded in nine. Bronchoscopic appearances improved in 18, the mean obstruction index decreasing from 6. 2 to 2. 8. The isotope scans showed significant increases in the percentage of total <b>lung</b> <b>ventilation</b> (V) and perfusion (Q) measured over the abnormal lung (V 17. 7 % to 27. 7 %, Q 15. 1 to 21. 9 %). Five minute walking distance (305 to 329 m), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 1. 45 to 1. 61 l), forced vital capacity (FVC 2. 17 to 2. 48 l) and ratio of forced expiratory to forced inspiratory flow rate at 50 % vital capacity (FEF 50 /FIF 50 0. 58 to 0. 88) all increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial radiotherapy led to subjective benefit in most cases in terms of symptoms and bronchoscopic and radiological appearances. There was objective improvement in spirometric indices and in exercise tolerance with increased pulmonary ventilation and perfusion and evidence of decreased intrathoracic airway obstruction...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{management of}} pulmonary embolism and {{deep venous thrombosis}} of the legs are similar and requires prolonged anticoagulation therapy. The standard diagnostic approach in patients suspected of pulmonary embolism is ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and compression ultrasonography to detect deep venous thrombosis. This retrospective study analyzed the role of V/Q <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and compression ultrasonography in detection of thromboembolic disease. One hundred-twenty consecutive patients (65 female, 55 male) age range 18 - 95 (Mean age 60. 7) suspected for pulmonary embolism underwent concomitant V/Q <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> and compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities. The clinical and radiographic correlation was performed. Of patients with non-diagnostic (Low or intermediate probability) <b>lung</b> <b>scans,</b> 15. 4 % (14 / 91) received anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism. These patients had either high pre-clinical suspicion for PE or underwent pulmonary arteriogram. However, there was an additional 7 % (7 / 91) {{increase in the number}} of patients who received anticoagulation therapy based on the results of ultrasound with confidence interval (3 %- 16 %). We conclude that V/Q <b>lung</b> <b>scan</b> is a more sensitive examination for thromboembolic disease, and has a high negative predictive value.
