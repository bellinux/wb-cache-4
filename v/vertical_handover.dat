The protocol presentation goes with a review of the current propositions of security mechanisms and procedures dedicated to manage <b>vertical</b> <b>handovers.</b> From a critical analysis, the HetNets are positioned in the context of wireless security to describe the possible attacks that afflict this new kind of infrastructure. From this analysis, it is revealed that the different entities involved in the management of handovers are surrounded by new security challenges. This challenges and the positioning of HetNets helps to deliver a new suited protection. Securing <b>vertical</b> <b>handovers</b> means to deal with the different cryptographic algorithms from the security architecture of the different technologies that protect the sessions of communications. © 2013 SERSC.

40|$|Interworking {{heterogeneous}} {{wireless access}} technolo-gies {{is an important}} step towards building the next genera-tion, all-IP wireless access infrastructure. In this paper, we present an experimental study of inter-network mobility be-tween GPRS Cellular and 802. 11 b-based WLAN hot-spots, and analyse its impact on active transport TCP flows. Our experiments were conducted over a loosely-coupled, Mo-bile IPv 6 -based, GPRS-WLAN experimental testbed. De-tailed analysis from packet traces of inter-network (<b>vertical)</b> <b>handovers</b> reveals a number of performance bottlenecks. In particular, the disparity in the round trip time and band-width offered by GPRS and WLAN networks, and presence of deep buffers in GPRS, can aggravate performance dur-ing <b>vertical</b> <b>handovers.</b> This paper summerizes the practical experiences and challenges of providing transparent mobil-ity in heterogeneous environments. Based on our observations, we propose a number of network-layer handover optimisation techniques, e. g. Fast Router Advertisements (RA), RA Caching, Binding Update (BU) simulcasting and layer- 3 based soft handovers that improve performance during <b>vertical</b> <b>handovers.</b> The paper concludes with our experiences of migrating TCP connec-tions, and the impact that this has on applications such as ftp and web. 1...|$|R

This paper describes a generic, context-aware handover solution for multimedia applications and illustrates how this handover works for redirection of communication between WLANs and GPRS or UMTS networks.

50|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>handover</b> or {{vertical}} handoff {{refers to}} a network node changing the type of connectivity it uses to access a supporting infrastructure, usually to support node mobility. For example, a suitably equipped laptop {{might be able to}} use both a high speed wireless LAN and a cellular technology for Internet access. Wireless LAN connections generally provide higher speeds, while cellular technologies generally provide more ubiquitous coverage. Thus the laptop user might want to use a wireless LAN connection whenever one is available, and to 'fall over' to a cellular connection when the wireless LAN is unavailable. Vertical handovers refer to the automatic fallover from one technology to another in order to maintain communication. This is different from a 'horizontal handover' between different wireless access points that use the same technology in that a <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> involves changing the data link layer technology used to access the network.|$|E
50|$|For the <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> between UMTS and WLAN, {{there are}} two main {{interworking}} architecture: tight coupling and loose coupling.The tight coupling scheme, which 3GPP adopted, introduces two more elements: WAG (Wireless Access Gateway) and PDG (Packet Data Gateway). So the data transfers from WLAN AP to a Corresponding Node on the internet must go through the Core Network of UMTS.|$|E

The standard supports algorithms enabling seamless handover between networks {{of the same}} type as well as handover between different network types also called Media independent handover (MIH) or <b>vertical</b> <b>handover.</b> The standard provides information to allow handing over to and from 802.3, 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, 3GPP and 3GPP2 networks through different handover mechanisms.|$|E

5000|$|Because it is {{currently}} not possible to deploy wireless networks to cover all geographical areas with no [...] "dead spots", services are restricted in some areas.

In 5G, the concept may be further developed into multiple concurrent data-transfer paths.|$|E
50|$|In {{traditional}} handovers, {{such as a}} handover between cellular networks, the handover {{decision is}} based mainly on RSS (Received Signal Strength) in the border region of two cells, and may also be based on call drop rate, etc. for resource management reasons.In <b>vertical</b> <b>handover,</b> the situation is more complex. Two different kinds of wireless networks normally have incomparable signal strength metrics, for example, WLAN compared to UMTS. In, WLAN and UMTS networks both cover an area at the same time.The handover metrics in this situation should include RSS, user preference, network conditions, application types, cost etc.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 136 - 144). The {{rapid growth}} of mobile and wireless communication {{over the last few}} years has spawned many different wireless networks. These heterogeneous wireless networks are envisioned to interwork over an IP-based infrastructure to realize ubiquitous network service provisioning for mobile users. Moreover, the availability of multiple-interface mobile nodes (MNs) will make it possible to communicate through any of these wireless access networks. This wireless network heterogeneity combined with the availability of multiple-interface MNs creates an environment where handovers between the different wireless access technologies become topical during mobility events. Therefore, operators with multiple interworking heterogeneous wireless networks will need to facilitate seamless <b>vertical</b> <b>handovers</b> among their multiple systems. Seamless <b>vertical</b> <b>handovers</b> ensure ubiquitous continuity to active connections hence satisfy the quality of experience of the mobile users...|$|R

40|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> {{decision}} {{strategy in}} the heterogeneous wireless networks is very challenging issue because it needs to deal with many different radio access networks and make decisions for <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> calls between them. Due to traffic offloading the decisions for vertical handovers to WLAN hotspots in heterogeneous wireless networks are very important because they impact the QoS of the mobile users, especially when they are using real-time services. In this paper we propose <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> decision algorithm from WiMAX to WLAN networks based on the user’s speed and session’s priority (non-real-time or real-time service) of the mobile nodes. We use the IEEE 802. 21 standard as a layout for implementing the algorithm. The implementation of our handover algorithm avoids unnecessary <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> from WiMAX to WLAN in scenarios with various traffic types and speeds of the mobile nodes.

40|$|Abstract Wireless {{network devices}} are {{equipped}} with mul-tiple access technologies like UMTS and Wireless LAN. The handover between the technologies has been widely studied in literature. Several of these research papers build their handover mechanisms on top of existing protocols like Mobile IP. The protocols however, operate on the network layer and only react on link layer changes. Consequently, a seamless <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> between Wireless LAN and UMTS cannot be provided. In this paper, we introduce a <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> protocol based on a tight-coupled network architecture. With this architecture, {{it is possible to}} perform the handover on the link layer and thus, reducing the handover delays. The protocol is implemented in a simulation environment and the results reveal that a seamless <b>vertical</b> <b>handover</b> can be performed, with blackout times of only a few milliseconds.

In big cities the densely populated areas like town centres, shopping centres and train stations which have coverage of multiple {{wireless network}}s, {{a large number of}} mobile users may be connected to the more common UMTS, thereby creating an unbalanced load across these wireless networks.
