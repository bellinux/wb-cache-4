40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2005 Medicare paid over $ 1. 4 billion <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> services. These services are generally provided by anesthesia practitioners, such as anesthesiologists and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs). A government-sponsored study found that Medicare payments <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> services are lower than private payments. Congress is concerned that this difference may create regional discrepancies in the supply of anesthesia practitioners, and asked GAO to explore this issue. GAO examined (1) {{the extent to which}} Medicare payments <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> services were lower than private payments across Medicare payment localities in 2004, (2) whether the supply of anesthesia practitioners across Medicare payment localities in 2004 was related to the differences between Medicare and private payments <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> services or the concentration of Medicare beneficiaries, and (3) compensation levels <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> practitioners in 2005 and trends in graduate training. GAO used claims data from two anesthesia service billing companies that bill private insurance payers and Medicare to calculate payments by payer <b>for</b> seven <b>anesthesia</b> services in 41 Medicare payment localities. GAO also used data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and other sources to determine practitioner supply and Medicare beneficiary concentration in 87 Medicare payment localities. ...|$|R

50|$|Once the incisions {{are made}} by the tracheotome and the stomas are accessible, tracheotome tubes are placed in the trachea to provide oxygen to the lungs. Tubes have also been {{improved}} to reduce complications of infection and tissue damage. For instance, Alain Milhay from Amiens, France, invented a tracheotomy tube with shield <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> in 1983. This tube included a conduit <b>for</b> passing on <b>anesthesia</b> and ventilation gases. At the time, other tubes were also been implemented <b>for</b> <b>anesthesia</b> application but their material composition was toxic and could give off caustic or toxic vapors.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that local anesthetics, {{arterial}} catheters and central venous catheters cause a higher risk in haematoma formation in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
