40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} takes {{theories of}} voice-over narration that are typically applied to fiction film and applies them to documentary film. It looks at issues of representation and truth {{values in the}} documentary films of Werner Herzog, John Marshall, Luis Buñuel and Karin Jurshcick. It argues that the choices filmmakers make regarding types of <b>voice-over</b> affect <b>these</b> issues and are therefore worthy of study. It argues that the unconventional story-weavers in documentaries like those of Marshall and Herzog‘s can inadvertently marginalise their subjects. It looks at Buñuel‘s Land Without Bread as an extreme example of an (intentionally) manipulative narrator. It suggests that a voice-over narrator that follows Chion‘s conceptualisation of the complete acousmêtre encourages audiences to engage on a more critical level. Finally, it argues that even a seemingly traditional narrator as seen in Jurshick‘sIt Should Have Been Nice After That can be unconventional and reveal an - ecstatic truth...|$|R

This includes starring in the sequel, Mulan 2, the former Mulan parade, and a trove of theme park attractions, TV shows and pilots, and video games, for example, the Square Enix game Kingdom Hearts II. He also voiced several characters in Shrek 2, and sang in Murphys place in the Shrek extra ending, Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party and Donkey in the Shrek video games. Moseley has also sound-doubled Arnold Schwarzenegger, most notably in the video game Terminator 3: The Redemption, in which Moseleys voice is often heard side-by-side with Schwarzeneggers original recordings for the previous Terminator game. Moseley has appeared on numerous hit TV series-mostly in <b>voice-over</b> roles. <b>These</b> include The Fairly OddParents, The Sopranos, The PJs, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, My Life as a Teenage Robot, Father of the Pride, Disneys House of Mouse, and others.|$|R
40|$|The femme fatale is {{a marker}} {{for the past}} {{is evident in the}} film noir work of German exile {{directors}}. These directors created a femme fatale character similar to Weimar examples of the sexual woman icon, using Weimar cultural constructions as a template for their work in Hollywood. The femme fatale figure in film noir is specifically an enigma or duplicitous mystery, a woman with a gun who threatens the male protagonist. She represents a piece of the male character's past often seen through the structure of the <b>voice-over</b> and flashback. <b>These</b> narrative devices enable the male protagonist to rework this jaded past vis-a-vis his relationship to the femme fatale and his fatal attraction to her. The film noir femme fatale is linked to German exile directors' desire to review a past that has been lost and cannot be recuperated. In the case of the Weimar femme fatale, she is a sign for the trauma of World War I and the ensuing political/social crises of the Weimar republic. The femme fatale in her castrating capacity is a marker for historical upheaval and male subjectivity in flux. She is ultimately the scapegoat for male questions of self and a split subjectivity brought on by historical events such as war and the experience of exile. Her various guises include the criminal woman, the technological entity, and the double...|$|R
