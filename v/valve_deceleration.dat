40|$|Background Nitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} shown to affect {{myocardial}} function in positive and negative inotropic ways. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and release of nitric oxide into the circulation has been associated with acute rejection in animal studies. The role of NO and the associated myocardial dysfunction seen during acute rejection in humans has not been adequately defined. In a prospective sequential study, we have studied the relationship between plasma nitrate and biopsy-proven acute rejection, and systolic and diastolic function after heart transplantation. Methods Biopsies were performed weekly and then fortnightly up to 12 weeks after transplantation and on clinical indication of rejection in 37 patients. Plasma nitrates were obtained on the morning of each biopsy (total 341). An echocardiogram was performed immediately prior to each biopsy in which the systolic parameters, ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (fs), and the diastolic parameters, isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), mitral valve pressure half-time (MVPHT), mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (MVDT), e:a ratio, and a wave duration, were measured. Results Plasma-nitrate level showed no significant correlation with the systolic parameters, EF or fs, or with changes in EF or fs. No significant correlation was found between plasma-nitrate level and the diastolic parameters IVRT, MVPHT, MVDT, mitral valve a wave duration, or e:a ratio. Conclusions This study has shown no correlation between plasma nitrate and impaired systolic or diastolic function after heart transplantation. Instead there was a weak trend for elevated nitrate to be associated with better systolic function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is strongly}} associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, derived in part from impairment of sympathetic nervous system signaling. Glucose, insulin, and non-esterified fatty acids are potent stimulants of sympathetic activity and norepinephrine (NE) release. We hypothesized that sustained hyperglycemia in the high fat diet-fed streptozotocin (STZ) rat model of sustained hyperglycemia with insulin resistance would exhibit progressive sympathetic nervous dysfunction in parallel with deteriorating myocardial systolic and/or diastolic function. Methods Cardiac sympathetic nervous integrity was investigated in vivo via biodistribution of the positron emission tomography radiotracer and NE analogue [11 C] meta- hydroxyephedrine ([11 C]HED). Cardiac systolic and diastolic function was evaluated by echocardiography. Plasma and cardiac NE levels and NE reuptake transporter (NET) expression were evaluated as correlative measurements. Results The animal model displays insulin resistance, sustained hyperglycemia, and progressive hypoinsulinemia. After 8 weeks of persistent hyperglycemia, {{there was a significant}} 13 - 25 % reduction in [11 C]HED retention in myocardium of STZ-treated hyperglycemic but not euglycemic rats as compared to controls. There was a parallel 17 % reduction in immunoblot density for NE reuptake transporter, a 1. 2 fold and 2. 5 fold elevation of cardiac and plasma NE respectively, and no change in sympathetic nerve density. No change in ejection fraction or fractional area change was detected by echocardiography. Reduced heart rate, prolonged mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time, and elevated transmitral early to atrial flow velocity ratio measured by pulse-wave Doppler in hyperglycemic rats suggest diastolic impairment of the left ventricle. Conclusions Taken together, these data suggest that sustained hyperglycemia is associated with elevated myocardial NE content and dysregulation of sympathetic nervous system signaling in the absence of systolic impairment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} aims {{to study the}} {{relationship}} between tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) indices of right ventricle and exercise capacity in patients after total correction for tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included 20 patients, after undergoing total correction procedure for ToF diagnosed with mild/moderate pulmonary regurgitation and 30 age-matched healthy children. In the postoperative period, patients were invited to hospital for evaluation of the ventricular functions by 2 D, M-mode, Doppler (DE) echocardiography and TDE and exercise testing to evaluate the effort capacity. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests, and Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Compared with the controls; the mitral annular peak systolic flow velocity (Sm) value was significantly lower, while isovolumic contraction time (IVCT), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and myocardial performance index (MPI) values obtained at the tricuspid and mitral (MV) valves were significantly higher (p< 0. 05 for all) in patients after ToF repair. There was a negative correlation between the exercise period and the total correction age (r=- 0. 20, p= 0. 015) and the same negative correlation existed between the exercise period and METS (r=- 0. 25, p= 0. 010). MV IVCT with DE and TDE {{was found to be}} correlated with METS (r=- 0. 45, p= 0. 04). Left ventricular MPI was found to be correlated with maximum heart rate (r=- 0. 20, p= 0. 03). By DE, tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time and Sm peak flow velocity with TDE were significantly correlated with METS (r=- 0. 30, p= 0. 04; r=- 025, p= 0. 005, respectively). MPI calculated with TDE was correlated with maximum heart rate (r=- 0. 15, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Even if patients, undergone total correction surgery for ToF were asymptomatic or had minimal clinical symptoms, MPI index assessed by pulse wave TDE and exercise testing may allow early diagnosis of right ventricle dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|The ovine {{model is}} {{generally}} considered to be the best for testing bioprosthetic heart valve durability. Although echocardiography is the method of choice for the interim evaluation of the valve, literature on sheep echocardiography is scarce. Within the context of a study on treatment of pericardial heart valve prostheses, 19 adolescent sheep underwent transthoracic echocardiography six days after mitral implantation of bioprosthetic valves. Echocardiographic examination was performed under mild anesthesia and animals were put in a right lateral decubitus position. Four images were obtained: right parasternal long axis four and five chamber views, right parasternal long axis view with left ventricular outflow, and right parasternal short axis view through the mitral valve. We measured aortic annulus and velocity time integral over the aortic valve to determine stroke volume, cardiac output and cardiac index. The mitral valve was evaluated through color Doppler imaging for valvular and paravalvular leakages. Pulsed wave spectral Doppler was used for the measurement of velocities, pressures and velocity time integrals. For the evaluation of <b>valve</b> stenosis <b>deceleration</b> time and pressure half-time were determined. Effective orifice area of the mitral valve was derived. And, although not measured, other structures could clearly be visualized: right and left ventricle and atrium, wall thicknesses, tricuspid valve. This study shows that echocardiography in sheep is feasible, and that right parasternal images, obtained in animals in a right lateral decubitus position, are well qualified for the interim evaluation of bioprosthetic valves implanted in the mitral position. Besides the implanted valve, other cardiac structures like atria and ventricles can be visualized and evaluated. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Catheter-based {{sympathetic}} renal denervation (RDN) is {{a recent}} therapeutic option for patients with resistant hypertension. However, the impact of RDN in left ventricular (LV) mass and function is not completely established. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of RDN on LV structure and function (systolic and diastolic) in patients with resistant hypertension (HTN). From a single centre prospective registry including 65 consecutive patients with resistant HTN submitted to RDN between July- 2011 and April- 2015, 31 patients with baseline and 1 -year follow-up echocardiogram were included in this analysis. Mean age was 65 ± 7 years, 48 % were males, 71 % had type 2 diabetes. Most had hypertension lasting for more than 10 years (90 %), and were being treated with a median number of 6 anti-hypertensive drugs, including 74 % on spironolactone. At 1 -year, {{there was a significant}} decrease both on office SBP (176 ± 24 to 149 ± 13 mmHg, p< 0. 001) and DBP (90 ± 14 to 79 ± 11 mmHg, p< 0. 001), and also in 24 h ABPM SBP (150 ± 20 to 132 ± 14 mmhg, p< 0. 001) and DBP (83 ± 10 to 74 ± 9 mmHg, p< 0. 001). There was also a significant decrease in LV mass from 152 ± 32 to 136 ± 34 g/m(2) (p< 0. 001), an increase in LV end diastolic volume (93 ± 18 to 111 ± 27 mL, p = 0. 004), an increase in LV ejection fraction (65 ± 9 to 68 ± 9 %, p = 0. 001) and mitral <b>valve</b> E <b>deceleration</b> time (225 ± 49 to 247 ± 51 ms, p = 0. 015) at 1 -year follow up. There were no significant changes in left atrium volume index or in the distribution of patients among the different left ventricle geometric patterns and diastolic function subgroups. In this single centre registry of patients with resistant hypertension, renal denervation was associated with significant reduction in both office and ABPM blood pressure and a significant decrease in left ventricle mass evaluated by transthoracic echocardiogram at 1 year follow-up...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assessed}} the hemodynamic performance and calcification {{potential of a}} new design of bovine pericardial valve, the Trilogy valve (Arbor Surgical Technologies Inc, Irvine, CA). We compared this new valve with the Perimount valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) in a randomized prospective study in adolescent sheep. METHODS: Nine Trilogy valves (size 21) and six Perimount valves (size 23 or 25) were implanted in the mitral position in adolescent sheep and studied during five months. Hemodynamic measurements were performed at one week, three months, and five months using transthoracic echocardiography. Valve calcification was assessed by X-ray and calcium content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry after five months implantation in sheep. Tissues were also evaluated histologically (Von Kossa staining). RESULTS: The nine Trilogy valves had lower peak velocity, peak gradient, and mean gradient compared with the six Perimount valves. These 21 -mm Trilogy <b>valves</b> had similar <b>deceleration</b> time and effective orifice area compared with the 23 - and 25 -mm Perimount valves. Calcification of the Trilogy valves was significantly lower than Perimount valves (p < 0. 01), particularly in the commissural (p < 0. 01) and free margin regions (p < 0. 03). In all parameters assessed, the Trilogy valves exhibited less variation valve-to-valve compared with Perimount valves. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a valve designed to reduce stress in the tissue, improve leaflet kinematics, with advanced antimineralization treatment, can exhibit superior calcification resistance in the mitral position of adolescent sheep. The trilobal geometry and independent leaflet suspension design, combined with an advanced tissue treatment, {{appears to be a}} promising breakthrough in the effort to develop a more durable and hemodynamically efficient bioprosthetic valve. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} the effect of prolonged cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Background. Cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation results in cessation of forward blood flow, including myocardial blood flow. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, myocardial blood flow remains suboptimal. Once the heart is defibrillated and successful resuscitation achieved, reversible myocardial dysfunction, or “stunning,” may occur. The magnitude and time course of myocardial stunning from cardiac arrest is unknown. Methods. Twenty-eight domestic swine (26 ± 1 kg) were studied with both invasive and noninvasive measurements of ventricular function before and after 10 or 15 min of untreated cardiac arrest. Contrast left ventriculograms, ventricular pressures, cardiac output, isovolumetric relaxation time (tau) and transthoracic Doppler-echocardiographic studies were obtained. Results. Twenty-three of 28 animals were successfully resuscitated and postresuscitation data obtained. Left ventricular ejection fraction showed a significant reduction 30 min after resuscitation (p < 0. 05). Regional wall motion analysis revealed diffuse, global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly in the postresuscitation period (p < 0. 05). Isovolumetric relaxation time (tau) was significantly increased over baseline by 2 h after resuscitation (p < 0. 05). Similar findings were noted with the Doppler-echocardiographic analysis, including a reduction in fractional shortening (p < 0. 05), a reduction in mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (p < 0. 05) {{and an increase in}} left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time in 5 h after resuscitation (p < 0. 05). By 24 h, these invasive and noninvasive variables of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function had begun to improve. At 48 h, all measures of left ventricular function had returned to baseline levels. Conclusions. Myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction is severe after 10 to 15 min of untreated cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. Full recovery of this postresuscitation myocardial stunning is seen by 48 h in this experimental model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart {{failure is}} {{associated}} with abnormalities of myocardial structure, and plasma levels of the advanced glycation end-product (AGE) N(ε) -(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) correlate with the severity and prognosis of heart failure. Aging {{is associated with}} diastolic dysfunction and increased risk of heart failure, and we investigated the hypothesis that diastolic dysfunction of aging humans is associated with altered myocardial structure and plasma AGE levels. METHODS: We performed histological analysis of non-ischemic left ventricular myocardial biopsies and measured plasma levels of the AGEs CML and low molecular weight fluorophores (LMWFs) in 26 men undergoing {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery who had transthoracic echocardiography before surgery. None had previous cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure. RESULTS: The patients were aged 43 - 78 years and increasing age was associated with echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction, with higher mitral Doppler flow velocity A wave (r =  0. 50, P =  0. 02), lower mitral E/A wave ratio (r =  0. 64, P =  0. 001), longer mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (r =  0. 42, P =  0. 03) and lower early diastolic peak velocity of the mitral septal annulus, e' (r =  0. 55, P =  0. 008). However, neither mitral E/A ratio nor mitral septal e' was correlated with myocardial total, interstitial or perivascular fibrosis (picrosirius red), immunostaining for collagens I and III, CML, and receptor for AGEs (RAGE), cardiomyocyte width, capillary length density, diffusion radius or arteriolar dimensions. Plasma AGE levels were not associated with age. However, plasma CML levels were associated with E/A ratio (r =  0. 44, P =  0. 04) and e' (r =  0. 51, P =  0. 02) and LMWF levels were associated with E/A ratio (r =  0. 49, P =  0. 02). Moreover, the mitral E/A ratio remained correlated with plasma LMWF levels in all patients (P =  0. 04) and the mitral septal e' remained correlated with plasma CML levels in non-diabetic patients (P =  0. 007) when age was a covariate. CONCLUSIONS: Diastolic dysfunction of aging was independent of myocardial structure but was associated with plasma AGE levels. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis of {{diabetes}} mellitus, presence of hyperglycemia, and/or insulin resistance confer cardiovascular risk, particularly for diastolic dysfunction. Diabetes {{is associated with}} elevated myocardial norepinephrine (NE) content, enhanced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, altered resting heart rate, and depressed heart rate variability. Positron emission tomography (PET) using the NE analogue [11 C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ([11 C]HED) provides an index of myocardial sympathetic neuronal integrity at the NE reuptake transporter (NET). The hypothesis of this project is that (i) hyperglycemia imparts heightened sympathetic tone and NE release, leading to abnormal sympathetic neuronal function {{in the hearts of}} diabetic rats, and (ii) these abnormalities may be reversed or prevented by treatments to normalize glycemia. Sprague Dawley rats were rendered insulin resistant by high fat feeding and diabetic by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic rats were treated for 8 weeks with insulin, metformin or rosiglitazone, starting from either 1 week (prevention) or 8 weeks (reversal) after STZ administration. Sympathetic neuronal integrity was evaluated longitudinally by [11 C]HED PET. Echocardiography measures of systolic and diastolic function were completed at serial timepoints. Plasma NE levels were evaluated serially and expression of NET and β-adrenoceptors were tested at the terminal endpoints. Diabetic rats exhibited a 52 - 57 % reduction of [11 C]HED standardized uptake value (SUV) at 8 weeks after STZ, with a parallel 2. 5 -fold elevation of plasma NE and a 17 - 20 % reduction in cardiac NET expression. These findings were confirmed by ex vivo biodistribution studies. Transmitral pulse wave Doppler echocardiography established an extension of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time and elevated early to atrial velocity ratio, suggesting diastolic dysfunction. Subsequent treatment with insulin but not metformin restored glycemia, reduced plasma NE by 50 %, normalized NET expression, and recovered [11 C]HED SUV towards non-diabetic age-matched control. Diastolic dysfunction in these rats persisted. By contrast, early treatment with insulin, metformin, or rosiglitazone delayed the progression of diastolic dysfunction, but had no effect on elevated NE and reduced [11 C]HED SUV in diabetic rats, potentially owing to a latent decrease in blood glucose. In conclusion, diabetes is associated with heightened circulating and tissue NE levels which can be effectively reversed by lowering glycemia with insulin. Noninvasive interrogation of sympathetic neuronal integrity using [11 C]HED PET may have added value in the stratification of cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients and in determining the myocardial effects of glycemic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Puberty is {{accompanied}} by significant changes in hemodynamics that can influence interpretation of clinical states. However {{the extent to which}} this is influenced by the nutritional status of children is poorly understood. To study the changes in cardiac dimensions with onset of early puberty and their relation to growth and nutritional status in females. Methods: Survey was conducted for 200 schools girls aged 9 – 12  years including full cardiac exam, blood pressure (BP), weight-for-age (W/A), height-for-age (H/A) and body mass index (BMI) and echocardiography for aortic, atrial and ventricular dimensions, as well pressure gradients and flow velocities. Further analysis was conducted for forty cases that were identified with flow abnormalities. Findings: Only 17. 5 % had audible murmurs. Mean BP ranged from 90. 4 in the 9  years olds, 94 in the 10  year olds, 95. 9 in the 11  year olds and 97. 5 in the 12  year olds. Morphologic dimensions were measured for the ventricles, left atria (LA) and aorta (Ao). Aortic dimensions increased with the onset of puberty and correlated with the BMI increase, but the mean aortic to left atrial dimensions were unchanged with puberty onset. Also ventricular dimensions did not change with puberty. The E wave of the mitral <b>valve</b> signal and <b>deceleration</b> velocity showed some change with age, with an exaggerated E wave. BMI averaged 17. 1 at 9  years increasing to 21 at 12  years. Underweight (− 2 SDS) occurred in 22. 5 % and stunting (− 2 SDS) in 10 % and wasting (underweight for height) in 17. 5 %. Fifty percent of the children were exposed to passive smoking from family member, 69. 2 % did not consume a healthy diet and 97 % did not practice sports. Conclusions: Onset of puberty {{is accompanied}} by an increase in aortic dimensions to cope with the increased venous return from the developing body systems. Growth disturbances may result in echo abnormalities in flow across the cardiac valves. Improving nutritional status and healthy living lifestyles of children in this period may prevent abnormalities and restore hemodynamics of the heart...|$|R
40|$|Glucocorticoid {{production}} by {{the adrenal gland}} is regulated by hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Within cells, glucocorticoid levels are modulated by 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 β-HSD), which interconverts active and intrinsically inert glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have widespread physiological effects and, in the cardiovascular system, they {{play a crucial role}} in heart development and maturation, blood pressure control, and myocardial calcium cycling. Mice which are unable to regenerate the physiological glucocorticoid, corticosterone, from 11 -dehydrocorticosterone due to deletion of the type 1 11 β-HSD isozyme (11 β-HSD 1) have previously been shown to have smaller, lighter hearts but unaltered systolic function. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Hsd 11 b 1 gene has been associated with reduced left ventricular mass in humans, suggesting a role for 11 β-HSD 1 in regulating cardiac size. After myocardial infarction (MI), 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice have an augmented inflammatory response, increased numbers of pro-reparative alternatively-activated macrophages in the heart, enhanced peri-infarct angiogenesis and improved cardiac function compared to C 57 BL/ 6 controls. However, the role of ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 in the development of these phenotypes, both basally and after MI, is unknown. It was hypothesised that ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency would result in smaller hearts, and that this selective deletion would lead to altered calcium handling protein expression and diastolic abnormalities. Furthermore, it was hypothesised that ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 deletion would reproduce the beneficial post-MI phenotype previously seen in global 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice. The first aim was to characterise the cardiac phenotype of mice with global deletion of 11 β-HSD 1 (DelI mice), and mice in which deletion is restricted to cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMAC mice). SMAC mice have ‘floxed’ 11 β- HSD 1 alleles and a Cre recombinase transgene inserted into the Sm 22 α gene. Sm 22 α is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and transiently in cardiomyocytes during development. Thus, Cre expression in these cells results in deletion of exon three of the Hsd 11 b 1 gene and gives rise to a non-functional protein. Controls for DelI mice were C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and controls for SMAC mice were their Cre- littermates. DelI, but not SMAC, mice have smaller, lighter hearts, which may be explained by their shorter cardiomyocytes measured following isolation using a Langendorff preparation. Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area is unchanged. In vivo measurement of cardiac function using ultrasound imaging showed systolic function is comparable between DelI mice and SMAC mice and their respective controls. However, there is mild diastolic dysfunction in both DelI and SMAC mice, characterised by reduced E wave deceleration and an increased mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time. This phenotype occurred following pharmacological inhibition of 11 β-HSD 1, by administration of UE 2316, a selective 11 β-HSD 1 inhibitor, to adult C 57 BL 6 /SJL mice. While ventricular collagen content is unaltered in DelI, SMAC and UE 2316 -treated mice compared to their respective controls, expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase (SERCA) is reduced, suggesting that altered calcium handling, rather than changes in stiffness, may underlie this phenotype. The second aim was to determine whether the beneficial acute outcomes seen previously in 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice after MI could be reproduced by selective cardiovascular deletion of the enzyme. Seven days after MI, compared to Cre- littermate controls, SMAC mice have similar peri-infarct angiogenesis, total macrophage and alternatively-activated macrophage infiltration into the heart, infarct size, ventricular dilatation and systolic function. This suggests 11 β-HSD 1 deletion in another cell type, or types, is responsible for the phenotype seen in global 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice. The final aim was to assess the impact of global 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency and ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 deletion on the development of heart failure, using magnetic resonance imaging to determine structure and function. Eight weeks after MI, mice globally deficient in 11 β-HSD 1 have attenuated expression of ANP and β- MHC, RNA markers of heart failure, and show attenuated pulmonary oedema, reduced chamber dilatation, preserved systolic function and smaller infarcts compared to control. None of these parameters are altered in SMAC mice relative to control. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis shows that cardiovascular 11 β-HSD 1 influences physiological cardiac function, potentially through regulation of calcium handling. 11 β-HSD 1 in other cells influences cardiomyocyte length, resulting in smaller hearts in its absence. Despite this, global 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency prevents heart failure development after MI, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of 11 β-HSD 1 may be of benefit in treating this condition. Cardiovascular 11 β-HSD 1 does not, however, account for the changes in infarct healing or remodelling associated with this beneficial outcome, therefore these effects must be related to 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency elsewhere, such as fibroblasts or myeloid cells...|$|E
