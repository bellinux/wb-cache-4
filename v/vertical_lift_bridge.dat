5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers widened, straightened, and deepened the canal. As part {{of their}} work, the agency {{constructed}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> across the canal. Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle turns in Chesapeake City. The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> on July 28, 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission established a ferry service across the canal. Between 1946 and 1949, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present tied arch Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, plans for reopening the Staten Island Rapid Transit line in New Jersey were {{announced}} by the New York Port Authority. Since the Central Railroad of New Jersey became a New Jersey Transit line, a new junction would be built to the former Lehigh Valley Railroad. In order for all New England and southern freight {{to pass through the}} New York metropolitan area, a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and a rail tunnel from Brooklyn to Greenville, New Jersey were planned. On December 15, 2004, a $72 million project to reactivate freight service on Staten Island and to repair the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> was {{announced by the}} NYCEDC and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Specific projects on the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> included repainting the steel superstructure and rehabilitating the lift mechanism. In June 2006, the freight line connection from New Jersey to the Staten Island Railway was completed, and became operated in part by the Morristown and Erie Railway under contract with the State of New Jersey and other companies.|$|E
5|$|The Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> was renovated in 2006 {{and began}} regular service on April 2, 2007, sixteen {{years after the}} bridge closed.

5|$|In November 1957, the Arthur Kill {{swing bridge}} was damaged by an Esso oil tanker, and was {{replaced}} by a state-of-the-art, single track, 558 foot <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> in 1959. The 2,000 ton lift span was prefabricated, then floated into place. The new bridge was raised 135 feet and since the new bridge aided navigation on the Arthur Kill, the United States government assumed 90 percent of the $11 million cost of the project. Freight trains started crossing the bridge when it opened on August 25, 1959.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the Saint Lawrence Seaway {{required}} {{the construction of}} twin <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridges</b> replacing the exising fixed spans.

5|$|Beyond West Brighton near a NYCDEP water {{pollution}} control facility, the line rose onto a reinforced concrete trestle {{known as the}} Port Richmond Viaduct, crossing Bodine Creek and running for about a mile through the Port Richmond neighborhood. West of Nicholas Avenue near Port Richmond High School, the line entered an open cut, crossing under the Bayonne Bridge approach and continued west to the Arlington Yard and station at South Avenue. Rapid transit service continued via a northern spur to Port Ivory; freight service passed the current Howland Hook Marine Terminal (adjacent to Port Ivory) and crossed the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> to Cranford Junction in New Jersey. The right-of-way from the Port Richmond Viaduct to Arlington Yard has remained intact and in good condition, though the former station sites and infrastructure are dilapidated and need rehabilitation or replacement should passenger service be reactivated.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, US 213 was realigned {{to cross}} the Choptank River at Cambridge on the Emerson C. Harrington Bridge that opened in 1935. The route {{replaced}} MD 344 between Vienna and Mount Holly, ran concurrent with MD 16 between Mount Holly and Cambridge, and turned north across the river to continue to Easton. The former routing of US 213 between Vienna and Easton became MD 331. Also, US 213 was relocated to a new alignment to the north between West Ocean City and Ocean City. In 1939, the road between US 40 and the northern terminus of US 213 in Elkton and the Pennsylvania border north of Fair Hill was designated MD 280. The portion of MD 280 between Fair Hill and the Pennsylvania border was built as a state highway by 1933. On July 28, 1942, the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> carrying US 213 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, built in 1927, was destroyed when the tanker Franz Klasen struck it. The destroyed bridge {{was replaced by the}} current Chesapeake City Bridge, which opened in 1949. The approaches to the original bridge are now designated as MD 537 and a western extension of MD 285. A portion of US 213 south of Easton was moved to a straight alignment by 1946; the former routing became MD 565. By 1946, work was underway for a bypass to the east of Easton along with a straight alignment between Easton and Wye Mills. US 213 was moved to this new alignment in 1948, with the former alignment on Washington Street in Easton becoming an extended MD 333 {{in the southern part of}} the city and an extended MD 33 in the northern part the city, while MD 662 was designated on the original alignment between Easton and Wye Mills.|$|E
5|$|On October 21, 1957, {{four years}} after North Shore Branch {{passenger}} trains ended, the very last SIRT special—a train from Washington carrying Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to the Staten Island Ferry from a state meeting in Washington, D.C. with President Eisenhower—crossed the Arthur Kill <b>Vertical</b> <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge.</b> There was a royal train and a press train and they traveled over the Reading Railroad and the B to get to Camp Kilmer in New Jersey. Since British royalty was being transported, the movement was done in secrecy with high security. The trains reached the Camp by traveling via the Port Reading Branch of the Reading Railroad. In order to travel to Staten Island, which required traveling over the Arthur Kill swing bridge, the two trains had to be reconfigured. Done at the Camp, the two diesel locomotives in the front were dropped from the two consists, allowing the trains to pass over the bridge, which had a limited load capacity. Awaiting {{the return of the}} equipment from Staten Island, the two diesel trains were sent to Cranford Junction. On the morning of October 21, the press train, consisting of 10 cars, left the Camp in New Jersey and traveled to the SIRT via the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The royal train, which was constructed by Pullman Standard, followed an hour later. These two trains terminated at the Stapleton freight yard, which was cleaned up for the occasion. Each of the trains were hauled back to Cranford Junction by a SIRT switcher after the Queen's motorcade left the yard. The trains, that afternoon, then went south to Baltimore.|$|E
50|$|The old {{alignment}} {{was originally}} spanned by five <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridges</b> and a railroad swing bridge (bridge 15). After the relocation, {{two of the}} bridges were replaced by modern fixed-span bridges and another had its towers removed due to excessive cost of potential renovation. Two more bridges {{were built in the}} northern section of the Waterway, and a bridge was constructed in downtown Welland to twin the East Main Street bridge.|$|R

25|$|The first {{bridge across}} the Chicago River was {{constructed}} over the North Branch near the present day Kinzie Street in 1832. A second bridge, over the South Branch near Randolph Street, was added in 1833. The first moveable bridge was constructed across the main stem at Dearborn Street in 1834. Today, the Chicago River has 38 movable bridges spanning it, down {{from a peak of}} 52 bridges. These bridges are of several different types, including trunnion bascule, Scherzer rolling <b>lift,</b> swing <b>bridges,</b> and <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridges.</b>|$|R

50|$|Below the {{junction}} with the Croydon Canal, a railway bridge {{was built for}} the Deptford Wharf branch, which was authorised by the London and Croydon Railway Act of 1846. In 1854, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway gained an Act, and the Deptford Wharf Branch was re-routed over the canal at a lower level. The canal company campaigned for a swing bridge to be built, but the Railway Commissioners overruled their objections, and a <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>bridge</b> was installed. This was 13 ft wide and 31+1/2 ft long, and provided 9+1/2 ft of headroom when it was raised. Operation was initially manual, but electric motors were later installed, and it continued to operate until the branch was lifted in 1964.|$|R
2500|$|The canal is {{increasingly}} {{hemmed in by}} buildings. On the east bank is Phoenix Mill, a five-storey building with attics and a pitched slate roof. Close to the North Eastern Gas Board offices, which are located in a three-storey mid-19th century listed building, the canal makes a dog-leg turn under Leeds Road. On the west bank is an octagonal chimney, standing over [...] tall, which was built in 1872 and formed part of a cotton spinning mill. Adjacent to it, the Locomotive <b>lift</b> <b>bridge,</b> which was installed in 1865, is a <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>bridge.</b> It was refurbished in 2002, and converted to electric operation. On the west bank is a seven-storey mill building originally belonging to John L Brierley.

It merges onto Raymond Boulevard, which continues west from the US1-9 and US1-9 Truck interchange into downtown Newark. The truck restriction on Route 1-9 is for the [...] "safety and welfare of the public" [...] according to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, not a specific bridge defect. At this point, the truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway, heading to the east. A short distance later, the road comes to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) and Doremus Avenue before crossing over the Passaic River on a <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>bridge.</b> Here, the route enters Kearny in Hudson County and continues east into industrial areas as the Lincoln Highway. [...] The road has a right-in/right-out in both directions that provides access to Jacobus Avenue before it comes to an interchange with County Route 659. From here, US1-9 Truck becomes a six-lane divided highway and comes to an at-grade intersection with Hackensack Avenue.

5000|$|Ryde Bridge has rarity {{value at}} a State level and {{historical}} significance locally. Ryde Bridge spans the Parramatta River between Church Street in Ryde (Uhrs Point) and Concord Road in Rhodes, replacing an earlier ferry service {{between these two}} points established {{in the late nineteenth}} century. It is rare at a state level because it is the only <b>lift</b> span <b>bridge</b> on Sydney Harbour and its tributaries (although the mechanism to operate the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> span has been removed). Ryde Bridge, constructed in 1935, is also a relatively rare example of a steel truss <b>bridge</b> with a <b>lift</b> span in NSW. By the early 1950s, the bascule span was the preferred option for bridges with opening spans, meaning that <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> span <b>bridges</b> such as Ryde Bridge were no longer being designed and built. Ryde Bridge has local historical significance because it is located at an important crossing over the Parramatta River, between Ryde and Rhodes, {{which was one of the}} narrowest points on the river. Ryde Council initiated the construction of the bridge in order to open up the municipality for suburban development. Thereafter, Ryde Bridge has provided an important transportation route for outer suburbs in the municipalities of Ryde and Hornsby to access Sydney by car.
