40|$|Two methods, {{namely the}} {{air-tight}} sheet method and the vacuum-drain method (sheetless), are generally used to conduct vacuum consolidation in the field. The {{advantages and disadvantages}} of both methods and the techniques for preventing vacuum leakage through a middle sand layer in a deposit, as well as the method for maintaining <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> when large settlement occurs, have been described. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> is an isotropic consolidation pressure applied to a soil deposit, and the deformation induced is different from that induced by a surcharge (e. g. the weight of an embankment). Two typical case histories in Japan are presented and deformation analyses were conducted. In one case history the vacuum-drain method was used with <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> alone, and in the other a combination of embankment loading and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> was applied employing the air-tight sheet method. It is shown that under <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> loading, the ground deformation (settlement and lateral displacement) can be calculated reliably using a method proposed previously.

In this paper, the thermal steady-state equilibrium method was used to test the receivers’ heat-loss. The receivers with increasing emittance were tested to study the variation of heat-loss. Meanwhile, the variable <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> in the annulus that affects the efficiency of the system was investigated. The influence of vacuumizing rate and getters on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> and heat-loss were discussed.

Saskatoon berries were dried from an initial moisture content of 75. 5 % to around 25 % (w. b.) using microwave-vacuum drying. In this study, saskatoon berries were dried at different microwave power levels P 10 (745 W), P 7 (514 W) and P 5 (374 W) and <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> levels V 20 (67. 0 kPa) and V 10 (33. 5 kPa). The <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressure</b> levels did not greatly influence the drying time of the saskatoon berries compared to the microwave power levels. Increasing the microwave power level produced faster drying times for the samples. After 12 min of drying at power level P 10, the moisture contents of the samples at <b>vacuum</b> <b>pressures</b> of 33. 5 and 67. 0 kPa were 29. 74 and 31. 24 %, respectively.
