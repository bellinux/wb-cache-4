5|$|In late 2015, the PGSO {{received}} Ford Taurus Police Interceptors {{for use in}} its <b>vehicular</b> fleet.|$|E
5|$|In {{the city}} of Zarqa, several bridges, <b>vehicular</b> and pedestrian, cross the river. The {{earliest}} of these was built by the Chechen founders of the city. Current bridges include the Zawahreh Bridge, a <b>vehicular</b> bridge connecting Baha' al-Din Street with al-Zuhur Street and another connecting Baha' al-Din Street with King Talal Street. Two pedestrian bridges connect al-Zuhur Street and Baha' al-Din Street, and Wasfi al-Tal Street and Petra Street.|$|E
5|$|New York City {{started a}} program, Vision Zero, {{that aims to}} lower <b>vehicular</b> {{fatalities}} by 50% between 2014 and 2025.|$|E
5|$|The area {{is close}} to many other bus routes, both from outside the front {{entrance}} of Brighton station and along London Road. There is a direct pedestrian and <b>vehicular</b> route along Stroudley Road to the rear entrance of Brighton station.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{also has an}} official residence in Minsk surrounded by the streets of Marx, Engels, Kirov and Komsomol. Like the American White House, the streets close to the residence are closed off to <b>vehicular</b> traffic and are patrolled by police forces.|$|E
5|$|Washington Irving {{had sunk}} {{on top of}} the New York-New Jersey <b>vehicular</b> tube complicating its removal. The wreck became a menace to {{navigation}} and was struck at 3am on 16 June by a railroad car float.|$|E
5|$|During {{the weekend}} of June 13–14, 2015, a large swarm of mayflies caused several <b>vehicular</b> {{accidents}} on the Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge, carrying Pennsylvania Route 462 across the Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired visibility and obstructions posed by piles of dead insects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for {{deferment}} of a prison sentence until the child reaches the age of 14. Such a request was controversially granted in 2011 to Anna Shavenkova, who had been sentenced to two years and six months prison for <b>vehicular</b> manslaughter. It was alleged that her request was granted because of her family connections.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries trails were formed, often by the {{movement}} of game herds, that could be traveled on horseback. However, <b>vehicular</b> access to the summit was practically impossible until {{the construction of a}} road in 1964, and it continues to be restricted. Today, multiple trails to the summit exist, in various states of use.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{planned for}} release in 2014, it was {{released}} in September the following year, several months after the theatrical release of , the fourth film in the series. Mad Max received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Although the game's environment, direction, <b>vehicular</b> combat, and graphics were praised, its quest design and story were criticized. The game became the eighth best-selling retail game in the US in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Forth Road Bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge in east central Scotland. The bridge, opened in 1964, spans the Firth of Forth, connecting Edinburgh, at Queensferry, to Fife, at North Queensferry. It replaced a centuries-old ferry service to carry <b>vehicular</b> traffic, cyclists and pedestrians across the Forth; railway crossings {{are made by}} the adjacent Forth Bridge, opened in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the crossing to <b>vehicular</b> traffic was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial A9 road to be routed across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing {{as part of this}} route led to the A90 number being assigned instead.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel was {{originally}} opened {{as a single}} bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales, as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End, and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and <b>vehicular</b> traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate, and consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound.|$|E
5|$|There are 13 Aboriginal {{language}} groups, 11 {{oral and}} 2 sign, in Canada, {{made up of}} more than 65 distinct dialects. Of these, only Cree, Inuktitut and Ojibway have a large enough population of fluent speakers to be considered viable {{to survive in the}} long term. Two of Canada's territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common <b>vehicular</b> language in territorial government. In the NWT, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Besides English and French, these languages are not <b>vehicular</b> in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.|$|E
5|$|Wasteland Angel is a <b>vehicular</b> combat shoot 'em up {{video game}} {{created by the}} Finnish {{independent}} developer team Octane Games. Released on September 1, 2011, the game is published by Meridian4 for Windows and is distributed online through Steam, Impulse, GamersGate, Direct2Drive, and Amazon Download.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapid transit}} route to connect Staten Island (alternately known as Richmond County) to the {{remainder}} of New York City was proposed in 1912, {{in conjunction with the}} Dual Contracts of the New York City Subway. At the time, there were no <b>vehicular</b> or rail connections between Staten Island and the other four boroughs; the only connection was by ferry. Although not funded by the city, the tunnel was expected to help expand the then-sparsely populated borough in a similar manner to the population and development explosions seen in Brooklyn and the Bronx.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. <b>Vehicular</b> traffic is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{approximately}} 100,000people {{were facing}} starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno {{reported that the}} government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within {{a few months after the}} storm, 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000. The <b>vehicular</b> paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|Among the park's most {{distinctive}} and well-known features are the <b>vehicular</b> river crossings. At three places, crossing Pine Creek, fords were constructed instead of bridges. The fords offer visitors {{a chance to}} actually drive through the creek, though high water frequently closes the crossings. Hikers are relegated to pedestrian bridges or stepping stones in the creek to cross the stream. Floods are frequent enough on Pine Creek, a large watershed {{to the north of}} the park, that there is an emergency exit from the campground. When high water closes the fords, the campground is cut off and the emergency exit is the only way out.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing <b>vehicular</b> traffic.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country <b>vehicular</b> access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can {{accommodate}} large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and the original, , are {{identical}} in gameplay and plot. The {{game is a}} first-person shooter with portions of <b>vehicular</b> combat taking place from a third-person perspective. The plot follows the player character and protagonist Master Chief, a supersoldier, as he fights the alien Covenant on the mysterious ancient ringworld Halo. Players are equipped with a recharging energy shield that absorbs damage; players also have health {{that can only be}} replenished by health packs scattered across the game's levels. A variety of human and alien weapons and vehicles can be used.|$|E
5|$|Olds' {{fondness for}} alcohol was well known. John Darrell Sherwood, {{in his book}} Fast Movers: Jet Pilots and the Vietnam Experience, posits that Olds' heavy {{drinking}} hurt his post-Vietnam career. On July 12, 2001, Olds was arrested for {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol and resisting arrest near his home in Steamboat Springs. Olds, briefly hospitalized during the incident for facial cuts, pleaded guilty in return for charges of weaving and felony <b>vehicular</b> eluding being dropped. Olds was placed on one year probation, and ordered to pay almost $900in fines and costs, attend an alcohol education course, and perform 72hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} owned and {{maintained}} by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians, as it can no longer be used for <b>vehicular</b> traffic due to weight restrictions.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a major}} bus {{terminus}} on the Kowloon side, {{which is}} conveniently situated close to the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier. Thousands of residents passed through this principal gateway to Hong Kong Island from the Kowloon Peninsula daily from 1957 until 2006. However, the inauguration of the Cross Harbour Tunnel in 1972 popularised <b>vehicular</b> travel across the harbour and reduced the flow of passengers. From 1972 to 2006, the ferry was still used {{by many as the}} shortest route from Tsim Sha Tsui (TST) to Central District, and a daily average of 74,000 passenger trips were made across the harbour in 2004.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vehicular</b> {{access to}} the Quays has been {{improved}} by the construction of Broadway Link Road, which links the site to the M602 motorway at junction 2, and by the provision of car parking. The high-rise 2116 space multi-storey car park was completed in August 2009. It is a pre-cast curved structure clad {{in a mixture of}} aluminium mesh panels and shaded aluminium tiles, comprising 11 floors of parking above the development's energy centre and commercial units.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{are allowed}} to snowshoe and do {{cross-country}} skiing and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to <b>vehicular</b> traffic during the winter and {{this section of the}} road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the winter in the backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park {{has many}} {{activities}} open to visitors and residents, some {{maintained by the}} city, others are spontaneously set up by individuals. Washington Park's open spaces are often used by visitors to play boccie, volleyball, and badminton games. Tennis, basketball, and handball courts are maintained by {{the city in the}} park, and ice skating is permitted on Washington Park Lake, though swimming is prohibited. Bicycling is popular on the many roadways, many of which are closed to <b>vehicular</b> traffic. Though skateboarding is legal throughout the park itself, the monuments and ball courts in the park fall under a citywide ban on skateboarding on public monuments, statues, and tennis/basketball courts.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{on the new}} expressway {{over the next several}} years, wrapping up in mid-1997. By then, a new Progressive Conservative government was in power, and committed $100 million towards the two projects. An opening ceremony was held on October5, 1997, with local, regional and provincial politicians in attendance. The new expressway opened to <b>vehicular</b> traffic ten days later on October15. The cost of the parkway, initially projected at $187 million, was under budget at $180 million.|$|E
5|$|Cobra Triangle is a 1989 racing, <b>vehicular</b> combat {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The player controls a weapon-equipped speedboat through 25 levels. Objectives include winning races, saving swimmers, and defusing bombs. The game also includes power-ups and is displayed from a 3D isometric perspective with automatic scrolling {{that follows the}} player's movement. The Stamper brothers designed the game and David Wise wrote its soundtrack. Computer and Video Games highly recommended the game and praised its graphics and gameplay. Later reviewers lauded its level diversity and noted its graphical similarities to previous Rare game R.C. Pro-Am. IGN and GamesRadar ranked Cobra Triangle among their top NES games. The latter considered Cobra Triangle emblematic of the NES era's aesthetic. It was also included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Destruction Derby is a <b>vehicular</b> combat racing {{video game}} {{developed}} by Reflections Interactive {{and published by}} Psygnosis. Based on the sport of demolition derby, the game tasks the player with racing and destroying cars to score points. The developers implemented simulated physics to make the results of collisions easier to predict, and they kept the game's tracks small {{to increase the number}} of wrecks. Versions of Destruction Derby were released for MS-DOS, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A Nintendo 64 version, Destruction Derby 64, was released in 1999 by Looking Glass Studios and THQ. Critics found Destruction Derby enjoyable and they praised its graphics and car damage system, but the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn releases received mixed reviews. It doesn't work fully on all PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 models due to game save file issues. The game started the Destruction Derby franchise, beginning with its 1996 sequel, Destruction Derby 2.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} a weekend getaway, {{surgeons}} Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) {{are involved in a}} <b>vehicular</b> collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life and the life of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.|$|E
5|$|English and French are {{recognized}} by the Constitution of Canada as official languages. All federal government laws are thus enacted in both English and French, with government services available in both languages. Two of Canada's territories give official status to indigenous languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common <b>vehicular</b> language in territorial government. In the Northwest Territories, the Official Languages Act declares that there are eleven different languages: Chipewyan, Cree, English, French, Gwich'in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, North Slavey, South Slavey and Tłįchǫ. Multicultural media are widely accessible {{across the country and}} offer specialty television channels, newspapers and other publications in many minority languages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing <b>vehicular</b> traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} <b>vehicular</b> combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player to toggle between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.|$|E
