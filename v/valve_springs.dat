25|$|Ducati is also {{famous for}} using the {{desmodromic}} valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from valve float at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet {{engineered}} several modifications for the Z06 to {{best use}} the increased power. Starting {{with the most}} structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 pounds lighter than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel, non-EMT tires, reduced sound proofing, fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM air intake, stiffer <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> lighter sodium filled valves and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|E

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
500|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford twin-choke carburettor. The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same [...] wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 [...] cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to mechanical friction, considerable force {{is required to}} compress the <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> used to close the engine's valves.

2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). This contrasts with road car engines of a similar size which typically operate at less than 6,000 rpm. The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean effective pressure had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E

2500|$|The {{camshaft}} [...] "lift" [...] is {{the resultant}} net {{rise of the}} valve from its seat. [...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to the piston crown and secondly, greater effort is required to move the <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> a Formula One engine's high rpm output has been made possible due to advances in metallurgy and design allowing lighter pistons and connecting rods to withstand the accelerations necessary to attain such high speeds, also by narrowing the connecting rod ends allowing for narrower main bearings. This allows for higher rpm with less bearing-damaging heat build-up. For each stroke, the piston goes from a null speed, to almost two times the mean speed, (approximately 40m/s) then back to zero. This occurs once {{for each of the four}} strokes in the cycle: one Intake (down), one Compression (up), one Power (ignition-down), one Exhaust (up). [...] Maximum piston acceleration occurs at top dead center and is in the region of 95,000m/s2, about 10,000 times standard gravity or 10,000g.|$|E
2500|$|Ducati is {{best known}} for {{high-performance}} motorcycles characterized by large-capacity four-stroke, 90° V-twin engines, with a desmodromic valve design. Ducati refers to this configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal, making it look like a letter [...] "L". Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a [...] "passive" [...] closing mechanism under the same conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The primary {{function}} of the camshaft is the smooth opening and closing of valves. In actual working conditions of an engine when the cam displaces the valve it results in <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> restoring force {{to act on the}} cam.

These cyclic variations in the resisting torque acting on the camshaft due to <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> load result in the oscillations of the camshaft. At high engine speeds these oscillations become severe and may even result in failure of the valvespring due to surging.
