Here, we report the unexpected finding that ALV entry depends on a critical low pH step that was overlooked when this virus was directly compared to the classical pH-dependent influenza A virus. In contrast to influenza A <b>virus,</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>interaction</b> plays an essential role in priming ALV Env for subsequent low pH triggering. Our results reveal a novel principle in viral entry, namely that receptor interaction can convert a pH-insensitive viral glycoprotein to a form that is responsive to low pH...|$|E
40|$|The feline and canine {{transferrin}} receptors (TfRs) bind canine parvovirus to host {{cells and}} mediate rapid capsid uptake and infection. The TfR and its ligand transferrin have well-described pathways of endocytosis and recycling. Here we tested several receptor-dependent steps in infection for {{their role in}} virus infection of cells. Deletions of cytoplasmic sequences or mutations of the Tyr-Thr-Arg-Phe internalization motif reduced the rate of receptor uptake from the cell surface, while polar residues introduced into the transmembrane sequence resulted in increased degradation of transferrin. However, the mutant receptors still mediated efficient virus infection. In contrast, replacing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane sequences of the feline TfR {{with those of the}} influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) resulted in a receptor that bound and endocytosed the capsid but did not mediate viral infection. This chimeric receptor became localized to detergent-insoluble membrane domains. To test the effect of structural <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>interaction</b> on infection, two chimeric receptors were prepared which contained antibody-variable domains that bound the capsid in place of the TfR ectodomain. These chimeric receptors bound CPV capsids and mediated uptake but did not result in cell infection.

Aim of the antiviral intervention was the cell protection against HRV 14 infections. Peptide sequences for the blockade of the <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>interaction</b> were derived from the 3 D-structures and amino acid sequences of HRV 14 and ICAM- 1. The peptides were synthesized by the project partner WITA GmbH. The antiviral efficacy of the de novo designed peptides and high affinity RNA molecules (haRNAs) selected by in vitro evolution techniques were measured as inhibition of HRV 14 reproduction in in vivo test systems. The sequence properties of the peptides and their antiviral effect were analyzed and optimized with new algorithms developed and applied by the bioinformatic working groups of the joint project. 253 peptides in total were characterized in the virology group. 38 of the 253 peptides showed a significant inhibition of HRV 14 reproduction of more than - 30 %. One peptide resulted in an inhibition of virus reproduction of - 74 %. The best of the selected haRNA molecules exhibited an inhibition of HRV 14 reproduction of up to - 53 %. (orig.)

Their similarities include the overall surface organization, {{the presence of}} 72 capsomeres composed of five molecules of the major capsid proteins, VP 1 and L 1, respectively, {{the structure of the}} core segment of capsomeres with classical antiparallel “jelly roll” β strands as the major feature, and the linkage of neighboring capsomeres by invading C-terminal arms.

These differences may affect the dramatic differences observed in receptor binding and internalization pathways utilized by these viruses, but as detailed later even structural differences cannot completely explain receptor and pathway usage.

Alphaviruses can infect humans, and these infections can cause serious illness. The symptoms of an alphavirus infection include fever, rash, arthralgia, and encephalitis. This broad host range and tissue tropism are attributed to the alphaviruses 2 ̆ 7 ability to utilize multiple host receptors. The {{purpose of the present}} study was: to define Ross River virus antireceptor amino acids: to identify a Ross River virus co-receptor: and to obtain structural information about the <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>interaction.</b> In this study, it was determined that the enhanced entry of Ross River virus mutants. N 218 R and N 218 K, into cultures of chicken embryo fibroblasts was the result of an interaction between the mutants and cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) moieties. The mutants bound immobilized heparin (a highly sulfated form of HS), and were inhibited in growth in HS-deficient cell lines. These data suggested that a single amino acid change expanded the host range through an interaction with HS. Cryoelectron microscopy followed by image reconstruction determined the binding location of heparin, and by inference HS, on the surface of the particle. Heparin bound the distal portion of the spike. The footprints of heparin and Fab T 10 C 9, which recognizes residue E 2 216, overlapped each other suggesting heparin was interacting with residue 218. These data supported the idea that this region of the alphavirus spike is involved in cell surface recognition. An RRV mutant with a deletion of 7 amino acids in the E 2 glycoprotein was shown here to bind HS. The location of HS binding on the mutant particle is unknown, but it is likely to be distinct from binding at residue 218.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) infects oral epitelial cells, then spreads to {{the nerve}} endings and estabilishes latency in sensory ganglia, {{from where it}} may, or may not reactivate. Diseases caused by virus {{reactivation}} include mild diseases such as muco-cutaneous lesions, and more severe, and even life-threatening encephalitis, or systemic infections affecting diverse organs. Herpes simplex virus represents the most comprehensive example of <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> <b>interaction</b> in Herpesviridae family, and the prototype virus encoding multipartite entry genes. In fact, it encodes 11 - 12 glycoproteins {{and a number of}} additional membrane proteins: five of these proteins play key roles in virus entry into subsceptible cells. Thus, glycoprotein B (gB) and glycoprotein C (gC) interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycan to enable initial attachment to cell surfaces. In the next step, in the entry cascade, gD binds a specific surface receptor such as nectin 1 or HVEM. The interaction of glycoprotein D with the receptor alters the conformation of gD to enable the activation of gB, glycoprotein H, and glycoprotein L, a trio of glycoproteins that execute the fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. In this thesis, I described two distinct projects: I. The retargeting of viral tropism for the design of oncolytic Herpesviruses: • capable of infecting cells through the human epitelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2), overexpressed in highly malignant mammary and ovarian tumors and correlates with a poor prognosis; • detargeted from its natural receptors, HVEM and nectin 1. To this end, we inserted a ligand to HER 2 in gD. Because HER 2 has no natural ligand, the selected ligand was a single chain antibody (scFv) derived from MAb 4 D 5 (monoclonal antibody to HER 2), herein designated scHER 2. All recombinant viruses were targeted to HER 2 receptor, but only two viruses (R-LM 113 and R-LM 249) were completely detargeted from HVEM and nectin 1. To engineer R-LM 113, we removed a large portion at the N-terminus of gD (from aa 6 to aa 38) and inserted scHER 2 sequence plus 9 -aa serine-glycine flexible linker at position 39. On the other hand, to engineer R-LM 249, we replaced the Ig-folded core of gD (from aa 61 to aa 218) with scHER 2 flanked by Ser-Gly linkers. In summary, these results provide evidence that: i. gD can tolerate an insert almost as big as gD itself; ii. the Ig-like domain of gD can be removed; iii. the large portion at the N-terminus of gD (from aa 6 to aa 38) can be removed without loss of key function; iv. R-LM 113 and R-LM 249 recombinants are ready to be assayed in animal models of mammary and ovary tumour. This finding and the avaibility {{of a large number of}} scFv greatly increase the collection of potential receptors to which HSV can be redirected. II. The production and purification of recombinant truncated form of the heterodimer gHgL. We cloned a stable insect cell line expressing a soluble form of gH in complex with gL under the control of a metalloprotein inducible promoter and purified the heterodimer by means of ONE-STrEP-tag system by IBA. With respect to biological function, the purified heterodimer is capable: • of reacting to antibodies that recognize conformation dependent epitopes and neutralize virion infectivity; • of binding a variety cells at cell surface. No doubt, the availability of biological active purified gHgL heterodimer, in sufficient quantities, will speed up the efforts to solve its crystal structure and makes it feasible to identify more clearly whether gHgL has a cellular partner, and what is the role of this interaction on virus entry...|$|E
40|$|Envelope protein {{precursors}} of many viruses {{are processed}} by a basic endopeptidase to generate two molecules, one for receptor binding {{and the other}} for membrane fusion. Such a cleavage event has not been demonstrated for the hepatitis B virus family. Two binding partners for duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) pre-S envelope protein have been identified. Duck carboxypeptidase D (DCPD) interacts with the full-length pre-S protein and is the DHBV docking receptor, while duck glycine decarboxylase (DGD) has the potential to bind several deletion constructs of the pre-S protein in vitro. Interestingly, DGD but not DCPD expression was diminished following prolonged culture of primary duck hepatocytes (PDH), which impaired productive DHBV infection. Introduction of exogenous DGD promoted formation of protein-free viral genome, suggesting restoration of several early events in viral life cycle. Conversely, blocking DGD expression in fresh PDH by antisense RNA abolished DHBV infection. Moreover, addition of DGD antibodies soon after virus binding reduced endogenous DGD protein levels and impaired production of covalently closed circular DNA, the template for DHBV gene expression and genome replication. Our findings implicate this second pre-S binding protein as a critical cellular factor for productive DHBV infection. We hypothesize that DCPD, a molecule cycling between the cell surface and the trans-Golgi network, targets DHBV particles to the secretary pathway for proteolytic cleavage of viral envelope protein.

In order to identify the receptor binding site, a panel of G glycoprotein constructs containing mutations was generated using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis strategy. Based on a predicted G structure, charged amino acids residing in regions that could be homologous to those in the measles virus H attachment glycoprotein known to be involved in its protein <b>receptor</b> <b>interaction</b> were targeted. Using a coprecipitation-based assay, seven single-amino-acid substitutions in HeV G were identified as having significantly impaired binding to both the ephrinB 2 and ephrinB 3 viral receptors: D 257 A, D 260 A, G 439 A, K 443 A, G 449 A, K 465 A, and D 468 A.

BHK cells that lacks the <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM 1) were not suscepti-ble by HRV- 14. As permissive cells HeLa cells were used. To study {{the influence of the}} <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> about the susceptibility of cells BHK cells were transfected with ICAM- 1 (BHK-ICAM- 1 cells). I could show for HeLa cells that HRV- 14 is internalized via coated pits and coated vesicles by receptor-mediated endocytosis. A pH-dependent entry mechanism could by demonstrated by exploiting the action of monensin as an ionophore which raises the pH in the acidic endosomes and lysosomes. The progeny of new rhinoviruses was detected by transmission electron microscopy and the measure of infectious virus by plaque titration. Differently, the HRV- 14 infection proceeded at BHK-ICAM 1 -cells. In contrast to HeLa cells virus internalization into BHK-ICAM- 1 cells were receptor mediated, too. But nei-ther a synthesis of viral RNA nor a production of infectious rhinoviruses was detected. Long chains of virus particles were located in membrane tubes. Virus particles were lined up in these channels like pearls on a string, but did not induce a productive infec-tion. ICAM- 1 acts as a functional <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> on the transfected cells as shown in infection experiments with coxsackievirus A 21.

These results suggest that ICAM- 1 was not sufficient to render transfected BHK cells permissive to HRV- 14.

To further elucidate the regions of MHVR required for <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> activity and MAb CC 1 binding, we constructed chimeras between MHVR and other members of the CEA family and tested them for MHV strain A 59 (MHV-A 59) receptor activity and MAb CC 1 binding activity. In addition, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce selected amino acid changes into the N-terminal domains of MHVR and these chimeras and tested the abilities of these mutant glycoproteins to bind MAb CC 1 and to function as MHV receptors. Several recombinant glycoproteins exhibited <b>virus</b> <b>receptor</b> activity but did not bind MAb CC 1, indicating that the virus and MAb binding sites on the N-terminal domain of MHVR are not identical. Analysis of the recombinant glycoproteins showed that a short region of MHVR, between amino acids 34 and 52, is critical for MHV-A 59 receptor activity.

We describe the development of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) particles pseudotyped with the visna virus envelope glycoprotein and encoding a green fluorescent protein reporter as a tool to study the expression of the visna <b>virus</b> <b>receptor.</b> Functional MuLV/visna <b>virus</b> pseudotypes were obtained when the cytoplasmic tail of the visna virus envelope TM protein was truncated to 3, 7, or 11 amino acids in length. MuLV/visna virus particles were used to transduce a panel of cell types from various organisms, including sheep, goat, human, hamster, mouse, monkey, and quail. The majority of the cells examined were susceptible to MuLV/visna pseudotype viruses, supporting the notion that the visna <b>virus</b> cellular <b>receptor</b> is a widely expressed protein found in many species. Of 16 different cell types tested, only mouse embryo fibroblast NIH 3 T 3 cells, hamster ovary CHO cells, and the human promonocyte cell line U 937 cells were not susceptible to transduction by the pseudotyped virus. The production of functional MuLV/visna virus pseudotypes has provided a sensitive, biologically relevant system to study visna virus cell entry and envelope-receptor interactions...|$|R
40|$|Induction of {{antiviral}} cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) {{has been}} proposed to require cross-presentation of viral antigens derived from infected extralymphatic host cells by antigen-presenting cells (APC). This postulated mechanism of cross-priming {{is thought to be}} essential for CTL responses against viruses that do not infect professional APC, e. g., because of absence of the specific <b>virus</b> <b>receptor.</b> Here, we show for the human pathogen poliovirus that naturally nonpermissive murine APC acquire viral RNA in vivo independently of the cellular <b>virus</b> <b>receptor.</b> Uptake of poliovirus or polioviral RNA initiated neosynthesis of viral antigen to an extent sufficient to prime CTLs in vivo, which were detectable 2 - 3 wk after infection. Our results do not only indicate that experiments studying cross-presentation and cross-priming by using potentially amplifiable or translatable materials need careful examination, but they also question the general biological importance of cross-presentation and cross-priming in antiviral CTL responses...|$|R
