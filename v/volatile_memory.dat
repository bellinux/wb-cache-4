500|$|A digital {{forensic}} investigation commonly {{consists of}} 3 stages: acquisition or imaging of exhibits, analysis, and reporting. Ideally acquisition involves capturing {{an image of}} the computer's <b>volatile</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM) and creating an exact sector level duplicate (or [...] "forensic duplicate") of the media, often using a write blocking device to prevent modification of the original. However, the growth in size of storage media and developments such as cloud computing [...] have led to more use of 'live' acquisitions whereby a 'logical' copy of the data is acquired rather than a complete image of the physical storage device. Both acquired image (or logical copy) and original media/data are hashed (using an algorithm such as SHA-1 or MD5) and the values compared to verify the copy is accurate.|$|E

2500|$|On Macs, {{a feature}} known as Safe Sleep saves the {{contents}} of <b>volatile</b> <b>memory</b> to the system hard disk each time the Mac enters Sleep mode. The Mac can instantaneously wake from sleep mode if power to the RAM has not been lost. However, if the power supply was interrupted, such as when removing batteries without an AC power connection, the Mac would wake from Safe Sleep instead, restoring memory contents from the hard drive.

50|$|Mobile devices do {{not provide}} the {{possibility}} to run or boot from a CD, connecting to a network share or another device with clean tools. Therefore, system commands could {{be the only way}} to save the <b>volatile</b> <b>memory</b> of a mobile device. With the risk of modified system commands it must be estimated if the <b>volatile</b> <b>memory</b> is really important. A similar problem arises when no network connection is available and no secondary memory can be connected to a mobile device because the <b>volatile</b> <b>memory</b> image must be saved on the internal non-volatile memory, where the user data is stored and most likely deleted important data will be lost. System commands are the cheapest method, but imply some risks of data loss. Every command usage with options and output must be documented.|$|E

50|$|<b>Volatile</b> <b>memory</b> is {{computer}} memory that requires {{power to maintain}} the stored information. Most modern semiconductor <b>volatile</b> <b>memory</b> is either static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM). SRAM retains its contents {{as long as the}} power is connected and is easy for interfacing, but uses six transistors per bit. Dynamic RAM is more complicated for interfacing and control, needing regular refresh cycles to prevent losing its contents, but uses only one transistor and one capacitor per bit, allowing it to reach much higher densities and much cheaper per-bit costs.|$|E
