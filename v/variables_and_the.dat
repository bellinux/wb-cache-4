5|$|Central to feminist {{economics}} {{is an effort}} to alter the theoretical modeling of the economy, to reduce gender bias and inequity. Feminist macroeconomic inquiries focus on international capital flows, fiscal austerity, deregulation and privatization, monetary policy, international trade and more. In general, these modifications take three main forms: gender disaggregation, the addition of gender-based macroeconomic <b>variables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> creation of a two-sector system.|$|E

25|$|It has {{applications}} in logic, interpreting 0 as false, 1 as true, ∧ as and, ∨ as or, and ¬ as not.

25|$|A law of Boolean algebra is an {{identity}} such as x∨(y∨z) = (x∨y)∨z between two Boolean terms, where a Boolean term {{is defined as}} an expression built up from <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> constants 0 and 1 using the operations ∧, ∨, and ¬. The concept can be extended to terms involving other Boolean operations such as ⊕, →, and ≡, but such extensions are unnecessary for the purposes to which the laws are put. Such purposes include {{the definition of a}} Boolean algebra as any model of the Boolean laws, and as a means for deriving new laws from old as in the derivation of x∨(y∧z) = x∨(z∧y) from y∧z = z∧y as treated in the section on axiomatization.|$|E

25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent <b>variables,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased series expansion reduces.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{approach}} to choosing network variables with voltages which is analogous and dual to the loop current method. [...] Here the voltage associated with pairs of nodes are the primary <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branch voltages are found in terms of them. [...] In this method also, a particular tree of the graph must be chosen {{in order to ensure}} that all the variables are independent. [...] The dual of the tie set is the cut set. [...] A tie set is formed by allowing all but one of the graph links to be open circuit. [...] A cut set is formed by allowing all but one of the tree branches to be short circuit. [...] The cut set consists of the tree branch which was not short-circuited and any of the links which are not short-circuited by the other tree branches. [...] A cut set of a graph produces two disjoint subgraphs, that is, it cuts the graph into two parts, and is the minimum set of branches needed to do so. [...] The set of network equations are formed by equating the node pair voltages to the algebraic sum of the cut set branch voltages. [...] The dual of the special case of mesh analysis is nodal analysis.Suresh, p.518, pp.523–528 ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} whether or not it is {{appropriate}} to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> precise interpretation of research questions.

2500|$|Quantitative {{genetics}} {{focuses on}} genetic variance due to genetic interactions.

In this regression, the observed two locus genetic effects are treated as dependent <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> [...] "pure" [...] genetic effects are used as the independent variables.

2500|$|Elementary algebra {{differs from}} {{arithmetic}} {{in the use}} of abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are either unknown or allowed to take on many values.

If no proof can be found, the original goal succeeds. Therefore, the \+/1 prefix operator {{is called the}} [...] "not provable" [...] operator, since the query ?- \+ Goal. succeeds if Goal is not provable. This kind of negation is sound if its argument is [...] "ground" [...] (i.e. contains no variables).

In particular, the query ?- legal(X). can now {{not be used to}} enumerate all things that are legal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion of}} a [...] "unique effect" [...] is {{appealing}} when studying a complex system where multiple interrelated components influence the response variable.

However, {{it has been argued that}} in many cases multiple regression analysis fails to clarify the relationships between the predictor <b>variables</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> response variable when the predictors are correlated with each other and are not assigned following a study design. A commonality analysis may be helpful in disentangling the shared and unique impacts of correlated independent variables.|$|E
