5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X became <b>very</b> <b>tired</b> {{and slept}} little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
5|$|Paula Barila Bolopa was Equatorial Guinea's {{only female}} {{competitor}} {{to participate in}} swimming at the Sydney Olympic Games and was 20 {{years old at the}} time of the quadrennial event. She had not entered any previous Olympic Games. Like Moussambani, Bolopa qualified for the Games as a wildcard because she did not meet the minimum qualification standards for the women's 50 metre freestyle. She began swimming two and a half months before the Games. Bolopa took part in the contest's first heat on 22 September, finishing second out of three entered participants, with a time of one minute and 3.97 seconds. The time set a new record as the slowest for a female athlete in the Olympic history of the women's 50 metre freestyle and was double the slowest time of the fastest overall swimmer in the displicine. She received loud support and encouragement from spectators. Bolopa finished second behind the heat's winner Moe Thu Aung of Myanmar (26.80 seconds) after the third participant Fatema Hameed Gerashi of Bahrain was disqualified for a false start. She finished 73rd and last out of all swimmers, and did not progress into the semi-finals because she was 35.90 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced beyond the first round. After the event, Bolopa said that she was <b>very</b> <b>tired</b> because it was the first time she had swum in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was <b>very</b> <b>tired.</b> Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

25|$|According to BMF {{secretary}} John Kuenzli, Manser {{crossed the}} Sarawak/Kalimantan border on 22 May {{with the help}} of a local guide. His last known communication was a letter mailed to his girlfriend, Charlotte, while hiding in Bario. In the letter, Manser said he was <b>very</b> <b>tired</b> while waiting for the sun to set before continuing his journey along the logging roads. The letter was deposited at the Bario post office and reached Switzerland with a Malaysian stamp but without a post office stamp. Manser was last seen carrying a 30-kilogram backpack by his Penan friend, Paleu and Paleu's son on 25 May 2000. They accompanied Manser until they saw Bukit Batu Lawi (2000-metre limestone pinnacle in Sarawak). Manser stated his intention to climb the mountain alone and requested Paleu to leave him there. Manser has not been seen since.|$|E

25|$|The {{first time}} a patient {{experiences}} KLS, it usually occurs along with symptoms {{that are similar to}} those of the flu or encephalitis. In at least 75 percent of cases, symptoms occur after an airway infection or a fever. Viruses observed before the development of the condition include Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, herpes zoster virus, Influenza A virus subtypes, and adenovirus. Several days after symptoms first occur, patients become <b>very</b> <b>tired.</b> In cases that occur after an infection, KLS usually starts within three to five days for teenagers and fewer for children. In other cases, alcohol consumption, head injury, or international travel precede symptoms. Lifestyle habits, such as stress, alcohol abuse and lack of sleep and stress, have also been proposed as possible triggers. First episodes of KLS are preceded by a clear event in about 90 percent of cases. Recurrences generally do not have clear triggers; only about 15 percent have a precipitating event.|$|E
25|$|After the {{successful}} {{crossing of the}} Danube and deployment of his army on the Marchfeld plain, Napoleon achieved his primary goal for the day. Nevertheless, towards 18:00, either because he was dissatisfied with {{the result of the}} first engagements or because he was fearing that the enemy might retreat under the cover of darkness, the Emperor began issuing orders for an immediate attack. Never a man to lose time, Napoleon probably noted that the sun was still high on the sky, that the Austrian right wing was placed noticeably far away from the main body, and that there was still no sign of the arrival of Archduke John's army from the east. This attack was also meant to probe the strength and resolution of the enemy, as the Emperor did not know exactly what forces lay before him. The attack was to take place against the Russbach line on a wide front, between Wagram and Markgrafneusiedl, with Bernadotte, EugÃ¨ne, Oudinot and Davout all ordered forward. Nevertheless, the French troops were all <b>very</b> <b>tired</b> and the most difficult tasks were assigned to some of the weakest troops available, namely elements of the Corps of Bernadotte and Oudinot. Additionally, with the Emperor ordering an immediate attack, the General Staff failed to transmit the orders to the respective commanders in due time, which resulted in a failure to launch synchronized actions.|$|E

[...] Yanayev said the Emergency Committee was committed to continuing his reforms. However, Yanayev's weak posture, trembling hands and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing. According to some historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee but was not its mastermind; Kryuchkov has been described as the [...] "heart and soul of the conspiracy".
