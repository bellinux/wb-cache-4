40|$|Medical {{cartography}} {{can provide}} valuable {{insights into the}} epidemiology and ecology of infectious diseases, providing a quantitative representation {{of the distribution of}} these pathogens. Such methods therefore provide a key step in informing public health policy decisions ranging from prioritising sites for further investigation to identifying targets for interventions. By increasing the resolution at which risk is defined, policymakers are provided with an increasingly informed approach for considering next steps as well as evaluating past progress. In spite of their benefits however, global maps of infectious disease are lacking in both quality and comprehensiveness. This thesis sets out to investigate the next steps for medical cartography and details the use of species distribution models in evaluating global distributions of a variety of zoonotic diseases of public health importance. Chapter 2 defines a methodology by which global targets for infectious disease mapping can be quantitatively assessed by comparing the global burden of each disease with the demand from national policymakers, non-governmental organisations and academic communities for global assessments of disease distribution. Chapter 3 introduces the use of boosted regression trees for mapping the distribution of a group of vector-borne diseases identified as being a high priority target, the leishmaniases. Chapter 4 adapts these approaches to consider Ebola virus disease. This technique shows that the West African outbreak was ecologically consistent with past infections and suggests a much wider area of risk than previously considered. Chapter 5 investigates Marburg virus disease and considers the variety of different factors relating to all aspects of the transmission cycle that must be considered in these analyses. Chapters 6 and 7 complete the mapping of the suite of <b>viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> by assessing the distribution of Crimean-Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> and Lassa fever.

40|$|Viral {{haemorrhagic}} fevers {{are caused}} by {{a wide range of}} viruses. There are 4 types of viruses well known to spread from person to person and able to cause nosocomial outbreaks with a high case fatality rate: an arenavirus (Lassa fever and more exceptionally the Junin and Machupo virus), a bunyavirus (Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever) and the Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses).

40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHF) {{caused by}} arenaviruses {{are among the}} most devastating {{emerging}} human diseases. The most important pathogen among the arenaviruses is Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever that is endemic to West Africa. On the South American continent, the New World arenavirus Junin virus (JUNV), Machupo (MACV), Guanarito (GTOV), and Sabia virus (SABV) have emerged as causative agents of severe VHFs. Clinical and experimental studies on arenavirus VHF have revealed a crucial role of the endothelium in their pathogenesis. However, in contrast to other VHFs, haemorrhages are not a salient feature of Lassa fever and fatal cases do not show overt destruction of vascular tissue. The functional alteration of the vascular endothelium that precede shock and death in fatal Lassa fever may be due to more subtle direct or indirect effects of the virus on endothelial cells. Haemorrhagic disease manifestations and vascular involvement are more pronounced in the VHF caused by the South American <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> viruses. Recent studies on JUNV revealed perturbation of specific endothelial cell function, including expression of cell adhesion molecules, coagulation factors, and vasoactive mediators as a consequence of productive viral infection. These studies provided first possible links to some of the vascular abnormalities observed in patients, however, their relevance in vivo remains to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|<b>Viral</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fevers</b> (VHF) {{are caused}} by {{zoonotic}} viral infections transmitted to humans directly or by ticks or mosquitoes. The overall risk to travellers is conservatively estimated at < 1 in 1 million travel episodes to African countries where infection is present, and febrile patients returning from these countries are at least 1000 {{times more likely to}} have malaria than Lassa fever or another VHF. No cases have been reported in fellow travellers exposed to a travelling case and only one asymptomatic seroconversion (to Lassa) has been reported in over 2000 contacts following care of VHF cases in modern Western hospital settings. However, healthcare-associated transmission of infection has been a major problem in some endemic settings. The potential for healthcare-associated infection and the threats posed by unrecognised or new agents necessitate a high index of suspicion and a standardised risk assessment approach to febrile travellers. Travel-related hantavirus infections are increasingly being reported from Europe and the Americas.

Relative to the results of the reference leptospirosis test, the sensitivity of the dipstick assay was 84. 5 % for serum samples collected during the first 10 days of the disease and 92. 1 % for serum samples collected 10 - 30 days after the onset of disease.
