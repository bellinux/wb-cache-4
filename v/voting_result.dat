25|$|The Pirate Party {{attracted}} 34,918 {{votes in}} the Swedish general election of 2006, their first participation at an election for parliament since {{the founding of the}} party less than 9 months prior. With 0.63% of the overall votes, it became the 10th biggest party of more than 40 participating. However, a <b>voting</b> <b>result</b> of less than 4% of the total votes does not qualify the party for seats in the Swedish Parliament. Getting more than 1% of the vote would have granted the party financial assistance from the state for printing ballots which is costly in Sweden, while at least 2.5% would grant them state funds for campaigning in the next election. Despite the setbacks, Falkvinge began planning for the Swedish general election in 2010.|$|E

The video showed one jury member {{not paying attention to}} the Dutch performance, while another jury member was filmed during the Armenian performance stating that she will support Armenia [...] "because [...] husband is Armenian". The video also shows jury members on their phones during other performances, as well as a glimpse of Stotskaya's <b>voting</b> <b>result,</b> which also included notes evaluating performances. The rules of the contest stipulate that all jury members are to evaluate performances individually, without discussing the results with other jury members, a stipulation that was clearly violated by the Russian jury.|$|E
