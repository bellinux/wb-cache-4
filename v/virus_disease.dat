5|$|Several highly lethal viral {{pathogens}} {{are members}} of the Filoviridae. Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. Ebola <b>Virus</b> <b>Disease</b> has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified. The worst and most recent one is the West Africa epidemic.|$|E

Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{believe that}} a 2-year-old boy was the index case of the current Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> epidemic. He died in December 2013 {{in the village of}} Meliandou, Guéckédou Prefecture. His mother, sister, and {{grandmother}} then became ill with similar symptoms and also died. Although Ebola represents a significant public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa and was documented in Tai Forest chimpanzees, only one case had been reported in humans in West Africa. With this background and in the context of poor public health systems, the early cases were mis-diagnosed as diseases more common to the area. Thus Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> spread for several months before it was recognized as such. In late October 2014, the child was identified as Emile Ouamouno. In a Tuesday, December 30, 2014 online world news story article by Richard Ingham from the Agence France-Presse (AFP) that was featured on the MSN homepage, it was revealed that a tree in the area where children had played at, playing with insect-eating free-tailed bats and hunting and grilling them to eat (they are a cousin of another well-known Ebola reservoir, the fruit bat, whose role in this outbreak is not as clear), {{is believed to be the}} point where human infection– likely by the bats– with Ebola in this current outbreak occurred, the 'ground zero' of the epidemic. This is not yet known decisively, but scientists have enough knowledge to go public with the story.|$|E

Now, insects capable of being vectors of <b>virus</b> <b>diseases</b> may assume a significance quite out of proportion to their relative density of population. It was therefore decided to commence a study {{from this point of view}} of the insects inhabiting the cherry orchards of the Niagara District of Ontario.

25|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease,</b> Lassa fever virus, Rift Valley fever, Marburg {{virus and}} Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly {{contagious}} and deadly diseases, with the theoretical {{potential to become}} pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector, and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly quarantine vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.|$|E
25|$|Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> (EVD), {{also known}} as Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other {{primates}} caused by ebolaviruses. Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches. Then, vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys. At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally. The disease has {{a high risk of}} death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent. This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.|$|E
25|$|Suspicion {{of modern}} {{medicine}} due to beliefs about illness being due to witchcraft also continues in many countries to this day, with tragic healthcare consequences. HIV/AIDS and Ebola <b>virus</b> <b>disease</b> are two examples of often-lethal infectious disease epidemics whose medical care and containment has been severely hampered by regional beliefs in witchcraft. Other severe medical conditions whose treatment is hampered in this way include tuberculosis, leprosy, epilepsy and the common severe bacterial Buruli ulcer. Public healthcare often requires considerable education work related to epidemology and modern health knowledge {{in many parts of}} the world where belief in witchcraft prevails, to encourage effective preventive health measures and treatments, to reduce victim blaming, shunning and stigmatization, and to prevent the killing of people and endangering of animal species for body parts believed to convey magical abilities.|$|E
