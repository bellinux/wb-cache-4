After a single injection of tritiated leucine, the radioactivity first appears in the cytoplasm of the <b>visual</b> <b>cell</b> which contains ribosomes.

40|$|UnrestrictedTraditionally <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been}} {{characterized}} using {{their responses to}} artificial stimuli by simple parametric models. However, recent investigations show that <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> adapt to the statistical properties of the stimuli used to probe them. Thus, to characterize <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> in their natural operating conditions, {{it is important to}} use naturalistic stimuli. Simple parametric models are designed for specific classes of cells, making assumptions about their response properties. But, if these assumptions do not match the cell response properties, the interpretation of the estimated model parameters is questionable. An alternative is to use generic non-parametric models that can characterize a broad range of cell classes.; This thesis contains technical and scientific contributions. Technically, we develop methods to estimate generic non-parametric models of <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> from their responses to arbitrary, including natural, stimuli. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we introduce the Volterra Relevant Space Technique (VRST), that allows the estimation of spatial Volterra models of <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> from their responses to natural stimuli. Disregarding temporal properties of the response generation mechanism for the estimation of spatial Volterra models is a good first approximation. However, in most conditions responses of <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> are not spatial, but spatio temporal. So, in the second part of this dissertation we build the extended Projection Pursuit Regression (ePPR) algorithm, that estimates a very general model for the characterization of <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> in space and time. The generality of the ePPR model reveals differences in response properties of cortical cells to natural and random stimuli that had not been observed with existing models. Thus, scientifically this thesis shows that using natural stimuli for the characterization of <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> is relevant to understand natural vision...|$|R

The phototransduction cascade has diverged in different species, {{such as those}} mediated by transducin in vertebrate rods and cones, by Gq-type G protein in insect and molluscan rhabdomeric-type <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> and vertebrate photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, and by Go-type G protein in scallop ciliary-type <b>visual</b> <b>cells.</b> Here, we investigated the phototransduction cascade of a prebilaterian box jellyfish, the most basal animal having eyes containing lens and ciliary-type <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> similar to vertebrate eyes, to examine the similarity {{at the molecular level}} and to obtain an implication of the origin of the vertebrate phototransduction cascade. We showed that the opsin-based pigment functions as a green-sensitive visual pigment and triggers the Gs-type G protein-mediated phototransduction cascade in the ciliary-type <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> of the box jellyfish lens eyes. We also demonstrated the light-dependent cAMP increase in the jellyfish <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> and HEK 293 S cells expressing the jellyfish opsin. The first identified prebilaterian cascade was distinct from known phototransduction cascades but exhibited significant partial similarity with those in vertebrate and molluscan ciliary-type <b>visual</b> <b>cells,</b> because all involved cyclic nucleotide signaling. These similarities imply a monophyletic origin of ciliary phototransduction cascades distributed from prebilaterian to vertebrate...|$|R

RCS and control rats were injected with amino acids- 3 H at 11 days of age. Radioactive rod outer segment discs were assembled at the outer segment base from radioactive proteins synthesized in the rod inner segments. In controls, all radioactive discs assembled at 11 days of age were displaced the length of the outer segments, removed from outer segment tips, and phagocytized by the pigment epithelium by 8 days after injection. In the RCS rats, disc assembly and displacement resembled controls for the first 3 days after injection. However, as disc assembly continued for some time thereafter, a layer of labeled, disorganized, lamellar debris accumulated between the outer segment tips and the pigment epithelium. The buildup of debris was accompanied by <b>visual</b> <b>cell</b> death.

40|$|The {{renewal of}} {{glycerol}} {{in the visual}} cells and pigment epithelium of the frog retina was studied by autoradiographic analysis of animals injected with [2 - 1 1]glycerol. Assay of chloroform: methanol extracts showed that the labeled precursor was used mainly in lipid synthesis, although there was also some utilization {{in the formation of}} protein. Radioactive glycerol was initially concentrated in the myoid portion of rods and cones, indicating that this is the site of phospholipid synthesis in visual cells. The glycogen bodies (paraboloids) of accessory cones were also heavily labeled, suggesting the diversion of some glycerol into glycogenic pathways. In the pigment epithelium, only the oil droplets became significantly radioactive. The outer plexiform layer (which contains the <b>visual</b> <b>cell</b> synaptic bodies) and the cone oil droplets gradually accumulated considerable amounts of labeled material. Within 1 - 4 h, labeled molecules began to appear in the <b>visual</b> <b>cell</b> outer segments, evidently having been transported there from the myoid portion of the inner segment. Most of these were phospholipid molecules which became distributed throughout the outer segments, presumably replacing comparable constituents in existing membranes. In rods only, there was also an aggregation of labeled material {{at the base of the}} outer segment due to membrane biogenesis. These highly radioactive membranes, containing labeled molecules of lipid and protein, were subsequently displaced along the rod outer segments due to repeated membrane assembly at the base. The distribution of radioactivity supported the conclusion that membrane renewal by molecular replacement is more rapid for lipid than it is for protein...|$|E

40|$|The {{intercellular}} {{relationships in}} the ommatidia of the lateral eye of Limulus have been investigated. The distal process of the eccentric cell gives origin to microvilli which intcrdigitatc with the microvilli of the retinular cells. Therefore, both types of <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> contribute to form the rhabdom and may have an analogous photoreceptor function. Quintuplelayered junctions are found within the rhabdom at the lines of demarcation between adjoining microvilli, whether the microvilli originate from a single retinular cell, from two adjacent retinular cells, or from a rctinular cell and the eccentric cell. Furthermore, quintuple-layered junctions between the eccentric cell and {{the tips of the}} microvilli of the rctinular cells occur at the boundary between the distal process and the rhabdom. These findings are interpreted to indicate that the rhabdom providcs an extensive electrotonic junction relating retinular cells to one another and to the eccentric cell.

40|$|Goldfish {{were placed}} on a daily light cycle of 12 h light and 12 h {{darkness}} for 18 days or longer. The <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> and pigment epithelium of the retina were then examined by microscopy at many intervals throughout the cycle. Goldfish rods and cones follow a rhythmic pattern in eliminating packets of photosensitive membranes from their outer segments. Rods shed membranes early in the light period. The detached membranes are ingested by pigment epithelial cells or by ameboid phagocytes, which degrade them during {{the remainder of the}} light period. Cones discard membranes from the ends of their outer segments early in the dark period. During the next several hours, this debris is digested by the pigment epithelium or by ameboid phagocytes. Thus, the disposal phase of the outer-segment renewal process is similar in rods and cones, but is displaced in time by about 12 h. There is evidence that this daily rhythm of membrane disposal in rods and cones is a general property of vertebrate <b>visual</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Alterations {{produced}} by iodoacetate in <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> {{have been studied}} under the electron microscope. Lesions of the outer segments of the rods are visible as early as 3 hours after a single injection of 20 mg. iodoacetate per kg. body weight. After 6 hours the changes are more marked and consist then of disorganization, vesiculation, and lysis of the rod sacs. The inner segments of most rod cells show swelling and vacuolization of the matrix, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi complex. The mitochondria of the ellipsoid show a tendency to disintegrate. In some inner segments the changes consist primarily {{in an increase in}} density of the matrix and deposition of a granular material. The rod synapses are also affected, showing lysis of the synaptic vesicles and alterations of the synaptic membrane. With a second injection of 20 mg. iodoacetate per kg. body weight, all these changes become more marked and lead to complete destruction of the rod cells. The cones seem more resistant than the rods. A single injection produces no visible changes in the outer or inner segments of the cones. At cone synapses, however, there are changes consisting of fusion of synaptic vesicles and other membranous material to form large concentric membranes characteristic of myelin figures. A second dose of the drug causes complete destruction of the cone cells. All these, and other submicroscopic changes, are discussed in relation to various hypotheses put forward to explain the mode of action of iodoacetate on <b>visual</b> <b>cells.</b> The pronounced alterations of submicroscopic intracellular membranes suggest that the locus of action of iodoacetate may be a component widely dispersed throughout the <b>visual</b> <b>cells</b> and related, in some way, to the maintenance of these lipoprotein structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{renewal of}} fatty acids {{in the visual}} cells and pigment {{epithelium}} of the frog retina was studied by autoradiographic analysis of animals injected with tritiated palmitic, stearic, or arachidonic acids. Most of the radioactive material could be extracted from the retina with chloroform-methanol, indicating that the fatty acids had been esterified in lipids. Analysis of the extracts, after injection of [3 H]palmitic acid, revealed that the radioactivity was predominantly in phospholipid. Palmitic acid was initially concentrated in the pigment epithelium, particularly in oil droplets which are storage sites for vitamin A esterified with fatty acid. The cytoplasm, but not the nucleus of these cells, was also heavily labeled. Radioactive fatty acid was bound immediately to the <b>visual</b> <b>cell</b> outer segment membranes, including detached rod membranes which had been phagocytized by the pigment epithelium. This {{is believed to be}} due to fatty acid exchange in phospholipid molecules already situated in the membranes. Gradually, the concentration of radioactive material in the <b>visual</b> <b>cell</b> outer segment membranes increased, apparently {{as a result of the}} addition of new phospholipid molecules, possibly augmented by the transfer from the pigment epithelium of esterified vitamin A. Injected fatty acid became particularly concentrated in new membranes which are continually assembled at the base of rod outer segments. This localized concentration was short-lived, apparently due to the rapid renewal of fatty acid. The results support the conclusion that rods renew the lipids of their outer segments by membrane replacement, whereas both rods and cones renew the membrane lipids by molecular replacement, including fatty acid exchange and replacement of phospholipid molecules in existing membranes...|$|E
