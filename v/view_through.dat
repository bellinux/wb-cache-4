5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed <b>view</b> <b>through</b> the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

25|$|Recently, a new {{lesson was}} {{introduced}} in the Junior School: Thinking Skills.

25|$|Pro-Chinese {{materials}} may {{be published}} by mainstream Western printers, or within the People's Republic of China.

25|$|Multifocal {{contact lenses}} (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are {{comparable}} to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing {{through the center of}} the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to <b>view</b> <b>through</b> the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).|$|E

25|$|For {{professional}} matches, often {{one or more}} of the stumps is {{hollow and}} contains a small television camera. This is aligned vertically, but can <b>view</b> <b>through</b> a small window on the side of the stump via a mirror.

25|$|The city of Orvieto {{has long}} kept {{the secret of}} its {{labyrinth}} of caves and tunnels that lie beneath the surface. Dug deep into the tuff, a volcanic rock, these secret hidden tunnels are now only open to <b>view</b> <b>through</b> guided tours. Their spectacular nature has also yielded many historical and archeological finds. Saint Anselm College {{has set up a}} program where each summer, students travel to Italy to work at the college’s archaeology site located at the Coriglia excavation site, just outside town.|$|E

25|$|Also {{strongly}} {{critical of}} reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained {{to the contrary}} that mind {{is the reality of}} which we are in fact most certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his <b>view,</b> <b>through</b> a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.|$|E
25|$|During the Ten Days' Campaign {{undertaken}} by the Dutch in 1830 after the Belgian Revolution, a Dutch garrison bombarded Antwerp. The church was damaged and all the 17th century stained glass windows, made after designs by Abraham van Diepenbeeck, were destroyed. In 1833 {{the interior of the}} church was changed: the rood screen dating from 1654, which had been executed by Pieter Verbruggen II and his workshop was dismantled to allow an unobstructed <b>view</b> <b>through</b> the nave to the choir. A new rood screen had previously been built on the western side of the nave.|$|E
25|$|The main {{impression}} that historians once retained from the Historia focused on Gregory's anecdotes about violence; until recently, historians tended {{to conclude that}} Merovingian Gaul was a chaotic, brutal mess. Recent scholarship has refuted that <b>view.</b> <b>Through</b> more careful readings, scholars have concluded that Gregory's underlying purpose was to highlight the vanity of secular life and contrast it with the miracles of the Saints. Though Gregory conveys political and other messages through the Historia, and these are studied very closely, historians now generally agree that this contrast is the central and ever-present narrative device.|$|E

25|$|Bifocal, trifocal, and {{progressive}} lenses generally require a taller lens shape to {{leave room for}} the different segments while preserving an adequate field of <b>view</b> <b>through</b> each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting myopic prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began {{to be seen as}} an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.|$|E
25|$|To {{consolidate}} {{his political}} power in the Équateur Province, Bolikango summoned a congress to Lisala that lasted from 24 March to 3 April. Like his own party, the other political groups of the Équateur lacked the necessary support to make significant gains in the upcoming independent elections. Bolikango was eager to win a prominent government office and aimed to form a broad coalition with the Ngombe, Mongo, and Ngwaka peoples and other minorities in the province to achieve it. This could be best accomplished, in his <b>view,</b> <b>through</b> an alliance of his own groups, the FUB and ASSORECO, with UNIMO, FEDUNEC, UNILAC, and local chiefs who had not already put their support behind the PNP.|$|E
25|$|The {{downside}} {{of the new}} units was the more restricted <b>view</b> <b>through</b> the windows. The Mark 3 bodyshell has a much higher window sill level than the first generation DMUs and moreover the alignment of the windows with the seating positions is poor, a problem common to much Mk 3 derived stock. The view is especially poor for passengers seated nearest to the doors, whose view is obscured by the pockets into which the doors slide when opened, or {{at the ends of}} the vehicle. Also unlike the first generation DMUs, the rear of the driver's cab was not glazed, so passengers in the front seats no longer had a view of the track ahead, which was regretted both by railfans and children.|$|E

25|$|Faraz then, {{keeping the}} name of Mizraab, began his solo project. In the summers of 1999, he went on {{recording}} his solo album at Digital Fidelity Studios in Lahore, Punjab, where his work was well received. Faraz then recorded and released his instrumental solo album, An Abstract Point of <b>View,</b> <b>through</b> the American-based record label Gnarly Geezer Records, owned by Allan Holdsworth, in 2001. It {{is only the second}} guitar-based instrumental album to have been produced in Pakistan. The album got rave reviews from musicians all over the world hailing Faraz as a great guitar find from Asia. On the other hand, Faraz also continued performing for the death metal band called Dusk, which included famous musician and director Babar Sheikh, and released its debut album My Infinite Nature Alone.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as {{welding goggles}} should be worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear <b>view</b> <b>through</b> the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hijackers}} noticed the airstars moving towards them, they {{recognised}} the imminent assault. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, {{it became apparent}} that it was elevated too much higher than the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to the an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs. After a short delay in re positioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their <b>view.</b> <b>Through</b> a window, Borderie jumped out of the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers {{in the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|E
