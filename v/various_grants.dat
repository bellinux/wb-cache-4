5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, the prefectural {{government}} of Hokkaidō, Japan's northernmost island, were offering <b>various</b> <b>grants</b> and incentives for mainland Japanese groups willing to relocate there. At the time, Hokkaidō was still largely unsettled by the Japanese, being occupied primarily by the indigenous Ainu. In 1910, Ueshiba travelled to Hokkaidō in the company of his acquaintance Denzaburo Kurahashi, who had lived on the northern island before. His intent was to scout out a propitious location for a new settlement, and he found the site at Shirataki suitable for his plans. Despite the hardships he suffered on this journey (which included getting lost in snowstorms several times and an incident in which he nearly drowned in a freezing river), Ueshiba returned to Tanabe filled with enthusiasm for the project, and began recruiting families to join him. He became the leader of the Kishū Settlement Group, a collective of eighty-five pioneers who intended to settle in the Shirataki district and live as farmers; the group founded the village of Yubetsu (later Shirataki village) in August, 1912. Much of the funding for this project came from Ueshiba's father and his brothers-in-law Zenzo and Koshiro Inoue. Zenzo's son Noriaki was also a member of the settlement group.|$|E

25|$|Pancartes were medieval {{historical}} documents, {{drawn up}} by a monastery, that recorded a sequence of gifts to the monastery. They were created in order that the whole group of grants or gifts could be confirmed by the ruler. They are known from Normandy and other northern French regions. Sometimes they were created {{over a number of}} years as successive gifts were added to the original document. Generally the <b>various</b> <b>grants</b> were tied together with a narrative, usually quite short, that linked the various gifts to a short history of the religious house. These documents were a frequent product of monastic houses in Normandy during the early 11th century and afterwards. Normally, they were not a product of the lay administration's chanceries, but came from ecclesiastical sources.|$|E

The Government sought Gresham's advice in all their money difficulties, and also frequently employed him in various diplomatic missions.

500|$|The North-West Mounted Police {{was created}} as a {{consequence}} of the expansion of the newly formed Dominion of Canada into the North-West Territories during the 1870s. The Dominion had been formed in 1867 by the confederation of the British colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, but the extensive lands to the north-west remained governed by the Hudson's Bay Company. The new Dominion government was keen to expand westwards, in part due to fears that the United States might annex the region. It agreed to purchase the company's lands in exchange for £300,000 and <b>various</b> <b>grants</b> of land, adding around [...] of territory to the Dominion in 1871.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the English Civil War, the exiled King Charles II of England hoped {{to shore up}} the loyalty of several of his supporters by granting them a significant area of mostly uncharted land to control as a Proprietary in [...] Virginia (a claim that would only be valid were the king to return to power). While {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Virginia Colony, the proprietary maintained complete control of the granting of land within that territory (and revenues obtained from it) until after the American Revolution. The grant was for the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, which included the titular Northern Neck, but as time went on also would include all of what is today Northern Virginia and into West Virginia. Due to ambiguities of the text of the <b>various</b> <b>grants</b> causing disputes between the proprietary and the colonial government, the tract was finally demarcated via the Fairfax Line in 1746.|$|E
