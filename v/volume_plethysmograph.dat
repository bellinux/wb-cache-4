40|$|Historical {{background}} of the measuring, partitioning and correlating of resistance was reviewed, and the theory behind the indirect estimation of upstream resistance explained. The oscillator with <b>volume</b> <b>plethysmograph</b> enabled study of volume history effect on lower (obtained from a tracheal catheter) and total pulmonary resistance. An adaptation of the upstream resistance estimation was used. Each study was done both pre and post atropine. Each test showed inflation resistance greater than deflation. This hysteresis was greatly reduced after atropine. It was considered due to bronchomotor tone. Lower pulmonary resistance {{was found to be}} very low and much more sensitive to airway change than total pulmonary resistance, and showed an increase at TLC. Inflation partial expiratory flow volume curves were considered the best indicators of bronchodilation particularly due to their simplicity. All tests showed that airway calibre depended on the balance between elastic recoil pressure and smooth muscle tone...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{subjects}} {{showing an}} increase of residual volume (RV) without any clinical or functional signs of bronchial obstruction were studied. Maximum expiratory flow volume (MEFV) curves were obtained with a pressure-corrected <b>volume</b> <b>plethysmograph.</b> Static pressure-volume curves were obtained by stepwise interruption of a slow expiration from total lung capacity (TLC) to RV. Static compliance {{was measured by the}} slope of pressure-volume curve between functional residual capacity (FRC) and FRC+ 20 % of TLC. Maximum flow static recoil (MFSR) curves were constructed by plotting MEF obtained from MEFV curves against elastic pressure (Pst) obtained from pressure-volume curves at the same lung volumes. Most patients demonstrated a decrease of MEF 50 % and 25 % of VC. From the MFSR curves it was clear that this reduction was not the result of increased airways resistance, but rather of loss of elastic recoil. Most patients showed a significant decrease of Pst at different volumes and changes seem likely to be evidence of emphysema...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} how the presence of generalised airflow limitation due to chronic obstructive lung disease affects the recognition of simulated upper airway obstruction, a study {{was carried out in}} 12 patients (mean (SD) age 57 (7) years) with chronic obstructive lung disease (FEV 1 % predicted 53 (22), range 21 - 70) and 12 matched control subjects. Patients and control subjects performed maximal inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume curves in a variable <b>volume</b> <b>plethysmograph</b> with and without upper airway obstruction simulated at the mouth with a series of polythene washers of internal diameter 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm. In patients, as in normal subjects, peak expiratory flow (PEF) and maximum inspiratory flow at 50 % of vital capacity (Vmax 50) were more sensitive to upper airway obstruction than were FEV 1 or maximum expiratory flow at 50 % VC (VEmax 50); but the reductions in all indices caused by simulated upper airway obstruction were smaller in the patients than in the controls. The fall in PEF (whether expressed in absolute units or as a percentages) consequent on severe (4 mm) upper airway obstruction became smaller with increasing severity of chronic obstructive lung disease. The subjects also produced flow-volume curves with and without 6 mm upper airway obstruction while breathing helium and oxygen (heliox). In both groups the effects of heliox on PEF and Vmax 50 were increased when upper airway obstruction was simulated. It was confirmed that the functional recognition of upper airway obstruction is more difficult in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease than in normal subjects and this difficulty increases with severity of disease; an unusually large increase in PEF or Vmax 50 while the patient is breathing heliox should raise the suspicion of coexisting upper airway obstruction, but such a pattern is not specific...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between lung mechanics and ventilation distribution is of considerable current interest to pulmonary physiolo-gists, {{it is not a}} new subject. Indeed, Dixon and Brodie published a classic paper exactly 70 years ago dealing with this topic (1) 12 years before Rohrer’s famous treatise (2). As they were among the first in-vestigators to become interested in this topic, and because I do not be-lieve that they have received due credit for their remarkable contribu-tion I will review their paper at some length. You will find that they anticipated many topics currently of interest to pulmonary physiologists. To the best of my knowledge, Dixon and Brodie were the first to distinguish experimentally between changes in the lung’s elastic proper-ties and changes in flow resistance when overall mechanical properties of the lungs were altered by experimental manipulation. The experi-mental set-up which allowed them todo this was ingenious. They en-cased a lobe in viva in a <b>volume</b> displacement <b>plethysmograph</b> and re...|$|R
50|$|A medical {{procedure}} {{is defined as}} non-invasive when no break in the skin is created {{and there is no}} contact with the mucosa, or skin break, or internal body cavity beyond a natural or artificial body orifice. For example, deep palpation and percussion are non-invasive but a rectal examination is invasive. Likewise, examination of the ear-drum or inside the nose or a wound dressing change all fall outside the definition of non-invasive procedure. There are many non-invasive procedures, ranging from simple observation, to specialised forms of surgery, such as radiosurgery. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy is a non-invasive treatment of stones in the kidney,gallbladder or liver, using an acoustic pulse. For centuries, physicians have employed many simple non-invasive methods based on physical parameters in order to assess body function in health and disease (physical examination and inspection), such as pulse-taking, the auscultation of heart sounds and lung sounds (using the stethoscope), temperature examination (using thermometers), respiratory examination, peripheral vascular examination, oral examination, abdominal examination, external percussion and palpation, blood pressure measurement (using the sphygmomanometer), change in body <b>volumes</b> (using <b>plethysmograph),</b> audiometry, eye examination, and many others.|$|R
30|$|Rats with nose-only {{exposure}} to phosgene exhibited an instant ≈ 50 % depression in respiratory minute <b>volumes</b> on volume-displacement <b>plethysmographs</b> {{when exposed to}} 744 and 1428  mg phosgene/m 3  × min [37]. Partial recovery occurred shortly after the nadir of this response was reached (Fig.  1). However, recording the apnea time (AT), the period between two breathing cycles (see insert of Fig.  1), revealed a rapid ≈fivefold increase in AT. At exposure concentrations of both 24.8 and 47.6  mg/m 3, a similar increase occurred up to ≈ 10  min of exposure, followed by a decrease toward normal breathing at 24.8  mg/m 3. At 47.6  mg/m 3, the opposite occurred when a cumulative exposure dose of ≈ 1000  mg/m 3  × min was attained (stepped line in Fig.  1, upper panel). The POD from reflexively related changes suggestive of progressive loss in the control of pulmonary mechanics coincided with the LCt 01 threshold occurring 10 – 20  h post-exposure.|$|R
40|$|Viewers' {{preference}} for multimedia selection depends highly on their emotional experience. In this paper, we present an emotion detection method for music videos using central and {{peripheral nervous system}} physiological signals as well as multimedia content analysis. A set of 40 music clips eliciting {{a broad range of}} emotions were first selected. After extracting the one minute long emotional highlight of each video, they were shown to 32 participants while their physiological responses were recorded. Participants self-reported their felt emotions after watching each clip by means of arousal, valence, dominance, and liking ratings. The physiological signals included electroencephalogram, galvanic skin response, respiration pattern, skin temperature, electromyograms and blood <b>volume</b> pulse using <b>plethysmograph.</b> Emotional features were extracted from the signals and the multimedia content. The emotional features were used to train a linear ridge regressor to detect emotions for each participant using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The performance of the personalized emotion detection is shown to be significantly superior to a random regressor...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{method for}} measuring effective pulmonary capillary blood flow (Qc eff) in infants {{has been developed}} with an adaptation of the plethysmographic technique. Measurements were made on 19 preterm. 14 small-for-dates, and 7 fullterm normal infants with a constant <b>volume</b> whole body <b>plethysmograph</b> in which the infant rebreathed nitrous oxide. There was a highly significant correlation between Qc eff and body weight, and this relationship was unaffected by premature delivery or intrauterine growth retardation. Mean Qc eff in preterm, small-for dates, and fullterm infants was 203, 208 and 197 ml min- 1 kg- 1, respectively, with {{no significant differences between}} the groups. A significant negative correlation existed between Qc eff and haematocrit in the preterm infants. There was no relationship between weight standardized Qc eff and postnatal age in any of the groups. With this technique, it was possible to readily recognise the presence of rapid recirculation (indicative of shunting) in several of the infants, suggesting that rebreathing methods for the assessment of Qc eff should not be applied indiscriminately during the neonatal period. By taking care to overcome the potential sources of technical error, it was possible to obtain highly reproducible results of Qc eff in infants over a wider age range than has been previously reported...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of traditional systems {{of medicine and}} of certain traditional medical practices has now been recognized all over the world. Aim: The present {{study was designed to}} study anti-inflammatory activity of fruit of Emblica officinalis in albino rats and compare with standard agent Diclofenac. Material &Methods: Anti-inflammatory activity 3 methods were used. Carrageenan induced rat paw edema method (Acute inflammation), in which 5 animals (3 groups) received orally 4 % gum acacia, Diclofenac sodium and E. officinalis powder respectively, 1 hour before carrageenan injection into right paw. The paw edema <b>volume</b> measured with <b>plethysmograph</b> after 3 hours and percentage inhibition of edema in various groups calculated. Rexin pellet granuloma method (Chronic inflammation), in which 4 rexin pellets were implanted into dorsum skin of each rat of 3 groups (n= 5), which include control, Diclofenac and E. officinalis powder respectively. Rats were daily fed drugs for 7 days and on th 08 day rexin pellets were removed after sacrificing animals. Rexin pellets were kept in incubator at 60 C overnight. Pellets were then weighed and percent inhibition of granuloma tissue was calculated. Leukocyte emigration rat paw edema method, Result: Fruit of E. officinalis showed significant anti-inflammatory activity, in both acute as well as chronic model of inflammation comparable to diclofenac. Conclusion: E. officinalis may be used as potential herbal drug for both acute and chronic inflammation due to their anti-inflammatory property...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects on}} the airways of {{inhalation}} of the vehicles used in two commercial pressurized bronchodilator aerosols were studied in 20 normal and seven asthmatic subjects. Changes in bronchial calibre due to bronchoconstriction were measured as changes in airway resistance using a constant <b>volume</b> whole body <b>plethysmograph,</b> and results were expressed as changes in the ratio Airway conductance/Thoracic gas volume (=specific airway conductance). The aerosols caused very slight bronchoconstriction in the normal subjects, with a mean decrease of 5 · 3 % in specific airway conductance after inhalation of a spray containing sorbitol trioleate as a surface tension lowering agent, and of 9 · 7 % after inhalation of a spray containing lecithin. This effect was prevented by prior inhalation of atropine methonitrate, and its mechanism was therefore probably a vagally mediated reflex. The bronchoconstriction was also reversed {{by the addition of}} isoprenaline to the aerosol. The asthmatic subjects showed larger mean reductions in specific airway conductance of 13 % and 21 % after sorbitol and lecithin respectively: the response was again prevented by atropine. We conclude that, although the aerosol vehicles cause slight bronchoconstriction, this is unlikely to be a clinical danger since it is insufficient to cause symptoms of wheezing, and is less than that caused by inhalation of a single cigarette. Moreover, the constriction is regularly converted to dilatation in both normal and asthmatic subjects by the addition of atropine or isoprenaline to the aerosol...|$|R
