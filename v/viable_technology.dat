Inspired by the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus, the Titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, Georgescu terms fire 'the first Promethean recipe'. According to Georgescu, a later important Promethean recipe (technology) of the same (first) kind was animal husbandry, feeding on grass and other biomass (like fire does).|$|E

50|$|Intact protein {{expression}} spectrometry (IPEx) is a label-free quantification {{approach in}} mass spectrometry under development by the analytical chemistry {{group at the}} United States Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and elsewhere. Intact proteins are analyzed by an LCMS instrument, usually a quadrupole time-of-flight in profile mode, and the full protein profile is determined and quantified using data reduction software. Early results are very encouraging. In one study, two groups of treatment replicates from mammalian samples (different organisms with similar treatment histories, but not technical replicates) show dozens of low CV protein biomarkers, suggesting that IPEx is a <b>viable</b> <b>technology</b> for studying protein expression.|$|E
5000|$|In 1917, AT&T {{invented the}} first American {{air-to-ground}} radio transmitter. [...] They tested this device at Langley Field in Virginia {{and found it}} was a <b>viable</b> <b>technology.</b> [...] In May 1917, General George Squier of the U.S. Army Signal Corps contacted AT&T to develop an air-to-ground radio {{with a range of}} 2,000 yards. By July 4 of that same year, AT&T technicians achieved two-way communication between pilots and ground personnel. This allowed ground personnel to communicate directly with pilots using their voices instead of Morse code. Though few of these devices saw service in the war, they proved this was a viable and valuable technology worthy of refinement and advancement.|$|E
50|$|FOUPs {{began to}} appear along with the first 300mm wafer {{processing}} tools in the mid 1990s. The size of the wafers and their comparative lack of rigidity meant that SMIF was not a <b>viable</b> <b>technology.</b> FOUPs were designed with the constraints of 300mm in mind, with the removable cassette being replaced by fins in the FOUP which hold the wafers in place, and the bottom opening door being replaced by a front opening door to allow robot handling mechanisms to access the wafers directly from the FOUP. The weight of a fully loaded 25 wafer FOUP at around 9 kilograms means that automated material handling systems are essential {{for all but the}} smallest of fabrication plants.|$|E
5000|$|NIUST {{is focused}} on {{national}} and global research issues, and specifically on development of new products from the sea and new technologies for exploring the sea's harsh and extreme environments. NIUST is composed of three Core Divisions: the Ocean Biotechnology Center & Repository (OBCR), established to create a national repository of marine organisms specifically {{for use by the}} biotechnology sector; the Seabed Technology Research Center (STRC), focused on the research and development of <b>viable</b> <b>technologies</b> for the operation and development of remote sensor and direct sampling technologies for the investigation of the deep sea; and the Undersea Vehicles Technology Center (UVTC), focused on the research and development of <b>viable</b> <b>technologies</b> for the operation and development of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) Each NURC solicits proposals from the research community and awards funding [...] only after the proposal has gone through a comprehensive peer review process and has been judged to be relevant to the mission of NURP and NOAA. The technology required to conduct the research is generally provided by NURP; however, it is often necessary to develop new technologies and methodologies. Scientific reviewers are often hesitant to provide research dollars for unproven concepts; so technology development is usually left to the larger institutions and research centers such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institution, the Naval Underwater Warfare Fighting Center, and the Stennis Space Center.|$|R
5000|$|Green banks {{focus on}} commercially <b>viable</b> <b>technologies,</b> {{as opposed to}} early-stage {{innovative}} technologies, {{because they have been}} tested, have less associated “technology risk” and can reliably produce revenue for project owners. [...] Green banks are public-purpose entities with some manner of a relationship with government, and are usually capitalized by public dollars. [...] Just like a commercial bank, green banks lend capital and own debt, so it is important they have their own balance sheet. Green banks also focus on using their capital to facilitate private entry into the clean energy market—specifically by using limited public dollars to leverage private investment in clean energy.|$|R
