50|$|The {{limnology}} of reservoirs {{has many}} similarities {{to that of}} lakes of equivalent size. There are however significant differences.

Originally the lake was susceptible to <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>level</b> and flooding along its shoreline.

40|$|Europe {{displays}} important <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> the <b>level</b> {{of internal}} migration, {{with a clear}} spatial gradient of high mobility in northern and western Europe but lower mobility {{in the south and}} east. However, cross-national <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> of internal migration remains poorly understood, because it is analysed almost exclusively using cross-sectional data and period measures. This paper seeks to advance understanding of cross-national <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> migration <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> 14 European countries by drawing on a recently proposed suite of migration cohort measures, coupled with internationally comparable retrospective residential histories. It shows that differences <b>in</b> migration <b>levels</b> are mainly attributable to <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> the extent of repeat movement, which is underpinned by the differences in mean ages at first and last move that together delineate the average length of migration careers.

40|$|Classic {{studies in}} {{political}} sociology argued {{that differences in}} countries' patterns of mobility are responsible for <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> of class voting in these countries. In this paper the tenability of this classic claim is examined using survey data from 14 long-standing Western democracies over the period 1964 – 1990 (N= 54 478). When testing this claim, we improved over earlier studies by employing detailed measures of class, by using multivariate statistical models that measure relative levels of class voting and by employing diagonal reference models that deal adequately {{with the effects of}} individual intergenerational class mobility. Our results show significant effects of individual intergenerational mobility. The longer mobile persons are members of a certain class the more they are apt to show the typical voting behaviour of their destination class. However, our results do not support the claim for the effects of intergenerational mobility at the macro <b>level.</b> <b>Variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> of mobility can only to a very modest extent – if at all – be held responsible for cross-national and over-time <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> of class votin...|$|R
50|$|The {{relationship}} between testosterone and female sexual reproduction motivation is somewhat ambiguous.

In particular, studies with rhesus macaques have observed testosterone was not significantly associated with <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>level</b> of sexual reproduction motivation in females. However, some research with nonhuman primates suggests a role for androgens in female sexual reproduction behaviour. Adrenalectomized female rhesus monkeys displayed diminished female sexual receptivity. Later studies revealed this diminished sexual receptivity was specific to the elimination of androgens that {{can be converted to}} estrogen.|$|E

While some believe that this trend {{is a result of}} processing trade and foreign direct investment, the evidence is mixed. This paper examines <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>level</b> of export sophistication across China’s manufacturing industries. We find that an industry’s level of export sophistication is positively related to the share of wholly foreign owned enterprises from OECD countries and the share of processing exports of foreign-invested enterprises, and negatively related to the share of processing exports of indigenous Chinese enterprises. Evidence from the relative export prices of Chinese goods, which measure within-product export sophistication, shows a similar pattern...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability to}} {{identify}} and accurately measure traits at the phenotypic interface of potential coevolutionary interactions is critical in documenting reciprocal evolutionary change between species. We quantify the defensive chemical trait of a prey species, the newt Taricha granulosa, thought {{to be part of}} a coevolutionary arms race. <b>Variation</b> <b>in</b> newt toxicity among populations results from <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>levels</b> of the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX).

The study attempted to identify significant predictors of level of social capital in the farmers’ l organisations (FOs) operating in Akwa Ibom State of Nigeria. Results derived from 225 members of 15 FOs reveal that 7 factors significantly predicted the level of social participation, viz: status of respondent, age of respondent, ages of respondents’ children, number of years of FO affiliation, multiple group membership, mode of generation of funds for FO activities and relationship of FO member with information source for affiliation. Status and age of respondents; however contributed about 65 % of the <b>variations</b> <b>in</b> <b>level</b> of social participation.

We found important differences with other saline lakes: the species richness was lower; the mean abundance of zooplankton was between four and six times higher; and rotifers, which were not affected by salinity or the concentration of inorganic suspended solids, were numerically predominant. Crustaceans, on the other hand, were negatively affected by these environmental factors. Biomass was twofold higher than that recorded in the same period in two shallow lakes of Pampa, with similar nutrient concentrations but lower salinities...|$|E
