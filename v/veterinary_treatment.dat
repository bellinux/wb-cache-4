The tanks and filter system, totaling some 81,000 gallons of fresh-water, can accommodate 5 adult manatees and 10 calves in rehabilitation. The life support building contains 12 commercial rapid-sand filters and 16 IntelliFlo pumps that process all water every 50 minutes allowing for excellent water quality that it is both healthy for the manatees and adequate for public viewing.

25|$|Pyometra (or a pus filled womb) ('Pyo' = pus; 'metra' = uterus or womb) is a {{life-threatening}} condition that requires emergency <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment.</b> The {{risk of a}} non-spayed bitch developing pyometra by age 10 is 25% across all breeds, but can {{be as high as}} 54% in some breeds. The treatment of choice for a closed-pyometra (where the cervix is closed and the pus cannot drain) is admission to hospital, commencement on intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics and, once stable enough for the anaesthetic and surgery, emergency removal of the infected pus-filled uterus. Medical management can be attempted if the animal's condition allows (for example {{in the case of an}} 'open' pyometra where the pus drains per-vaginum from the uterus via the open cervix) or dictates (where the animal is too old or otherwise unwell to withstand surgery), if the owner wishes to keep the dog entire to breed or if the owner is unable to afford the veterinary fees associated with surgery. Emergency removal of the infected uterus carries a much higher degree of risk of death than a routine 'spay' operation. The risk of death from in dogs undergoing surgical treatment for pyometra is up to 17%. Thus the risk of death in entire female dogs from a pyometra, even if given correct veterinary attention can be up to 9% by 10 years of age (17% of 54%). This risk is reduced to virtually zero if spayed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the changes in production, herd health and <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments</b> in Danish organic dairy herds during {{approximately}} eleven years based on historic data from herds converted to organic milk production before 1990 (old organic herds) compared to herds converted in 1995 and 1999 - 2000 and herds that are still conventional. Herd size, milk production, {{the shape of the}} lactation curve, somatic cell counts and <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatments</b> for mastitis, retained placenta and ketosis are compared over time and between herd groups. The old organic herds differed from the other three herd groups by having lower milk production per cow, lower somatic cell counts and fewer treatments of mastitis. Herds converted in 1995 and 1999 - 2000 were comparable to the conventional herds before conversion for all analyzed parameters. However, herd size was larger than both the older organic herds and the conventional herds after conversion. Production was about 2 kg energy corrected milk lower per cow per day than before conversion and compared to the conventional herds. In the herds converted in 1999 - 2000 little difference could be seen in relation to udder health after conversion when compared to conventional herds. The organic herds had fewer treatments for retained placenta and ketosis than the conventional herds. The shape of the lactation curves changed over the 11 year period with better persistency from day 60 to day 305 in all herd groups except for the old organic herds, which had the best persistency in 1990. ...|$|R

By the time clinical signs are observed, the kidneys are usually too damaged for the dog to survive so acting quickly is important. Immediate treatments include inducing vomiting by using apomorphine or dilute hydrogen peroxide solution (if {{this can be done}} shortly after ingestion), but these merely reduce the amount absorbed [...] immediate <b>veterinary</b> <b>treatment</b> is still usually imperative due to the high toxicity of the compound. Medical treatments may include fomepizole (preferred treatment) which competes favorably with the toxin in the body, ethanol which competes favorably in the liver long enough to allow excretion to take place, activated charcoal to further reduce uptake of undigested product, and hemodialysis to remove toxins from the blood. Dogs should not be allowed access to any place in which an antifreeze leak or spill has happened until the spill is completely cleaned out.
