Also covered are a discussion of the Internet as a form of addiction, and related literature on this issue. This study used the Uses and Gratifications theory and the Play theory in mass communication. Nine hundred and ten <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> from 12 universities and colleges around Taiwan. The results indicated that Internet addiction does exist {{among some of}} Taiwan’s college students. In particular, 54 students were identified as Internet addicts. It was found that Internet addicts spent almost triple the number of hours connected to the Internet as compare to non-addicts, and spent significantly more time on BBSs, the WWW, e-mail and games than non-addicts. The addict group found the Internet entertaining, interesting, interactive, and satisfactory. The addict group rated Internet impacts on their studies and daily life routines significantly more negatively than the non-addict group. The study also found that the most powerful predictor of Internet addiction is the communication pleasure score, followed by BBS us...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate consumers’ knowledge of health risks of high salt intake and frequency of use and understanding of labelled salt information. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in shopping centres within Metropolitan Melbourne. A sample of 493 subjects was recruited. The questionnaire assessed salt related shopping behaviours, attitudes to salt intake and health and their ability to interpret labelled sodium information. Four hundred and seventy four <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> (65 % female, 64 % being the main shopper). Most participants knew of the relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure (88 %). Sixty five percent of participants were unable to correctly identify the relationship between salt and sodium. Sixty nine percent reported reading the salt content of food products when shopping. Salt label usage was significantly related to shoppers concern about the amount of salt in their diet and the belief that their health could improve by lowering salt intake. Approximately half of the sample was unable to accurately use labelled sodium information to pick low salt options. Raising consumer awareness of the health risks associated with high salt consumption may increase salt label usage and purchases of low salt foods. However, for food labels to be effective in helping consumers select low salt foods a more ‘user friendly’ labelling format is needed. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} of Americans over age 65 {{is expected to}} increase from a reported 12 percent in 1988 to 22 percent by the year 2030. Nutrition screening and intervention can help combat the rising need for health care and other services among the elderly by preventing or delaying disability and dependency. This study was designed to determine the degree of nutritional risk present within the elderly population in rural and urban areas in the state of Utah by conducting an initial nutrition screening using the Determine Your Nutritional Health checklist developed by the Nutrition Screening Initiative. Congregate meal sites were stratified according to urbanization and fifteen centers were selected from both rural and urban counties. Congregate meal participants present at the site completed a Determine Your Nutritional Health checklist and survey asking additional demographic data including age, sex, marital status, living situation, frequency of participation in congregate meals, and if they had previously used the checklist. A total of 838 <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>was</b> <b>collected</b> from 29 congregate meal sites throughout the state of Utah. Fifty-seven percent of participants scored in the 2 ̆ 2 good nutritional health 2 ̆ 2 category, 27. 7 percent were at moderate nutrition risk, and 15. 4 percent scored in the high nutrition risk category. Nutrition risk category was significantly associated with gender, marital status, and cohabitation status. Women, unmarrieds, and individuals living alone scored more frequently in a higher nutrition risk category. Results of this study reflect influences on nutrition risk found in a sample of congregate meal participants in the state of Utah. These results can help the state of Utah identify the common risk factors within this segment of its population, i. e. gender, marital status, cohabitation status, acute/chronic disease, eating alone, and polypharmacy, to plan education and/or intervention for individuals who are at risk...|$|R

40|$|University life {{of today}} {{is full of}} challenges. News of school {{involved}} bad incidents has all become too common. In Taiwan, students are also faced with many pressures and problems. Problems such as academic stress, future job uncertainty, and interpersonal relationships {{are just some of}} the interrelated complications easily found in universities. To address this issue, the current mixed-method study uses a series of focus group sessions in order to solicit the various issues surrounding students’ day to day in-campus life challenges and their corresponding coping strategies. A survey questionnaire was then formulated from the results of the focus group sessions. A total of 123 <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected.</b> Data collected were analyzed together with their corresponding demographical backgrounds such as: gender, year level of study, place of living, working or non-working students, and course of study. Results show that the common students’ related complications are health problems, future career issues, lessons and examinations, learning difficulties, self-efficacy issues, interpersonal difficulties, time management, and stress causing issues. Statistical analyses were accomplished resulting to significant students’ school problems determining background factors such as students’ course of study, gender, working or non-working students, and place of living. While no significant differences were found on the common students’ coping strategies. Lastly, there seems to be a high correlation between the students’ problems and coping strategies within the stress causing issues, suggesting that stress related issues to be the root cause of major complications for university students in Taiwan...|$|E

The employees in the state-owned units andother companies from 31 provinces/autonomous regions were surveyed. A total of 1, 036 <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> in June 2008. The result indicated that 70. 08 % of the respondents were willing to pay for the conservation of the rare and endangered species. The average WTP bids of all the respondents were 127. 82 RMB yuan per year. We also analyzed the correlation between the respondents’ characteristics and their WTP bids using the contingency table and the Chi-square test for independence. The results indicated that WTP bids were mainly affected by age, education level, profession, personal income, the awareness of TGP, the attention paid to TGP, and the knowledge of the influence of TGP on the rare and endangered species. In conclusion, the economic values of conserving the rare and endangered species affected by TGP is 82. 19 × 108 RMB yuan per year.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} and understand how niche fashion startups brand toward Millennials. Millennials, also known as Generation Y, are becoming an important segment of the global population. Specifically, this study is designed to investigate if niche fashion brands successfully target and brand to Millennials consumers compared to mass-market brands on the following brand traits: brand self-congruency, perceived quality, brand prestige, brand loyalty, brand tribalism, and brand user image congruency. Design/methodology/approach –Two online surveys were conducted to compare Gap (mass- retailer) and Everlane (niche brand) on the seven brand components, and 46 <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected.</b> Findings – The study revealed that Everlane performed better than Gap on three branding elements (brand tribalism, brand user image congruency, and brand prestige suggesting that not only the Integrated Marketing Communications efforts taken by Everlane are targeting Millennials, but that through IMC, Everlane is crafting brand equity among the cohort. This study provides a model to study other Millennials and analyze the company against a comparable mass-market competitor. Research limitations/implications – Limitations for this study come from three sources: (1) the representativeness of the sample, (2) limited sampled brands, and (3) influence of other factors. Implications for brand managers, marketers, and retailers focus on strategies that influence the social and self-motivation for luxury consumption and level of brand consciousness. Originality/value – This research is unique and significant because it focuses on understanding the consumer behavior of Millennial consumers, an important segment in the market that is growing in market power. The study is the first to analyze new startups coined as ‘niche brands’ that are targeting Millennials and compare them to mass-market retailers...|$|E
40|$|The {{bottom of}} the pyramid market (BOP) {{comprises}} a huge customer size of approximately four billion globally; hence segmentation is necessary within this market. The Bottom of pyramid market refers to an aggregate of customers who survive on relatively low income levels. In this respect, youth in war-affected regions can {{be considered to be}} a segment of BOP market. However, there is scant research on customers’ attitudes and purchase behaviour in BOP markets or segments therein. Hence, the purpose of this research is to investigate war-affected youth’s attitudes towards microcredit and the related drivers of these attitudes. The literature revealed four types of attitudes towards microcredit, Positive Affect, Perceived Benefits, Perceived Deterrents and Default Risk Perceptions. Also, knowledge of microcredit and entrepreneurial desire were considered to be the drivers of these attitudes. A total of 795 <b>valid</b> completed <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> from youth aged 18 and above who live in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The findings revealed that positive affect enhanced intentions to obtain microcredit, whereas perceived deterrents reduced them. Knowledge of microcredit enhanced attitudes towards microcredit. Also, entrepreneurial desire enhanced the association between positive affect and intentions to obtain microcredit, and it decreased the negative association between perceived deterrents and intentions to obtain microcredit. The implications to theory and practice have been discussed which {{will go a long way}} in enhancing the attitudes towards microcredit amongst war-affected youth and possibly those in other segments of the BOP market...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was twofold. A primary goal was to investigate the perceived attractiveness of a series of tourism opportunities proposed for Prophetstown, a 19 th century Shawnee town in central Indiana with ties to Native American and U. S. military history in the Wabash Valley and the Old Northwest Territory to determine which activities would be the most appealing to culturally-minded travelers. The process involved identifying the range of the site 2 ̆ 7 s cultural assets with a proposed framework that facilitated the comparison of two different breakdowns of culture, one by the field of foundational field of anthropology and the other by UNESCO, transforming them into potential tourism activities and pre-testing their attractiveness among consumers before implementation. A secondary goal was to investigate the dimensionality of the proposed tourism opportunities for Prophetstown, while at the same time, validating the usefulness of the proposed framework in helping to identify and organize the site 2 ̆ 7 s cultural assets. ^ A total of 285 <b>valid</b> <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> at Mississinewa 1812, a central Indiana fall festival, which included perceived attractiveness scores for 48 culture-based tourism opportunities or activities and other key variables. Perceived attractiveness scores were used to analyze the dimensionality of the proposed culture-based activities with exploratory factor analysis in SPSS 16. 0. The resultant underlying seven-factor latent structure, which included all four factors from the proposed framework, was verified with confirmatory factory analysis in Amos 16. 0. Using a respondent 2 ̆ 7 s emotional involvement with culture as the exogenous variable and perceived attractiveness scores as endogenous variables for structural equation modeling (SEM), an unexpected result was the presence of conceptual linkages between passive and active elements within the latent structure, which can envisioned as a double binary pattern: tangible/intangible and passive/active. Additionally, emotional involvement with culture had a positive and significant relation with perceived attractiveness, and thus, the results of this research can be used to guide development that will appeal to culturally-engaged tourists. ^ Using the top ten most attractive tourism opportunities as the main guide, key recommendations included the introduction of culinary tourism combined with storytelling or folktales at Prophetstown. This recommendation stood true across all demographic groups including age, gender, education, as well as level of emotional and behavioral involvement with culture. Additionally, since seven of the top ten tourism opportunities were drawn from the realm of intangible culture, this area should be considered important for identifying other tourism opportunities. Finally, insights were garnered from taking {{a closer look at the}} top-ranked tourism opportunities segmented by gender, age and education, which can be used to guide future tourism development for targeted segments of the population. ...|$|E

A total of 420 self-reported <b>surveys</b> <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> and then <b>were</b> randomly selected to participate in an Ecocultural family interview (EFI). Bivariate correlations indicated that adolescent depression and family identity were moderately negatively correlated, as well as perceived parental support and depression. Since both family identity and perceived parental support where closely correlated with one another, specific cases were selected based on profiles of scores to better understand why some cases would not fit that pattern. The qualitative data from the EFI???s showed a relationship with spending more time together was associated with greater importance placed on family identity. The cases that described conflict with their families had low perceived parental support despite high family identity and spending time together.
