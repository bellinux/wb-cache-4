40|$|The primary {{function}} of a <b>vapour-tight</b> layer is to reduce or {{prevent the spread of}} humidity from the interior to other layers of the surrounding structures. This would otherwise result in condensation of (water) vapour due to a drop in temperature. In some cases, the behaviour of real structures differs from the structure modelled using a computational programme. This paper deals with the factors that can affect the features of a structure, specifically the internal and external surface temperature of curtain walling. The heat reflection effect of a <b>vapour-tight</b> layer was investigated on a model panel of curtain walling. An inadequate surface temperature can have a negative impact in that it promotes a biotic attack. This results in surface degradation which affects the continuous layers in the adjacent structures...|$|E
40|$|Most {{photovoltaic}} (PV) -modules have {{polymeric materials}} as encapsulants and back sheets. Usually these materials are not water <b>vapour-tight</b> and air-tight, but allow permeation of gases from the ambient atmosphere, especially oxygen and water vapour, which {{could contribute to}} degradation of the PV-modules. This work gives a short overview on how the permeation process through polymers takes place {{and how it is}} influenced by the material properties and ambient conditions. Results of permeation and diffusion measurements for water vapour as well as oxygen are shown for various encapsulation and back sheet materials with special focus on temperature dependence. The results demonstrate differences in permeability and temperature dependence for the investigated materials, but also show similarities for material groups. All investigated materials feature a Fickian behaviour within the measurement conditions even when crossing glass temperature or melting temperature. With these results, an Arrhenius-model was fitted to extrapolate permeation and diffusion values to a temperature range the PV-modules can be exposed to during lifetime...|$|E
