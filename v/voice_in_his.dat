At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's (Stewie) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper (Brian). As they travel further down the tracks, they are chased across a bridge by a train, which ends up running over Joey's legs, as does another train that follows closely behind, which effectively cripples him. The others end up going {{all the way back to}} Pressman's junkyard to get him a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
25|$|Oba is {{also aware}} of the second sorceress {{and the fact that}} she knows {{something}} concerning his fate or nature. He hires a guide to the swamp, which he safely negotiates as well. The sorceress reveals that Oba is now a thrall to the Keeper of the Underworld and kills herself before Oba can do the deed. This, along with the fact that his guide has stolen all his money, enrages Oba. He is mollified somewhat by the treasure he finds in the sorceresses' cottage, but his rage returns when, after returning to the People's Palace, he spots his guide. After killing the guide, he is briefly jailed but escapes, using the <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind to make the D'Haran guards do his bidding, and resolves to locate Richard Rahl.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, another sibling of Richard's, Oba Rahl, suffers {{under an}} abusive {{mother on the}} family farm. Oba imagines himself as {{energetic}} and the possessor of a healthy curiosity. His inquisitive nature manifests itself especially through pleasure in watching things die under his hand. Oba does not know that he, along with Jennsen, is pristinely ungifted and immune to magic. His mother sends him to a nearby sorceress to buy medicine, and, during the purchase, he begins to menace the magic user. Her attempts to defend herself with magic fail and Oba kills her brutally. During the fight, Oba surrenders to a <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind that promises invincibility in return for obedience. After returning home, Oba kills his mother and resolves to see the world. He can travel comfortably with the funds he looted from the sorceress.|$|E

500|$|McNeile had a quiet {{life after}} the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that [...] "as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the {{exciting}} life". Although he was an [...] "unremittingly hearty man", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and [...] "liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as [...] "not everybody's cup of tea", and commented that [...] "he was loud in every possible way—in his <b>voice,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life". McNeile {{and his wife had}} two sons.|$|E

500|$|Although Holst wrote a {{large number}} of works—particularly songs—during his student days and early adulthood, almost {{everything}} he wrote before 1904 he later classified as derivative [...] "early horrors". Nevertheless, the composer and critic Colin Matthews recognises even in these apprentice works an [...] "instinctive orchestral flair". Of the few pieces from this period which demonstrate some originality, Matthews pinpoints the G minor String Trio of 1894 (unperformed until 1974) as the first underivative work produced by Holst. Matthews and Imogen Holst each highlight the [...] "Elegy" [...] movement in The Cotswold Symphony (1899–1900) as among the more accomplished of the apprentice works, and Imogen discerns glimpses of her father's real self in the 1899 Suite de ballet and the Ave Maria of 1900. She and Matthews have asserted that Holst found his genuine <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> setting of Whitman's verses, The Mystic Trumpeter (1904), in which the trumpet calls that characterise Mars in The Planets are briefly anticipated. In this work, Holst first employs the technique of bitonality—the use of two keys simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|The Plankton {{character}} has garnered a generally positive reception over {{the run of}} SpongeBob SquarePants. In his review of the fourth season, Paul Mavis of DVD Talk stated that adult viewers would likely find Plankton more amusing than others, praising his [...] "hilariously stentorian" [...] <b>voice.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> review of the season eight episode [...] "Clash of Triton," [...] Mavis called Plankton [...] "the only secondary SpongeBob character who can [...] anchor his own short". Bettijane Levine of The Los Angeles Times wrote positively of Plankton's portrayal calling it poignant rather than genuinely immoral, describing him as a [...] "town meanie... but mean is different than evil. There is no evil, not even a sense of menace, in SpongeBob's soggy, safe world." [...] Ann Hagman Cardinal of Blogcritics praised the character, rhetorically asking in a 2007 review, [...] "who isn't tickled by the tight-jawed, Kirk Douglas-voiced Plankton with his silent moviesque evil plans to steal the secret recipe for the Krabby Patty?" [...] Boston.com writer Jamie Loftus had mixed feelings about Plankton in a 2015 article, asserting that while [...] "almost every episode featuring tiny supervillain Plankton is highly formulaic," [...] he never [...] "gets old".|$|E
500|$|Azaria {{became famous}} for his voice work in the ongoing {{animated}} television series The Simpsons. He joined the show having previously performed only one voice-over—as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot Hollywood Dog, a show he described as [...] "sort of Roger Rabbit-esque, where the dog was animated, but everybody else was real." [...] The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character's voice. Having known him from Hollywood Dog, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria {{and asked him to}} audition for the voice of Moe. At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacino's performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon. He used the <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> audition for The Simpsons and, {{at the request of the}} show's executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more [...] "gravelly". Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", dubbing Collins' voice.|$|E

500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, and those are the qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E

2500|$|Plato never {{speaks in}} his own <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dialogues. In the Second Letter, it says, [...] "no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become {{beautiful}} and new" [...] (341c); if the Letter is Plato's, the final qualification seems {{to call into question}} the dialogues' historical fidelity. In any case, Xenophon and Aristophanes seem to present a somewhat different portrait of Socrates from the one Plato paints. Some have called attention to the problem of taking Plato's Socrates to be his mouthpiece, given Socrates' reputation for irony and the dramatic nature of the dialogue form.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} titled Towards Understanding the Qur'an, Islamic thinker and philosopher Abul Ala Maududi cites {{a notion that}} [...] "Al-Khushoo of the heart is to fear and stand in awe of a {{powerful}} person, and al-Khushoo {{of the body is}} to bow one's head and lower one's gaze and <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> presence. In Salaah one is required to show al-Khushoo, both of the heart and of the body, and this is the essence of this Islamic Prayer. It has been reported that when Muhammad once saw a person offering Salaah, as well as playing with his beard, he remarked: [...] "Had he khushu in his heart, his body would have manifested it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, Bartók {{needed a}} {{significant}} piece for piano and orchestra {{with which he}} could tour in Europe and America. In the preparation for writing his First Piano Concerto, he wrote his Sonata, Out of Doors, and Nine Little Pieces, all for solo piano [...] He increasingly found his own <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> maturity. The style of his last period—named [...] "Synthesis of East and West" [...] —is hard to define let alone to put under one term. In his mature period, Bartók wrote relatively few works {{but most of them}} are large-scale compositions for large settings. Only his voice works have programmatic titles and his late works often adhere to classical forms.|$|E

As he did, he heard a weak <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes in his nose and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet.
