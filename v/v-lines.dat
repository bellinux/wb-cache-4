40|$|International audienceThe {{concept of}} Compton camera {{originates}} {{from the need}} to improve sensitivityin Single Photon Emission Imaging, which uses hole collimators. It advocates electronic collimation which registers radiation emitted by the radiating objectand scattered by a scattering detector placed before an absorption detector. The data consists of three dimensional conical projections of the activity density of a radio-tracer. An analytic reconstruction method of this density is presently not available. To evaluate its imaging power, we consider aparticular two-dimensional Compton camera in which the collected data consists of the set ofintegrals of the density on rotating <b>V-lines.</b> In this communication, we present simulation results obtainedfrom an algebraic reconstruction technique, which illustrate and validate the imagingcapability of this Compton camera modality...|$|E
40|$|The Compton {{camera is}} a {{promising}} {{alternative to the}} Anger camera for imaging gamma radiation, {{with the potential to}} significantly increase the sensitivity of SPECT. Two-dimensional Compton camera image reconstruction can be implemented by inversion of the V-line transform, which integrates the emission distribution over <b>V-lines</b> (unions of two half-lines), that have vertices on a surrounding detector array. Inversion of the V-line transform without attenuation has recently been addressed by several authors. However, it is well known from standard SPECT that ignoring attenuation can significantly degrade the quality of the reconstructed image. In this paper we address this issue and study the attenuated V-line transform accounting for attenuation of photons in SPECT with Compton cameras. We derive an analytic inversion approach based on circular harmonics expansion, and show uniqueness of reconstruction for the attenuated V-line transform. We further develop a discrete image reconstruction algorithm based on our analytic studies, and present numerical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the magnetism of the bare and graphene-covered (111) surface of a Ni single crystal employing three different magnetic imaging techniques and ab initio calculations, covering length scales from the nanometer regime up to several millimeters. With low temperature spinpolarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) we find domain walls with widths of 60 - 90 nm, which can be moved by small perpendicular magnetic fields. Spin contrast is also achieved on the graphene-covered surface, {{which means that the}} electron density in the vacuum above graphene is substantially spin-polarized. In accordance with our ab initio calculations we find an enhanced atomic corrugation with respect to the bare surface, due to the presence of the carbon pz orbitals {{and as a result of}} the quenching of Ni surface states. The latter also leads to an inversion of spinpolarization with respect to the pristine surface. Room temperature Kerr microscopy shows a stripe like domain pattern with stripe widths of 3 - 6 μm. Applying in-plane-fields, domain walls start to move at about 13 mT and a single domain state is achieved at 140 mT. Via scanning electron microscopy with polarization analysis (SEMPA) a second type of modulation within the stripes is found and identified as 330 nm wide <b>V-lines.</b> Qualitatively, the observed surface domain pattern originates from bulk domains and their quasi-domain branching is driven by stray field reduction...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Basic {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to compare two rabbit lines: <b>V-line</b> (exotic line), Alexandria (local synthetic line) for yield and composition of milk product and their effect on productive performance of rabbits. Materials and Methods: The experiment was conducted on 80 does and their kits. Milk yield (MY) of each doe and milk composition (MC) were recorded at 3 rd week of lactation. Results: The results of MY showed insignificant difference between <b>V-line</b> and Alexandria line. While the results of MC indicated significant differences in milk protein and fat between the two lines. The protein electrophoresis was used for assaying variation in milk proteins between the two lines. The banding protein patterns showed seven protein bands for Alexandria line and six bands for V line. The results demonstrated one specific protein marker at 48 KDa (?-casein) in Alexandria doe's milk. Moreover, the results of individual body weight at weaning age indicated that Alexandria rabbits had significantly higher body weight compared with <b>V-line</b> rabbits (845. 33 g, 664. 05 g, respectively).

40|$|Biochemical and {{molecular}} variations were investigated in three rabbit genotypes namely Alexandria, <b>V-line</b> and Baladi Black {{in order to}} find molecular genetic markers which can differentiate between studied animals.

40|$|AbstractSeveral novel imaging {{modalities}} proposed {{during the}} last couple of years are based on a mathematical model, which uses the <b>V-line</b> Radon transform (VRT). This transform, sometimes called broken-ray Radon transform, integrates a function along V-shaped piecewise linear trajectories composed of two intervals in the plane with a common endpoint. Image reconstruction problems in these modalities require inversion of the VRT. While there are ample results about inversion of the regular Radon transform integrating along straight lines, very little is known for the case of the <b>V-line</b> Radon transform. In this paper, we derive an exact inversion formula for the VRT of functions supported in a disc of arbitrary radius. The formula uses a two-dimensional restriction of VRT data, namely the incident ray is normal to the boundary of the disc, and the breaking angle is fixed. Our method is based on the classical filtered back-projection inversion formula of the Radon transform, and has similar features in terms of stability, speed, and accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Aim: In this study, we {{examined}} parts of six growth genes (growth hormone [GH], melanocortin 4 receptor [MC 4 R], growth hormone receptor [GHR], phosphorglycerate mutase [PGAM], myostatin [MSTN], and fibroblast growth factor [FGF]) as specific primers for two rabbit lines (<b>V-line,</b> Alexandria) using nucleotide sequence analysis, to investigate association between detecting {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) of these genes and body weight (BW) at market. Materials and Methods: Each line kits were grouped into high and low weight rabbits to identify DNA markers useful for association studies with high BW. DNA from blood samples of each group was extracted to amplify the six growth genes. SNP technique was used to study the associate polymorphism in the six growth genes and marketing BW (at 63 days) in the two rabbit lines. The purified polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced in those had the highest and lowest BW in each line. Results: Alignment of sequence data from each group revealed the following SNPs: At nucleotide 23 (A-C) and nucleotide 35 (T-G) in MC 4 R gene (sense mutation) of Alexandria and <b>V-line</b> high BW. Furthermore, we detected the following SNPs variation between the two lines: A SNP (T-C) at nucleotide 27 was identified by MC 4 R gene (sense mutation) and another one (A-C) at nucleotide 14 was identified by GHR gene (nonsense mutation) of Alexandria line. The results of individual BW at market (63 days) indicated that Alexandria rabbits had significantly higher BW compared with <b>V-line</b> rabbits. MC 4 R polymorphism showed significant association with high BW in rabbits. Conclusion: The results of polymorphism demonstrate the possibility to detect an association between BW in rabbits and {{the efficiency of the}} used primers to predict through the genetic specificity using the SNP of MC 4 R...|$|R
