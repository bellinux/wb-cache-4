5|$|Halfbeaks carry several {{adaptations to}} feeding {{at the water}} surface. The eyes and {{nostrils}} {{are at the top}} of the head and the upper jaw is mobile, but not the lower jaw. Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back (similar to that of a pike), these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate, catch, and swallow food items <b>very</b> <b>effectively.</b>|$|E
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{symptoms}} of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors {{the majority of the}} lymphocytes found in the body.

5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the unconsciousness of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per year for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality {{after the}} outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter {{the war against the}} Central Powers with promises of territory acquisition in Italia irredenta. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the main opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian Naval Chief of Staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement. As a result, Emanuele Filiberto {{and the rest of the}} Italian battle fleet did not see significant action during the war.|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} a very accurate computation of the non-equilibrium fluctuation- dissipation ratio for the 3 D Edwards-Anderson Ising spin glass, {{by means of}} large-scale simulations on the special-purpose computers Janus and Janus II. This ratio (computed for finite times on <b>very</b> large, <b>effectively</b> infinite, systems) is compared with the equilibrium probability distribution of the spin overlap for finite sizes. Our main result is a quantitative statics-dynamics dictionary, which could allow the experimental exploration of important features of the spin-glass phase without requiring uncontrollable extrapolations to infinite times or system sizes...|$|R

5|$|While {{en route}} to the final Test in Jamaica, the West Indies team stopped in Panama and Costa Rica where {{official}} functions were held in Headley's honour. In Jamaica, where there was widespread jubilation, Headley attended several receptions and celebrations. When the cricket resumed, Headley scored 64, 72 and 55 in three innings against MCC for Jamaica. With the Test series level, it was agreed that the final match of the series would be played until one team won, regardless of how long it took—the other Tests had been limited to four days each. On the first three days, England scored 849. In reply West Indies could only manage 286, with Headley out for ten runs. England batted again, to set West Indies an eventual victory target of 836. This time, Headley batted for 390 minutes, faced 385 balls and hit 28 fours while scoring 223. He and Karl Nunes added 227 for the second wicket. Headley played the hook <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> and hit many short deliveries for runs. When Headley was stumped, he had made what was at the time the fourth highest individual score in all Test cricket and the highest in a second innings. When West Indies still needed 428 runs, rain fell for two days and the match had to be abandoned after its ninth scheduled day. Headley ended the series with 703 runs at an average of 87.87.|$|E

25|$|Muscarinic {{receptor}} antagonists bind to muscarinic receptors thereby preventing ACh from binding to and activating the receptor. By {{blocking the}} actions of ACh, muscarinic receptor antagonists <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> block the effects of vagal nerve activity on the heart. By doing so, they increase heart rate and conduction velocity.|$|E
50|$|Wedge depolarizers exhibit {{some small}} beam deviation. This is true {{even if the}} faces of the optic are exactly parallel. Because each half of the optic is a wedge, and the two halves do not have exactly the same {{refractive}} index (for a particular polarization), the depolarizer is <b>effectively</b> <b>very</b> slightly wedged (optically).|$|R
50|$|When a team plays a zone, the {{defenders}} must keep their {{hands up and}} in passing lanes and quickly adjust their positions as the ball and the offensive players move around. Teams that successfully play zone defenses are <b>very</b> vocal and <b>effectively</b> communicate where they, the ball, and their opponents are or will be.|$|R
50|$|Roguing, or {{the removal}} and {{destruction}} of infected plants, {{is a way to}} control the spread of PRSV.

25|$|Gause’s 1930s lab {{experiments}} showed logistic {{growth in}} microorganisms. Populations of yeast grown in test tubes initially grew exponentially. But as resources became scarcer, their growth rates slowed until reaching the carrying capacity.

The shape of their growth can be modeled <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> with the logistic growth model.|$|E
25|$|Briggs was a notably {{short man}} at {{about five feet}} five or 165 centimetres. Briggs's skill lay {{in his ability to}} vary the flight and pace of the ball as well as in {{achieving}} prodigious spin on the primitive pitches of the nineteenth century. As a batsman, Briggs was capable of hitting <b>very</b> <b>effectively,</b> but as time went by an eagerness to punish every ball set in and led to a decline.|$|E
25|$|India had won {{the series}} 1–0, and secured their first series victory in England since 1986. Overall, the series had {{been a very good}} one, with two evenly matched sides {{competing}} well. England were unlucky not to win the first test at Lords due to rain, although they had had their chances. India seized on the opportunities they created at Trent Bridge to take the lead, and then first and foremost batted England out of contention in the final test, before thinking about winning it, which they did <b>very</b> <b>effectively.</b>|$|E

25|$|No climactic battle {{ever took}} place on Nauru, and the Japanese {{launched}} {{only a handful of}} minor raids from it. Nevertheless, the island {{played an important role in}} the campaigns of the Central Pacific. It was too well-defended to invade, yet its airfield and strategic location made it too threatening to ignore; thus the Americans had to divert considerable effort and resources to keep it neutralised. It could be said that militarily, the Japanese on Nauru did their job <b>very</b> <b>effectively.</b> Over 300 of them died from malnutrition, disease, and enemy action.|$|E
25|$|The detective gag, or over-the-mouth gag (sometimes {{abbreviated}} to OTM), {{is often described}} in fiction (particularly crime serials) as preventing the subject from speaking {{through the use of}} soft materials such as scarves or bandannas. The long scarf or bandanna is pulled over the subject's mouth and tied at the back of his/her head. In practice, it does not silence the subject <b>very</b> <b>effectively.</b> Images of OTM gags, usually applied on women, had been prevalent since the film serials of the early 1900s. For this reason, the OTM gag is associated with the typical damsel in distress.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process <b>very</b> <b>effectively,</b> and {{can be as simple as}} a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
50|$|Lastly, it is {{important}} to note that HEPA filters are designed to arrest <b>very</b> fine particles <b>effectively,</b> but they do not filter out gasses and odor molecules. Circumstances requiring filtration of volatile organic compounds, chemical vapors, cigarette, pet, and/or flatulence odors call for the use of an activated carbon (charcoal) or other type of filter instead of or in addition to a HEPA filter.|$|R
50|$|Several of {{the largest}} former oil tankers were {{converted}} to floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units, <b>effectively</b> <b>very</b> large floating oil storage tanks. Knock Nevis, by some measures the largest ship ever built, served in this capacity from 2004 until 2010. In 2009 and 2010 {{two of the four}} TI-class supertankers, then the largest ships afloat, TI Asia and TI Africa, were converted to FPSOs.|$|R
50|$|Labour {{regarded}} the result as {{good news for}} them, as it came {{at the end of}} a <b>very</b> long campaign (<b>effectively</b> seventy one days), and with a swing markedly smaller than in other seats over the previous year.

25|$|The {{production}} design and cinematography also won some praise from critics. Claire Sisco King called {{the use of}} real footage unconventional and disruptive in a positive way. The editing was described as akin {{to that of a}} music video, and critic Laura Kern found it effectively paced. Michael Koresky described Joey's death scene in the red-drenched bathroom <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> staged, although Peter Hartlaub found that the lighting obscured the action rather than enhancing it. Except for the strobe light effects during Chaz's death and the moment when the killer's scythe touches Eddie's glass eye, Kern found the special effects only average.|$|E
25|$|Above medium {{pace and}} right-handed, Geary {{was able to}} swing the new ball <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> but relied {{for most of his}} success on his amazing {{persistence}} and ability to bowl with slight yet well-disguised variations of pace and cut. He was able to bowl quite incredible numbers of overs on unresponsive pitches, as shown in the last Test of the 1928/1929 Ashes tour, when he bowled an amazing 81 overs on a typical billiard-table Australian wicket in very hot weather. Because he was tall and very solidly built, he was able both to get bounce and to bowl the long spells required for success in Australian conditions which destroyed the reputations of all English bowlers of slighter build.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it is also}} possible, {{by holding}} the seam at an angle and rolling the fingers {{over the surface of}} the ball, to produce a {{deliberate}} off cutter in which the ball veers away from the off side when it bounces on the pitch, or leg cutter in which it veers away from a right-handed batsman. Former Australian bowler Dennis Lillee employed a leg cutter of this sort to considerable effect; however, deliveries of this kind will be slower than if the bowler simply bowls with the seam upright, hoping for movement one way or the other. Some bowlers deliberately use cutters more for their surprise slowness than the deviation off the pitch - a tactic <b>very</b> <b>effectively</b> used by Mustafizur Rahman.|$|E
