Flow reversal in the reconstructed aorta may reflect the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> The purpose of our study was to investigate the utility of arterial PO 2, arterial oxygen saturation, and a newly developed Doppler-derived flow index in predicting the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> after first-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Methods: Twenty-four infants who underwent first-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome or a variant were studied. Superior vena cava blood samples were drawn to estimate the mixed venous saturation and permit calculation of the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> Fifty-four samples were evaluated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Simultaneous blood draw and Doppler echocardiography were performed with interrogation in the distal aspect of the arch reconstruction. The ratio of the Doppler velocity-time integral of retrograde flow to the velocity-time integral of forward flow was calculated and compared with the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> Results: The median mixed venous saturation for the 54 samples was low (38. 5 %; range, 18 %- 64 %). The median calculated pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> was 1. 4 : 1 (range, 0. 3 : 1 to 4. 2 : 1). Pulse pressure, mixed venous saturation, and arterial PO 2 were not statistically significant predictors of the measured pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> Although both aortic oxygen saturation (R 2 = 0. 84, P <. 01) and Doppler <b>flow</b> reversal <b>ratio</b> (R 2 = 0. 94, P <. 001) were significantly associated with the measured pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio,</b> the model coefficient of determination was greatest for Doppler <b>flow</b> reversal <b>ratio.</b> Conclusion: Measures of arterial oxygen saturation and arterial PO 2 may be misleading in assessing the circulatory status of infants after first-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Doppler echocardiography, through use of the Doppler <b>flow</b> reversal <b>ratio,</b> provides a more useful measure of pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> Low mixed venous saturation after surgery may be due to factors other than pulmonary overcirculation, such as ventricular dysfunction and low cardiac output.

Evidence now suggests that gravity has a less important role in the variation of regional distribution than structural features of the airways and blood vessels.

Methods: Beagle dogs (n = 8) 3 to 7 months old and weighing 3. 0 to 5. 0 kg were used. Atrial septectomy and patch closure of the tricuspid valve were performed, and a systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt was created by interposing a 3. 5 - or 4. 0 -mm graft between the right subclavian artery and main pulmonary artery. After cardiopulmonary bypass, hemodynamic variables including pulmonary and systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> were measured consecutively according to physiologically respiratory manipulations. The ratio of shunt size to body weight ranged from 0. 80 to 1. 33 mm/kg (1. 08 ± 0. 16 mm/kg). Results: Each dog with a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 0. 8 to 1. 1 showed significant negative correlation between the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> and arterial Pco 2, but those with a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 1. 1 to 1. 4 did not. Consequently each dog with a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 0. 8 to 1. 0 got adequate systemic <b>flow,</b> whereas a <b>ratio</b> of 1. 0 to 1. 4 resulted in inadequate systemic flow and acidic status. Similar phenomena were shown with the grouped data on relationship between the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> and inspired oxygen fraction. Conclusions: These findings imply that when the ratio of shunt size to body weight is 0. 8 to 1. 1, the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> is controllable by physiologic respiratory manipulations. Larger shunts make pulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> excessive and uncontrollable. We recommend that a ratio of shunt size to body weight of 0. 9 to 1. 0 be considered a useful index for suitable systemic-pulmonary arterial shunt in the Norwood operation.

Objective: We performed closure of trabecular ventricular septal defects by sandwiching the septum between 2 polyester felt patches placed in the left ventricle and right ventricle without ventriculotomy. Methods: Eleven patients (7 boys and 4 girls) underwent a sandwiching closure at {{a mean age of}} 4. 7 years (range, 0. 4 - 9. 7 years) and a mean weight of 16. 7 kg (range, 4. 6 - 52 kg). Associated cardiac malformations were present in 9 of the 11 patients. Seven patients had undergone previous operations. The trabecular ventricular septal defects are exposed through the tricuspid valve and also from the left ventricular side through a coexisting large perimembranous ventricular septal defect or through the mitral valve through an interatrial septostomy. Two forceps, one each from the right and left ventricular side, lead a 3 F Nelaton catheter through the trabecular defect. An oversized circular polyester felt patch mounted on a 3 - 0 Nespolen suture attached to the Nelaton catheter is then passed into the left ventricle. The suture ends are then passed through a slightly smaller polyester felt patch on the right ventricular side of the septum. The Nespolen suture is then tied, thereby sandwiching the septum between the 2 patches. Results: Time required for the procedure was less than 20 minutes in each case. There were no hospital deaths, and the postoperative course was uneventful in all patients. There was no residual shunt in 3 patients, and a minimal residual shunt was observed in 5 patients. Mild residual shunt was observed in 3 patients. Cardiac catheterization was performed 1 month postoperatively in 8 patients in whom residual shunt was noted on echocardiography. Five of 8 patients had a minimal residual shunt (pulmonary <b>blood</b> flow/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> = 1. 0). Three patients had a residual shunt (pulmonary <b>blood</b> flow/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> = 2. 0, 1. 6, and 1. 2). The patient with a pulmonary <b>blood</b> flow/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2. 0 had a “Swiss cheese” ventricular septal defect, and a residual shunt remained around the patch. However, the residual shunt decreased to a pulmonary <b>blood</b> flow/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 6 at examination 16 months postoperatively. Echocardiography showed that the residual shunt had also decreased in another 2 patients. Conclusions: We conclude that the sandwich technique is safe and easy. Even in cases with a residual shunt present, the shunt is expected to decrease as time passes. Further experience and longer follow-up of these patients are necessary to conclude whether this technique is applicable to neonates and young infants.

Nisoldipine caused dose-dependent decreases in arterial blood pressure (30 %), systemic vascular resistance (30 %) and left ventricular filling pressure (15 %), but raised heart rate (25 %) and LV dP/dt max (20 %).

At 33. 1 ± 6. 5 days, the rats were injected with phVEGF 165 at one location and control plasmid at a second location (500 μg DNA, n = 24) or saline (n = 16). After 33. 1 ± 5. 7 days, the hearts were excised for macroscopic and histologic analysis. Regional <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> were measured in 18 rats by radioactive microspheres. RESULTSphVEGF 165 -treated sites showed macroscopic angioma-like structures at the injection site while control DNA and saline injection sites did not. By histology, 21 / 24 phVEGF 165 -treated hearts showed increased focal epicardial blood vessel density and angioma-like formation. Quantitative morphometric evaluation in 20 phVEGF 165 -treated hearts revealed 44. 4 ± 10. 5 vascular structures per field in phVEGF 165 -treated hearts versus 21. 4 ± 4. 7 in control DNA injection sites (p < 0. 05). Regional myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> between the injection site and noninfarcted area did not demonstrate any difference between phVEGF 165 -treated hearts (0. 9 ± 0. 2) and saline-treated hearts (0. 7 ± 0. 1). CONCLUSIONSInjection of DNA for VEGF in the border zone of MI in rat hearts induced angiogenesis. Angioma formation at the injection sites {{did not appear to}} contribute to regional myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow,</b> which may be a limitation of gene therapy for this application...|$|R

We have investigated the effects of vasopressin infusion on hepatic tumour <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in an experimental model of liver tumour. Hepatic tumour was induced by the intraportal inoculation of HSN sarcoma cells. Hepatic and splanchnic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was determined using a dual reference microsphere technique before and after an intravenous infusion of vasopressin at a dose of 0. 1 mU kg- 1 min- 1 for 10 min. There was a significant increase in systemic arterial blood pressure associated with a rise in portal venous inflow (P less than 0. 01, Wilcoxen Signed rank Test) and a significant fall in hepatic arterial flow (P less than 0. 05). The tumour: liver <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> was significantly increased by vasopressin infusion (P less than 0. 02). Vasopressin infusion decreases hepatic arterial flow and increases tumour <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> which may potentiate the delivery of a regionally delivered chemotherapeutic drug to hepatic tumour...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: In {{patients}} with single ventricle physiology, {{the distribution of}} flow to the systemic and pulmonary circulations, which are in parallel, largely depends on the relative resistances in the respective vascular beds. Although neonatal palliation in {{patients with}} single ventricle physiology has become more common, medical management during the perinatal and perioperative periods is often based primarily on personal and institutional experience and {{is complicated by the}} transition to postnatal life and the effects of cardiopulmonary bypass. The lack of an animal model that suitably mimics single ventricle physiology has impeded progress in this area. Objective: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of respiratory manipulations on pulmonary hemodynamics in the early neonatal period in a reproducible model of single ventricle physiology created in utero. Methods: A 10 mm Damus-Kaye-Stansel aortopulmonary anastomosis was created in fetal sheep (n = 14) at 140 ± 1. 2 days' gestation, with pulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> provided through a 5 mm aortopulmonary shunt after ligation of the main pulmonary artery distally. Two to 3 days after delivery at term, lambs (n = 11) underwent an open sternotomy and 30 minutes of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Both before and after bypass, respiratory manipulations, including administration of nitric oxide (80 ppm), 100 % oxygen, 10 % oxygen, and 5 % carbon dioxide, were performed and hemodynamic variables were measured. Results: Nitric oxide and oxygen caused a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and an increase in the pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio,</b> both before and after bypass. Hypoxia and carbon dioxide produced a significant rise in pulmonary vascular resistance and a significant drop in the ratio of pulmonary to systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Conclusions: Oxygen, nitric oxide, and carbon dioxide all appear to be useful means of manipulating pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> in neonatal lambs with single ventricle physiology, but further investigation is necessary to understand their dose responsive effects and the effects of prolonged administration.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Partial liquid {{ventilation}} with perfluorocarbons {{may increase}} alveolar hydrostatic transmural pressure and {{may result in}} a redistribution of pulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> from dependent to nondependent lung regions. To test this hypothesis under controlled study conditions, we determined intrapulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> distributions during gas and perfluorocarbon ventilation in isolated rabbit lungs. DESIGN: Controlled animal study with an ex vivo isolated lung preparation. SETTING: Research laboratory for Experimental Anesthesiology at the Heinrich-Heine-University of Düsseldorf. SUBJECTS: New Zealand White rabbits. INTERVENTIONS: The lungs were perfused with autologous <b>blood</b> at constant <b>flow</b> (150 mL/min) and ventilated with 5 % C(O 2) in air (positive end-expiratory pressure, 2 cm H 2 O; tidal volume, 10 mL/kg body weight; respiratory rate, 30 breaths/ min) without and with perfluorocarbon administered intratracheally (15 mL/kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Regional lung perfusion was measured with colored microspheres in apical, central, peripheral, and basal samples before and after bronchial instillation of perfluorocarbons. Compared with gas <b>ventilation,</b> intrapulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during perfluorocarbon <b>ventilation</b> was higher in apical samples (49. 4 +/- 8. 6 mL/min/g vs. 38. 3 +/- 6. 8 mL/min/g dry weight; p =. 03) and lower in basal samples (22. 2 +/- 5. 1 mL/min/g vs. 39. 9 +/- 8. 2 mL/min/g; p =. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that during partial liquid <b>ventilation,</b> intrapulmonary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> is redistributed toward less-dependent lung regions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} beta-adrenergic {{blockade}} with timolol (40 μg/kg) on myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during rest and graded treadmill exercise was assessed in 12 chronically instrumented dogs 10 to 14 days after myocardial infarction {{was produced by}} acute left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. During exercise at comparable external work loads, the heart rate-systolic blood pressure product was significantly decreased after timolol, with concomitant reductions of myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> in normal, border and central ischemic areas (p < 0. 001) and increases in subendocardial/subepicardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> (p < 0. 05). In addition to the blunted chronotropic response to exercise, timolol exerted an effect on myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> that was not explained by changes in heart rate or blood pressure. At comparable rate-pressure products during exercise, total myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was 24 % lower after timolol (p < 0. 02) and flow was redistributed from subepicardium to subendocardium in all myocardial regions. Thus, timolol altered myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> during exercise by two separate mechanisms: 1) a negative chronotropic effect, and 2) a significant selective reduction of subepicardial perfusion independent of changes in heart rate or blood pressure with transmural redistribution of flow toward the subendocardium...|$|R
30|$|We {{considered}} the associations of asystole and RBBB with congenital heart disease. According to a previous study, RBBB is well correlated with high pulmonary/systemic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> {{in patients with}} ASD [13]. However, the ASD in this patient had already been surgically repaired. Another study showed that in cases with surgical VSD repair, RBBB might be associated with right ventricular dysfunction [14]. However, the authors of that study concluded that after VSD repair, biventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction may develop irrespective {{of the presence of}} RBBB [14]. Therefore, the dysfunction may not be directly related to the RBBB. For the aforementioned reasons, we consider that RBBB with congenital heart disease may not be directly related to the asystole in the present case.|$|R
30|$|The {{findings}} {{presented in}} this paper relate to the ARDS patient with high Q̇_S/Q̇_T, that requires Q̇_EC ≥  2  l/min to support oxygenation. During extracorporeal CO 2 removal, Q̇_EC is usually <[*] 2  l/min, and Q̇_EC becomes a major determinant of CO 2 elimination. Gas exchange across the membranes used for extracorporeal CO 2  removal is often limited by incomplete diffusion [21], and this may be exacerbated by the high gas sweep to <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> that are used to facilitate CO 2 removal. A range of techniques have been tried to enhance CO 2  removal including using carbonic anhydrase [23], acidification of blood or dialysate [24] and electrodialysis [25]. Further modelling of the factors affecting gas exchange during extracorporeal CO 2  removal may prove enlightening.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} perfluorocarbon (PFC) hemodilution on myocardial vessel capacity to autoregulate, circumflex coronary artery pressure-flow relations were studied in anesthe-tized dogs under three conditions: maximal vasodilatation before and after PFC; autoregu-lation before and after PFC with 100 % oxygen supplemented with room air ventilation, and autoregulation with PFC hemodilution during either room air or 100 % oxygen supplemented with room air ventilation. During coronary vasodilatation, PFC did not modify coronary conductance or zero-flow pressure. During autoregulation after PFC, the lower pressure limit of the autoregulatory pressure-flow relation was shifted leftward. This leftward shift occurred because endocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was maintained at a lower coronary perfusion pressure with PFC while epicardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was unchanged. Endocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was also preserved at 50 % of control <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> levels as evidenced by the higher endocardial-epicardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> with PFC. After PFC with 100 % oxygen supplemented with room air ventilation, oxygen transport increased significantly when coronary perfusion pressure was below the lower pressure limit; the effect was most prominent in the endocardial tissue layer. Thus, PFC shifts the lower pressure limit to the left because of the increased ability o...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective. This study {{compared}} quantitatively {{the efficacy}} of intravenous adenosine and dipyridamole for pharmacologic induction of myocardial hyperemia. Background. Pharmacologic vasodilation is used increasingly for induction of myocardial hyperemia in conjunction with radionuclide imaging of myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> Although both intravenous dipyridamole and adenosine have been used, the magnitude of hyperemia induced by these agents and the hyperemia to baseline <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> have not been quantified and compared. Methods. Twenty normal volunteers were studied with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and intravenous nitrogen- 13 ammonia. Myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> was quantified with a two-compartment tracer kinetic model. Results. Myocardial <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> at rest averaged 1. 1 ± 0. 2 ml/min per g and increased significantly to 4. 4 ± 0. 9 ml/min per g during adenosine and 43 ± 1. 3 ml/min per g after dipyridamole administration. Hyperemia to baseline <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> averaged 4. 3 ± 1. 6 for adenosine and 4. 0 ± 1. 3 for dipyridamole. The average <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> and the maximal flows achieved were similar for both agents, but there was considerable variation in the individual response to these agents, {{as indicated by the}} range of hyperemia to baseline <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> (from 2. 0 to 8. 4 for adenosine and from 1. 5 to 5. 8 for dipyridamole). in addition, the hyperemic responses to dipyridamole and to adenosine differed by > 1 ml/min per g in nine subjects. Conclusions. Despite these inter- and istraindividual differences, we conclude that both agents are equally effective in producing myocardial hyperemia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Valvular aortic {{stenosis}} {{is the most}} common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy due to gradually increasing pressure work. As the stenosis develop the left ventricular hypertrophy may lead to congestive heart failure, increased risk of perioperative complications and also increased risk of sudden death. A functional porcine model imitating the pathophysiological nature of valvular {{aortic stenosis}} is very much sought after in order to study the geometrical and pathophysiological changes of the left ventricle, timing of surgery and also pharmacological therapy in this patient group. Earlier we developed a porcine model for aortic stenosis based on supracoronary aortic banding, this model may not completely imitate the pathophysiological changes that occurs when valvular aortic stenosis is present including the coronary <b>blood</b> <b>flow.</b> It would therefore be desirable to optimize this model according to the localization of the stenosis. Methods In 20 kg pigs subcoronary (n = 8), supracoronary aortic banding (n = 8) or sham operation (n = 4) was preformed via a left lateral thoracotomy. The primary endpoint was left ventricular wall thickness; secondary endpoints were heart/body weight ratio and the systolic/diastolic <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> in the left anterior descending coronary. Statistical evaluation by oneway anova and unpaired t-test. Results Sub- and supracoronary banding induce an equal degree of left ventricular hypertrophy compared with the control group. The coronary <b>blood</b> <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> was slightly but not significantly higher in the supracoronary group (ratio = 0. 45) compared with the two other groups (subcoronary ratio = 0. 36, control ratio = 0. 34). Conclusions A human pathophysiologically compatible porcine model for valvular aortic stenosis was developed by performing subcoronary aortic banding. Sub- and supracoronary aortic banding induce an equal degree of left ventricular hypertrophy. This model may be valid for experimental investigations of aortic valve stenosis but studies of left ventricular hypertrophy can be studied equally well by graduated constriction of the ascending aorta. </p...|$|R
