With the CCW-2 that followed, he could achieve almost <b>vertical</b> <b>starts,</b> and flight almost like a helicopter. The military started a number of trials, that was subsequently cancelled despite some interesting achievements. Later, Custer founded the Custer ChannelWing Corporation, and in 1954 built more aircraft. The last one, the CCW-5, almost reach series production.|$|R

Altering the initial position systematically affects the direction or amplitude of the movements to a striking degree. In general, {{changes in the}} horizontal or <b>vertical</b> <b>starting</b> position primarily produce changes in the horizontal or vertical component, respectively, {{regardless of whether the}} target displacement occurs in the horizontal or vertical direction. For some monkeys, a similar pattern of initial position influence on movement direction {{can be seen in the}} curvature of visually guided saccades.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a program called MUDoS (Maastricht University Domineering Solver) that solves Domineering positions in a very efficient way. This enables the solution of known positions so far (up to the 10 x 10 board) much quicker (measured in number of investigated nodes). More importantly, it enables {{the solution of the}} 11 x 11 Domineering board, a board up till now far out of reach of previous Domineering solvers. The solution needed the investigation of 259, 689, 994, 008 nodes, using almost half a year of computation time on a single simple desktop computer. The results show that under optimal play the first player wins the 11 x 11 Domineering game, irrespective if <b>Vertical</b> or Horizontal <b>starts</b> the game. In addition, several other boards hitherto unsolved were solved. Using the convention that <b>Vertical</b> <b>starts,</b> the 8 x 15, 11 x 9, 12 x 8, 12 x 15, 14 x 8, and 17 x 6 boards are all won by Vertical, whereas the 6 x 17, 8 x 12, 9 x 11, and 11 x 10 boards are all won by Horizontal...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} new approach to the prediction of cloud attenuation A on Earth-space links operating in the EHF (Extremely High Frequency) range. The methodology relies on SMOC (Stochastic MOdel of Clouds), which synthesizes high-resolution three-dimensional distributions of the liquid water content w (extent: 200 km× 200 km horizontal, 10 km <b>vertical),</b> <b>starting</b> from coarse integral information typically provided by global gridded Numerical Weather Prediction products. Cloud attenuation statistics are calculated by coupling synthetic cloud fields with a simplified yet accurate approach to estimate cloud attenuation based on the concept of mass absorption coefficient. Tests performed against reference attenuation data inferred from an extensive set of radiosonde observations show a very satisfactory accuracy of the proposed methodology in estimating A and, on the other hand, a marked tendency to overestimation of the model currently adopted in recommendation ITU-R P. 840 - 6...|$|R

50|$|The Gyroplane was a two-seat {{autogyro}} without wings, with a {{ducted fan}} pusher propeller {{driven by a}} 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 piston engine. It had a three bladed rotor, formed from bonded aluminium. There were flapping hinges but no drag hinges. In normal flight the rotor was undriven, but the design team were keen to enable <b>vertical</b> jump <b>starts,</b> an autogyro technique which spins up the rotor before take off without forward movement over the ground.

40|$|Hardy 2 ̆ 7 s (1971) {{technique}} of interpolation {{was tested using}} fluid speed data from Big Otter Creek, a gravel bed stream, in South-Western Ontario. Fourteen cross-sections were selected from a 500 m-long reach of the river. Each cross-section was divided into 10 verticals. Fluid speed was sampled as different positions in these <b>verticals</b> <b>starting</b> at 0. 025 m off the channel bed using an electromagnetic current metre. Bed roughness at each cross-section was determined by collecting samples of the bed material and by measuring the long, intermediate and short axes of particles at the 10 verticals. To test the multiquadric {{technique of}} interpolation, known fluid speeds from the collected data sets were systematically and randomly removed from the cross-section and plan views. These new, smaller data sets were then used as input {{for a series of}} computer programs which generated a multiquadric surface. The interpolated fluid speeds were compared against the know fluid speeds to determine the magnitude of the errors. The results show that the largest error values occurred in the near bed region and in areas with steep velocity gradients. Of the two types of analyses, cross-section and plan view, the plan view had the largest errors. No difference in error magnitude or location was identified between the random and systematic analyses...|$|R
