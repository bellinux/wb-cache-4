All CT examinations were acquired using dual-source CT systems (either Somatom Definiton or Somatom Definiton Flash, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA, USA). Examinations were performed at 100  kV according to a non-ECG-triggered high-pitch (3, 2) protocol. Collimation was 64 [*]×[*] 0.6  mm 2 for the Somatom Definition and 128 [*]×[*] 0.6  mm 2 for the Somatom Definition Flash. A total of 60  ml of non-ionic, iodinated contrast agent (Ultravist 370, Bayer-Schering-Pharma, Berlin, Germany) was injected through a right antecubital vein at a flow rate of 5  ml/s, followed by a 50 -ml saline chaser bolus at the same flow rate. Data acquisition was initiated by a bolus-triggering technique (CARE Bolus, Siemens Medical Solutions) with the region of interest placed within the left atrium. The threshold above the native reference scan and the delay before scanning started were 100 HU respectively 6  s for the Somatom Definition and 150 HU respective 10  s for the Somatom Definition Flash. Measurements of the left atrial size were performed on transverse 1 -mm slices with a reconstruction increment of 1  mm using commercially available software (SyngoVolumetry, Siemens Medical Systems, Malvern, PA, USA).

40|$|In {{the recent}} years {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in the application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agriculture, specifically aiding automatic application of water, chemicals and fertilizers to the field. Since WSNs are still under development stage, they are at times unreliable, power hungry, fragile and they easily lose communication. Intrinsically, any irrigation system based on WSNs requires close monitoring to guard against any horrendous mishaps. However, monitoring such an irrigation system which, usually, is located at a rural site can be expensive and time consuming. In this paper we developed an efficient, cost-effective and real-time wireless based remote monitoring mechanism for a WSN based Irrigation system situated in Manja Township within Blantyre city.

40|$|In {{search for}} {{the origin of the}} less {{reliable}} cardiac output (CO) estimations by means of electrical impedance cardiography (EIC), the authors hypothesized that cardiac valve pathology might be one of the reasons. Twenty-six patients were examined by means of echo Doppler (ED) and EIC. The cardiac <b>valve</b> <b>status</b> was obtained by means of echocar-diography and color Doppler flow, while CO was obtained by means of both methods. Seventeen patients had no valve pathology (nVP) while nine patients had mild to moderate mitral regurgitation (MVR). The overall correlation between the calculation of CO by means of the two methods was good (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 001, mean difference and standard deviation: 0. 20 &plusmn; 0. 74 L/min), while {{there was no significant difference}} between the paired values. After division into an nVP and an MVR population, the results showed an even closer agreement between the CO values in the nVP population (r = 0. 88, p < 0. 001, mean difference and standard deviation: 0. 15 &plusmn; 0. 68 L/min). Further-more, significant differences were found in the first derivative of the impedance (dZ/dt) signals of these groups. Although the agreement between ED and EIC was slightly lower in the MVR population, EIC reliably estimated CO, even in case of MVR.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between heart valve history and susceptibility artifacts at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain in patients with Bjork-Shiley convexoconcave (BSCC) valves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images of the brain were obtained in 58 patients with prosthetic heart valves: 20 patients had BSCC valve replacements, and 38 had other types of heart valves. Two experienced neuroradiologists determined {{the presence or absence}} of susceptibility artifacts in a consensus reading. Artifacts were defined as characteristic black spots that were visible on T 2 *-weighted gradient-echo MR images. The statuses of the 20 explanted BSCC valves-specifically, whether they were intact or had an outlet strut fracture (OSF) or a single-leg fracture (SLF) -had been determined earlier. Number of artifacts seen at brain MR imaging was correlated with explanted <b>valve</b> <b>status,</b> and differences were analyzed with nonparametric statistical tests. RESULTS: Significantly more patients with BSCC valves (17 [85 %] of 20 patients) than patients with other types of prosthetic valves (18 [47 %] of 38 patients) had susceptibility artifacts at MR imaging (P =. 005). BSCC valve OSFs were associated with a significantly higher number of artifacts than were intact BSCC valves (P =. 01). No significant relationship between SLF and number of artifacts was observed. CONCLUSION: Susceptibility artifacts at brain MR imaging are not restricted to patients with BSCC valves. These artifacts can be seen on images obtained in patients with various other types of fractured and intact prosthetic heart valves. (C) RSNA, 200...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{introduces}} a condition diagnosis technique for a turbine governor system. The governor system {{is an important}} control system to handle turbine speed in a nuclear power plant. The turbine governor system includes turbine valves and stop valves which have their own functions in the system. Because a turbine governor system is operated by high oil pressure, {{it is very difficult}} to maintain under stable operating conditions. Turbine valves supply oil pressure to the governor system for proper operation. Using the pressure variation of turbine and governor valves, operating conditions of the turbine governor control system are detected and identified. To achieve automatic detection of <b>valve</b> <b>status,</b> time-based and frequency-based analysis is employed. In this study, a new approach, wavelet decomposition, was used to extract specific features from the pressure signals of the governor and stop valves. The extracted features, which represent the operating conditions of the turbine governor system, include important information to control and diagnose the valves. After extracting the specific features, decision rules were used to classify the valve conditions. The rules were generated by a decision tree algorithm (a typical simple method for data-based rule generation). The results given by the wavelet-based analysis were compared to detection results using time- and frequency-based approaches. Compared with the several related studies, the wavelet transform-based analysis, the proposed in this study has the advantage of easier application without auxiliary features...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis requiring surgery in patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of subaortic stenosis. BackgroundClassic teachings emphasize aortic regurgitation as the most common complication associated with discrete subaortic stenosis. We hypothesized that significant aortic stenosis may also be an important valve lesion associated with this condition. MethodsClinical outcomes in patients with subaortic stenosis were examined. The primary outcome of interest was the prevalence of valvular aortic stenosis requiring surgery (surgical valvotomy or valve replacement). Logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with the need for surgery for aortic stenosis. ResultsOne hundred twenty-one adults with subaortic stenosis (median age 32 years) were evaluated in our clinic. Associated lesions were common: 23 % had bicuspid valves and 21 % had coarctation of the aorta. Seventy-nine percent of the patients had at least 1 surgical resection of subaortic tissue (median age 12 years). Moderate to severe aortic regurgitation was present in 16 % of patients (19 of 121), 3 of whom required surgical intervention in adulthood. Twenty-six percent of patients (32 of 121) required surgery for valvular aortic stenosis. Valve surgery for aortic stenosis was more common in patients with concomitant bicuspid aortic valve disease (p = 0. 008), coarctation of the aorta (p = 0. 03), and supravalvular stenosis (p = 0. 02). ConclusionsValvular aortic stenosis is a surprisingly common finding in patients with discrete subaortic stenosis.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Because of the {{complexity}} of traditional 1 - and 2 -patch techniques for the repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect, we modified our repair technique to avoid the use of any ventricular septal patch material. We report our prospective experience with this simplified 1 -patch technique. Method: Forty-seven consecutive patients between May 1995 and August 1998 underwent repair with the use of this technique without modification. Repair was done in all patients by direct suturing of the common atrioventricular valve leaflets to the crest of the ventricular septum. No division of valve leaflets was necessary. A single pericardial patch was used to close the defect in the atrial septal component. Follow-up included electrocardiography and echocardiographic assessment of ventricular function, atrioventricular valve function, and adequacy of the left ventricular outflow tract. Results: There were 2 deaths (4 %), only 1 cardiac related, in the series. There were 17 male patients and 30 female patients. Mean age at repair was 5. 6 months (median, 3. 4 months). Associated lesions were repaired in 19 patients (40 %). Mean follow-up was 1. 85 years (median, 1. 9 years). There was no heart block. There were no significant residual ventricular septal defects detected and no left ventricular outflow tract obstruction seen on echocardiography in any patient to date. Mitral <b>valve</b> <b>status</b> after operation was assessed as no incompetence in 13 patients (28 %), minimal in 19 patients (40 %), mild in 12 patients (26 %), and moderate in 3 patients (6 %). Conclusion: The repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect by direct suturing of the atrioventricular valve leaflets to the crest of the ventricular septum with a single-patch technique greatly simplifies the repair and does not lead to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction nor interfere with valve function.

30|$|Instead {{of judging}} the {{calibration}} through only differences and/or ratios {{of the observed}} to the predicted pressure or head loss differences between the test nodes and nearby boundary locations (reservoirs/tanks) having known pressures or heads (Walski 1986), it is preferable to judge the calibration through minimizing the summation of the sum of square of difference between the measured and simulated value of pressure heads at test nodes as done {{in most of the}} implicit approaches The Research Committee on Water Distribution Systems of the American Water Works Association (1974) states that “the major source of error in simulation of contemporary performance will be in the assumed loadings distribution and their variations”. On the other hand, Eggener and Polkowski (1976) state that the weakest piece of input information is not the assumed loading condition, but the pipe friction factor. From these conflicting views, it is clear that, in some cases, the adjustment in the pipe head-loss coefficients may be more predominant than the adjustment in the nodal consumptions, while the opposite may be the situation in other cases (Shamir and Howard 1977). Walski (1986) suggested consideration of multiple demand loadings for reliable model calibration, which can be generated through pump on/off conditions or excessive withdrawal at one or few nodes by opening fire hydrants. The novelty of the study herein is the use of online data of flow and pressures that provided a set of observations under various loadings. This paper demonstrates that with the online pressure and flow data at few observational points in the network, it is possible to accurately calibrate a model of a real WDN by adjusting the pipe roughness coefficients only. This is achieved by providing accurate inputs about pipe lengths, diameters and materials, nodal elevations, nodal demands, <b>valve</b> <b>status</b> and its opening. The importance of the valve is recognized, as these are used for isolation as well as pressure and flow control purpose by throttling. The usual way of considering head loss through them as minor loss and clubbing their effects in adjusting pipe roughness coefficient results in a very absurd value of pipe roughness coefficients.|$|E
40|$|Computer {{hydraulic}} solvers such as EPANET allow complex {{water distribution}} system networks to be simulated by design engineers. Modeling of systems containing combinations of pressure reducing valves (PRVs), pressure sustaining valves (PSVs) and flow control valves (FCVs) {{can sometimes be}} problematical. The status of PRVs, PSVs and FCVs is usually solved for based on a heuristic approach. Starting from an assumed state of the control device, a check is performed during the next step of the iteration procedure, {{as to whether the}} original assumption of each particular assumed <b>valve</b> <b>status</b> still holds. If the assumption proves to be no longer true, a correction {{of the state of the}} control device is made. It has been observed in the past that this approach may sometimes fail to converge at all, or even worse may converge to incorrect solutions when simulating networks that include pressure regulating devices. In the majority of cases for which no correct solution was obtained, the solver converged quickly to an incorrect solution. Hence, no warning message was generated to indicate there was a problem with the solution. Some simple networks incorporating PRVs and FCVs have been considered in this research. The networks have multiple pressure regulating and flow regulating devices that are placed in series and separated by substantial lengths of pipe. Even for simple networks comprising two pressure regulating devices (one pressure regulating device and one flow regulating device) in series, current hydraulic modeling software fails to converge to the correct solution for particular configurations and settings. This paper aims to consider the circumstances in which such difficulties occur and the reasons for the failure to solve. In 2002, Deuerlein in his PhD thesis proposed a new method to ensure that the correct solution for water distribution systems containing multiple pressure and flow regulating valves is obtained. He used Nash equilibrium. The application of this approach enables all simple networks (as described above) to be correctly solved that previously could not be solved or those that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET. Details of the Nash equilibrium algorithm and the specific application to some example networks that converged to the wrong solution in EPANET are presented in this paper. Arbitrary pressure and flow controlling devices in water distribution systems can now be simulated with confidence. Convergence is assured if the system's physics are feasible. The approach has been implemented as part of the water supply network simulation and optimization model KANET. Jochen Deuerlein, Angus R. Simpson and Stefanie Wilkins[URL]...|$|E
40|$|Avoiding {{accidents}} is important, {{especially in}} the petroleum industry where {{the outcome of a}} major accident can be serious harm to both people, the environment and to company property. There are requirements from the Petroleum Safety Authority [Norway] (PSAN), as well as from internal guidelines from operators on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, that barriers are established and maintained so that the probability of accident situations developing is reduced, and that harm and disadvantages are limited. Furthermore, it is required that the operators are aware of the condition of the safety barriers, i. e. if the barriers have been impaired or are non-functioning. As a result of the Macondo disaster, PSAN has identified the need to develop new tools for risk management. In addition, a questionnaire survey carried out for PSAN as a supervisory activity in 2009 revealed the need for the development of such tools, as it showed that the current risk analysis studies employed by the sector were not utilised ?as input to day-to-day decisions on installations/plants about minor modifications, maintenance and intervention activities? (Vinnem and Haugen, 2012, p. 4). This master's thesis explores and describes how barrier management can be directly linked to operational control of major accident risk. An extensive review of literature and several interviews are performed to examine how the platform manager can use information {{on the state of the}} safety barriers as a risk control tool. The thesis describes the premises for a new risk control tool including, but not limited to, its purpose, expectations and requirements to the tool, situations of use, how information should be communicated, a description of the type of information that goes into the risk control tool, the data sources of such information and the output it provides. Moreover, interviews with two former platform managers and an executive vice president are performed to present the most important decisions the management of the platform makes where the information on barrier condition is of importance, as well as how risk considerations come into these decisions. Furthermore, existing measures, methods and tools are presented, including a method for considering the total risk on the platform against acceptance criteria for risk. Finally, based on contact with the petroleum industry and a classification society, the thesis presents how decision-making criteria can be set for the activities that are not permitted based on, amongst other, information on the state of the safety barriers. Based on these examinations, the following suggestions are made:?	A new risk control tool should be developed with the purpose of providing decision support, including amongst other decision-making criteria and information on safety barrier condition, to situations where the management of the platform is to decide whether or not an activity can be performed. ?	A new risk control tool should be focused on bridging gaps found in the industry it is intended for. A new risk control tool should thus be focused on providing decision support on a day-to-day basis to platform manager(s), as well as to onshore management on a long-term basis, during planning of activities on the installation where the information on the state of safety barriers is of importance. ?	The tool itself should be a robust information surface with an interface built up like other tools used in the industry or by a specific company. ?	The user(s) of the tool should be presented with; area specific information on the state of the safety barriers that are directed against major accidents, relevant indicators and information that is suitable for helping the decision-maker make a decision including, but not limited to, <b>valve</b> <b>status</b> from automatic transponders, a ?map? of the platform showing relevant information, current weather and weather forecast, operational data, operating limits and preconditions used in QRA, preconditions stipulated and risk considerations performed during the onshore planning of activities, decision-making criteria and guidance, a simulation function where the user(s) can simulate the effect a specific activity brings in time and space, and a function for considering the total risk of the platform against tolerance limits for risk. ?	A new risk control tool should, as far as possible, rely on and take advantage of frequently updated and reliable information from systems already put in place by the operator. ?	Efforts should be made to be able to present detailed installation specific information of the condition of the safety barriers/-systems. ?	A classification of barrier elements according to their transient properties / behaviour could be developed for a risk control tool that is to be capable of capturing and showing the short-term transient behaviour (or state) of the safety barriers. ?	Focus should be on technical and organisational safety barriers, which show a more short-term transient behaviour than operational barriers. ?	Presented indicators should be limited to a reasonable number, fit the purpose of the risk control tool, and be recognizable for decision-makers and fitting to the installation. </p...|$|E

Patients were allotted into three groups based on the timing of diuretic administration: Diuretic given 15 min before (F- 15), {{at the same time}} as (F + 0) and 20 min after (F + 20) radionuclide administration. Dynamic images and renogram curves were inspected to identify in each group (1) number of equivocal curves and (2) number of interrupted studies due to patient movement/discomfort/voiding. Statistical significance was determined by the Fisher exact test. Results: There was no significant difference in age/sex distribution between groups F- 15 (n = 35), F + 0 (n = 38) and F + 20 (n = 75). The number of equivocal curves was significantly less in F + 0 (2 / 38) and F- 15 (3 / 35) compared with F + 20 (20 / 75). The number of interrupted studies was significantly less in F + 0 (2 / 38) compared with F- 15 (9 / 35) and F + 20 (18 / 75). Conclusion: The F + 0 and F- 15 protocols are superior to the F + 20 protocol in reducing the number of equivocal curves, while the F + 0 protocol is superior to the other two in reducing interruptions due to patient movement or voiding.

Methods: We enrolled MPD patients who had undergone over 18 months of dialysis in our dialysis center, examined their cardiac <b>valve</b> calcification <b>status</b> by echocardiography, and recorded their biochemical data and dialysis-related indicators. These results were compared by logistic regression analyses to identify the risk factors associated with calcification in aortic and mitral valves. Results: Among the 117 enrolled MPD patients, 41 exhibited calcification in aortic or mitral valves, including 38 with aortic valve calcification (AVC) and 17 with mitral valve calcification (MVC); 14 of them had calcification in both aortic and mitral valves. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (OR= 1. 965, p= 0. 01), diabetes history (OR= 4. 693, p= 0. 029), calcium-phosphorus product (OR= 2. 373, p= 0. 001) and prealbumin (OR= 0. 908, p= 0. 012) were independently related to AVC, whereas age (OR= 3. 179, p= 0. 023), calcium-phosphorus product (OR= 6. 512, p= 0. 001), prealbumin (OR= 0. 885, p= 0. 033), high-density lipoprotein (OR= 19. 540, p= 0. 011) and diabetes history (OR= 6. 948, p= 0. 038) were independently related to MVC. Conclusions The incidence of cardiac valve calcification in MPD patients is high, and the incidence of AVC is higher than MVC. Age, diabetes history, calcium-phosphorus product and hypo-prealbuminemia are independent risk factors for AVC, whereas age, calcium-phosphorus product and hypo-prealbuminemia are independent risk factors for MVC...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} seen that, in the agriculture, wastage of water and valve {{controlling}} {{is one of the}} major concern. At present it is operated manually which leads to great man power requirement. Also adequate and required supply of water is needed in agriculture. Along with these concerns, fluctuations in electricity lead to damage the motor permanently. So we have made an attempt to design a system, which would control the valve action based on the sensors output through GSM. Along with this it also prevents permanent damage of motor from fluctuations in electricity. The main aim of the project is to read the sensors output and to control the valves through the GSM technology. Input signal 230 v ac given to the transformer of 12 vdc and 12 v dc signal is send to microcontroller. Status of the field is sent through the GSM based on the output of the sensors. Depending on this <b>status,</b> <b>valve</b> controlling action is performed. After the adequate supply of water, valves are closed automatically depending on the updated status of the sensors. In this project, we have also improved on automatic action taken to control the valve action in case of GSM facility failure...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to: 1) {{determine}} the usefulness of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as the primary technique to guide transapical (TA) transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI); and 2) to compare TEE with angiography as the primary imaging modality for TA-TAVI guidance. BackgroundTEE has been routinely used as an adjunct to angiography during TA-TAVI procedures, but very few data exist on the use of TEE as the primary imaging technique guiding TA-TAVI. MethodsOne hundred consecutive high-risk patients (mean age 79 ± 9 years, mean logistic EuroSCORE: 25. 8 ± 17. 6 %) who underwent TA-TAVI in our center were included. The Edwards valve was used in all cases, and all procedures were performed in an operating room without hybrid facilities. The TA-TAVI was primarily guided by angiography in the first 25 patients (A-TAVI group) and by TEE in the last 75 patients (TEE-TAVI group). Procedural, 30 -day, and follow-up results were evaluated. ResultsNo differences were observed between groups at baseline except for a higher (p = 0. 001) prevalence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation in the TEE-TAVI group. The procedure was successful in 97. 3 % and 100 % of the patients in the TEE-TAVI and A-TAVI groups, respectively (p = 1. 0), and a lower contrast volume was used in the TEE-TAVI group (12 [5 to 20] ml vs. 40 [20 to 50] ml, p < 0. 0001). There were no differences between groups in the occurrence of valve malposition needing a second valve (TEE-TAVI: 5. 3 %; A-TAVI: 4 %; p = 1. 0) or valve embolization (TEE-TAVI: 1. 3 %; A-TAVI: 4 %; p = 0. 44). The results regarding post-procedural <b>valve</b> hemodynamic <b>status</b> and aortic regurgitation were similar between groups. The survival rates at 30 -day and 1 -year follow-up were 87 % and 75 % in the TEE-group and 88 % and 84 % in the A-TAVI group, respectively (log-rank = 0. 49). ConclusionsTEE-TAVI was associated with similar acute and midterm results as A-TAVI and significantly reduced contrast media use during the procedures. These results suggest the feasibility and safety of performing TA-TAVI procedures in an operating room without hybrid facilities, but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Patients (n = 195) {{undergoing}} {{aortic valve}} replacement (n = 209) for native or prosthetic valve endocarditis were studied to determine {{risk factors for}} death and recurrent endocarditis and also to determine the valve type least likely {{to be associated with}} recurrent endocarditis. Ten-year survival was 60 %, the highest risk of dying occurring within the first 3 postoperative months. Risk factors for death in this early phase included increased urea concentration, higher New York Heart Association functional class, prosthetic <b>valve</b> endocarditis, infection <b>status</b> (lower in patients with healed endocarditis), longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, and nonuse of an allograft valve. In the late phase (beyond 3 months), risk factors included age at operation and Staphylococcus aureus infection (only in New York Heart Association functional class V). Ten years after aortic valve replacement, 79 % of valves were free of recurrent endocarditis. The highest risk of recurrence was in the first 4 months. Longer duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was a weak risk factor for recurrent endocarditis in the early phase, and in the late phase risk factors were S. aureus infection (only in New York Heart Association functional classes III, IV, and V) and the use of now discontinued biologic valves. Allograft aortic valve replacement was shown to be associated with a low and constant risk of recurrent endocarditis, whereas other valve types were associated with a high early risk. The allograft valve should be the preferred replacement device for aortic root infection...|$|R
40|$|Puberty is {{accompanied}} by significant changes in hemodynamics that can influence interpretation of clinical states. However {{the extent to which}} this is influenced by the nutritional status of children is poorly understood. To study the changes in cardiac dimensions with onset of early puberty and their relation to growth and nutritional status in females. Methods: Survey was conducted for 200 schools girls aged 9 – 12  years including full cardiac exam, blood pressure (BP), weight-for-age (W/A), height-for-age (H/A) and body mass index (BMI) and echocardiography for aortic, atrial and ventricular dimensions, as well pressure gradients and flow velocities. Further analysis was conducted for forty cases that were identified with flow abnormalities. Findings: Only 17. 5 % had audible murmurs. Mean BP ranged from 90. 4 in the 9  years olds, 94 in the 10  year olds, 95. 9 in the 11  year olds and 97. 5 in the 12  year olds. Morphologic dimensions were measured for the ventricles, left atria (LA) and aorta (Ao). Aortic dimensions increased with the onset of puberty and correlated with the BMI increase, but the mean aortic to left atrial dimensions were unchanged with puberty onset. Also ventricular dimensions did not change with puberty. The E wave of the mitral valve signal and deceleration velocity showed some change with age, with an exaggerated E wave. BMI averaged 17. 1 at 9  years increasing to 21 at 12  years. Underweight (− 2 SDS) occurred in 22. 5 % and stunting (− 2 SDS) in 10 % and wasting (underweight for height) in 17. 5 %. Fifty percent of the children were exposed to passive smoking from family member, 69. 2 % did not consume a healthy diet and 97 % did not practice sports. Conclusions: Onset of puberty {{is accompanied}} by an increase in aortic dimensions to cope with the increased venous return from the developing body systems. Growth disturbances may result in echo abnormalities in flow across the cardiac <b>valves.</b> Improving nutritional <b>status</b> and healthy living lifestyles of children in this period may prevent abnormalities and restore hemodynamics of the heart...|$|R
40|$|Background: Globally, rheumatic {{heart disease}} (RHD) remains an {{important}} cause of heart disease. In Australia it particularly affects younger Indigenous and older non-Indigenous Australians. Despite its impact there is limited understanding of the factors influencing outcome following surgery for RHD. Methods: The Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons Cardiac Surgery Database was analysed to assess outcomes following surgical procedures for RHD and non-RHD valvular disease. The association with demographics, co-morbidities, pre-operative <b>status,</b> <b>valve(s)</b> affected and operative procedure was evaluated. Results: Outcome of 1384 RHD and 15843 non-RHD valve procedures was analysed. RHD patients had longer ventilation, experienced fewer strokes and had more readmissions to hospital and anticoagulant complications. Mortality following RHD surgery at 30 days was 3. 1 % (95 % CI 2. 2 - 4. 3), 5 years 15. 3 % (11. 7 - 19. 5) and 10 years 25. 0 % (10. 7 - 44. 9). Mortality following non-RHD surgery at 30 days was 4. 3 % (95 % CI 3. 9 - 4. 6), 5 years 17. 6 % (16. 4 - 18. 9) and 10 years 39. 4 % (33. 0 - 46. 1). Factors independently associated with poorer longer term survival following RHD surgery included older age (OR 1. 03 /additional year, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 05), concomitant diabetes (OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 2. 5) and chronic kidney disease (1. 9, 1. 2 - 2. 9), longer invasive ventilation time (OR 1. 7 if greater than median value, 1. 1 - 2. 9) and prolonged stay in hospital (1. 02 /additional day, 1. 01 - 1. 03). Survival in Indigenous Australians was comparable to that seen in non-Indigenous Australians. Conclusion: In a large prospective cohort study we have demonstrated survival following RHD valve surgery in Australia is comparable to earlier studies. Patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, were at particular risk of poorer long-term survival. Unlike earlier studies {{we did not find}} pre-existing atrial fibrillation, being an Indigenous Australian or the nature of the underlying valve lesion were independent predictors of survival. E.
