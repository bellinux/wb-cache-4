40|$|Abstract — In energy-aware design, {{especially}} for systems with uncertain power sources, asynchronous computation loads which can function under <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> have many potential advantages. Fully safe asynchronous loads based on delay insensitivity (DI), however, tend to suffer power and size penalties. As a compromise, delay bundling {{has been widely}} used in asynchronous computation, but traditional delay elements {{have been shown to}} be unsuitable for bundling memory components, whose latency behaviour varies differently under variable Vdd from other types of logic. This paper proposes an intelligent delay bundling method for SRAM working under Vdd which unpredictably varies over a wide range (e. g. 200 mV to 1 V for 90 nm technology), based on the principle of using matching delay bundling elements. A fully speed independent (SI) SRAM design is investigated in depth and a self-timed SRAM architecture using such SI SRAM cells as delay bundling elements is demonstrated through comprehensive analysis.

Ultra low power supply or even {{a very short period}} without power supply may cause very serious consequences. In the case of system memories, important data may be lost. A gated diode based DRAM can be a potential memory solution as a dynamic backup storage to meet these challenges. However, before exploring this solution, such DRAMs need to be studied under low and variable Vdd situations and this paper investigates these problems. Gated diodes can be used in DRAM cells and sense amplifiers on the read bit-lines. These give the DRAM significantly long retention time and improve memory reading speed. This paper investigates the performance of two existing DRAM structures, 2 T 1 D and 3 T 1 D, working under low and variable Vdd. In addition, a novel sense amplifying method which works correctly under very low Vdd is developed. The performances of DRAMs with the novel sense amplifiers, with typical sense amplifiers, and without sense amplifiers are characterized with a comparative study.

40|$|As the {{proportion}} of total power supplied by renewable sources increases, it gets more costly to use reserve generation {{to compensate for the}} variability of renewables like solar and wind. Hence attention has been drawn to exploiting flexibility in demand as a substitute for reserve generation. Flexibility has different attributes. In this paper we consider loads requiring a constant power for a specified duration (within say one day), whose flexibility resides in the fact that power may be delivered at any time so long as the total duration of service equals the load’s specified duration. We give conditions under which a <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is adequate to meet these flexible loads, and describe how to allocate the power to the loads. We also characterize the additional power needed when the supply is inadequate. We study the problem of allocating the available power to loads to maximize welfare, and show that the welfare optimum can be sustained as a competitive equilibrium in a forward market in which electricity is sold as service contracts differentiated by the duration of service and power level. We compare this forward market with a spot market in their ability to capture the flexiblity inherent in duration-differentiated loads. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As IC {{technology}} scales down, interconnect {{issues are}} {{becoming one of}} the major concerns of gigahertz System-on-Chip (SoC) design. Voltage distortion (power supply noise) and delay violations (signal and clock skews) dramatically contribute to signal integrity loss. Temperature variations and gradients along the die, due to (variable) power consumption, also {{have a negative impact on}} SoC behavior. As a consequence, performance degradation, reliability problems and, ultimately, functional error occur. Detection of physical defects in emerging nanometer semiconductor technologies requires the detection of dynamic faults, namely delay test. In addition, process variations must be taken into account, leading to the specification of acceptability windows and time slacks. In previous works, it has been demonstrated that parametric tests using <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> voltage (multi-VDD test) and temperature (multi-T test) can be rewardingly applied to production and lifetime test. In this paper, a simple analytical model to define those dynamic parametric tests and the resulting test strategy are presented.

Include consideration of radiated energy, supposing that the circuit has {{the form of a}} circular loop of radius a.

As confirmed in sec. 2. 1, if the capacitor is charged to voltage V in a simple RC circuit, then the resistor dissipates energy equal to that eventually stored in the capacitor. Heinrich [1] noted that this energy loss could be avoided if the battery is replaced by a <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> whose voltage is raised “slowly ” to the desired value V. 1 See also [2, 3]. If one capacitor is charged by another in a circuit with negligible resistance, there is again a loss of energy, to radiation in this case [4, 5, 6]. These analyses leave open the question of whether energy loss is inevitable whenever a capacitor is charged “quickly”. Show that a capacitor can be charged with only modest energy loss in an underdamped series RLC circuit if the battery is disconnected after 1 / 2 cycle. ...|$|E

This paper considers the design and evaluation of transformer-based and transformer less-based <b>variable</b> regulated DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> {{with the aim of}} presenting a comparative analysis between them; and their respective areas of applications. The quality, cost, size, weight, performance and efficient production of DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> thus pose a great deal of concern and attention in the DC power production of any electronic device. The design methodology used in this work involves Software design for component selection, improved hardware design, computer simulation and evaluation of transformation, rectification, filtration and regulation stages for both transformer-based and transformer less-based adjustable DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> with graphical outputs. The results obtained after following the design specification was very satisfactory. The transformer-based has a robust output current and well isolated from the supply voltage, which makes it more suitable for high current application, highly reliable for powering electronics devices while the transformer less based DC source has smaller size, weight and cheaper so as to miniaturize electronics devices but limited to low current devices. It also generates far less noise, heat, input harmonic distortion levels, and higher transient response but lack of proper isolation unlike its counterpart thus result in lower Mean Time To Failure (MTTF). Transformer less <b>variable</b> DC <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> should be considered a viable option for lower power, small and low current applications where achieving the highest availability is not the top concern and cost, size and weight restrictions inhibit the use of traditional transformer-based DC <b>power</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R

Powering these systems using harvested energy from ambient sources provides an attractive alternative {{to the use of}} batteries which may be either inaccessible for routine maintenance or unsuitable (for example in aerospace applications).
