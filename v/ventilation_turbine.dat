40|$|This project aims {{to create}} a more compact and {{accessible}} renewable energy source using the Wind and <b>Ventilation</b> <b>Turbine</b> (WVT) Generator. The wind turbine provides ventilation while generating “clean” electricity using solar and kinetic energy. The electrical generation causes no functional losses to the ventilation as rising heat and passing wind turn the turbine, ventilating the house. Placing a generator beneath the spinning turbine allows for the transformation of mechanical motion into electrical energy. The system charges a battery, supplying recharging power into small standard electronics (i. e. cell phones, tablets, etc.) through a USB output...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the feasibility {{and effects of}} non-invasive pressure support ventilation (NIV) on the breathing pattern in infants developing respiratory failure after extubation. DESIGN: Prospective pilot clinical study; each patient served as their own control. SETTING: A nine-bed paediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary university hospital. PATIENTS: Six patients (median age 5 months, range 0. 5 - 7 months; median weight 4. 2 kg, range 3. 8 - 5. 1 kg) who developed respiratory failure after extubation. INTERVENTIONS: After a period of spontaneous breathing (SB), children who developed respiratory failure were treated with NIV. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Measurements included clinical dyspnoea score (DS), blood gases and oesophageal pressure recordings, which were analysed for respiratory rate (RR), oesophageal inspiratory pressure swing (dPes) and oesophageal pressure-time product (PTPes). All data were collected during both periods (SB and NIV). When comparing NIV with SB, DS was reduced by 44 % (P < 0. 001), RR by 32 % (P < 0. 001), dPes by 45 % (P < 0. 01) and PTPes by 57 % (P < 0. 001). A non-significant trend for decrease in PaCO(2) was observed. CONCLUSION: In these infants, non-invasive pressure support <b>ventilation</b> with <b>turbine</b> flow generator induced a reduction of breathing frequency, dPes and PTPes, indicating reduced load of the inspiratory muscles. NIV {{can be used with}} some benefits in infants with respiratory failure after extubation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Tuberculosis {{transmission}} {{in healthcare}} facilities contributes {{significantly to the}} TB epidemic, particularly in high HIV settings. Although improving ventilation may reduce transmission, {{there is a lack}} of evidence to support low-cost practical interventions. We assessed the efficacy of wind-driven roof turbines to achieve recommended ventilation rates, compared to current recommended practices for natural ventilation (opening windows), in primary care clinic rooms in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Methods: Room ventilation was assessed (CO 2 gas tracer technique) in 4 rooms where roof turbines and air-intake grates were installed, across three scenarios: turbine, grate and window closed, only window open, and only turbine and grate open, with concurrent wind speed measurement. 332 measurements were conducted over 24 months. Findings: For all 4 rooms combined, median air changes per hour (ACH) increased with wind speed quartiles across all scenarios. Higher median ACH were recorded with open roof turbines and grates, compared to open windows across all wind speed quartiles. <b>Ventilation</b> with open <b>turbine</b> and grate exceeded WHO-recommended levels (60 Litres/second/ patient) for 95 % or more of measurements in 3 of the 4 rooms; 47 % in the remaining room, where wind speeds were lower and a smaller diameter turbine was installed. Conclusion: High room ventilation rates, meeting recommended thresholds, may be achieved using wind-driven roo...|$|R

Roof turbines and air-intake grates are not easily closed by staff, allowing continued ventilation through colder periods.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{extensive}} study of rectangular cross-sectioned C-duct and C-diffuser is made by the help of 2 -D mean velocity contours. Study of flow characteristics through constant area duct is a fundamental research area of basic fluid mechanics since the concepts of potential flow and frictional losses in conduit flow were established. C-ducts are used in aircraft intakes, combustors, internal cooling systems of gas <b>turbines,</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducts, wind tunnels etc., while diffuser is mechanical device usually made {{in the form of}} a gradual conical expander intended to raise the static pressure of the fluid flowing through it. Flow through curved ducts is more complex compared to straight duct due to the curvature of the duct axis and centrifugal forces are induced on the flowing fluid resulting in the development of secondary motion (normal to the primary flow direction) which is manifested {{in the form of a}} pair of contra-rotating vortices. For a diffuser in addition to the secondary flow, the diverging flow passage, which causes an adverse stream wise pressure gradient, can lead to flow separation. The combined effect may result n non uniformity of total pressure and total pressure loss at the exit. A comparative study of different turbulent models available in the Fluent using y  as guidance in selecting the appropriate grid configuration and turbulence models are done. Standard k-ε model and RSM models are used to solve the closure problem for both the constant area duct and the diffuser. It has been observed that the Standard k-e model predicts the flow through the constant area duct and the diffuser within a reasonable domain ofthe y  range...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In Sri Lanka, around 50 % of the {{electrical}} energy generation is done using thermal energy, and hence maintaining generation efficiencies of thermal power plants at {{an acceptable level}} is very important from a socio-economic perspective for the economic development of the country. Efficiency monitoring also plays a vital role as it lays the foundation for maintaining and improving of generation efficiency. Heat rate, which is the reciprocal of the efficiency, is {{used to measure the}} performance of thermal power plants. In combined cycle power plants, heat rate depends on ambient conditions and efficiencies of subsystems such as the gas turbine, Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), steam turbine, condenser, cooling tower etc. The heat rate provides only a macroscopic picture of the power plant, and hence it is required to analyse the efficiency of each subsystem {{in order to get a}} microscopic picture. Computer modelling is an efficient method which can be used to analyse the each subsystem of a combined cycle power plant. Objective of this research is to develop a computer based tool which simulates the performance of subsystems of a combined cycle power plant in Sri Lanka. At the inception of the research, only heat rate was measured, and performances of subsystem were unknown.                   During the analysis, plant is divided into main systems, in order to study them macroscopically. Then, these main systems are divided into subsystems in order to have a microscopic view. Engineering equation solver (EES) was used to develop the tool, and the final computer model was linked with Microsoft excel package for data handling. Final computer model is executed using both present and past operating data in order to compare present and past performance of the power plant.              In combined cycle power plants steam is injected into the gas turbine to reduce the NOx generation and this steam flow is known as NOx flow. According to the result it was evident that turbine efficiency drops by 0. 1 % and power output increase by 1 MW when NOx flow increases from 4. 8 to 6. 2 kg/s. Further it was possible to conclude that gas turbine efficiency drop by 0. 1 % when ambient temperature increased by 3 C; and gas turbine power output decrease by 2 MW when ambient temperature increases from 27 to 31 degrees.   Regarding the steam cycle efficiency it was found that steam turbine power output drops by  0. 5 MW when ambient temperature increases from 27 to 31 degrees; and steam cycle efficiency increases by 1 % when NOx flow increases from 4. 8 to 6. 2 kg/s. Further, steam turbine power output decreases by 0. 25 MW When NOx flow increases from 4. 8 to 6. 2 kg/s                 Heat rate, which is the most important performance index of the power plant, increases by 10 units (kJ/kWh) when ambient temperature increases by 3 C. Heat rate also increases with raising NOx flow which was 6. 2 kg/s in 2007 and 4. 2 kg/s in 2011. Hence, heat rate of the power plant has improved (decreased) by 10 units (kJ/kWh) from 2007 to 2011.                Other than above, following conclusions were also revealed during the study.                          1)        HRSG efficiency has not change during past 4 years 2)      Significant waste heat recovery potential exists in the gas <b>turbine</b> <b>ventilation</b> system in the form of thermal energy...|$|R
