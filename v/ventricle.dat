5|$|The {{heart has}} four valves, which {{separate}} its chambers. One valve lies between each atrium and <b>ventricle,</b> and one valve rests {{at the exit}} of each <b>ventricle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, {{colourless}} {{transcellular fluid}} that circulates around {{the brain in}} the subarachnoid space, in the ventricular system, and in the central canal of the spinal cord. It also fills some gaps in the subarachnoid space, known as subarachnoid cisterns. The four ventricles, two lateral, a third, and a fourth <b>ventricle,</b> all contain choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The third <b>ventricle</b> lies in the midline and {{is connected to the}} lateral ventricles. A single duct, the cerebral aqueduct between the pons and the cerebellum, connects the third <b>ventricle</b> to the fourth <b>ventricle.</b> Three separate openings, the middle and two lateral apertures, drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the fourth <b>ventricle</b> to the cisterna magna one of the major cisterns. From here, cerebrospinal fluid circulates around the brain and spinal cord in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid mater and pia mater.|$|E
5|$|The left <b>ventricle</b> is much thicker as {{compared}} with the right, due to the greater force needed to pump blood to the entire body. Like the right <b>ventricle,</b> the left also has trabeculae carneae, but there is no moderator band. The left <b>ventricle</b> pumps blood to the body through the aortic valve and into the aorta. Two small openings above the aortic valve carry blood to the heart itself, the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery.|$|E
500|$|The {{cardiac cycle}} {{refers to a}} {{complete}} heartbeat which includes systole and diastole and the intervening pause. The cycle begins with contraction of the atria and ends with relaxation of the <b>ventricles.</b> [...] Systole refers to contraction of the atria or <b>ventricles</b> of the heart. Diastole is when the atria or <b>ventricles</b> relax and fill with blood. The atria and <b>ventricles</b> work in concert, so in systole when the <b>ventricles</b> are contracting, the atria are relaxed and collecting blood. When the <b>ventricles</b> are relaxed in diastole, the atria contract to pump blood to the <b>ventricles.</b> This coordination ensures blood is pumped efficiently to the body.|$|R
30|$|Brain imaging showed slit <b>ventricles</b> in five {{patients}} and near normal <b>ventricles</b> in two patients.|$|R
50|$|These are the mitral and tricuspid valves, {{which are}} {{situated}} between the atria and the <b>ventricles</b> and prevent backflow from the <b>ventricles</b> into the atria during systole. They are {{anchored to the}} walls of the <b>ventricles</b> by chordae tendineae, which prevent the valves from inverting.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood will flow into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right <b>ventricle)</b> or aorta (left <b>ventricle).</b>|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single <b>ventricle.</b> The <b>ventricle</b> is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common <b>ventricle</b> before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The <b>ventricle</b> is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.|$|E
50|$|Heart valves are {{essentially}} inlet and outlet check valves {{for the heart}} <b>ventricles,</b> since the <b>ventricles</b> act as pumps.|$|R
50|$|During systole, the <b>ventricles</b> contract, pumping blood {{through the}} body. During diastole, the <b>ventricles</b> relax and fill with blood again.|$|R
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} valves (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the <b>ventricles,</b> the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent backflow into the <b>ventricles.</b> When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral valves will shut. When the <b>ventricles</b> contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary valves open. As the <b>ventricles</b> relax, the aortic and pulmonary valves will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|R
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right <b>ventricle,</b> the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right <b>ventricle</b> undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Most (about two-thirds to 80%) of CSF is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus. The choroid plexus is a network of blood vessels present within sections of the four ventricles of the brain. It is present throughout the ventricular system except for the cerebral aqueduct, frontal horn of the lateral <b>ventricle,</b> and occipital horn of the lateral <b>ventricle.</b> CSF is also produced by the single layer of column-shaped ependymal cells which line the ventricles; by the lining surrounding the subarachnoid space; and a small amount directly from the tiny spaces surrounding blood vessels around the brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right atrium, and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left atrium and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining {{the back of the}} left <b>ventricle),</b> the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right <b>ventricle</b> and drain directly into the right atrium.|$|E
50|$|In human embryology, {{the primary}} {{interventricular}} foramen {{is a temporary}} opening between the developing <b>ventricles</b> of the heart. The <b>ventricles</b> arise as a single cavity that is divided by the developing interventricular septum. Before the septum closes completely, the remaining opening between the two <b>ventricles</b> is termed the interventricular foramen.|$|R
50|$|Computed Tomography {{scans of}} {{schizophrenic}} brains show several pathologies. The brain <b>ventricles</b> are enlarged {{as compared to}} normal brains. The <b>ventricles</b> hold cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and enlarged <b>ventricles</b> indicate a loss of brain volume. Additionally, schizophrenic brains have widened sulci as compared to normal brains, also with increased CSF volumes and reduced brain volume.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the general cause of beta-adrenergic receptor neuroeffector abnormalities in the failing human heart, we measured ventricular myocardial adrenergic receptors, adrenergic neurotransmitters, and beta-adrenergic receptor-effector responses in nonfailing and failing hearts taken from nonfailing organ donors, subjects with endstage biventricular failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), and subjects with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) who exhibited isolated right ventricular failure. Relative to nonfailing PPH left <b>ventricles,</b> failing PPH right <b>ventricles</b> exhibited (a) markedly decreased beta 1 -adrenergic receptor density, (b) marked depletion of tissue norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y, (c) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation {{in response to the}} beta agonists isoproterenol and zinterol, and (d) decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation in response to Gpp(NH) p and forskolin. These abnormalities were directionally similar to, but generally more pronounced than, corresponding findings in failing IDC right <b>ventricles,</b> whereas values for these parameters in nonfailing left <b>ventricles</b> of PPH subjects were similar to values in the nonfailing left <b>ventricles</b> of organ donors. Additionally, relative to paired nonfailing PPH left <b>ventricles</b> and nonfailing right <b>ventricles</b> from organ donors, failing right <b>ventricles</b> from PPH subjects exhibited decreased adenylate cyclase stimulation by MnCl 2. These data indicate that: (a) Adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities present in the failing human heart are due to local mechanisms; systemic processes do not produce beta-adrenergic neuroeffector abnormalities. (b) Pressure-overloaded failing right <b>ventricles</b> of PPH subjects exhibit decreased activity of the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, an abnormality not previously described in the failing human heart...|$|R
5|$|The left {{heart has}} two chambers: the left atrium, {{and the left}} <b>ventricle,</b> {{separated}} by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{consists}} of two chambers, the right atrium and the right <b>ventricle,</b> separated by a valve, the tricuspid valve.|$|E
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right <b>ventricle</b> is the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left <b>ventricle.</b> It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated {{sodium channel}} {{function}} from neonatal and adult rat cardiomyocytes was measured and compared. Channels from neonatal <b>ventricles</b> required an ∼ 10 mV greater depolarization for voltage-dependent gating events than did channels from neonatal atria and adult atria and <b>ventricles.</b> We questioned whether such gating shifts {{were due to}} developmental and/or chamber-dependent changes in channel-associated functional sialic acids. Thus, all gating characteristics for channels from neonatal atria and adult atria and <b>ventricles</b> shifted significantly to more depolarized potentials after removal of surface sialic acids. Desialylation of channels from neonatal <b>ventricles</b> did not affect channel gating. After removal of the complete surface N-glycosylation structures, gating of channels from neonatal atria and adult atria and <b>ventricles</b> shifted to depolarized potentials nearly identical to those measured for channels from neonatal <b>ventricles.</b> Gating of channels from neonatal <b>ventricles</b> were unaffected by such deglycosylation. Immunoblot gel shift analyses indicated that voltage-gated sodium channel α subunits from neonatal atria and adult atria and <b>ventricles</b> are more heavily sialylated than α subunits from neonatal <b>ventricles.</b> The data are consistent with approximately 15 more sialic acid residues attached to each α subunit from neonatal atria and adult atria and <b>ventricles.</b> The data indicate that differential sialylation of myocyte voltage-gated sodium channel α subunits is responsible {{for much of the}} developmental and chamber-specific remodeling of channel gating observed here. Further, cardiac excitability is likely impacted by these sialic acid–dependent gating effects, such as modulation of the rate of recovery from inactivation. A novel mechanism is described by which cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel gating and subsequently cardiac rhythms are modulated by changes in channel-associated sialic acids...|$|R
50|$|Atrioventricular block (AV block) {{is a type}} {{of heart}} block in which the {{conduction}} between the atria and <b>ventricles</b> of the heart is impaired. Under normal conditions, the sinoatrial node (SA node) in the atria sets the pace for the heart, and these impulses travel down to the <b>ventricles.</b> In an AV block, this message does not reach the <b>ventricles</b> or is impaired along the way. The <b>ventricles</b> of the heart have their own pacing mechanisms, which can maintain a lowered heart rate in the absence of SA stimulation.|$|R
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} <b>ventricles</b> where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral <b>ventricles.</b> Beneath the lateral <b>ventricles</b> is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|R
5|$|There {{is about}} 125-150mL of CSF {{at any one}} time. This CSF circulates within the {{ventricular}} system of the brain. The ventricles {{are a series of}} cavities filled with CSF. The majority of CSF is produced from within the two lateral ventricles. From here, the CSF passes through the interventricular foramina to the third <b>ventricle,</b> then the cerebral aqueduct to the fourth <b>ventricle.</b> From the fourth <b>ventricle,</b> the fluid passes into the subarachnoid space through four openings – the central canal of the spinal cord, the median aperture, and the two lateral apertures. CSF is present within the subarachnoid space, which covers the brain, spinal cord, and stretches below the end of the spinal cord to the sacrum. There is a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear making the cerebrospinal fluid continuous with the perilymph in 93% of people.|$|E
5|$|Two {{additional}} semilunar valves sit at {{the exit}} {{of each of the}} ventricles. The pulmonary valve is located {{at the base of the}} pulmonary artery. This has three cusps which are not attached to any papillary muscles. When the <b>ventricle</b> relaxes blood flows back into the <b>ventricle</b> from the artery and this flow of blood fills the pocket-like valve, pressing against the cusps which close to seal the valve. The semilunar aortic valve is at the base of the aorta and also is not attached to papillary muscles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single <b>ventricle</b> and two atria. When the <b>ventricle</b> starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} signal transduction in denervated, previously transplanted human ventricular myocardium. Background. In model systems, surgical denervation typically results in both presynaptic and postsynaptic supersensitivity in beta-adrenergic receptor pathways and alteration in G protein-mediated signal transduction. Methods. We examined beta-adrenergic receptor signal transduction in the left and right <b>ventricles</b> removed from nine subjects with a previous transplant and surgical denervation 25 ± 4 months after their first transplantation. Twenty-six hearts removed from organ donors served as control hearts. Results. Total beta-adrenergic receptor density and stimulation of muscle contraction in isolated right ventricular trabeculae by the nonselective agonist isoproterenol were similar in the transplant and donor groups. Beta 1 -receptor density was not in the left <b>ventricles</b> of the two group but tended to be reduced (by 29 %, p = 0. 09) in transplant right <b>ventricles.</b> By contrast, betah 2 -receptor density was higher in transplant left and right <b>ventricles</b> relative to the respective values in donor <b>ventricles</b> by 33 % in left <b>ventricles</b> and 97 % in right <b>ventricles</b> (both p < 0. 05). Isoproterenol, which in particulate fractions of human heart stimulate adenylyl cyclase primarily via beta 2 -receptors, produced a greater increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate generation in membranes prepared from transplant left <b>ventricles</b> and right <b>ventricles</b> compared with donors. In contrast, guanosine 5 ′-[beta,gamma-imido]triphosphate, sodium fluoride and forskolin, which stimulate adenylyl cyclase through nonreceptor/G protein-sensitive mechanisms, yielded similar degress of adenylyl cyclase stimulation in the two group, and both pertussis toxin- and cholera toxin-catalyzed adenosine diphosphate ribosylation were not altered in transplanted left <b>ventricles.</b> Conclusions. These data indicate that the transplanted human heart exhibits an up-regulation of functional beta 2 adrenergic receptors...|$|R
25|$|The {{walls of}} the {{interventricular}} foramina contain choroid plexus, a specialized structure that produces cerebrospinal fluid. The choroid plexus of the third <b>ventricles</b> continues through the foramina into the lateral <b>ventricles.</b>|$|R
50|$|MHC-α isoform is abundantly {{expressed}} in both cardiac atria and cardiac <b>ventricles</b> during embryonic development. Following birth, cardiac <b>ventricles</b> predominantly express the MHC-β isoform and cardiac atria predominantly express the MHC-α isoform.|$|R
5|$|Capillaries are {{organized}} into capillary beds in tissues; {{it is here}} that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste. In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues. Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart. Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure. As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart. Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right <b>ventricle</b> to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen. Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left <b>ventricle</b> where it is pumped out to the body.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, <b>ventricle.</b> The <b>ventricle</b> is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Panday {{performed}} a rare heart operation at the Nanavati hospital in Mumbai, wherein a large tumor {{was removed from}} the left <b>ventricle</b> of a 29-year-old patient. This was the first operation of its kind in India, as tumors {{in that part of the}} heart are considered uncommon.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} phase of {{ventricular}} diastole, called late ventricular diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the blood within the <b>ventricles</b> drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria. When this occurs, blood flows from the atria into the <b>ventricles,</b> pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves. As pressure drops within the <b>ventricles,</b> blood flows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the <b>ventricles.</b> Both chambers are in diastole, the atrioventricular valves are open, and the semilunar valves remain closed. The cardiac cycle is complete.|$|R
5000|$|A PVC may be {{perceived}} as a [...] "skipped beat" [...] or felt as palpitations in the chest. In a normal heartbeat, the <b>ventricles</b> contract after the atria have helped to fill them by contracting; in this way the <b>ventricles</b> can pump a maximized amount of blood both to the lungs and {{to the rest of the}} body. In a PVC, the <b>ventricles</b> contract first and before the atria have optimally filled the <b>ventricles</b> with blood, which means that circulation is inefficient. However, single beat PVC abnormal heart rhythms do not usually pose a danger and can be asymptomatic in healthy individuals.|$|R
