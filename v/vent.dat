5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central <b>vent</b> eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.

5|$|Nevado del Ruiz has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central <b>vent</b> eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994.

5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the <b>vent</b> is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the <b>vent,</b> but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vented</b> fins {{were first}} {{designed}} in 1964 by Georges Beuchat and commercialised as Jetfins.

The <b>vents</b> are intended to allow for the passage of water during the recovery stroke, but prevent passage during power strokes due to the blade angle, attempting to lessen effort during recovery and improve kick efficiency. A review and study by Pendergast et al in 2003 concluded that <b>vented</b> fins did not improve economy, implying that water does not pass through the <b>vents.</b> The study is only partially significant because it only considers the flutter kick, whereas the jetfin is mostly used with frog kick in the technical diving community.

5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's <b>vent,</b> some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below.

40|$|In this study, {{the water}} vapour balance method {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} the ventilation rate to calibrate and validate the ventilation sub-model of the Gembloux Dynamic Greenhouse Climate Model (GDGCM) in a naturally ventilated three span Azrom type greenhouse in Zimbabwe. Two ventilation strategies were considered to investigate their effects on the microclimate and transpiration of the rose crop: the configuration with roof <b>vents</b> only (while the side <b>vents</b> were closed) and the configuration with both roof <b>vents</b> and side <b>vents.</b> Crop transpiration was evaluated using the Penman-Monteith method. This allowed continuous and automatic determination of the ventilation rate and leakage rate using the water vapour balance method. The model was fitted to experimental data for ventilation rates, and the parameters for the model, the discharge and wind effect coefficient were determined using statistical analysis. The results showed that there was a good fit between measured and predicted values (R 2 = 0. 702 and 0. 729 for the model of ventilation for the greenhouse operating respectively with both roof and side <b>vents</b> and with roof <b>vents</b> only for the summer period considered), although there was a general overestimation of the air renewal rates, particularly during the night. The air renewal rate was found to be influenced by the ventilation regime in practice. The greenhouse was found to have higher air renewal rates for the configuration with both roof and side <b>vents.</b> On a typical hot day, the maximum simulated air renewal rate was 15. 6 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof and side <b>vents</b> at 1600 hrs, while it was only 6. 5 hr- 1 for the configuration with roof <b>vents</b> at the same time. The difference between the air renewal rates for the different regimes resulted in different microclimates, since the ventilation affects both the energy balance and mass balance of a greenhouse. The greenhouse inside air temperature was reduced significantly for the configuration with both roof and side <b>vents</b> as it had lower simulated air temperatures than the configuration with roof <b>vents</b> only. On a typical hot day the maximum simulated air temperature for the configuration with roof and side <b>vents</b> was 29. 7 ÂºC, while it was 31. 5 ÂºC for roof <b>vents</b> configuration at 1400 hrs. On typical selected days the maximum differences between the inside air temperature and the external air temperature were 3. 7 ÂºC and 4. 6 ÂºC for the configuration with both roof and side <b>vents</b> and the configuration with roof <b>vents</b> only, respectively. Thus during summer periods it is necessary to have a greenhouse with both roof and side <b>vents</b> so that plants will have a better physiological and morphological development, as the air renewal rates influence crop behaviour largely through their effects on gas exchanges, particularly transpiration and photosynthesis. The transpiration of the rose crop was found to be influenced by the ventilation strategy. The simulated maximum canopy transpiration flux density was 166. 5 W m- 2 for the configuration with both roof and side <b>vents,</b> while it was 152. 9 Wm- 2 for the roof <b>vents</b> only on a selected hot day. The simulated night-time relative humidities were higher for the configuration with roof <b>vents</b> only. The simulated relative humidity was above 90 % for the configuration with roof <b>vents</b> only, while it was 84 % for the configuration with both roof and side <b>vents.</b> To prevent excessive humidity build up, the ventilation strategy with both roof and side <b>vents</b> needs to be employed in order to prevent condensation in the greenhouse...|$|R
