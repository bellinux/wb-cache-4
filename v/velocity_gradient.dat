40|$|Abstract [...] A new {{boundary}} {{integral equation}} is derived directly for <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients</b> in a finite-strain clasto-plastic solid. These integral equations for <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients</b> {{do not involve}} hyper-singularities (when the source point is taken to the boundary) of the type found in the alternate case when the integral equations for velocities are differentiated to derive an integral relation for <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients.</b> Hence the new formulation obviates {{the need for a}} two tier system of computing the <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients,</b> which existed in the alternate case. A genera&d mid-point radial return algorithm is presented for determining the objective increments of stress from the computed <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients.</b> Moreover, a mid-point evaluation of the generalized Jaumann integral is used to determine the material increments of stress. The constitutive equation employed is based on an endochronic model of combined isotropic/ kinematic hardening finite plasticity using the concepts of a material director triad and the associated plastic spin. The problem of a thick cylinder under prescribed internal velocity is considered for illustrative purposes. The solution derived from the present formulation is compared with that of the standard formulation and the exact solution. 1. INTRODU~ION The boundary element method (BEM) is based upo...|$|R

We suggest a definition of local <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients</b> to compute types of self-motion, segment objects, and compute local properties of optical flow fields, such as divergence, curl, and shear. Such <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients</b> are computed as velocity differ-ences measured locally tangent and normal to the direction of flow. Then these differences are rotated according to the local direction of flow to achieve independence of that direction. We propose a bio-inspiredmodel for the computation of these <b>velocity</b> <b>gradients</b> for video sequences. Sim-ulation results show that local gradients encode ordinal surface depth, assuming self-motion in a rigid scene or object motions in a nonrigid scene. For translational self-motion <b>velocity,</b> <b>gradients</b> can be used to distinguish between static and moving objects.
