5|$|Ambohimanga {{has been}} <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> Merina {{since the late}} 19th century as the {{embodiment}} of an ideal social order blessed by the ancestors. The significance attached to the site in Imerina increased further when its sister rova in Antananarivo was destroyed by fire in 1995, contributing to a sense that Ambohimanga was the last remaining physical link to this sanctified past. A small intellectual elite among the Tsimahafotsy clan of Ambohimanga and the nobles (andriana) believe that only Ambohimanga possesses the ancestral benediction (hasina) to serve as the national capital and imbue national leaders with the legitimacy and wisdom needed to rightly govern the country. The descendents of the andriana have consequently been key in promoting and protecting Ambohimanga, such as by playing a significant role in successfully lobbying UNESCO to list Ambohimanga as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Sunshine (1999)—a three-hour {{historical}} epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was <b>viewed</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> {{critics as}} Szabó’s most ambitious film, and, along with Mephisto, his most important. Hungary’s Jews had figured {{in either a}} marginal or coded fashion in several of Szabó’s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around {{the history of the}} country’s Jews was more circumscribed. In Sunshine, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had experienced as a child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials of twentieth-century Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.|$|E

50|$|Philosopher Richard Rorty has a {{somewhat}} paradoxical {{role in the}} debate over relativism: he is criticized for his relativistic <b>views</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> commentators, but has always denied that relativism applies to much anybody, being nothing more than a Platonic scarecrow. Rorty claims, rather, that he is a pragmatist, and that to construe pragmatism as relativism is to beg the question.|$|R

30|$|The {{long history}} of the {{overlapping}} and private system reflects three unique characteristics of pre-primary services in Hong Kong: (a) the government considered education and care as separate domains - a perspective that is contradictory to the common <b>view</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> scholars and educators that children’s education, health, and socio-emotional needs are intertwined (Pearson and Rao 2006); (b) the government was ambivalent about where primary responsibility for early education should lie; and therefore (c) there was an absence of official policy or plan supporting early education.|$|R
