50|$|Models of {{restorative}} justice can be grouped into three categories: circles, conferences, and <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediations.</b> The principles upheld in each remain relatively similar.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Victim-Offender</b> <b>Mediation</b> (VOM) is [...] "a {{face-to-face}} meeting {{involving a}} trained mediator, crime victim, and person who committed the crime." [...] During this contact, the offender {{and the victim}} might share their experiences and feelings surround the event.|$|E
50|$|Some {{restorative}} justice systems, especially <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> and family group conferencing, require participants {{to sign a}} confidentiality agreement. These agreements usually state that conference discussions will not be disclosed to nonparticipants. The rationale for confidentiality is that it promotes open and honest communication.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of RJ in continental Europe, especially the German speaking countries, Austria, Germany and Switzerland, is somewhat {{different from the}} Anglo-Saxon experience. For example, <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> is just one model of restorative justice but in the present European context {{the most important one}} as described in the works of Christa Pelikan and Thomas Trenczek Restorative justice is not just a theory, but a practice-oriented attitude in dealing (not only) with criminal relevant conflicts. Therefore, he says that we have moved forward beyond restorative justice to restorative practice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three types}} of {{restorative}} justice practices specific to social work are <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> (VOM), family group conferencing (FGC), and peacemaking circles. [...] Van Wormer and Bednar (2002) offer a bridge between restorative justice and the strengths perspective, which is a widely used social work approach that takes into consideration client capabilities and positive characteristics {{as a vehicle for}} change and coping. For example, an integrated theoretical understanding applied to battering males is termed “the restorative-strengths approach” and offers a new application for social work practice utilizing restorative justice practices.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation,</b> (VOM, {{also called}} victim-offender dialogue, victim-offender conferencing, victim-offender reconciliation, or {{restorative}} justice dialogue), {{is usually a}} meeting, {{in the presence of}} a trained mediator, between victim and offender. This system generally involves few participants, and often is the only option available to incarcerated offenders. VOM originated in Canada as part of an alternative court sanction in a 1974 Kitchener, Ontario case involving two accused vandals who met face-to-face with their many victims.{Peachey, D. (1989) ‘The Kitchener experiment,’in M. Wright and B. Galaway (eds.) Mediation and Criminal Justice; victims, offenders and community, London: Sage.} ...|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Keough {{plans to}} {{introduce}} legislation to establish statewide <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> for punishments {{with the goal of}} reducing recidivism in prisons. A member of the National Rifle Association, Keough plans to oppose gun-free zones in schools and churches. He would allow licensed gun owners to carry weapons in such zones. Keough favors the repeal of margins taxes on small businesses. He favors upgrading the penalties for the possession of child pornography from a third-degree to a second-degree felony. He proposes the abolition of sanctuary cities, those in which municipalities forbid the use of any local funds to enforce national immigration laws.|$|E
50|$|In {{the modern}} context, {{restorative}} justice {{originated in the}} 1970s as mediation or reconciliation between victims and offenders. In 1974 Mark Yantzi, a probation officer, arranged for two teenagers to meet directly with their victims following a vandalism spree and agree to restitution. The positive response by the victims led to the first victim-offender reconciliation program, in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, {{with the support of}} the Mennonite Central Committee and collaboration with the local probation department. The concept subsequently acquired various names, such as <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> and victim-offender dialogue as it spread through North America and to Europe through the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

50|$|When {{looking at}} {{juvenile}} justice {{as a whole}} two types of models tend to be used: restorative justice and criminal justice. Within the United States, there are systematic shifts towards a more restorative model of justice especially surrounding juveniles. Canada has long been practicing under a restorative model of justice and continues to grow and expand upon practices of integrating youth offenders into the community in hopes {{that they do not}} recidivate but become positive, contributing members of society. In addition to these countries, Austria has taken an initiative to implement <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> programs geared towards a more restorative form of justice. New Zealand completely restructured their system with an emphasis on what the indigenous people, Māori, practiced for many years. This includes a family-centered focus that lowers youth incarceration. Globally, there is a trend of utilizing the traditional values of past generations to create a positive impact throughout juvenile court systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> in Sweden and South Africa and then compare the two systems. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> is a conflict resolution method. The victim and offender {{take part in a}} meeting with an impartial third party acting as mediator. The aim of the meeting is for both parties to express their thoughts and feelings towards the offence. The mediator’s role is to help the parties communicate with one another. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> is based on the philosophy of restorative justice. ‘Making right’ is central in the restorative approach and a restorative system wants to involve the concerned parties in the justice process, rather than hand over the justice process to people who represent the judicial system, such as attorneys, lawyers and judges. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> can be used at various stages in the justice process, both as a complementary and an alternative to the regular criminal justice system. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> started to develop in Sweden {{at the end of the}} 1980 s but the first regulation, The Mediation Act (Medlingslagen 2002 : 445), only came into effect in 2002. The <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> service is a part of the municipalities’ social welfare activities. The municipalities are responsible for ensuring that <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> are available when a crime has been committed by someone under the age of 21. It is up to each service to decide if a case is suitable for <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> or not. There has been a strong opposition towards using <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> in serious offences in Sweden, but this attitude has begun to change, it is now believed that <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> can be suitable in all types of offences. The fact that a young offender is willing to take part in mediation is a special reason for wavering prosecution and can therefore have an influence on a prosecutor’s decision when he or she considers a waiver of prosecution against the offender or not. The fact that <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> has taken place may also influence a court’s decision on the choice of sanction and the type of punishment. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> does play a complementary role in the regular justice system in Sweden, which means that it does not constitute a penal sanction, or an alternative to the regular justice system. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> started to develop in South Africa in the early 1990 s but as a concept it was not foreign, the African traditional justice systems were generally acknowledged to contain elements of restorative justice even before the 90 ’s. The first regulation to mention <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation,</b> The Child Justice Bill, passed by the parliament in the end of June 2008. The Bill will only come into effect in April 2010 but departments, other State structures and NGOs have already implemented key aspects of the Bill in their work. Service providers are the local Department of Social Development and NGOs. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> can take place at various stages of the justice system; as diversion options prior to trial or in the middle of a trial or after conviction. <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> in South Africa is therefore used as an alternative, a complement and a sentence. The decision whether or not <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> is appropriate is made by the prosecutor or the magistrate. Some cases are seen as more suitable than others but the seriousness of the crime does not automatically excluded a case. Instead the nature of the offence only influences the decision as to how it would be best applied, at pre-trial, pre-sentence or sentence stage, rather than excluding the use of <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> altogether. The main {{purpose of this}} thesis was to see how the <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> services in both Sweden and South Africa can develop. My conclusion is that South Africa should develop a regulation that states how the service shall proceed and also try to ensure that the service is nationwide. In Sweden on the other hand, I believe that we should take the step to develop <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> as a more permanent feature in the criminal justice system...|$|E

40|$|<b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation,</b> a {{component}} of restorative justice, has been a valuable tool for rehabilitating juvenile offenders since the late 1970 s. Victim offender mediation brings crime victims and offenders together to reach agreements for restitution and community healing.

40|$|Crime {{incidents}} are negative events that usually happen suddenly, which threaten victims and offenders (probationers) psychological health {{and leave them}} in an emotional state that {{they are unable to}} deal with using their normal psychological resources. Consequently, Restorative justice programmes such as <b>Victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> practises, which are rooted on religious traditions, have been introduced into the criminal justice system as a measure to address the psychological needs of probationers’. Rooted on theological underpinnings that are normative rather empirical, there exist different perceived outcomes among probation officers on whether <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> practices addresses the psychological harm. This has resulted to lack of uniformity in assessment of probationer’s psychological needs for development of an effective rehabilitation treatment plan. Therefore, {{the purpose of the study}} is to assess whether victimoffender encounter has any effects on psychological health of probationers’ (victims and offenders) using specific standardized indicators.

40|$|Criminology in {{the recent}} past has been faced with the dilemma of how to satisfy victims’ needs for justice. It has by now been {{recognized}} that in order for victims {{to come to terms with}} the experience of victimisation they need to be given the opportunity to actively engage in the criminal proceedings. This presentation wishes to consider the extent to which victims’ safety is safeguarded by these participation rights. Critics have blamed one of these opportunities for participation, i. e. the victim statement, for being overly secure, saying that victims risk nothing when participating, whereas another means for participation, i. e. <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation,</b> has been said to put too much burden on the victim. Drawing on evaluation research on the use of both these procedural rights, this presentation argues that these critics may be based on misunderstandings about what constitutes “security” for a victim. Indeed, it seems that victims have several concerns and doubts when deciding whether to make a victim statement: it may not at all feel like a safe way to participate. On the other hand, research shows that the vast majority of victims feel safer after participating in <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation.</b> Considering the 2010 BSC conference focuses on human rights and security issues, the presentation, reverting to evidence from evaluation studies of victim statements and <b>victim-offender</b> <b>mediation</b> programmes, wishes to consider the extent to which victim reforms that were designed to help victims recover, indeed enhance their feelings of safety – or would it be possible that they actually reduce it?status: publishe...|$|E
