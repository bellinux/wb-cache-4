5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels {{from town to town}} in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{recognizing}} the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, Remer {{realizes that the}} Reserve Army has been duped—rather than containing a coup, they have unwittingly supported it. SS officers are released and the plotters in turn are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. In an ultimately vain effort to save himself, General Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, places Beck under arrest, and sentences Von Quirnheim, Olbricht, Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death, contravening Hitler's orders that they be kept alive. Given a pistol by Fromm, Beck commits suicide. That night, the ringleaders are then executed by firing squad one by one. Some distance away, General Von Tresckow commits suicide with a grenade. When Stauffenberg {{is about to be}} shot, in a last gesture of loyalty and defiance, Haeften places himself {{in the path of the}} bullets meant for Stauffenberg. When his turn arrives, Colonel Stauffenberg's last act is to cry [...] "Long live sacred Germany!" ...|$|E
500|$|Germans {{entered the}} home that Creger and Slape were using as an {{observation}} post. Slape {{climbed into the}} attic, while Creger only had time to hide behind a door. He pulled the pin on a grenade as the door knob jammed into his ribs. Bullets from the I&R platoon struck the building, and the Germans suddenly left. Creger and Slape exited {{by the back door}} and ducked into a nearby cowshed. They crossed a field and then found themselves in a minefield. Picking their way forward, they circled through the woods until they encountered a handful of Germans. Opening fire, they killed them. Creger and Slape spotted Bouck and Milosevich across the road and sprinted towards them, drawing German fire. They made it back to their ridge-top position and Bouck called Regimental Headquarters. He requested artillery support, but when he reported the German column advancing on his position, the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end of the radio told him [...] "he must be seeing things". Bouck told them he had 20-20 vision and demanded artillery fire on the road in front of his unit.|$|E

60|$|Once on deck {{they stood}} {{perfectly}} quiet, listening. Presently {{they heard a}} murmur of <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> vessel. Very quietly they crept towards the sound, and at length made out two figures leaning over the bulwarks, talking.|$|R
500|$|Wu {{was known}} for posting humorous videos on YouTube. When Wu's [...] "I Have to Deal With Stereotypes" [...] video was {{featured}} on YouTube's home page, his number of viewers began to increase. In this video, Wu talks about stereotypes he {{has to deal with}} as an Asian-American. He tries to disprove his cheapness by bragging about the recent purchase of a [...] "brand new, top-of-the-line, TI-84 calculator". He acknowledges that this might make him nerdy but dismisses this stereotype too as he does not [...] "make all A's...in school today [...] made a B+." [...] He is then greeted by a voice {{that was supposed to be}} his mother calling him a loser and accusing him of dishonoring their family. Wu goes on to say he can prove his predominant social life with the constant ringing of his cell phone. At this point, his phone indeed rings, he answers it, and the <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end to Wu's disappointment says, [...] "Hey, why did you tell me to call you?" [...] Wu has collaborated with fellow YouTube comedian Christine Gambito (HappySlip), making five videos with her. In one of Kevin's older videos, he said he was an only child, which was later proven wrong by his father.|$|E

60|$|When he had {{finished}} his search, he {{came down to the}} ground floor and entered the room corresponding with the one from which he had heard voices in the adjoining house. He crouched here upon the dusty boards for some time, listening. Now and then he fancied that he could still hear <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> wall, but he was never absolutely certain.|$|R

50|$|García {{was somewhere}} between Tepalcatepec and Buenavista Tomatlan {{and on his}} way to Morelia to see his family when he {{disappeared}} on 20 November 2006. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> way, he called his family around 8 p.m. to ask about groceries and was speaking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone with his son when his son heard <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end of <b>the</b> line that told García to hang up. Noises sounding like García being dragged away were heard before the line went dead for his son. His family filed an official report after a week on 28 November.|$|R
40|$|In this Introduction, {{the author}} {{discusses}} the recent Supreme Court decisions Washington v. Glucksberg and Vacco v. Quill. On one hand, several panel contributors hold {{the position that}} one {{should have the right}} to control one’s own death, which is rooted in autonomy, liberty, and equality. Scholarly <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> debate, including four panel members, believe that the legalization of physician-assisted suicide would create intolerable risks, particularly to those in the community who are the most vulnerable: the poor, the elderly, and the mentally and physically disabled...|$|R
60|$|I moved {{towards the}} parlour door. A <b>voice</b> discoursing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side (it {{was but a}} {{matchboard}} partition), rose so loudly that the concluding words became quite plain in all their atrocity.|$|R
6000|$|She was pausing {{a moment}} with that easeful sense of {{accomplishment}} which follows work done {{that has been a}} hard struggle in the doing, when she heard a woman's <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the hedge say, anxiously, [...] "George!" [...] In a moment the name was repeated, with [...] "Do come indoors! What are you doing there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear, {{as if this}} wasn't deliciously {{exciting}} enough, {{just exactly}} at that minute I heard a strange <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the hedge say, [...] "What's this? What's this, Bucksteed?" [...] and there was my father and Sir Arthur Wesley on horseback in the lane; and there was Rene kneeling on Doctor Break, and there was I up in the oak, listening with all my ears.|$|E
6000|$|These ghostly words {{passed between}} us hardly louder than thoughts; but after my last answer she ceased {{and gave me}} a searching stare, then drew in a long breath. The <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the door burst out with an impassioned request for a little pity, just a little, and went on begging for a few words, for two words, for one word—one poor little word. Then it gave up, then {{repeated}} once more, “Say you are there, Rita, Say one word, just one word. Say ‘yes.’ Come! Just one little yes.” ...|$|E
60|$|As I {{crouched}} {{behind the}} hedge, I heard <b>voices</b> approaching <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of it. At last fortune had befriended me. The person {{speaking at the}} moment was Miss Jillgall; {{and the person who}} answered her was Philip.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a clamour of <b>voices</b> arose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of <b>the</b> closely-clipped wall of limes {{by which}} the two youths were walking. There were the clear tones of a young maiden expostulating in indignant distress, and the bantering, {{indolent}} determination of a male annoyer.|$|R
50|$|In 1986 {{he worked}} on Pee-wee's Playhouse where his work for his set and puppet designs won three Emmy awards; he also {{supplied}} a number of <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show. <b>Other</b> television credits include production and set design for Shining Time Station, Riders in the Sky, The Weird Al Show and Beakman's World.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drat that boy! he's escaped again, {{and after}} {{mischief}} I'll be bound!" [...] {{was the first}} sound that saluted him as he walked towards the house. It was Mrs Scholtz's <b>voice,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the hedge with which the garden was surrounded. The remark was immediately followed by a piercing shriek from the nurse, who repeated it again and again. Dobson could see her through {{an opening in the}} branches, standing helpless, with her hands clasped and eyeballs glaring. Thoroughly alarmed, he dashed towards the gate. At the same moment the voice of a child was heard:-- ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of that rooster's <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the little swamp, Reddy became a changed Fox. Could you have been sitting where you could have seen him, as did Blacky the Crow, you never, never would have guessed that Reddy had run a very long {{distance}} and was tired. He did not even glance up at Blacky. He did not even say thank you to Blacky for having shown him the way. He looked neither to the right nor to the left, but with eyes fixed eagerly ahead, began to steal forward swiftly.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] said a <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, [...] "he {{must have}} this." [...] Arms were about his neck detaining {{him in the}} doorway, and a black subtly-folding mantle hung from his shoulders. He threw his arm free of this and {{followed}} Lincoln. He perceived the girl in grey close to him, her face lit, her gesture onward. For the instant she became to him, flushed and eager as she was, an embodiment of the song. He emerged in the alcove again. Incontinently the mounting waves of the song broke upon his appearing, and flashed up into a foam of shouting. Guided by Lincoln's hand he marched obliquely across {{the centre of the}} stage facing the people.|$|E
50|$|Lorenzo was {{described}} as rather plain of appearance and was of average height, having a broad frame and short legs, a swarthy skin, squashed nose, short-sighted eyes and a harsh <b>voice.</b> Giuliano, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, was regarded as handsome; he {{was used as a}} model by Botticelli in his painting of Mars and Venus.|$|R

30|$|The inverse ZCR and the {{short-term}} power are combined for ZRMSE (14). In {{contrast to the}} ZCR, it is capable to detect voiced speech. For voiced speech, the value is high as the power typically is high for <b>voiced</b> speech. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, <b>the</b> high ZCR for unvoiced speech prevents a detector from detecting unvoiced speech. This behavior can be exploited to distinguish between voiced and unvoiced speech.|$|R
60|$|A {{noise like}} the {{rattling}} of chain links, a small grind and click {{exploded in the}} stillness of the hall and a voice began to swear in Italian. These surprising sounds were quite welcome, they recalled me to myself, and I perceived they came from the front door which seemed pushed a little ajar. Was somebody trying to get in? I had no objection, I went to the door and said: “Wait a moment, it’s on the chain.” The deep <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side said: “What an extraordinary thing,” and I assented mentally. It was extraordinary. The chain was never put up, but Therese was a thorough sort of person, and on this night she had put it up to keep no one out except myself. It was the old Italian and his daughters returning from the ball who were trying to get in.|$|E
60|$|Norgate {{left the}} hotel and walked out amid the first mutterings of the storm. He found a taxi and drove to his rooms. For an hour he sat before his window, {{watching}} the lightning play, fighting the thoughts which beat upon his brain, fighting all the time a losing battle. At midnight the storm had ceased. He walked back through the rain-streaming streets. The air was filled with sweet and pungent perfumes. The heaviness had passed from the atmosphere. His own heart was lighter; he walked swiftly. Outside her hotel he paused {{and looked up at}} the window. There was a light still burning in her room. He even fancied that he could see the outline of her figure leaning back in the easy-chair which he had wheeled up close to the casement. He entered the hotel, stepped into the lift, ascended to her floor, and made his way with tingling pulses and beating heart along the corridor. He knocked softly at her door. There was a little hesitation, then he heard her <b>voice</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.|$|E
60|$|One {{simple and}} {{touching}} memorial I well remember. There is a ferry between {{the town and}} the grounds near Netley Abbey. A lady had caught a cold, which terminated in death, in consequence of waiting on the shore, during a storm, for the arrival of a boat. To protect others from a similar calamity, she had ordered a very suitable defence against the weather to be built on the fatal spot, and to be kept in repair for ever. The structure is entirely of stone, small and exceedingly simple and ingenious. The ground plan is that of a Greek cross. On this foundation are reared four walls, which, of course, cross each other in the centre at right angles. A little above the height of a man, the whole is amply roofed. Let the wind blow which way it will, you perceive there is always shelter. There is no external wall, and the diameter of the whole does not exceed ten feet, if it be as much. This little work is exceedingly English, and it is just as unlike anything American as possible. It has its origin in benevolence, is original in the idea, and it is picturesque. We might accomplish the benevolence, but it would be of a more public character: the picturesque is a thing of which we hardly know the meaning; and as for the originality, the dread of doing anything different from his neighbour would effectually prevent an American from erecting such a shelter; even charity with us being subject to the control of the general <b>voice.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, what a clever expedient would have been devised, in the first instance, in America, to get across the ferry without taking cold! All these little peculiarities have an intimate connexion with national character and national habits. The desire to be independent and original causes a multitude of silly things to be invented here, while the apprehension of doing anything different from those around them causes a multitude of silly things to be perpetuated in America; and yet we are children of the same parents! When profit is in view, we have but one soul and that is certainly inventive enough; but when money has been made, and is to be spent, we really do not seem to know how to set about it, except by routine.|$|E
30|$|From initial {{listening}} tests, it {{has been}} clear that using a number of bands around 8 for our model produced high-quality resynthesis without loss of {{the objective of the}} initial recording. For example, {{we have been able to}} resynthesize the male <b>voices</b> recording based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> residual from <b>the</b> female <b>voices.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, without <b>the</b> use of a filterbank, the resulting quality of the resynthesized signal greatly deteriorated with an introduction of a large degree of crosstalk to the recording. In order to show this objectively, we measured the distance between the residual signals of the two recordings, using the normalized mutual information as a distance measure. The intuitive claim, as explained in Section 3, is that decreasing the distance of the two residuals will increase the quality of the resynthesized recording. Our listening tests indicated that increasing the number of subbands in our model, and consequently improving the model accuracy, resulted in much better quality of the resynthesized signals. While several measures were tested, the normalized mutual information proved to be very consistent in this sense.|$|R
5000|$|As seen {{on their}} {{television}} series, the band worked with many well known celebrities, such as Jordin Sparks, who recorded a song {{with the boys}} titled [...] "Count On You". When asked about the collaboration, James stated Jordin is an unbelievable singer. If you hear her sing in real life, she sounds just as good live every time. She absolutely deserves to be where she is. She's so talented, and she's a sweetheart too. We're <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same label. She {{wanted to get into}} acting, so we wrote an episode about her. She came on and was a great actress. The song is one of our first group ballads. It's a five-way ballad, but it turned out pretty cool. Usually, a duet has one person on each side. This has her voice one side and then there are our four <b>voices</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Laughs. It worked out though. It was such a pleasure to have Jordin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> song. She became a good friend of mine. She took me to the actual show before she was in it last time Laughs. She's so down-to-earth like that.|$|R
5000|$|The AFSC {{stated that}} the hearing [...] "highlighted <b>voices</b> of those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end of <b>the</b> {{pipeline}} of U.S. aid to Israel."
