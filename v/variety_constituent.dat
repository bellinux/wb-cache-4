These health benefits are attributed to a <b>variety</b> of <b>constituents,</b> including vitamins, minerals, fiber, and numerous phytochemicals, such as flavonoids. Thus, in addition to measuring the composition of the usual macronutrients and micronutrients, it seems important to also measure the antioxidant capacity of foods. For this purpose, 28 foods including fruits, vegetables and commercially-frozen fruit pulps were analyzed for antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant capacity of the foods varied from 0. 73 to 19. 8 mu mol BHT equiv/g. The highest values were observed for wild mulberries (19. 8 mu mol BHT equiv/g), acai fruit pulp (18. 2 mu mol BHT equiv/g) and watercress (9. 6 mu mol BHT equiv/g). The antioxidant capacities are only indicative of the potential of the bioactive compounds; however, these data are important to explore and understand the role of fruit, vegetables and other foods in health promotion.

This paper discusses Australia's National Landscapes Program, a collaborative nationwide initiative between parks and tourism agencies, local and state governments, and the private and non-profit sectors. A critical appraisal framework is presented for the various elements of the Program: geographical, ecological, socio-economic, cultural and visitor information. This paper argues that the approach adopted may be applicable for other collaborative destination management initiatives. It demonstrates the importance of adopting a geographical perspective in assessing nation-wide initiatives that takes full account of spatial challenges. Dimensions such as the scale, distances and accessibility compound the implementation challenges facing initiatives such as Australia’s National Landscapes Program. These challenges include ecological and socio-economic diversity, the number and <b>variety</b> of <b>constituent</b> organizations and understanding the current visitors, both domestic and international. The paper provides a potentially useful reference for jurisdictions that intend to implement large-scale collaborative destination management frameworks. It is noted that the challenges of identifying a common vision, objectives and measures of success, and of managing the politics of collaborations between different government levels and industry sectors, are magnified for larger-scale initiatives.

This includes the platelet, a cell that secretes a <b>variety</b> of <b>constituents</b> in response to these stimuli. For example, human platelet secretion is initiated by immune complexes and IgG aggregates (1), by aggregated Fc fragments (4, 5) but not aggregated F(ab') 2 fragments, leading to the concept of a platelet "Fc receptor " (5, 6). This concept has recently been strengthened by the demonstration that aggregated IgG binds to human platelets and that binding is inhibited more strongly by human IgG than by F(ab') 2 fragments or bovine IgG (7). The nature of the postulated platelet Fc receptor remains unclear, {{but the fact that the}} first component of the classical complement pathway, C 1, like the platelet, is activated by aggregated IgG or Fc fragments, has led to the hypothesis that C 1 bound to the platelet surface plays a critical role in the platelet response to aggregated IgG (8).
