2500|$|This engine has {{electronic}} hydraulic activation {{in order}} to increase flexibility with regard to fuel injection and exhaust valve activation. These two factors are adjusted {{in order to}} match operating conditions that a ship may be under. This electronic control of the start to finish of the combustion process is known as the Engine Control System. [...] Fuel injection controls the speed in which the engine will be operating at, while the exhaust valves control the exit of combustion gases from the cylinder. The actuators for fuel injection and the exhaust valves are electronically controlled by the Engine Control System. For fuel injection, a plunger powered by a hydraulic piston is started with oil pressure. Oil pressure is regulated by a valve that is electronically controlled through the Engine Control System. Exhaust valves are opened by a two-stage exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> which is activated by oil delivered from an electronically controlled valve. By controlling these valves electronically, the combustion process is fully controlled by the Engine Control System.|$|E

5000|$|Corliss valves open {{directly}} into the cylinder. The valves connect the cylinder to separate steam and exhaust plenums. Initially, Corliss used slide <b>valves</b> with linear <b>actuators,</b> but by 1851, Corliss had shifted to semi-rotary <b>valve</b> <b>actuators,</b> as documented in U.S. Patent 8253. [...] In this engine, the wrist plate {{was moved to the}} center of the cylinder side, as on later Corliss engines. This was still a beam engine, however, and the semi-rotary <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> operated linear slide valves inside the four valve chests of the engine.|$|R

50|$|A {{pneumatic}} control <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> converts energy (typically {{in the form}} of compressed air) into mechanical motion. The motion can be rotary or linear, {{depending on the type of}} actuator.|$|E
50|$|Used for the {{automation}} {{of industrial}} <b>valves,</b> <b>actuators</b> {{can be found}} in all kinds of process plants. They are used in waste water treatment plants, power plants, refineries, mining and nuclear processes, food factories, and pipelines. <b>Valve</b> <b>actuators</b> play a major part in automating process control. The valves to be automated vary both in design and dimension. The diameters of the valves range from one-tenth of a inch to several feet.|$|R

50|$|Usually {{pneumatic}} or {{hydraulic actuators}} {{are used to}} operate the butterfly valve. But with the large force of exhaust such type of actuators turns to be inefficient. Hence ARIS type of <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> which is widely used in the industries provides effective valve-operating force.|$|E

It is organised into the following businesses: Rotork Controls, Rotork Fluid Systems, Rotork Gears, Rotork Instruments.|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{convenience}} dispensing features can be built into closures. Spray bottles and cans with aerosol spray (<b>valves,</b> <b>actuator)</b> have special closure requirements. Pour spouts, triggers, sprayer cap, measuring attachments, sifting devices, etc. are common caps.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} nature these devices do not {{actually}} {{form part of}} the safety function and are therefore 100% fail safe. With {{the addition of a}} pressure sensor and/or a position sensor for feedback timer systems are also capable of providing intelligent diagnostics in order to diagnose the performance of all components including the <b>valve,</b> <b>actuator</b> and solenoid valves.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{pneumatic}} operation of valves, compared to motorised operation, has cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation {{is still an}} industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but {{enables the use of}} pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or (0.2 - 1.0 bar).This signal is then fed to the <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. This is a dedicated controller with a pneumatic nozzle and flapper arrangement and a mechanical linkage to sense the <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position, by comparing the actual valve regulating element position against the desired value; hence the name [...] "positioner". As a mechanical linkage is used for this, the positioner has to be mounted on the valve body. A positioner also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation, which is particularly useful with cylinder type valve actuators.|$|E
50|$|Actuators are {{specified}} for {{the desired}} life and reliability {{for a given}} set of application service conditions. In addition to the static and dynamic load and response time required for the valve, the actuator must withstand the temperature range, corrosion environment and other conditions of a specific application. <b>Valve</b> <b>actuator</b> applications are often safety related, therefore the plant operators put high demands on {{the reliability of the}} devices. Failure of an actuator may cause accidents in process-controlled plants and toxic substances may leak into the environment.|$|E
40|$|At {{nuclear power}} plants, {{electrical}} <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> {{are important for}} ensuring that the reactor core is water covered and the pressure in the reactor tank and containment is limited. The electrical actuators are provided with overload protection in case of drawing higher current then the motors are rated for. When safety manoeuvres are needed, the overload protection must not trig and cause the valve to stop before completing the manoeuvre. Analyses have showed that the current settings of the overload protection may cause an illegitimate trig at the worst theoretically possible accident. A new method has been developed with conservative assumptions and applies overload protections for all electrical <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> at the three reactors in Forsmark...|$|R

50|$|The gas {{generator}} control valve was a pneumatically operated poppet-type that was spring-loaded to the closed position. The fuel and oxidizer poppets were mechanically linked by an actuator. The valve controlled {{the flow of}} propellants through the {{gas generator}} injector. When the mainstage signal was received, pneumatic pressure was applied against the gas generator control <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> assembly which moved the piston and opened the fuel poppet. During the fuel poppet opening, an actuator contacted the piston that opened the oxidizer poppet. As the opening pneumatic pressure decayed, spring loads closed the poppets.|$|E
50|$|A <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> is the {{mechanism}} for {{opening and closing}} a valve. Manually operated valves require someone in attendance to adjust them using a direct or geared mechanism attached to the valve stem. Power-operated actuators, using gas pressure, hydraulic pressure or electricity, allow a valve to be adjusted remotely, or allow rapid operation of large valves. Power-operated valve actuators may be the final elements of an automatic control loop which automatically regulates some flow, level or other process. Actuators may be only to open and close the valve, or may allow intermediate positioning; some valve actuators include switches or other ways to remotely indicate {{the position of the}} valve.|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} was gradual and {{has extended}} into the 21st century, {{due to the}} huge installed base of 3-15 psi devices. As the operation of pneumatic valves over motorised valves has many cost and reliability advantages, pneumatic actuation is still an industry standard. To allow the construction of hybrid systems, where the 4-20 mA is generated by the controller, but allows the use of pneumatic valves, a range of current to pressure (I to P) converters are available from manufacturers. These are usually located locally to the control valve and convert 4-20 mA to 3-15 psi (or 0.2 - 1.0 bar). This signal is then fed to the <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> or more commonly, a pneumatic positioner. The positioner is a dedicated controller which has a mechanical linkage to the actuator movement. This ensures that problems of friction are overcome and the valve control element moves to the desired position. It also allows the use of higher air pressures for valve actuation.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, further {{agreements}} with Bendix brought licensed production of hydraulic servo valves to Normalair's range of products. This expertise was then developed into for electro-hydraulic servo <b>valves,</b> <b>actuators</b> and lightweight solenoid operated hydraulic valves. The company also produced marine hydraulics and valves for submarines.|$|R
40|$|Camless {{internal}} combustion engines offer improvements over traditional engines {{in terms of}} torque performance, reduction of emissions, reduction of pumping losses and fuel economy. Theoretically, electromagnetic <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> offer the highest potentials for improving efficiency due to their control flexibility. For real applications, however, the <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> developed so far suffer from high power consumption and other control problems. One key point for the control is {{the design of the}} reference trajectory to be tracked by the closed loop controller. In this paper an optimal trajectory design technique aimed at minimizing power consumption is proposed. An optimization problem that explicitly considers the physical constraints of the system is formulated and a suboptimal solution is derived by exploiting local flatness of the system...|$|R
