30|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is the proposed method of soil moisture estimation using a low-cost GPS L 1 receiver, a horizontally polarized antenna, and power spectrum analysis. The proposed method is extensively evaluated with data recently recorded during a number of ground-based experiments in Melbourne, Australia, and Wuhan, China. The experimental results are validated using in situ soil moisture measured by a moisture meter. One of the main existing methods is based on determining the Brewster angle using data recorded via a <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>antenna.</b> However, it may not be suitable to apply power spectrum analysis to vertically polarized signal due to spectrum line splitting and peak frequency shifting. In the existing power spectrum analysis-based methods, data is recorded by zenith-looking right-hand circular polarized (RHCP) GPS L 1 /L 2 dual frequency antennas as well as an expensive geodetic-quality GPS L 1 /L 2 receiver which has increased resistance to jamming and the ability to measure and remove the ionospheric delay error.

40|$|In this PhD thesis {{the author}} has dealt with the design and {{characterization}} of novel antenna layouts for modern communication systems. Specific attention {{has been devoted to}} cost-effective and compact solutions; also, some of the proposed antenna layouts have been designed facing with severe integration constraints. A novel slot-coupling feeding technique for dual-polarized patch antennas is presented in Chapter I. A square patch is fed through a square ring slot excited by two non-overlapping feed lines printed {{on the same side of}} a single-layer substrate. This technique was used to implement a wideband dual-polarized 2 x 1 microstrip stacked patch array working in the GSM band (1710 – 1910 MHz), UMTS band (1920 - 2170 MHz), ISM band (2400 - 2484 MHz) and UMTS 3 G expansion band (2500 - 2690 MHz) or, alternatively, WIMAX™ band (2300 – 2700 MHz), with a resulting 45 % percentage bandwidth. Moreover a circularly polarized 2 x 2 microstrip array, where each array element is fed through two microstrip lines which are excited 90 ° out-of-phase, has been realized for the WiMAX (3300 - 3800 MHz) band, resulting in excellent Axial Ratio performance. In Chapter II, a compact dual-band Planar Inverted-F Antenna (PIFA) working in both the DVB-T (Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial) and the WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) IEEE 802. 11 b,g frequency bands is presented. It has been designed to be integrated in a monitor-equipped device, exhibiting reduced electrical size with respect to similar PIFA solutions, also in a L-shape configuration. In the context of compact wideband antenna design, Chapter III presents a numerical analysis of a novel wideband two-arm Archimedean spiral antenna whose arms are made of vertical metallic strips. An advantage of this spiral is that the input impedance and polarization purity can be effectively controlled by varying the strip width and turn thickness. Also, when the antenna is embedded in a dielectric block, miniaturization is more effective than in conventional planar Archimedean spirals. In Chapter IV, two configurations of slot antennas suitable for integration into a class of commercial large photovoltaic (PV) panels are presented. The basic idea is to exploit the room available between adjacent PV cells, also taking advantage of the presence of the cover glass layer that gives a valuable miniaturization effect. As test cases, two antenna designs are presented for stand-alone communication systems operating in the GSM/UMTS (1710 - 2170 MHz) and WIMAX (3300 - 3800 MHz) frequency bands. Finally, a top-loaded vertical monopole antenna was designed to be integrated in a wireless sensor of a car park monitoring system operating at 433 MHz, and it is described in Chapter V.

40|$|Certain {{applications}} require {{topographic surveys}} below the vegetation cover. The use of radars with long wavelengths, such as L- and P-band, allows signal penetration {{through the forest}} volumetric structure. However, the interferometric phase center, resulting from this interaction, may be closer to or farther from the ground depending on the baseline and polarizations used. Recently, improvements in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry with the random volume over ground model have allowed the generation of terrain models with considerably increased accuracy. This work aims first at providing a theoretical background to support the comprehension of terrain model generation from the polarimetric and non-polarimetric SAR interferometry in regions with a dense vegetation cover.

This new approach offers a number of advantages over more conventional methods, including lower costs of hardware and software, the volume of data that can be collected over time, and ease of implementation. A fundamental component that may affect the quantity and the quality of the travel time samples collected with a Bluetooth-based system is the antenna type utilized. Antenna characteristics such as polarization and gain must be matched to specific application environments to optimize the performance of a Bluetooth reader unit. However, experimental data that focuses on antenna characterization as it relates to the use of Bluetooth technology to assess the performance of transportation facilities is lacking.
