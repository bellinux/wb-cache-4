5|$|The <b>Viola</b> Sonata was {{the subject}} of BBC Radio 3's Building a Library survey on 17 October 2015. The top recommendation, chosen by Helen Wallace, was by Tabea Zimmermann (<b>viola)</b> and Kirill Gerstein (piano). In 2017 BBC Radio 3 devoted five hours to her music as Composer of the Week.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins, <b>viola</b> (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the <b>viola</b> d'amore and the <b>viola</b> da gamba (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.|$|E

50|$|Handel often wrote {{works for}} strings without violas: for example {{many of his}} Chandos Anthems.

50|$|<b>Viola's</b> {{compositional}} {{style is}} closely related to that of Willaert's, particularly in relation to parallel major thirds over positions IV and V, where the juxtaposition of such is generally avoided.

5|$|The string section {{consists}} of two violin parts (Vl) and two <b>viola</b> parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed {{a few years after}} composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In {{the first half of the}} 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one <b>viola</b> part and continuo.|$|E

5|$|Two {{recordings}} of Bax as a pianist {{were made in}} 1929. With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own <b>Viola</b> Sonata for Columbia, and with May Harrison he recorded Delius's Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer's lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The <b>Viola</b> Sonata, Nonet and Mater ora Filium were recorded {{under the auspices of}} the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for <b>Viola</b> and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs. Of the tone poems, Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of Tintagel, in 1928; twenty years later a set of The Garden of Fand with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that The Record Guide listed only Tintagel, the Coronation March, the unaccompanied choral work What is it Like to be Young and Fair? and the solo piano piece Paean.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, arranged symmetrically around a central chorale.
