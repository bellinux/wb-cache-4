5000|$|SP-8 {{internals}} {{are identical}} to those of an Ion, with a few minor differences. First, the SP-8's regulator is canted 15 degrees forward; the Ion's is vertical. The SP-8's pressure gauge is mounted on the right, unlike the Ion (and almost all other markers) which has the gauge on the left. The SP-8 ships with a straight [...] "blade" [...] trigger, while the Ion has a curved [...] "wave" [...] trigger. Finally, the SP-8's breech section is drilled for a right-hand feed tube (so that top-mounted accessories such as scopes will not be blocked by the feed tube or hopper), while the Ion is set up for traditional <b>vertical</b> <b>feed.</b> The SP-8 is thus forced to use a plastic 45-degree elbow adapter to mount a hopper, which (because it is prone to frequent breakage) is a criticized feature. The Ion, by contrast, has a threaded <b>vertical</b> <b>feed</b> port that accepts all standard Impulse-threaded feednecks. Aftermarket adapters have been released that allow the SP-8 {{to use the same}} Impulse-threaded feednecks as the Ion while eliminating the plastic elbow.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{products}} of the Ultra Light Engineering from Tom Kaye was the aluminum <b>vertical</b> <b>feed</b> bodies. These ULE vertical bodies gave players a tighter profile when playing paintball. These bodies use Autococker threaded barrels and Angel threaded feednecks and ball-detents. This made the powerfeed tube design obsolete since chopping was no longer a problem {{with the help of the}} level ten bolt and agitated/force feed loaders. The use of aluminum instead of stainless steel dropped the weight of the automag significantly, allowing players a tighter as well as lighter marker setup.|$|E

Most modern electronic markers rely on electronic [...] "eyes" [...] to prevent chops, consisting of either an Infra-red sensor or an LED/Light Sensor combination. When a paintball enters the breech, the eyes complete the firing circuit and allow the firing cycle to continue. The Level X upgrade, however, does not rely on electronics, and is thus not susceptible to problems associated with dirty or uncalibrated eyes.|$|E

This paper investigates the forming ability of <b>vertical</b> wire <b>feeding</b> with an axisymmetric multi-laser source, and the microstructure and mechanical properties of the fabricated components. It {{has been found that}} <b>vertical</b> wire <b>feeding</b> with an axisymmetric multi-laser source has a strong forming ability with no anisotropic forming problem when fabricating the complex parts in a three-axis machine tool. Most of the grains in the samples are equiaxed grains, and a small amount of short columnar grains exist which are parallel to each other. The microstructure of the fabricated samples exhibits a fine basket-weave structure and martensite due to the fast cooling rate which was caused by the small size of the molten pool and the additional heat dissipation from the feeding wire. The static tensile test shows that the average ultimate tensile strength is 1140 MPa in the scanning direction and 1115 MPa in the building direction, and the average elongation is about 6 % in both directions...|$|R
50|$|The {{transmitter}} antenna {{consisted of}} four steel towers 360 feet m tall, {{set out in}} a line about 180 feet m apart. Three large platforms were stationed on the tower, at 50, 200 and 350 feet off the ground. A 600 ohm transmission cable was suspended from the top platform to the ground {{on either side of}} the platform (only on the inside of the end towers). Between these <b>vertical</b> <b>feed</b> cables were the antennas proper, eight half-wave dipoles strung between the vertical cables and spaced ½ of a wavelength apart. They were fed from alternating sides so the entire array of cables was in-phase, given their ½ wavelength spacing.

5000|$|Under some circumstances, {{the data}} rate {{of a radio}} link can be doubled by {{transmitting}} two separate channels of radio waves on the same frequency, using orthogonal polarization. For example, in point to point terrestrial microwave links, the transmitting antenna can have two feed antennas; a <b>vertical</b> <b>feed</b> antenna which transmits microwaves with their electric field vertical (vertical polarization), and a horizontal feed antenna which transmits microwaves on the same frequency with their electric field horizontal (horizontal polarization). These two separate channels can be received by vertical and horizontal feed antennas at the receiving station. For satellite communications, orthogonal circular polarization is often used instead, (i.e. right- and left-handed), as the sense of circular polarization is not changed by the relative orientation of the antenna in space.|$|E

Stable heaps are found to form only on a geometrically rough base comprised of discrete particles, and heap formation is only weakly sensitive to the value of the contact friction coefficient. The appearance of avalanches, the pressure distribution on the base, and the voidage distribution are sensitive to the analytic form of the elastic component of the normal interaction, with a soft-sphere r- 36 potential giving more realistic behavior than an equivalent Hooke law interaction with the same apparent spring constant. The r- 36 interaction gives more realistic assembly dynamics as it introduces medium range collective motion caused by particle roughness and shape found in typical granular materials, without having to model anisotropic particles. </p...|$|E

50|$|All are {{omnivorous}} to some degree: the butcherbirds mostly eat meat; Australian magpies usually forage through short grass {{looking for}} worms {{and other small}} creatures; currawongs are true omnivores, taking fruit, grain, meat, insects, eggs and nestlings and woodswallows feed on insects and nectar. Most are opportunistic feeders, such as the woodswallows, {{taking advantage of the}} flowering plants such as the silky oak Grevillea robusta, box mistletoe Amyema miquelii, and the long flowering stalks of Xanthorrhoea spp. or insects such as cockroaches or spiders eaten by the black butcherbird. Bigger species such as the grey currawong prey on many vertebrates, including frogs, lizards such as skinks, and juveniles of smaller birds such as the native eastern spinebill Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris or the introduced house sparrow Passer domesticus.The evolution of <b>vertical</b> <b>feeding</b> zones (feeding strategies subdividing into vertical space, e.g. upper, mid- and ground canopy) is noted among the Artamidae. While species will sometimes overlap vertical terrains, most woodswallows use the upper canopy, feeding on insects and pollen, while magpies and currawongs tend to use the ground or swoop down from the mid-story pouncing on their food. Being accomplished in extractive foraging is another trait of the Artamidae; although they are opportunistic feeders they are very methodical forages, often following a set routine.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Technology) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1988 Brown Davis and McCorquodale {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{suppliers}} of cheques to the banking industry. To produce these cheques they use a number of different print systems, one of which comprises of a minicomputer, an industry standard tape deck and two printers, a Diablo daisywheel and a Control Data Corporation (CDC) printer which was extensively modified to cater for the requirements of the cheque printing industry. The CDC printer is used to print the code line on the cheques using magnetic ink. After each line is printed the computer sends a form feed command which causes the printer to throw paper. This throw is controlled by a paper tape, known as a Vertical Format Unit tape, or rather a VFU tape. This tape has holes punched into it at specific places which determine the amount of paper throw also known as <b>vertical</b> <b>feed.</b> The holes are sensed by brushes which are pulled up to 5 volt when they pass over a hole and touch a roller connected to the 5 volt line. This system, being of an electro-mechanical nature, is prone to faults and causes much down time due to mechanical wear on the brushes and dirt on the roller. This means that the brushes have to be adjusted and therefore also means that the timing has to be readjusted each time. The timing relationships are discussed in Section 2. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform <b>vertical</b> <b>feed</b> results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each feed hopper is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} feed hopper. Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the feed hopper motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|E
5|$|Various feeding {{behaviours}} were proposed before {{more complete}} remains of Deinocheirus were known, {{and it was}} early on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal with giant arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz found that the hands of Deinocheirus were unsuited for grasping, but could instead {{have been used to}} tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky compared the forelimbs of Deinocheirus to sloths, leading him to hypothesise that Deinocheirus was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would have been good defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the ecological niches for Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that Deinocheirus had the largest <b>vertical</b> <b>feeding</b> range due to its hip height, and specialised in eating high foliage.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the primary}} dangers to a dog with megaesophagus is {{aspiration}} pneumonia. Because the food stays lodged in the throat, it can often be inhaled into the lungs causing aspiration pneumonia. One way to avoid this {{is to make sure}} that every time the dog eats or drinks anything, that the dog sits for at least 10 minutes afterwards or is held in a sitting up or begging position. This requires that all food and liquid intake be closely monitored and specifically administered to the dog in regular intervals (sometimes as often as 2-3 hours) in smaller quantities. Obviously, if smaller quantities of food and water are administered, one needs to take the necessary precaution to ensure the dog has a sufficient caloric and water intake. According to many specialists, this disorder has a guarded prognosis, however, since 2004 many owners have found a number of successful management techniques, one of which is <b>vertical</b> <b>feeding</b> (see [...] "Bailey Chair megaesophagus").|$|R
40|$|The insects {{with the}} longest {{proboscis}} {{in relation to}} body length are the nectar-feeding Nemestrinidae. These flies represent important pollinators of the South African flora and feature adaptations to particularly long-tubed flowers. This study examines the morphology of the extremely long and slender mouthparts of Nemestrinidae for the first time. The heavily sclerotized tubular proboscis of flies from the genus Prosoeca is highly variable in length. It measures 20 - 47 mm in length and may exceed double the body length in some individuals. Proximally the proboscis consists of the labrum-epipharynx unit, the laciniae, the hypopharynx and the labium. The distal half is composed of the prementum of the labium which solely forms the food tube. In adaptation to long-tubed and narrow flowers, the prementum is extremely elongated bearing the short apical labella that appear only {{to be able to}} spread apart slightly during nectar uptake. Moving the proboscis from resting position under the body to a <b>vertical</b> <b>feeding</b> position is accomplished in particular by the movements of the laciniae which function like a lever arm. Comparisons with the mouthparts of other flower visiting flies provide insights into adaptations to nectar-feeding from long-tubed flowers...|$|R
