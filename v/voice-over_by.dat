500|$|Although Zappa {{eventually}} {{gained the}} rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and original Mothers of Invention bassist Roy Estrada joined. Among other musicians were bassist Patrick O'Hearn, singer-guitarist Ray White and keyboardist/violinist Eddie Jobson. In December 1976, Zappa appeared as a featured musical guest on the NBC television show Saturday Night Live. Zappa's song [...] "I'm the Slime" [...] was performed with a <b>voice-over</b> <b>by</b> SNL booth announcer Don Pardo, who also introduced [...] "Peaches En Regalia" [...] on the same airing. In 1978, Zappa served both as host and musical act on the show, and as an actor in various sketches. The performances included an impromptu musical collaboration with cast member John Belushi during the instrumental piece [...] "The Purple Lagoon". Belushi appeared as his Samurai Futaba character playing the tenor sax with Zappa conducting.|$|E

5000|$|The film {{begins with}} a <b>voice-over</b> {{narration}} <b>by</b> Rolfe Whitehouse, announcing {{the story of his}} brother Wade's [...] "strange criminal behavior" [...] and subsequent disappearance.|$|R
500|$|The film {{contains}} {{live performances}} of twenty one songs {{along with a}} new song, [...] "God Made You Beautiful", written by Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler. Several short excerpts of the performances found on the concert film are also featured in Life Is But a Dream itself. The film opens with Beyoncé appearing {{in front of a}} large screen with her silhouette being seen. As the music of [...] "End of Time" [...] starts, she performs a choreography with her female dancers and French duo Les Twins on stage further singing the song's lyrics. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] follows with a similarly choreographed performance and for the third song [...] "Baby Boy", the singer dances with her background dancers in front of a holographic background performing a Dutty Wine dance at the end. [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and [...] "Diva" [...] are featured as the fourth and fifth song respectively. [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] is preceded by a video projection with a <b>voice-over</b> <b>by</b> Beyoncé talking about female sexuality. A snippet of Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] is interpolated within it and the singer performs the song with her female dancers. She continues with [...] "Party" [...] for which a prominent Las Vegas showgirl theme is featured.|$|E
500|$|Walt Disney {{strongly}} encouraged Costa to {{work closely}} with Davis while he animated Aurora so that she could learn as much as possible about her character and familiarize herself with [...] "all aspects of her." [...] Drawing Aurora to resemble her voice actress, Davis incorporated Costa's habit of gesturing with her hands while speaking and singing into the character's design, and defended the singer's performance when it was incorrectly referred to a <b>voice-over</b> <b>by</b> a fan, explaining that Costa's voice was [...] "the ocean of sound upon which we animated." [...] Davis and Costa eventually became close friends. Actress and dancer Helene Stanley served as the live-action model for Aurora, providing visual reference for the animators. The performer was recruited due to the high degree of realism required to animate Aurora. Stanley's costume was designed by costume designer Alice Estes at the behest of Davis, then a student of the animator at Chouinard Art Institute. To compliment the [...] "tapestry pattern" [...] of the film's backgrounds, Estes agreed to design the dress to [...] "move like [...] was animated." [...] Estes and Davis eventually got married. Meanwhile, British actress Audrey Hepburn served as Oreb's inspiration for Aurora's body type, from whom they borrowed the princess' [...] "elegant, slender features". The studio disagreed about whether Aurora's gown should be pink or blue, a conflict that was written into the film {{in the form of an}} argument between Flora and Merryweather. Aurora has a total of only 18 minutes of screen time.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a <b>voice-over</b> <b>by</b> Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you {{what the hell is going}} on in the film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E

Each one delves deeply in to a controversial or under-reported issue and provides facts and commentary on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Folgers {{promoted}} their {{instant coffee}} in 1970s and early 1980s ads which took the viewer inside various gourmet restaurants while a <b>voice-over</b> <b>by</b> Bryan Clark whispered, [...] "We are here at (insert name of four-star restaurant), where we've secretly replaced the fine coffee they usually serve with Folgers Crystals. Let's {{see if anyone}} can tell the difference!" [...] Clark ended the commercials with the line, [...] "Folgers Crystals...coffee rich enough to be served in America's finest restaurants." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{new look}} has been {{instrumental}} in the company's recent resurgence, particularly with the success of a new clothing campaign featuring the celebrated model, Twiggy, and younger models associated with the bohemian styles of 2005–6, and the new TV ad campaign for its food range. These adverts have the tag-line [...] "This is not just food, this is M food" [...] and feature slow motion, close-up footage of various food products, described in a sultry <b>voice-over</b> <b>by</b> Dervla Kirwan, to an enticing instrumental song— most notably Fleetwood Mac's [...] "Albatross" [...] as well as Santana's [...] "Samba Pa Ti", Olly Murs' [...] "Busy", Groove Armada's [...] "At the River" [...] or Spandau Ballet's [...] "True". These adverts have been referred to by both fans and critics as being food porn, with a number of other companies copying the idea, such as Aldi and, most recently, Waitrose.|$|E
