5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed <b>vibrator</b> {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in <b>vibrator</b> settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E

5|$|The Magic Wand {{has found}} great {{commercial}} {{success as a}} <b>vibrator,</b> a masturbation aid for women. Its popularity for this purpose {{is associated with the}} American artist and sex educator Betty Dodson, who used it in demonstrations and instructional classes to instruct women regarding self-pleasure techniques. Dodson became active in the sex-positive movement in the late 1960s. She recommended women put a small towel over their sex organs in order to dull the sensation of the <b>vibrator</b> and prolong the pleasurable experience. Her technique became known as the Betty Dodson Method. Her sessions were known as Bodysex workshops and featured 15 naked women in supine position, each using a Magic Wand simultaneously to aid in masturbation. She provided a Magic Wand to each woman for these two-hour masturbation sessions. Dodson taught thousands of women to achieve orgasm using this technique.|$|E
40|$|Abstract : Piezoelectric <b>vibrators</b> {{have been}} widely used in such devices as {{ultrasonic}} motors, piezoelectric pumps, piezoelectric speakers, micro machines and so on. For piezoelectric speakers and pumps, two types of <b>vibrators,</b> bimorph and unimorph <b>vibrators</b> are used. In this report, for improving the productivity and the performance of <b>vibrators,</b> the vibrations of bimorph and unimorph circular piezoelectric <b>vibrators</b> are analyzed theoretically, and their vibration characteristics are discussed by comparing the analytical results...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an impact damper which {{consists}} of multiple <b>vibrators</b> installed on a main structure and dissipates the vibrational energy by collisions between the <b>vibrators.</b> Transient vibration of the main system subject to an impact rapidly converges to zero by the impact damper. DE (Differential Evolution) method {{which is one of}} the optimization methods is employed to determine mass and spring constant of the every <b>vibrators</b> to maximize damping effect. We discuss the effect of a coefficient of restitution of <b>vibrators,</b> a ratio of total mass of the <b>vibrators</b> to the main structure mass and the number of the <b>vibrators</b> on the damping performance. The damping effect of the impact damper with three <b>vibrators</b> is demonstrated experimentally. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. Embargo Period 24 month...|$|R
50|$|<b>Vibrators</b> are {{vibrating}} devices intended {{to stimulate the}} body. <b>Vibrators</b> come {{in a range of}} shapes and sizes, for internal or external use. Some <b>vibrators</b> intended for internal use are phallic in shape. Small <b>vibrators</b> may have a stretchy loop attachment for use as a finger toy or cock ring. Penetrative <b>vibrators</b> usually measure twelve to eighteen cm (five to seven inches) in length and two to five cm (one to two inches) wide often to mimic the size of the average human penis.|$|R
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum <b>vibrator</b> which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor treatment or rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a <b>vibrator</b> or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store after using a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior <b>vibrator</b> operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E

5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the <b>vibrator.</b> In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
5|$|Sex {{therapist}} Ruth Westheimer {{said the}} device was most favored by those selecting from vibrators of the corded electrical variety. Therapist and sex educator Laura Berman recommended the device in many articles for the Chicago Sun-Times, both for women who had never experienced an orgasm {{and those who had}} difficulty becoming aroused. Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the <b>vibrator</b> most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} results of muitiple mode <b>vibrators</b> using degenerative modes in a rectangular or a square plate and a triangular one {{for the purpose of}} application to the electro-mechanical filters. 　It is first described that some multiple mode <b>vibrators</b> are obtained by combination of the same modes or the different ones in a rectangular or a square plate having many resonance modes of contour, bending, radial and other vibrations. In this paper, the double resonance <b>vibrators</b> using two modes of the plate mentioed above are mainely discussed from the viewpoint of the capacitance ratio in resonance modes and the easiness of adjusting two resonant frequencies, and moreover some <b>vibrators</b> suitable or not suitable for construction of the electro-mechanical filters and having needs of some contrivances for practical use are related. It is consequently pointed out that the <b>vibrators,</b> using two same modes in the secondary resonance of bending vibration and in the primary resonance of contour vibration, may be most suitable for practical use. The resonant frequencies of these <b>vibrators</b> are easily adjusted by the side length ratio or cutting off corners of a square plate. The experimental results of the filters consisting of these <b>vibrators,</b> moreover, are also expressed. 　Secondly, the multiple mode <b>vibrators</b> using two or three modes of a triangular plate are described. It is experimentally recognized that there are two different modes of contour vibration suitable for construction of the filter. The filfer using three modes of bending vibration is also denoted but the filter using three modes is not suitable for practical use, because of many spurious responses and large capacitance ratio. 　In this paper, the temperature and aging characteristics of the filter are not described, because {{the purpose of this paper}} is only in an experimental study about mode comdinations of multiple mode <b>vibrators</b> suitable or not suitable for construction of the filter...|$|R
