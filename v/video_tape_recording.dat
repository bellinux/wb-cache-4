The first RTB program was broadcast from the Belgrade Fair and from a new TV Studio build there. From 1961, RTS began to use quadruplex <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> equipment. The Sixties saw dramatic development in all genres of TV programs. TVB became famous by its sitcoms (directed and written by Radivoje-Lola Djukić, Novak Novak and others (unfortunately, only a small proportion is preserved, owing to implicit censorship and shortage of tapes). Also, TVB had excellent documentary programs (series Karavan, Reflektor and others) and quizzes. By 1970, the entire territory of Serbia was covered by the RTS signal. On 31 December 1971, TVB started broadcasting in PAL color system on its second network. A new AM (radio) broadcast equipment in Zvečka, Obrenovac, with 2000kW transmitter was erected in 1976.|$|E

5000|$|EIAJ-1 was a {{standard}} for <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorders (VTRs) developed by the Electronic Industries Association of Japan with the cooperation and assistance of several Japanese electronics manufacturers in 1969. It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a Helical scan system employing open reel tape. Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2" [...] wide tape. As a result, <b>video</b> <b>tapes</b> <b>recorded</b> on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility. For example, a reel of <b>tape</b> <b>recorded</b> on a Panasonic machine would not play on a Sony machine, and vice versa. The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers {{a standard}}ized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time. The format offered black-and-white (and later colour) video recording and playback on 1/2" [...] magnetic tape on a 7" [...] diameter open reel, with portable units using smaller 5" [...] diameter reels.|$|R
50|$|Penny and Her Pals was {{broadcast}} {{in black and}} white for most of its life and only went to color shortly before the show left the air in the early 1970s, having fallen like most other local origination children's shows of the day.

Even after the station's owners purchased and installed <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> and playback equipment, video tape was still not used to archive the station's on-air signal and was frequently re-used on a day-to-day basis, so there are no recordings of Penny and Her Pals.|$|E

5000|$|MPEG IMX is a 2001 {{development}} of the Digital Betacam format.

Unlike most other MPEG-2 implementations, IMX uses intraframe compression. Additionally, IMX ensures that each frame has the same exact size in bytes to simplify <b>recording</b> onto <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>Video</b> <b>recorded</b> in the IMX format is compliant with CCIR 601 specification, with eight channels of audio and timecode track.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{collaborative}} writing {{have focused on}} mature writers who have extensive experience with collaborative writing.

This paper describes an ethnographic study of collaborative writing by two groups of 4 grade six students using synchronous collaborative writing software for one hour per week over a 12 week period. Despite initially having no idea of what it means to write together, and no experience in doing so, both groups produced nearly one dozen short collaboratively conceived, written, and edited documents by the end of the study. A careful analysis of <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>records,</b> written documents, questionnaires, and interviews provided insight into the way in which novices learn to write together, and the role groupware technology can play in the process. It also demonstrated the importance of concepts such as awareness, ownership, and control in the writing process, and highlighted many examples of strengths and weaknesses in the writing software...|$|R
50|$|Film editing used an offline {{approach}} {{almost from}} the beginning. Film editors worked with a workprint of the original film negative to protect the negative from handling damage. When two-inch quadraplex <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> was first introduced by Ampex in 1956, {{it could not be}} physically cut and spliced as simply and cleanly as film negatives could be. One error-prone method option was to cut the tape with a razor blade. Since there was no visible frame line on the 2 in tape, a special ferrofluid developing solution was applied to the tape, allowing the editor to view the recorded control track pulse under a microscope, and thus determine where one frame ended and the next began. This process was not always exact, and if imperfectly performed would lead to picture breakup when the cut was played. Generally this process was used to assemble scenes together, not for creative editing.|$|E
50|$|In {{some early}} {{prototype}} linear <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> <b>recording</b> systems {{developed in the}} early 1950s from companies such as Bing Crosby Enterprises, RCA, and the BBC's VERA, the tape speed was extremely high, over 200 in/s, to adequately capture {{the large amount of}} image information. The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional Quadruplex system from 1956, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called transverse scanning), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Transverse scanning was superseded by the later technology of helical scanning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at an angle across the width of the tape.|$|E
