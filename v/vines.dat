5|$|A {{couple of}} weeks later in late June in the Wimbledon singles he again {{suffered}} a surprise loss to Ian Collins in the second round. In the mixed event Cochet and Whittingstall lost in semifinal stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth <b>Vines,</b> his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. Cochet and <b>Vines</b> met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two {{was one of the few}} encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. <b>Vines</b> ameliorated his team's result by defeating Cochet in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. <b>Vines</b> kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over Cochet. <b>Vines</b> and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat Cochet and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. Cochet and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semifinal while <b>Vines</b> reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.|$|E
5|$|It became common {{knowledge}} among the settlers that their European <b>vines,</b> of the vinifera. variety, simply would not grow in American soil, and they resorted to growing Native American plants, and established plantations of these native <b>vines.</b> Exceptions did exist; vinifera plantations were well-established in California before the aphids {{found their way}} there.|$|E

Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletić in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its wines are reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors.|$|E

5|$|On 9 September 1933 Cochet turned professional, {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Tilden Tennis Tour for a guaranteed annual payment of £25.000 and joined the team of Bill Tilden and Martin Plaa. Although he was still featured on the amateur world rankings published on the 20th of the month, where he was listed one spot behind Ellsworth <b>Vines</b> at number six, Cochet was also on Pierre Gillou's list in fourth place, also right after <b>Vines.</b> Cochet made his professional debut in a Franco-American match on 22 September and defeated Bruce Barnes. Three days later he lost to Tilden in straight sets. He also made appearances at the French Riviera with Plaa with back and forth matches across France. On 10 October Tilden signed <b>Vines</b> to the pro tour and from then Cochet's archrival and him competed within the same league again.|$|E

5|$|The rubber vine {{could be}} destructively {{harvested}} by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it {{lay on the}} ground. This was quicker and easier than non-destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment, especially once supplies of the vine began to run low. In addition some <b>vines</b> were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession. Because of this destruction all rubber <b>vines</b> within 10km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening. In an attempt to slow the destruction of <b>vines</b> Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective. In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or <b>vines</b> for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested <b>vines.</b> This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902. By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held {{more than one million}} plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation. Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure {{due in part to the}} fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor. Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper. Abir would also plant <b>vines</b> which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber, as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years. These <b>vines</b> may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber. In 1904 Abir began to run out of <b>vines</b> to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903, which was 1000 tons. By 1904 rubber <b>vines</b> within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting, leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants. The entirety of the Lulonga concession, to the west of Abir, produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905.|$|E

5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American <b>vines</b> and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American <b>vines</b> and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|In November Cochet only {{competed in}} the Toussaint tournament, held at the Tennis Club de Paris, {{alongside}} Colette Rosambert with whom he lost to Jean Borotra and his more skilled female partner Helen Wills Moody. The year 1932 {{marked the first time}} Cochet slipped {{off the top of the}} charts after switching places with <b>Vines.</b> In June 1933 Cochet, seeded first, relinquished his French Championships title to Australian Jack Crawford, who overwhelmed him in the final in three straight sets, becoming the first non-French player to possess it. In July the French team lost the Davis Cup for the first time since 1927. In front of their home crowd on the clay courts of Roland Garros, but without Lacoste and Borotra, the French team lost 3–2 to Great Britain. Cochet was defeated by Fred Perry and won against Bunny Austin, both in five sets. At the 1933 Wimbledon Championships first-seeded <b>Vines</b> conquered Cochet, who was seeded third, in straight sets in the semifinal. It was the third time in a row that <b>Vines</b> beat Cochet. These events marked the end of the Four Musketeers era.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the {{volatile}} composition of <b>vine</b> leaves and <b>vine</b> leaf infusion prepared from <b>vine</b> leaves collected at 30 and 60 days after grape harvest of two Vitis vinifera L. species.

40|$|Rubber <b>vine</b> (Cryptostegia grandiflora) is an {{environmental}} weed that frequently invades riparian habitats in northern Australia. I examined the habitat use of lizards in riparian and woodland environments comprised of native and rubber <b>vine</b> vegetation.

Of 132 lizards, none were observed using rubber <b>vine</b> vegetation in riparian habitats, significantly less than expected, and only one lizard was observed in rubber <b>vine</b> vegetation in the woodland habitat. As rubber <b>vine</b> vegetation contains features that superficially resemble native habitat used by lizards, such as leaf litter, the avoidance of rubber <b>vine</b> by lizards suggests that rubber <b>vine</b> has underlying characteristics that create a suboptimal environment for lizards...|$|R
