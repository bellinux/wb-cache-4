In years when there was a shortage of food, the great auks did not breed. A single egg was laid on bare ground up to [...] from shore.

The egg was yellowish white to light ochre with a <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> of black, brown, or greyish spots and lines that often were congregated on the large end. It is believed that the variation in the egg streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg among those in the vast colony. The pair took turns incubating the egg in an upright position for the 39 to 44 days before the egg hatched, typically in June, although eggs could be present at the colonies as late as August.|$|E

50|$|Associated {{with the}} vigour of St. Cuthbert's was {{a policy of}} beautification, which {{proceeded}} without a pause from 1887 until 1914 and turned an impressive but unoriginal building into a monument to turn-of-the- century AngloCatholic taste. Several architects and many craftsmen, professional and amateur, wereinvolved in the process. The more elaborate jobs were entrusted to skilled professionals such as Bainbridge Reynolds, the clergyman-designer Ernest Geldart and the architect J. Harold Gibbons. But in addition the church's supporters organized themselves into 'guilds' which took on manifold decorative tasks in the Arts- and-Crafts spirit. Classes and workshops under professional guidance were arranged in stone- and woodcarving, metal-working and church embroidery, and the guilds then proceeded to their long labours. For example, the carved stone diapering of <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> gradually extended round the walls between 1890 and 1909 was {{the responsibility of the}} Guild of St. Peter, the chancel stalls were made by the Guild of St. Joseph, and the vestments by the Guild of St. Margaret.|$|E
50|$|Since {{that time}} the {{ceremonial}} has evolved, but not dramatically. Mitred Abbots (who are to be seen, black-robed, in the 1523 illustration) were removed from Parliament {{at the time of}} the Reformation. In 1679 neither the procession nor the Abbey service took place, due to fears of a Popish Plot; although the procession was subsequently restored, the service in the Abbey was not. The monarch's role in the proceedings changed over time: early on, the monarch would say some introductory words, before calling upon the Lord Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) to address the assembly. James I, however, was accustomed to speak at greater length himself, and sometimes dispensed with the Chancellor's services as spokesman. This <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> continued in subsequent reigns (and during the Commonwealth, when Cromwell gave the speech), but from 1679 onwards it became the norm for the monarch alone to speak. Since then, the monarch (if present) has almost invariably given the speech, with the exception of George I (whose command of English was poor) and Victoria (after the death of Prince Albert). A dramatic change was occasioned by the destruction of the old Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834; however, the new palace was designed with the ceremony of the State Opening very much in mind, and the modern ceremony dates from its opening in 1852. The entire State Opening of Parliament was filmed for the first time in 1958. In 1998, adjustments were made and some participants were dropped.|$|E
50|$|Historical {{descriptions}} of the great auk breeding behaviour are somewhat unreliable. Great Auks began pairing in early and mid-May. They {{are believed to have}} mated for life (although some theorize that great auks could have mated outside their pair, a trait seen in the razorbill). Once paired, they nested at the base of cliffs in colonies, likely where they copulated. Mated pairs had a social display in which they bobbed their heads and displayed their white eye patch, bill markings, and yellow mouth. These colonies were extremely crowded and dense, with some estimates stating that there was a nesting great auk for every 1 m2 of land. These colonies were very social. When the colonies included other species of alcid, the great auks were dominant due to their size.Female great auks would lay only one egg each year, between late May and early June, although they could lay a replacement egg if the first one was lost. In years when there was a shortage of food, the great auks did not breed. A single egg was laid on bare ground up to 100 m from shore. The egg was ovate and elongate in shape, and it averaged 12.4 cm in length and 7.6 cm across at the widest point. The egg was yellowish white to light ochre with a <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> of black, brown, or greyish spots and lines that often were congregated on the large end. It is believed that the variation in the egg streaks enabled the parents to recognize their egg among those in the vast colony.

30|$|All these <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> of the {{stresses}} {{are due to}} the fact that the absolute level of the induced stresses greatly depends on bone elasticity and the patient’s age. With the same orthopedic load, equivalent sutures of juvenile skulls experienced significantly higher bone strain than adult skulls, suggesting that the same mechanical force might have different biologic effects on immature and mature facial skeletons [18].

In the case of I-RME maximum displacement was seen at Zygomaticomaxillary suture followed by Pterygomaxillary suture. The displacements produced in all the three planes of space for the plain RME model were greater in comparison to the Implant Supported RME model.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{general theory of}} pattern {{matching}} by adopting an extensional, geometric view of patterns.

We derive a generalized version of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string-matching algorithm by gradually converting this extensional description into an intensional description, i. e., an algorithm. The generality of this approach is illustrated by briefly considering other applications: Earley's algorithm for parsing, Waltz filtering for scene analysis, matching modulo commutativity, and the n-queens problem...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The terrace {{deposits}} {{in a river}} valley are key records to the research of fluvial sequence stratigraphy. Terrace deposits and the basal sequence boundary comprise the half-cycle of base level fall, and the fluvial infillings belong to the half-cycle of base level rise. Thus, terrace deposits and the basal sequence boundary {{are part of the}} regressive systems tract, and should be separated from the transgressive or lowstand systems tracts in previously published littoral fluvial sequence stratigraphic models. In addition, in the upstream portions of the fluvial system where sea level cannot reach, the fluvial sequence is influenced by tectonism and/or climate. The terrace deposits can provide specific information about the main controlling factor (e. g., tectonism or climate) and its <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> during the half-cycle of base level fall. Because the two half-cycles of base level fall and rise are at the same stratigraphic levels and belong to the same base level cycle, it is possible to research the controlling factor and its <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> during the rising half-cycle, which will be significant to an inland fluvial sequence stratigraphic model. Finally, the authors assert that seeking isochronous parasequence correlation based on 4 -division models (4 different systems tracts), along with the blend of sedimentology and geomorphology and diversification of models based on different controlling factors will collectively produce more robust-interpretations of fluvial sequence stratigraphy in the future...|$|E
30|$|The SLI is {{classified}} into single-shot and multiple-shot methods [1]. The single-shot algorithms {{only need to}} cast one pattern. These techniques use continuous <b>varying</b> <b>pattern</b> [2], stripe coding pattern [3 – 5], grid coding pattern [6, 7], etc. To improve the robustness of these algorithms, color variation [3, 5, 7], certain symbols [4, 8], and pseudo random property [5, 7] have been adopted to code the pattern. However, the color pattern might {{be influenced by the}} textures of the scene. The coded spatial information might be destroyed by the dramatic change of depth. Therefore, the precision of the single-shot methods is limited.|$|E
