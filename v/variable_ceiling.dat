50|$|In {{statistical}} modeling, {{regression analysis}} is a statistical process for estimating {{the relationships among}} variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when {{the focus is on}} the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables (or 'predictors'). More specifically, regression analysis helps one understand how the typical value of the dependent variable (or 'criterion variable') changes when any one of the independent variables is varied, while the other independent variables are held fixed. Most commonly, regression analysis estimates the conditional expectation of the dependent variable given the independent variables - that is, the average value of the dependent variable when the independent variables are fixed. Less commonly, the focus is on a quantile, or other location parameter of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent variables. In all cases, the estimation target is a function of the independent variables called the regression function. In regression analysis, it is also of interest to characterize the variation of the dependent variable around the regression function which can be described by a probability distribution. A related but distinct approach is necessary condition analysis (NCA), which estimates the maximum (rather than average) value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent <b>variable</b> (<b>ceiling</b> line rather than central line) in order to identify what value of the independent variable is necessary but not sufficient for a given value of the dependent variable.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{analysis}} {{to determine the}} performance of combined <b>variable</b> <b>ceiling</b> and floor-based air distribution systems in an office room Dong Yoon Park and Seongju Chang This study analyses the performance characteristics of combined <b>variable</b> <b>ceiling</b> and floor-based air distribution systems in an office room using a numerical method to optimize the level of thermal comfort and indoor air quality. To validate the computational fluid dynamics simulations, temperature, air velocity and CO 2 concentration were measured and compared. The simulation results of various combinations of ceiling and floor-based air distribution systems show that the exhaust should be located above the occupant and the window in summer; due to the large thermal plume as heat sources that could be generated by {{the window and the}} occupant. Whereas in winter, the supply should be located on the ceiling far from the window and the exhaust should be positioned on the floor near the occupant; as the downward airflow around the cold window surface would become more dominant when compared to the upward airflow associated with any other heat sources. The results have indi-cated that having both ceiling and floor-based air conditioning systems would allow the flexibility to change supply and exhaust air diffuser locations to optimize thermal and ventilation performance more efficiently in countries that are subject to distinct seasonal changes...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm that automatically finds the smoothest formant trajectories for short segments of speech. The method selects for each segment the smoothest {{from a number}} of alternatives. The smoothness criterion is based on the modeling of formant tracks with polynomial functions and uses both the c 2 badness-of-fit as well as the variances of the polynomial coefficients. A great advantage with respect to other methods is that it is completely automatic and reproducible because of our new criterion that quantifies the smoothness of formant tracks. Applied to some speech corpora, the new method shows smaller spreading ellipses especially for male’s high back vowels.

40|$|Abstract: The ovulatory shift modulates {{emotions}} {{related to}} female sexuality. Because fertility status only affects the individual’s own opportunity cost, the adaptive {{value of this}} shift is expected to stem from self-regulation. To test this assumption we asked women to contemplate various inbreeding descriptions: 1) they themselves having sex with male relatives; 2) their sister having sex with their common male relatives; and 3) an unrelated woman having sex with her male relatives (in 1, but not 2 and 3, negative fitness consequences {{are affected by the}} participant’s fertility). We dichotomized the dependent <b>variable</b> disgust (<b>ceiling</b> vs. non-ceiling) and analyzed the interaction between fertility status and description type. The ovulatory shift was stronger in descriptions where they themselves were described as engaging in inbreeding. A smaller increase was also found in reactions to others engaging in inbreeding. We explain the latter effect as due to self-reflection...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{examines}} {{the role of}} ceiling points in solving a pure, general integer linear programming problem (P). Several kinds of ceiling points are defined and analyzed and one kind called "feasible 1 -ceiling points" proves to be of special interest. We demonstrate that all optimal solutions for a problem (P) whose feasible region is nonempty and bounded are feasible 1 -ceiling points. Consequently, such a problem may be solved by enumerating just its feasible 1 -ceiling points. The paper then describes an algorithm called the Heuristic Ceiling Point Algorithm (HCPA) which approximately solves (P) by searching only for feasible 1 -ceiling points relatively near the optimal solution for the LP-relaxation; such solutions are apt {{to have a high}} (possibly even optimal) objective function value. The results of applying the HCPA to 48 test problems taken from the literature indicate that this approach usually yields a very good solution with a moderate amount of computational effort. integer linear programming, general integer <b>variables,</b> heuristic algorithm, <b>ceiling</b> points, linear programming relaxation, enumeration algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design and investigate a radiant panel cooling system on small scale building type (office) under the central Sudan climatic conditions so as to explore the benefits of radiant cooling systems over conventional air conditioning systems (VAV systems). Transient heat conduction of building (finite difference method) was used to evaluate the simulation model. The computer program (Matlab) was used to calculate transient heat flow through the walls and <b>ceiling</b> (<b>variable</b> loads) of the conditioned space. Other heat loads of the conditioned space were determined by the standard ASHRAE method. After the cooling load was calculated, the cooling system (radiant cooling panel system) was designed. This system consists of four (1. 3 m x 1. 05 m) panels made out of aluminum sheet metal and was installed on the ceiling of the conditioned space (4. 22 m x 2 m x 3. 05 m). Each panel consists of thirteen serpentine copper tubes fixed down {{on one side of the}} sheet and insulated with fiberglass at the back of the other side to prevent heat gains from the plenum. The experimental verification was achieved by using a cooling system which consists of a water chiller unit, fan coil unit (ducted fan coil unit) and radiant cooling panels. The duration of the experimental work took around one month (from 19 th September to 21 ist October 2006). Tests were conducted every day starting from 8 am up to 4 pm. In these tests four time intervals are selected for data recording (10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm and 4 pm) to evaluate the validity of the radiant cooling panel system. The experimental results showed that the ceiling radiant cooling panel system with dedicated outdoor air system saves power demand of 21 % and 35. 3 % of VAV system in case if recirculation air and 100 % VII fresh air are used in each respectively. In addition, the present investigation indicates that the radiant cooling system not only reduces the building energy consumption but also improve the human comfort (100 % fresh air and uniform temperatures distribution) with no noise (minimum supply air is used) in the conditioned space. Finally, the ceiling radiant cooling panel system has great advantages to improve human comfort and to save power demand when compared with VAV system. This system was found to be very suitable for a hot and arid environment (Khartoum) as shown in this investigation due to the fact that Sudan with its tropical and continental location is considered one of the hottest and arid regions in the world. This fact reduces the problems of condensation on the radiant cooling panel surfaces...|$|R
