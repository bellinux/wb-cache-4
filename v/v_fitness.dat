40|$|SUMMARY Soil organisms, in {{particular}} fungi and decomposer insects are primary drivers {{of organic matter}} recycling and energy fluxes (Swift et al. 1979; Cadish and Giller 1997; Bardgett et al. 2005). Fungi {{play a crucial role}} in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in terrestrial ecosystems functioning while having to deal in the same time with relentless attacks from fungivores. Only few studies, however, investigated the structuring forces of the population dynamics of fungi and the abundant decomposer fungivores, such as Collembola, with whom they continuously interact. This thesis investigated the interactions between fungi and Collembola focussing particularly on the effects of fungal secondary metabolites from different perspectives. Fungal secondary metabolites are believed to be one of the main vectors driving this interaction. Aiming to get specific insights into the nature of the mechanisms driving this interaction I focused on testing three overarching hypothesis: H 1. Fungal secondary compounds mediate the Collembola – fungi interaction H 2. Collembola have evolved means to detect fungal toxicity H 3. Genetic evidence (transcript regulation) can be used to understand the molecular nature of the Collembola – fungi interaction The above three overarching hypothesis have been addressed in three experimental studies, each with several pointed hypothesis. H 1. The first experimental study consisted of a feeding choice experiment offering single and mixed fungal diets using labelled fungal species (C 3 and C 4; 13 C and 15 N) of different toxicity. Collembola fractionation and carbon/ nitrogen incorporation of fungal species were assessed via stable isotope analysis. Four knock out mutants of Aspergillus nidulans with the sterigmatocystin production blocked at different steps along the biosynthetic pathway were combined in mixed diets with either the high quality fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides or the low quality fungus A. nidulans (wildtype). This study aimed at understanding the impact of fungal secondary metabolites and more specifically sterigmatocystin (ST) on Collembola performance in single and mixed diets and stabile isotope fractionation. It was hypothesised that (i) presence of sterigmatocystin (ST) impairs Collembola performance with increasing fungal toxicity of the A. nidulans strains, (ii) mixed diets will be beneficial to Collemboal fitness due to toxin dilution and (iii) the fractionation of 13 C and 15 N it is more pronounced in more toxic diets. We found that ST generally but not uniformly diminished springtail SUMMARY <b>v</b> <b>fitness</b> partially supporting the idea that secondary compounds act as shield against fungivory. However, the use of knockout mutants A. nidulans of the ST pathway (S 3 -S 6) led to rather idiosyncratic responses. Although Collembola fitness was not uniformly increased in mixed diets (suggesting a species specific response) the results still support the toxin dilution hypothesis since no correlation between fungal N content and ingestion could be found. Strong and specific responses of the two Collembola species to mixed diets, knock out mutants and toxins suggest the evolution of species specific strategies to cope with the constraints associated with living in different soil layers. The hypothesis suggesting a link between stable isotope fractionation and fungal toxins has been partially supported with the results suggesting that fungal toxin content may be more important than the nutrient content in controlling stable isotope fractionation of 13 C and 15 N. H 2. The second study focused on the olfactory ability of Collembola to perceive fungal toxicity via olfactory/volatile cues. By means of an olfactometer approach this experiment hypothesized that (i) Collembola are able to olfactorily perceive and distinguish fungal species/strains differing in secondary metabolism, (ii) that Collembola are able to sense and respond to fungal grazing by avoiding to forage on grazed fungi and that (iii) grazing by Collembola triggers in secondary metabolite gene expression in one Basidiomycete and one Ascomycete fungal species using a custom made cDNA microarrays (Chapter 3). All investigated Collembola species recognized fungal olfactory cues and directed their movement to fungal patches and moreover towards fungal strains with suppressed secondary metabolites, {{in particular}} towards the mutant ΔlaeA with the main part of secondary metabolites silenced. The volatile cues of conspecifically grazed fungi provoked a movement from two of the three Collembola species (H. nitidus and S. furcifera) towards ungrazed fungi. However, the response of S. furcifera was restricted to fungi extensively exposed to grazing (5 days) suggesting that the response varies between Collembola species. Surprisingly, the investigated fungal gene spectrum did not significantly respond to grazing by Collembola. The results support the first and second hypothesis indicating that Collembola are able to olfactorily differentiate fungi of different toxicity, orientate their movement towards more palatable fungi and avoid movement towards fungi previously exposed to grazing. The lack of changes in fungal gene regulation by grazing suggests that refined methods need to be adopted to investigate the genetic response of fungi to grazing. SUMMARY vi H 3. The third study investigated the impact of fungal secondary metabolites on transcript regulation of stress related expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of Folsomia candida, the Collembola species used as model species in ecotoxicology. Aspergillus nidulans wildtype (WT; Ascomycota) able to produce secondary metabolites including sterigmatocystin (ST) and a knockout mutant with reduced secondary metabolism (A. nidulans ΔLaeA) were combined with the high quality fungus C. cladosporioides as mixed diets or offered as single diets. I hypothesized that (i) A. nidulans WT triggers more genes associated with stress responses compared to the A. nidulans ΔlaeA strain with suppressed secondary metabolism, (ii) C. cladosporioides causes significantly different transcript regulation than the A. nidulans strains ΔlaeA and WT, and (iii) mixed diets will cause significantly different transcript expression levels than single diets. All three hypotheses are generally supported despite the fact that many functions of the affected ESTs are unknown. The results bring molecular evidence for the existence of a link between fungal secondary metabolites and responses in springtails supporting the hypothesis that fungal secondary metabolites act as a shield against fungivory. Overall, the work conducted in this thesis suggests that fungal secondary metabolites act as a structuring force in Collembola-fungi interactions and population dynamics. Using multiple approaches (food choice, olfactory and genetical) the results brings new insights supporting the hypothesis that fungal secondary metabolites act as a shield against fungivory...|$|E

50|$|The {{architecture}} and {{components of a}} given learning classifier system can be quite variable. It is useful to think of an LCS as a machine consisting of several interacting components. Components may be added or removed, or existing components modified/exchanged to suit {{the demands of a}} given problem domain (like algorithmic building blocks) or to make the algorithm flexible enough to function in many different problem domains. As a result, the LCS paradigm can be flexibly applied to many problem domains that call for machine learning. The major divisions among LCS implementations are as follows: (1) Michigan-style architecture vs. Pittsburgh-style architecture, (2) reinforcement learning vs. supervised learning, (3) incremental learning vs. batch learning, (4) online learning vs. offline learning, (5) strength-based <b>fitness</b> <b>vs.</b> accuracy-based <b>fitness,</b> and (6) complete action mapping vs best action mapping. These divisions are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, XCS, the best known and best studied LCS algorithm, is Michigan-style, was designed for reinforcement learning but can also perform supervised learning, applies incremental learning that can be either online or offline, applies accuracy-based fitness, and seeks to generate a complete action mapping.|$|R

40|$|Sherpa Romeo yellow journal (pre-print only, {{accepted}} for publication) Dispersal ability will largely determine whether species track their climatic niches during climate change, a process {{especially important for}} populations at contracting (low-­latitude/low-­elevation) range limits that otherwise risk extinction. We investigate whether dispersal evolution at contracting range limits is facilitated by two processes that potentially enable edge populations to experience and adjust {{to the effects of}} climate deterioration before they cause extinction: a) climate-­‐induced fitness declines toward range limits, and b) local adaptation to a shifting climate gradient. We simulate a species distributed continuously along a temperature gradient using a spatially explicit, individual-­‐ based model. We compare range-­‐wide dispersal evolution during climate stability vs. directional climate change, with uniform <b>fitness</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>fitness</b> that declines toward range limits (RLs), and for a single climate genotype vs. multiple genotypes locally adapted to temperature. Dispersal decreased toward stable RLs when range-­‐wide fitness was uniform, but increased when fitness declined toward RLs, due to highly dispersive genotypes maintaining sink populations at RLs, increased kin selection in smaller populations, and an emergent fitness asymmetry that favoured dispersal in low-­‐quality habitat. However, this initial dispersal advantage at low-­‐fitness RLs did not facilitate climate tracking, as it was outweighed by an increased probability of extinction. Locally-­‐adapted genotypes benefited from staying close to their climate optima; this selected against dispersal under stable climates but for increased dispersal throughout shifting ranges, compared to cases without local adaptation. Dispersal increased at expanding RLs in most scenarios, but only increased at the range centre and contracting RLs given local adaptation to climate...|$|R

Methods: Complete data on aerobic fitness (maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and time to exhaustion on the VO 2 max test), 6 MWT, and physical activity (Actigraph GT 1 M accelerometer) were obtained for 21 subjects (mean age 42. 6 years (standard deviation (SD) 11. 0 years); mean body mass index 39. 6 (SD 4. 5) kg/m 2). Multiple linear regression (controlling for change in body mass index) was used to analyse the relationships for changes in: (i) physical activity <b>vs</b> aerobic <b>fitness</b> and 6 MWT; and (ii) aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>vs</b> 6 MWT. Results: Change in physical activity level was related to VO 2 max and time to exhaustion (partial r > 0. 63, p < 0. 003). No significant relationships were found between changes in aerobic fitness and 6 MWT (partial r 0. 351) or between changes in physical activity level and 6 MWT (partial r = 0. 15, p = 0. 531).

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the association between fitness and lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). BackgroundHigher levels of traditional risk factors are associated with marked differences in lifetime risks for CVD. However, data are sparse regarding the association between fitness and the lifetime risk for CVD. MethodsWe followed up 11, 049 men who underwent clinical examination at the Cooper Institute in Dallas, Texas, before 1990 until the occurrence of CVD death, non-CVD death, or attainment of age 90 years (281, 469 person-years of follow-up, median follow-up 25. 3 years, 1, 106 CVD deaths). Fitness was measured by the Balke protocol and categorized according to treadmill time into low, moderate, and high fitness, with further stratification by CVD risk factor burden. Lifetime risk for CVD death determined by the National Death Index was estimated for fitness levels measured at ages 45, 55, and 65 years, with non-CVD death as the competing event. ResultsDifferences in fitness levels (low <b>fitness</b> <b>vs.</b> high <b>fitness)</b> were associated with marked differences in the lifetime risks for CVD death at each index age: age 45 years, 13. 7 % versus 3. 4 %; age 55 years, 34. 2 % versus 15. 3 %; and age 65 years, 35. 6 % versus 17. 1 %.

Our second prediction was also upheld: inbreeding depression was, on average, lower when large pollen loads were applied (11 %) relative to the low pollen-load treatment (28 %). The reduction was significant for two fitness components relatively late in the life-cycle: number of surviving seedlings and pollen-tube growth rate in vitro.

Fifty-five sophomores, juniors, and seniors enrolled in a high school physical education class participated in one of four fitness activities every other day. Two activities were traditional fitness (running; step-aerobics) and two were sport fitness (ballistic basketball; ultimate indoor soccer). Participants were required to maintain a moderate exercise intensity (140 - 180 bpm) for a minimum of 20 minutes out of a 30 -minute lesson as measured by POLAR ACCUREX II heart rate monitors. Participants completed a Subjective Exercise Experiences Scale (SEES) pre- and postexercise in order to determine changes in positive well-being, psychological distress, and fatigue. Participants responded to an additional item, postexercise, in order to assess post-activity levels of enjoyment. Results showed that over time participants displayed a significant increase in positive well-being (£ 1, 239 = 18. 73, <. 0001) after participation regardless of the activity. No significant differences were discovered when examining participants’ perceptions of fatigue or psychological distress. Analysis of covariance revealed no significant differences between activities for positive well-being, psychological distress, or fatigue. In relation to post-activity perceptions of enjoyment, analysis of variance displayed a significant difference (£ 3 ^ 3 4 = 11. 53, e <. 0001) between activities. Participants enjoyed ballistic basketball and ultimate indoor soccer more than running and step aerobics.

METHODS: Associations between a range of subjective and objective physical activity and fitness measures and cardiometabolic risk factors were examined using data from 1, 631 Australians aged 26 - 36 years. Anthropometry, fitness, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipids were measured at study clinics. Participants completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7 -day pedometer diaries; they also reported sedentary behavior (sitting, television viewing).

Daily physical activity was assessed by accelerometers for 4 days and daily accumulation of moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous activity was calculated. Significant relationships (P< 0. 05) existed for vigorous activity vs ln BF% (r=- 0. 40), ln AFM (r=- 0. 35), TBF/AFM (r=- 0. 22) and aerobic fitness (r= 0. 38), whereas moderate-to-vigorous activity displayed weaker relationships (- 0. 22, - 0. 18, - 0. 12 NS, and 0. 25). Multiple regression analyses with inclusion of possible confounders concluded that vigorous activity was independently related to aerobic fitness and ln BF% or ln AFM. Moderate-to-vigorous activity was only independently related to aerobic fitness. In this population, low daily accumulation of vigorous activity was, already in children aged 8 - 11 years, associated with more body fat and lower aerobic fitness. A similar relation was not found for daily accumulation of moderate-to-vigorous activity...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{constructed a}} series of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) mutants containing deletions within a 97 -nucleotide region of the SIVmac 239 untranslated region or leader sequence. However, as is common with live attenuated viruses, several of the mutants exhibited a moderate propensity for reversion. Since the M 184 V mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase is associated with diminished fitness as well as lamivudine resistance, we introduced this substitution into several of our deletion mutants to determine its effects on viral replication and compensatory reversion. Our results indicate that M 184 <b>V</b> impaired viral <b>fitness</b> in pair-wise comparisons of mutants that contained or lacked this substitution. We also observed that M 184 V significantly impaired the potential for both compensatory mutagenesis and reversion in these mutants both in cell lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells...|$|R
30|$|Differences in fatigue, muscle damage, and {{activity}} profiles between the high- and low-standard and high- and low-fitness playing groups and {{changes over time}} were determined using traditional null hypothesis testing and magnitude-based inferences. To compare differences in Yo-Yo IRT performance and match activity profiles between high- and low-standard playing groups and fitness levels, a two-way group (high- <b>vs.</b> low-standard) × <b>fitness</b> (high-standard/high-fitness <b>vs.</b> high-standard/low-fitness vs. low-standard/high-fitness vs. low-standard/low-fitness) ANOVA was used. A three-way group (high- vs. low-standard) × time (baseline vs. day 1 vs. 2 vs. 3 <b>vs.</b> 4) × <b>fitness</b> (high-standard/high-fitness <b>vs.</b> high-standard/low-fitness vs. low-standard/high-fitness vs. low-standard/low-fitness) repeated measures ANOVA (SPSS 22.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) {{was used to determine}} changes in neuromuscular fatigue, blood CK, {{and activity}} profiles between playing standards and fitness levels. If significant main effects were found, Bonferroni post hoc analyses were performed to locate the differences. Changes and differences in perceptual wellbeing and RPE were analysed using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Based on the real-world relevance of the results, magnitude-based inferences were used to assess the meaningfulness of any differences. Firstly, the likelihood that changes in the dependent variables were greater than the smallest worthwhile change was calculated as a small effect size of 0.20 × between subject standard deviation. Based on 90 % confidence intervals, the thresholds used for assigning qualitative terms to chances were as follows: < 1 % almost certainly not; < 5 % very unlikely; < 25 % unlikely; < 50 % possibly not; > 50 % possibly; > 75 % likely; > 95 % very likely; > 99 % almost certain [30]. The magnitude of difference was considered practically meaningful when the likelihood was ≥ 75 %. Secondly, magnitudes of change in the dependent variables were assessed using Cohen’s effect size (ES) statistic [31]. ES of 0.20 to 0.60, 0.61 to 1.19, and ≥ 1.20 were considered small, moderate, and large, respectively [32]. Data are reported as means[*]±[*]standard deviation (SD); the significance level was set at p[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Operation {{of natural}} {{selection}} can be characterized {{by a variety of}} quantities. Among them, variance of relative <b>fitness</b> <b>V</b> and load L are the most fundamental. Results Among all modes of selection that produce a particular value V of the variance of relative fitness, the minimal value L min of load L is produced by a mode under which fitness takes only two values, 0 and some positive value, and is equal to V/(1 +V). Conclusions Although it is impossible to deduce the load from knowledge of the variance of relative fitness alone, it is possible to determine the minimal load consistent with a particular variance of relative fitness. The concept of minimal load consistent with a particular biological phenomenon may be applicable to studying several aspects {{of natural selection}}.
