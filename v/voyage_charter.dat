500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the <b>voyage</b> <b>charter,</b> the time charter, the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} of affreightment. In a <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract of affreightment or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments. A completed chartering contract {{is known as a}} charter party.|$|E
2500|$|Air BP is the {{aviation}} division of BP, providing aviation fuel, lubricants & services. It has operations in over 50countries worldwide. BP Shipping provides the logistics to move BP's {{oil and gas}} cargoes to market, as well as marine structural assurance. [...] It manages a large fleet of vessels {{most of which are}} held on long-term operating leases. BP Shipping's chartering teams based in London, Singapore, and Chicago also charter third party vessels on both time charter and <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> basis. [...] The BP-managed fleet consists of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs), one North Sea shuttle tanker, medium size crude and product carriers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) carriers, and coasters. All of these ships are double-hulled.|$|E
5000|$|Voyage charter: The <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> is {{the most}} common charter in tramp shipping. [...] The owner of the tramp is obligated to provide a {{seaworthy}} ship while the charterer is obligated to provide a full load of cargo. [...] This type of charter {{is the most}} lucrative, but can be the riskiest due to lack of new charterers. During a <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> a part or all of a vessel is leased to the charterer for a voyage to a port or a set of different ports. There are two types of <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> - net form and gross form. [...] Under the net form, the cargo a tramp ship carries is loaded, discharged, and trimmed at the charterer's expense. Under the gross form the expense of cargo loading, discharging and trimming is on the owner. The charterer is only responsible to provide the cargo at a specified port and to accept it at the destination port. Time becomes an issue in the <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> if the tramp ship is late in her schedule or loading or discharging are delayed. If a tramp ship is delayed the charterer pays demurrage, which is a penalty, to the ship owner. The number of days a tramp ship is chartered for is called lay days.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the ISPS-code and <b>voyage</b> <b>chartering,</b> and investigate how the code affects the charterer and owner. The SOLAS convention was amended in 2004 {{as a result of}} the new terror threat, and the ISPS-code was then added to the convention as an annex. The new code affects different parties involved in <b>voyage</b> <b>chartering,</b> and everyone has to adapt to the new routines. Furthermore, some parts of <b>voyage</b> <b>chartering</b> are more vulnerable than others. Laytime is an essential part of a ships voyage, and a vast amount of money is linked to a vessel’s portstay. A violation of the ISPS-code allows the designated authorities in charge of maintaining the protection of ships and port to intervene and investigate the cause of non-compliance during the vessels portstay. Thus, the laytime can be directly affected by the ISPS-code. The question is who is responsible for the delays and in turn the economic risk of an ISPS related delay or cancellation of voyage? As a result of our investigation, we concluded that the ISPS-code is related to the seaworthiness of a vessel. If the obligations of the security requirements are not met, the vessel can be classified as non-seaworthy. In most voyage charterparties, such as GENCON 94, there is a clause that states that the owner shall provide a seaworthy ship. In English jurisdiction, the owner’s responsibilities to provide a seaworthy ship is even a so called implied term. Hence, a breach of the ISPS-code is directly linked to the seaworthiness of the ship, and the owner is responsible for the delays caused by lack of ISPS documents and certificates...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are legal}} {{differences}} between a bareboat charter {{and other types}} of charter arrangements, commonly called time or <b>voyage</b> <b>charters.</b> In a <b>voyage</b> or time <b>charter,</b> the charterer charters the ship (or part of it) for a particular voyage or for a set period of time. In these charters the charterer can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew. In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer and the charterer hires its own master and crew. The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a [...] "disponent owner". The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>voyage</b> <b>charter,</b> the {{charterer}} hires {{the vessel}} {{for a single}} voyage, and the vessel's owner (or disponent owner) provides the master, crew, bunkers and supplies.|$|E
50|$|A <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> is {{the hiring}} of a vessel and crew for a voyage between a load port and a {{discharge}} port. The charterer pays the vessel owner on a per-ton or lump-sum basis. The owner pays the port costs (excluding stevedoring), fuel costs and crew costs. The payment {{for the use of}} the vessel is known as freight. A <b>voyage</b> <b>charter</b> specifies a period, known as laytime, for loading and unloading the cargo. If laytime is exceeded, the charterer must pay demurrage. If laytime is saved, the charter party may require the shipowner to pay despatch to the charterer.|$|E
50|$|A Contract of Affreightment is a {{contract}} {{similar to a}} <b>voyage</b> <b>charter,</b> but ship-owner undertakes to carry a number of cargoes within a specified period of time on a specified route. Agreed frequency of cargoes may require more than one ship.|$|E

In the work, the most significant clauses are examined with the aim of showing their international approach to the matter and, particularly, the present trend of the maritime contracts regulation...|$|R

5000|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering.

50|$|A {{charter party}} is the {{contract}} between {{the owner of a}} vessel and the charterer for the use of a vessel.

50|$|For example, bulk coal long-distance {{rates in}} America are {{approximately}} 1 cent/ton-mile. So a 100 car train, each carrying 100 tons, over {{a distance of}} 1000 miles, would cost $100,000. On the other hand, Intermodal container shipping rates depend heavily on the route taken over {{the weight of the}} cargo, just as long as the container weight does not exceed the maximum lading capacity. Prices can vary between $300-$10,000 per Twenty foot equivalent unit (TEU) depending on the supply and demand of a given route.
