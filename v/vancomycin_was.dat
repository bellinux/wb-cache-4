50|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> made by {{the soil}} {{bacterium}} Amycolatopsis orientalis.Vancomycin biosynthesis occurs via different nonribosomal protein synthases (NRPSs).

L-tyrosine is modified to become the β-hydroxychlorotyrosine (β-hTyr) and 4-hydroxyphenylglycine (HPG) residues. However, acetate is used to derive the 3,5 dihydroxyphenylglycine ring (3,5-DPG).|$|R

5000|$|In a {{study that}} {{identified}} Clostridial species using commercial identification kits, {{it was found that}} as many as 10% of C. innocuum isolates were somewhat resistant to clindamycin. Most strains were found to be only moderately susceptible to vancomycin (MIC at which 90% of strains are inhibited, 4 micrograms/mL). [...] In another study, where C innocuum was positively identified by gas-liquid chromatography, resistance to <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> seen in all 28 strains isolated. It {{is interesting to note that}} all other clostridia species were at least 8 times more susceptible to vancomycin than C. innocuum, suggesting an intrinsic vancomycin resistance mechanism in C. innocuum.|$|E
40|$|Surgical site infections (SSIs) after spinal surgery are {{a serious}} {{complication}} {{that can be}} minimized with prophylaxis. <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> a common agent used {{in the prevention of}} SSI. Given that <b>vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> renally cleared, its use requires careful observation in dialysis-dependent patients due to toxicity at supratherapeutic levels. Since minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for vancomycin have increased due to the emergence of resistant pathogens, the use of vancomycin in such patients is further complicated. Local instillation of <b>vancomycin</b> powder <b>is</b> thought to provide additional protection against SSI and have lower systemic absorption. We present a patient with end-stage renal disease that developed progressively debilitating cervical spondylotic myelopathy necessitating multilevel laminectomy and instrumented fusion. Prior to closure, 1 gram of <b>vancomycin</b> powder <b>was</b> sprinkled into the surgical incision. Postoperative serum <b>vancomycin</b> levels <b>were</b> well below those associated with nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. Based on this experience, we reviewed the relevant guidelines that were designed to prevent postoperative infections in such dialysis-dependent patients.

25|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> {{indicated}} for {{the treatment}} of serious, life-threatening infections by Gram-positive bacteria unresponsive to other antibiotics.

5000|$|In 2008, {{writing in}} Nature Nanotechnology with colleagues from labs in the UK, Kenya and Australia, she showed how nano-sensors could 'feel' {{mechanical}} stresses {{in the cell}} walls of bacteria when the antibiotic Vancomycin attaches to them. <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> {{used in the study}} as {{it is one of the}} last powerful antibiotics in the battle against resistant bacteria and the 'hospital superbug' ... MRSA the paper explained. Nanosensors used in the study showed that it was approximately 1,000 times harder for Vancomycin to attach to the cell walls of antibiotic-resistant 'Superbugs.' Understanding the process by which Vancomycin attaches (or fails to attach) to bacterial walls and weakens or kills bacteria, led researchers in this study to suggest other, potentially more effective alternatives compounds worthy of investigation.|$|E
50|$|Although {{ampicillin}} resistance {{can be a}} huge benefit to scientists, it can also cause problems in regards to medical treatment. If this resistance accidentally spreads to other, more harmful bacteria, then those infections become harder to treat. In today's society, more and more bacteria are becoming resistant to antibiotics that used to work on them. When talking about issues in medical treatment, antibiotic resistance cannot be limited to just ampicillin. There are more serious bacteria that are resistant to other types of bacteria. An example is MRSA, or Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has become extremely difficult to treat with antibiotics. Methicillin is a much stronger antibiotic than the relatively weak ampicillin, which is why methicillin is not used as a selectable marker in scientific industry or research. If the {{ampicillin resistance}} gene accidentally spreads to other bacteria, then there are stronger antibiotics to kill off the bacteria. However, if a strong antibiotic such as methicillin or <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> used as a selectable marker, and the resistance spread, there would be large repercussions.|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{evaluation of}} the efficacy and safety of <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> conducted in 54 consecutive patients over a 16 -month period. <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> curative in 95 % of 43 patients with proven infection.

Reactions included thrombophlebitis (20 of 54 patients), rash (4 of 54), nephrotoxicity (4 of 50), proteinuria (1 of 50) and ototoxicity (1 of 11 patients tested by audiometry). Thrombophlebitis occurred only with infusion through peripheral cannulae; nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity were confined to patients receiving an amihoglycoside plus vancomycin.

30|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the first}} {{antibiotic}} choices for the treatment of severe gram-positive bacterial infections, especially if due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>is</b> suspected to cause nephrotoxicity, hence continuous vancomycin therapy as an alternative to intermittent administration has been proposed {{to reduce the risk of}} developing acute kidney injury (AKI).

40|$|<b>Vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> radioactively {{labelled}} by iodination with 125 I. Iodinated <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> only {{a little}} less potent as an antibiotic than vancomycin itself.

Radioactive <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> used to follow {{the fate of the}} antibiotic in bacteria that had been subjected to the least concentration required to inhibit growth. Most of the radioactivity was in the cell walls, although some was found in the membrane fraction. The latter proportion increased during longer incubations with the antibiotic. Pre-formed protoplasts adsorbed very little vancomycin. Mg 2 + removed labelled vancomycin from the mucopeptide of Bacillus licheniformis, but had little effect on the antibiotic adsorbed on Micrococcus lysodeikticus, either in vivo or on previously isolated cell walls.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} maternal-fetal transplacental {{passage of}} vancomycin in the ex vivo human placental perfusion model. METHODS: Six term placentas were collected immediately after delivery and perfused with physiologic medium using the single cotyledon perfusion system. <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> {{added to the}} maternal medium and perfused through the maternal circulation of the cotyledon. Over a 1 -h period in an open system, samples of the perfusate were collected at defined intervals from the fetal venous catheter and from the maternal effluence to assess vancomycin transfer. Thereafter, the system was closed for 1 - 5 h to establish accumulation. Transport fraction and clearance indexes were calculated by perfusing antipyrine 14 C (positive control). <b>Vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> estimated by high pressure liquid chromatography and antipyrine 14 C concentration was determined by liquid scintillation. RESULTS: Mean vancomycin maternal peak and trough concentrations ranged from 30. 0 to 51. 5 microg/ml and 7. 7 to 16. 4 microg/ml, respectively. Clearance indexes were minimal with a mean peak range of 0. 000 - 0. 080 and a mean trough range of 0. 00 - 0. 17. For each placenta, transport fraction for antipyrine 14 C was > 1. 85 with a single pass of > 40 %. No accumulation of <b>vancomycin</b> <b>was</b> noted when the system was closed for 1 - 5 h. The mean peak clearance index was zero after perfusing the placenta for up to 5 h with 35. 8 microg/ml of vancomycin.
