The fibre orientation and layer configuration (including relative {{thickness of the}} layers) of the different products is presented in Table 1, and qualitatively visible in Fig. 2 of the published paper. For the products used here, laminated bamboo and bamboo <b>veneer</b> <b>board</b> are comprised of Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens), while bamboo oriented strand board and laminated bamboo esterilla sheet of Guadua (Guadua angustifolia). Some of the products were also obtained with environmental-protective treatments and external, micro-thickness coatings, as is necessary when using the products for exterior use. The volumetric composition, in terms of solid cell wall material, air and polymer matrix, is also estimated for the various products. Finally, considering bamboo and wood composites as three-phase composites, the trend between thermal conducitvity and density is modelled using various composite structure-property relations, including the Rule of Mixtures, Halpin-Tsai equations, C-S and E-S models.

40|$|Auto-adhesion is a {{phenomenon}} that is in general related to the manufacture of wood-basedfibreboards, e. g. to the Masonite process or similar processes based on lignocellulosic raw materials. Auto-adhesion as a mechanism for the bonding of solid wood or veneer has not met with the sameindustrial success, but interest is increasing for environmental reasons {{and as a result}} of theincreasing cost of adhesives in wood products. The temperature in the laminate is crucial for the autoadhesionprocess that will result in bonding between veneers during hot-pressing. This paper presentsa model for the temperature evolution during the hot-pressing of a porous material, which wasdeveloped and verified for a five-veneer beech laminate pressed at a temperature of 250 °C and apressure of 6 MPa in an open system for 280 seconds. The result shows good agreement between themodel and the experimental temperature data during the hot-pressing.

The effect of water and water vapour on the bondings between <b>veneer</b> in <b>boards</b> pressed at 200, 225 and 250 ºC is studied. The conclusion is that pressing 5 layers of 2 mm rotary-cut beech veneer parallel-fibered at 225 ºC, 5 MPa and 300 s leads to a thickness reduction of 33. 4 % and mass loss of 1. 23 %; in such boards bondings are not resistant to liquid water but are resistant to vapour after one adsorption-desorption cycle.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the self-bonding of veneers, and investigations into the properties of boards obtained by hot-pressing beech veneers without adhesives. The raw material is pressed at temperatures from 200 to 250 ºC, at pressures from 4 to 6 MPa and pressing times from 240 to 360 s. The hot-pressing of five layers of veneers results in a self-bonded, compressed, densified board, darker than the raw material. The manufacturing process was optimised using a statistical analysis, the response surface experimental design method. The input factors were the pressing parameters and the output factors were characteristics of the product, the raw material properties being kept constant. The results showed correlations between the pressing parameters, especially temperature, as input data and the physical and mechanical properties as responses. Resistance to water absorption and swelling as well as shear strength, bending strength, and hardness were all enhanced by more severe pressing conditions. All the samples pressed at 250 ºC became water-resistant while samples pressed at 200 ºC delaminated rapidly in water. It {{was found that the}} colour of the edges can be used as an indication of the hardness. Chemical investigations were performed on samples taken from veneers (raw material), bond-lines and inner parts of pressed veneer. A High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used to detect and compare the levels of water-soluble monosaccharides (glucose and fructose) in the veneer before pressing and the levels of 5 -hydroxymethyl-furfural (HMF) and furfural in boards. From the results obtained in this thesis it is suggested, that besides other degraded compounds of hemicelluloses, the monosaccharides were transformed into hydroxymethyl-furfural during hot-pressing that could further participate in forming new browning compounds that are related to the bonding phenomenon. The UV spectroscopic analysis to evaluate the content of water-soluble phenols showed that the bond-line had a higher amount of conjugated phenols than the inner veneer suggesting a migration of degraded lignin towards the veneer surfaces during pressing. A CP/MAS 13 C NMR study on the solid material showed that the presence of β-ether structures and methoxyl groups in lignin was higher in the bond-line, supporting the hypothesis of a migration of lignin and possibly a condensation reaction occurring at higher temperatures, explaining the water-resistance property acquired by the boards. In a comparative study, oxidative activation with hydrogen peroxide and ferrous sulfate as a catalyst was performed before pressing. Boards made from beech veneer subjected to the pre-treatment step showed a greater mass loss, a lower thickness swelling but also a somewhat lower shear strength. For beech veneers such an oxidative pre-treatment step could be used to gain water-resistant boards pressed at lower pressing temperatures or shorter times than those needed to bond untreated veneers. Scots pine veneers were found to be less suitable for self-bonding than beech <b>veneers.</b> <b>Boards</b> of Scots pine hot-pressed without the oxidative pre-treatment delaminated in water, whereas, under the same pressing conditions, boards made from pre-treated veneers showed a water-resistant bond-line.

Recent, mainly public sector research included a 5 -agency project of 2009 - 12 resulting in advanced propagation technologies and greater knowledge of biology, wood properties and processing. Operational priority {{in the short term}} should focus on developing seed production areas and ‘rolling front’ clonal seed orchards. R&D priorities should include: developing and implementing a collaborative improvement strategy based on pooled resources; developing non-destructive evaluation of select-tree wood properties, micropropagation (including field testing of material from this source) to ‘industry ready’ and a select-tree index; optimising seed production in orchards; advancing controlled pollination techniques; and maximising benefits from the progeny, clone and provenance trials. Australia leads the world in improvement and ex situ conservation of African mahogany based on the governments’ 13 -year program and more recent industry inputs such that accumulated genetic resources total over 120 provenances and many families from 15 of the 19 African countries of its range.

40|$|The {{quality of}} peeled veneers is {{generally}} quoted considering 3 main criteria: surface roughness, thickness variations and lathe checking. This last criterion impacts on mechanical properties of byproducts. It {{is well known}} that lathe checking occurrence can be reduced applying a good hygrothermal treatment of the round-wood before peeling coupled with optimised setting of pressure bar on the peeling lathe. It is also well known that thicker the veneer is and more difficult it is to reduce lathe checking and the other veneer defects. The tendency being to manufacture more eco-friendly engineering wood products using less glue, it is of interest to design such products with thicker layers and so less glue lines. But using ticker veneers should lead to a deterioration of final products mechanical properties. To quantify this effect, we have made 20 - 21 mm thick LVL (Laminated <b>Veneer</b> Lumber) <b>boards</b> of beech (Fagus sylvatica) with various compositions (veneers 1, 3 or 5 mm thick). In order to obtained veneers enclosing different grades, several bolts of a same tree have been peeled following 4 different modalities changing wood conditioning temperature (20 / 70 °C) and pressure bar settings (bar acting or not). The quality of all the veneers has been quantified before gluing. In total, 12 sets of boards have been produced for non destructive and destructive mechanical tests. The main results of these exploratory experiments are: - a quite low weakening of LVL mechanical properties when increasing veneer thickness. - the non destructive prediction of MOE by vibration seems not so good on LVL with thick veneers, {{especially in the case of}} edgewise loading, probably because of the presence of important lathe checks. - in some configuration, and especially when using thick veneers, it could be benefit to load LVL flatwise rather than edgewise. - for the measurement of shear strength on LVL, the 5 -point bending test increases its efficiency when increasing veneer thickness. To properly order in a hierarchy the different veneer criteria impacting on LVL mechanical properties, new tests should be repeated on different LVL boards homogeneous for given criteria of veneer qualit...|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus nitens {{is widely}} planted for pulpwood, and {{increasingly}} also for solid-wood timber products, in cool-temperate climates. This thesis investigated {{the potential of}} tree breeding to improve the properties of E. nitens grown for sawn <b>boards,</b> pulpwood and <b>veneer</b> products. Two studies were undertaken using a 14 - 15 year old E. nitens provenanceprogeny trial established in Tasmania and comprising 420 open-pollinated families collected from three native races. In the first study, methods were developed to track the identities of 560 pedigreed trees through harvesting, transportation and sawmill processing. A second study tracked 548 trees from the same trial through a rotary peeled veneer production system. Genetic parameters were estimated {{for a total of}} 20 tree, log and wood traits relevant to sawn <b>board,</b> <b>veneer</b> and pulpwood products. Genetic differences among races of E. nitens were significant in wood stiffness, growth, stem form and pulpwood traits, but not significant for log end-splitting and sawn board checking traits. The Southern race had the most favourable mean values. Significant additive genetic variation within races was observed in all traits except log-taper, demonstrating that the quality of plantation-grown E. nitens wood products could be improved through breeding. Strongly positive genetic correlations among diameter at breast height (DBH) at ages 4, 9 and 14 years and between DBH all ages and the traits survival, log volume and stem straightness, demonstrated that early-age selection for DBH would not compromise stem straightness and would improve product volume recovery. Log end-splitting was under moderate genetic control but there was a negative genetic correlation between end-splitting and solidwood product volume. Sawn <b>board</b> and <b>veneer</b> sheet stiffness was highly heritable, and strongly correlated with acoustic wave velocity (AWV), measured in standing trees and logs. Consistent with previous studies in E. nitens, wood basic density, near infra red-(NIR) predicted kraft pulp yield (KPY) and cellulose content (CC) had moderate-to-high heritabilities, although coefficients of additive genetic variation for these traits were small. Estimated genetic correlations between standing tree AWV and each of the traits veneer sheet modulus of elasticity (MOE), sawn-board MOE, KPY, CC and basic density were highly significant and strongly positive, suggesting that standing tree AWV could be adopted as an indirect non-destructive selection criterion for improving solid-wood product stiffness, while simultaneously improving wood chemical traits favoured by the pulpwood industry. Basic density had no significant genetic relationship with KPY and CC, although other studies have reported moderate to strong significant values. Surface and internal checking in sawn boards, which are important defects leading to value downgrade, were shown to be under moderate levels of additive genetic control. Internal checking in wedges cut from log disks and in wafer sections cross-cut from processed boards were strongly and positively genetically correlated. However, the genetic correlation of checking traits with density and AWV were generally not significant. Work presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the potential for genetic improvement of E. nitens for pulpwood, sawn-boards and veneer production. A new method of tracking trees in processing studies has been established. Methods for assessing checking have been developed, and the utility of nondestructive AWV and NIR techniques has been confirmed for use in E. nitens breeding programs, aiming to simultaneously improve the quality and recovered volume of pulpwood and solid-wood products...|$|R
