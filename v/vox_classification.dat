The blackletters or fractures, which Vox {{included in the}} graphics, are characterized by pointed and angular forms, and are modeled on late medieval hands written with a broad-nibbed pen.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Vox</b> <b>classifications</b> {{can be used}} in combination. Notably, [...] "transitional" [...] (and its synonym [...] "realist") and [...] "humanist" [...] {{are used}} to {{distinguish}} between groups of sans-serif (also called [...] "lineal", [...] "Gothic", or [...] "grotesque") typefaces, sometimes with the term [...] "sans-serif" [...] omitted. The sans-serif realists have more constant line weight, while the sans-serif humanists have a varying line weight which harks back to Carolingian minuscule. So, very different typefaces may be described by the same term: for example, Times Roman and DIN 1451 may both be described as realist or transitional.|$|R
