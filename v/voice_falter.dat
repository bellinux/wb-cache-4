6000|$|... "Cowper's hand did not tremble {{in writing}} the lines. Why should my <b>voice</b> <b>falter</b> in repeating them? Depend on it, Shirley, no tear {{blistered}} the manuscript of 'The Castaway.' I hear in it no sob of sorrow, only the cry of despair; but, that cry uttered, I believe the deadly spasm passed from his heart, that he wept abundantly, and was comforted." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wilmot said {{something}} which the sharpest ears {{in the front}} row might, perhaps, have heard, and which resulted in Dr. Spencer standing up. Ethel hardly would have known who was speaking had her eyes been shut. His voice was so different, when raised and pitched, so as to show its power and sweetness; the fine polish of his manner was redoubled, and every sentence had the most graceful turn. It was like listening to a well-written book, so smooth and so fluent, and yet so earnest--his pictures of Indian life so beautiful, and his strong affection for the converts he described now and then making his eyes fill, and his <b>voice</b> <b>falter,</b> as if losing the thread of his studied composition--a true and dignified work of art, that made Dr. May whisper to Flora, [...] "You see what he can do. They would have given anything to have had him for a lecturer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can {{you ask the}} question?" [...] I replied, indignantly. [...] "I {{have told}} you that I heard him speak of her in terms of respect and affection of which any woman might be proud. He lives {{in the memory of}} her. I owe his {{friendly}} reception of me to some resemblance which he fancies he sees between my figure and hers. I have seen tears in his eyes, I have heard his <b>voice</b> <b>falter</b> and fail him, when he spoke of her. He may be the falsest of men in all besides, but he is true to her--he has not misled me in that one thing. There are signs that never deceive a woman when a man is talking to her of what is really near his heart: I saw those signs. It is as true that I poisoned her as that he did. I am ashamed to set my opinion against yours, Mr. Playmore; but I really cannot help it. I declare I am almost angry with you." ...|$|E
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> her {{resolution}} failed her, for {{the first}} time.|$|R
60|$|Still, his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> somewhat, and {{he looked}} down at them inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, shuddering. When he proceeded, his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> and {{his head}} drooped low.|$|R
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> {{his eyes}} rested on her--then looked away again. He said no more.|$|R
60|$|I {{could add}} no more. My <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> my eyes {{moistened}} {{in spite of}} me.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> and stopped, and a blush {{showed in}} her wet cheeks {{as her eyes}} fell before his.|$|R
60|$|Granser's <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> {{and broke}} at the recollection, and the weak tears {{streamed}} {{down his cheeks}} while the boys looked on and giggled.|$|R
6000|$|But she neither heeded nor heard him. She fell on {{her knees}} at the woman's feet, and in a low moaning <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> out:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Her glance fell away. Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> {{a little}} in replying. [...] "If he... needs redeeming. Perhaps... perhaps he has been judged too harshly." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. You mean--a follower--in the kitchen? (She courageously {{rings the}} bell, but her <b>voice</b> <b>falters.)</b> I am {{just a little}} afraid of Patty.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Madam,' said Jaqui, his <b>voice</b> <b>faltering</b> a little, 'you will {{excuse the}} {{intrusion}} of a stranger when I tell you that Dr. Torquino is dead.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{says he has}} James More my father's errand," [...] said she. She was whiter than ever, and her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> as {{she said}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "How long--" [...] His <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> and he stopped. [...] "How long," [...] he reiterated, [...] "have you worshipped {{the very}} ground she treads on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Bella's <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> as she said, after a moment's pause, [...] "Dear Elsie never {{recovered}} the shock. She joined {{her husband in}} heaven two months afterwards." ...|$|R
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> {{and then}} died away as he caught Miss Hartley’s eye and noticed {{the air of}} artless astonishment with which she was {{regarding}} him.|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{must have}} felt it, and her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> a very little as she continued. [...] "We--I--did it for fun. I meant to tell you. I--" ...|$|R
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> and in {{the dead}} silence which {{followed}} this revelation of Haney's secret he turned and re-entered the inner room, to watch beside his friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{property}} is landed property." [...] Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> as {{she referred to}} him, even in that indirect manner. [...] "It is entailed; his nearest male relative inherits it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I—er—I {{had them}} in a cage in my—er—in my suit-case,” {{the owner of the}} mice answered, and now his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered.</b> “I really didn’t think they would get out.” ...|$|R
60|$|Clara {{could not}} become paler than was her usual complexion; but her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> as she eagerly assured her brother, {{that she had}} no {{particular}} person in her thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "Under {{another name}} than my own," [...] Helene continued, {{apparently}} taking no notice of his interruption. She leaned {{toward him and}} her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered.</b> [...] "I found your mother dying." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{took from}} the breast-pocket {{of his coat}} the sheet of note-paper which {{contained}} Anne's letter, and Geoffrey's reply. His hand trembled as he held it; his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>faltered.</b> He {{turned away}} {{abruptly}} {{and took up}} his hat. Lady Janet followed him, and spoke {{to him at the}} door. Horace smiled satirically, and went to warm himself at the fire.|$|R
60|$|The old man's <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> and stopped. He {{was going}} to have made a remark that would have cast a slur on the {{character}} of his late partner, so he checked himself and sighed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are welcome}} home, Prudence," [...] said he, glancing {{sideways}} at her, and his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered.</b> [...] "Your {{mother would have}} rejoiced to see you, but she has been gone from us these four months." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll {{be right}} again soon," [...] said Polly Ann. [...] "He's been sleepin' that way, off and on, fer a week." [...] Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> into {{a note of}} {{tenderness}} as her eyes rested on me.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Horn's eyes wandered from Beaton; her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> in {{the faded}} {{interest}} of her remark, and then rose with renewed vigor in greeting {{a lady who}} came up and stretched her glove across the tea-cups.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Brandon ceased, his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> as he spoke, and {{the tears}} fell from his eyes. Mr. Harmer hid {{his face in his}} hands, and sobbed unrestrainedly; he was inexpressibly shocked and grieved. At last he said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Bess {{looked up}} to smile a welcome, and Jamie tried to cry [...] "Hurrah;" [...] but the feeble <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> and failed, and he could only wave his hand and cling fast to his friend, whispering, brokenly,-- ...|$|R
60|$|His <b>voice</b> <b>faltered.</b> Both {{men were}} now {{oblivious}} of their companions {{and of the}} scene. Both were thinking of the days when they both planned great things {{in the way of}} an education, two ambitious, dreamful boys.|$|R
60|$|The clock sounded eleven. Miss Temple rose. 'It is so late, and we in {{darkness}} here! What will they think? Ferdinand, sweetest, rouse the fire. I ring the bell. Lights will come, and then------' Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered.</b>|$|R
60|$|Sarah put {{one into}} his hand, {{and pointed to}} a place, but his eyes were misty, his <b>voice</b> <b>faltered,</b> broke down, and he was obliged to press his face down on the pillows to stifle his sobs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I love him?" [...] she said. [...] "Oh, {{what words}} can say Yes for me, as I {{want to say}} it? I love him--!" [...] Her <b>voice</b> <b>faltered</b> softly; and her answer ended in a sigh.|$|R
