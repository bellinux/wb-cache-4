5|$|Feng {{took part}} in the 25th Southeast Asian Games in <b>Vientiane,</b> Laos. She {{was a member of the}} Singapore women's team with Sun Beibei and Wang Yuegu that {{defeated}} Thailand 3–0 to win Gold on 10 December 2009. On 14 December 2009, she and her partner Wang Yuegu were defeated by compatriots Sun Beibei and Yu Mengyu in an all-Singapore final in the women's doubles. The following day, in her maiden appearance at the Games, she achieved gold in the singles competition after defeating Wang 4–1.|$|E
5|$|A {{coalition}} Government of National Union {{was installed}} {{in the capital of}} <b>Vientiane,</b> but it soon ran into difficulties. By the 2 October 1962 deadline for the removal of foreign troops, the North Vietnamese had pulled out only 40 personnel, leaving approximately 6,000 troops in the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile, rightist elements (in control of the army) opposed the new government. The U.S. played its part by increasing its assistance to the right by covertly supplying the army through Thailand. Despite another international accord, Laos remained ensnared by the political and territorial ambitions of communist neighbors, the security concerns of Thailand and the United States, and geographic fate.|$|E
5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the <b>Vientiane</b> government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
5000|$|Fodor’s Travel {{referred}} to Kualao Restaurant as “one of <b>Vientiane’s</b> best Lao restaurants.” ...|$|R
50|$|The Luang Namtha airport (LXG) has a daily {{flight to}} and from <b>Vientiane's</b> Wattay International Airport VTE, QV601/602.|$|R
5000|$|That Luang is the {{national}} symbol and most important religious monument of Laos. <b>Vientiane's</b> most important Theravada Buddhist festival, [...] "Boun That Luang", is held here for three days duringthe full moon of the twelfth lunar month (November).|$|R
5|$|Realizing the North Vietnamese {{would try}} to destroy the installation, Secord advised the U.S Embassy in <b>Vientiane</b> to {{evacuate}} all U.S. personnel. However, high-ranking U.S. officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped {{save the lives of}} U.S. pilots every day it remained in operation. In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army.|$|E
5|$|Tao {{participated in}} the 25th Southeast Asian Games in <b>Vientiane,</b> Laos. On 10 December 2009, she took the gold in the 200metres {{backstroke}} {{in a time of}} 2 minutes 17.12 seconds. Three days later, she was part of the winning 4 x 100metres medley relay team with Roanne Ho, Shana Lim and Quah Ting Wen, and on 14 December she broke her own 2005 Games record in the 200metres butterfly in a time of 2minutes 13.49seconds. As she chalked up five wins, including the 100metres backstroke and butterfly events, these were her most successful Games to date.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{rules of}} {{engagement}} applied in Laos (which prescribed the offensive action of pilots and the locations and circumstances under which offensive actions could be taken) were created to protect the civilian population of the country. To the American pilots that conducted the missions, however, they became complex {{to the point of}} incomprehensibility. The rules were constantly altered and elaborated upon by the political decision makers in Washington and <b>Vientiane</b> and bore little relation to the reality on the ground. There were different rules for every type of activity, for each different branch of service, and in each military region.|$|E
50|$|The main {{international}} {{airports are}} <b>Vientiane's</b> Wattay International Airport and Luang Prabang International Airport with Pakse International Airport also having a few international flights. The national carrier is Lao Airlines. Other carriers serving the country include Bangkok Airways, Vietnam Airlines, AirAsia, Thai Airways International, China Eastern Airlines and Silk Air.|$|R
5000|$|A new walled-city with a {{surrounding}} moat, {{designated as}} Nakhon Ratchasima, {{was built in}} the 17th century by order of the King Narai, as the easternmost [...] "command post", guarding the kingdom's border. It continued this duty during the Bangkok Period, although it was briefly seized during Chao Anuwong of <b>Vientiane's</b> 1826 revolt against King Rama III of Siam.|$|R
50|$|When the Malay Black bear vanishes {{from its}} cage {{in the zoo}} garden of <b>Vientiane’s</b> Lan Xang Hotel very few people are {{surprised}} to see mauled bodies turning up in the morgue. Very few that is, apart from Dr. Siri Phaiboun the only coroner in the Lao People’s Republic. Seventy-two-year-old Siri and his team are convinced something just doesn’t add up.|$|R
5|$|By October 1971 Prince Souvanna {{had little}} {{alternative}} but to accept the Pathet Lao program {{as the basis for}} negotiations. The Pathet Lao agreed to the new negotiating effort and on 14 October, representatives of the party arrived in <b>Vientiane.</b> Two weeks later they were followed by Phoumi Vongvichit, secretary general of the Pathet Lao. Communist demands included: a cessation of the U.S. bombing of Lao territory; withdrawal of all U.S. advisors and military personnel; an election for a new National Assembly; the establishment of a coalition government; and compensation and resettlement for those Lao who had been forcibly relocated would be undertaken. The pace of negotiations in Laos, however, mirrored those in South Vietnam, the impetus of which was determined by the perceived military success of the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|The {{most senior}} {{military}} officer in-country was the AIRA, the ambassador's air attaché, an Air Force colonel. The air attaché office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs in Laos however, dictated the dispatch of 117 more Air Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support project personnel, who coordinated the operational end of covert activities in Laos. Eventually, five air operations centers were created in Laos – at <b>Vientiane,</b> Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual air operations under a program called Palace Dog.|$|E
5|$|For 100 months, the U.S. Air Force, the CIA, and the Thai {{government}} had assisted the Royal Lao government in staving off defeat {{at the hands}} of its enemies. If one measures the success of Barrel Roll by the priorities assigned to it by the U.S. government and military, it was a success. It had allowed the continuous prosecution of the Steel Tiger (and, post-1968, Operation Commando Hunt) interdiction campaigns against the Ho Chi Minh trail by keeping the neutralists in power. At the time of the cease-fire, communist forces controlled two-thirds of the land area and one-third of the population of Laos, approximately the same amounts that they had under their control in 1961. The imposition of a strategic stalemate had prevented the fall of the <b>Vientiane</b> government, which accomplished the secondary goal of the operation, protecting Thailand from communist attack (however unrealistic that threat appears today). This stalemate had been achieved with the loss of 131 U.S. aircraft between 1964 and 1973, a very low loss rate when compared to the operations discussed above.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 1965, Colonel Bounleut Saycocie {{also decided}} on a coup. While unaware of Phoumi's efforts, Bounleut led three {{companies}} from the Groupement Mobile 17 (Mobile Group 17) regiment as they occupied <b>Vientiane's</b> radio station and other critical points. The coup was largely bloodless. Five announcements were aired on the radio station. There were now two separate coups being staged independently and simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Children's {{deaths are}} {{primarily}} due to communicable diseases, with malaria, acute respiratory infections, and diarrhea the main causes of mortality as well as morbidity. Vaccination against childhood diseases was expanding, but in 1989 <b>Vientiane's</b> municipal authorities still were unable to vaccinate more than 50 percent of targeted children. Other provinces have much lower rates of immunization. Malaria is widespread among both adults and children, with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum involved in 80 to 90 percent of the cases.|$|R
50|$|The MRL, {{along with}} the Royal Lao Air Force and the Royal Lao Army, was placed {{under the control of}} the Ministry of Defence in Vientiane; its {{administrative}} headquarters was allocated at <b>Vientiane's</b> military harbour, whose facilities also housed the main repair yard, the Fleet Command and the Independent Directorate of Laotian River Transports (French: Régie Autonome des Transports Fluviaux du Laos - RATFL), which handled military logistics and monotorized commercial shipping along the Mekong river.|$|R
5|$|In early 1953, the Việt Minh under Võ Nguyên Giáp {{commenced}} {{an invasion}} of Laos to exert additional pressure on Paris and on the French forces stationed in Indochina. In the area of Muong Khoua were the Việt Minh 308th, 312th and 316th divisions, whose long supply lines were maintained by a veritable army of 200,000 porters. The French command—headed then by Raoul Salan—ordered {{the establishment of a}} series of French outposts in northern Laos to resist the Việt Minh invading forces {{for as long as possible}} to buy time for the fortification of Luang Prabang and <b>Vientiane,</b> the capital cities of Laos. The King of Laos, Sisavang Vong, remained in Luang Prabang, which added greater impetus to French efforts. The terrain of northern Laos, and the local climate, isolated many of the outposts with a night-time fog known as crachin, thick jungle, a lack of roads, and steep terrain. Each outpost was given a certain number of days to withstand Việt Minh forces, including Muong Khoua which was issued orders on April 13 to hold for fourteen days—until April 27.|$|E
5|$|Raven Forward Air Controllers at Lima Site 20A, {{being the}} nearest {{available}} American support, were {{awakened by a}} radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn. At 05:15 Sullivan, from the U.S. Embassy in <b>Vientiane,</b> decided to evacuate Lima Site 85 and he gave a signal to U.S. pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. However, Sullivan {{did not realize that}} U.S. technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment. Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against North Vietnamese positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the North Vietnamese held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site was defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the North Vietnamese fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the TACAN site.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} An-2s {{had observed}} the attack {{from a distance}} and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, {{had been killed by}} the communist attack. Nevertheless, the TSQ-81 radar and its associated equipment was undamaged. Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the That Luang Monument, Vientiane’s most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom. Despite the attack, the U.S. Embassy in <b>Vientiane</b> and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. Lieutenant-Colonel Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the U.S. military took no steps to strengthen the defenses. In late February, a Combat Controller, Technical Sergeant James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes. He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 December 1959, Phoui {{fired the}} CDNI ministers from his cabinet, {{including}} Phoumi. On 25 December, General Phoumi {{took charge of}} the government in a bloodless coup, using Captain Kong Le and his Bataillon Parachutistes 2 (Parachute Battalion 2) to occupy <b>Vientiane's</b> infrastructure. The takeover had the approval of King Sisavang Vatthana; moreover, Phoumi was the only one chosen by his monarch for the new government. Phoumi believed he could impose an authoritarian [...] "directed democracy" [...] upon an ignorant populace for their own welfare.|$|R
25|$|At 0300 hours 10 August 1960, Kong Le {{launched}} the Second Paratroop Battalion in a coup. The same crucial points were seized {{as in the}} 1959 coup, {{with the addition of}} the seizure of <b>Vientiane's</b> docks at Tha Deua and the arrest of General Sounthone Pathammavong, the army commander in chief. By 0700 hours, Kong Le controlled the capital. Only six people were killed during the takeover. Any possible opposition was stranded in Luang Prabang. Thao Ma flew to Luang Prabang to relate news of the coup to Phoumi Nosavan.|$|R
25|$|French colonial {{policy in}} their Protectorate of Laos {{was based on}} a minimal French {{administration}} imposed upon the local culture. The French apparat in Laos was the smallest in French Indochina. In 1907, the French decided that two or three years education would suffice for the average Laotian citizen. Only a scanty lowland Lao urban elite received a better education, usually at <b>Vientiane's</b> Pavie Lycee by French instructors. By the time the Kingdom of Laos became independent, there were too few Lao with civil administrative training to run the government.|$|R
5|$|Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam {{shortly before}} the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive {{displaced}} hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated DetachmentS, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, DetachmentS was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, DetachmentS had carried 1,100refugees and 900tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4and 17April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated DetachmentN. The C-130Es began operations on 3May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91sorties for the UN. Aircraft of DetachmentS evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, {{shortly before the}}y fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. DetachmentN also evacuated the Australian embassy in <b>Vientiane,</b> Laos, during early June 1975.|$|E
25|$|With Central Intelligence Agency {{financial}} backing, and {{aided by}} CIA-trained commandos, at 0800 hours on 21 November 1960 Phoumi's troops launched their counter-coup to reclaim <b>Vientiane.</b> The northward movement to <b>Vientiane</b> would take nearly a month, but by 7 December, they were approaching Paksan, and poised {{for an attack}} on the capital. Kong Le ordered most of his paratroopers from <b>Vientiane</b> to reinforce his forward garrison at Paksan.|$|E
25|$|After a {{siege of}} <b>Vientiane</b> which took about four months, the Thais took <b>Vientiane</b> and carried off {{the images of}} Emerald Buddha and Phra Bang to Thonburi. The Prince of <b>Vientiane</b> managed to escape and went into exile. Thus Luang Prabang and <b>Vientiane</b> became Thai dependencies. Nothing {{definite}} {{is known about the}} origin of the celebrated Emerald Buddha. It is believed that this image was carved from green jasper by an artist or artists in northern India about two thousand years ago. It was taken to Ceylon and then to Chiang Rai, a town in the north of Siam where it was, in 1434, found intact in a chedi which had been struck by lightning. As an object of great veneration among Thai Buddhists. it has been deposited in monasteries in Lampang, Chiang Mai, Luang Prabang, <b>Vientiane,</b> Thonburi, and eventually in Bangkok.|$|E

By the time the Kingdom of Laos became independent, there were too few Lao with civil administrative training to run the government.|$|R
50|$|Four Air Operations Centers were established, one {{at each of}} the RLAF's airfields, {{which in}} turn were located one in each {{military}} region of Laos. The AOCs were located and designated respectively at <b>Vientiane's</b> Wattay Field (Lima Site 08), Pakse (Lima Site 11), Savannakhet (Lima Site 39), and Luang Prabang (Lima Site 54). Approximately June 1969, a fifth AOC located at Long Tieng (Lima Site 20A) was added. An advisor to the RLAF AC-47 gunship program was added in October 1970. This latter location supported the Hmong forces of General Vang Pao which would grow into the largest covert operation in history.|$|R
25|$|<b>Vientiane</b> {{remained}} {{independent and}} powerful, {{and the growing}} power of Ayutthaya threatened regional stability. In 1356 Fa Ngum marched south to take <b>Vientiane</b> for failing to support his earlier advance on Muang Sua. In 1357 he took <b>Vientiane</b> and the surrounding plains, and marched south to assert Lao control over the areas seized by Ayutthaya. Fa Ngum moved across the Khorat Plateau taking the major cities along the Mun and Chi Rivers and moving {{as far south as}} Roi Et.|$|E
25|$|In <b>Vientiane,</b> a Minister of State, Pra Woh, had {{rebelled against}} the ruling prince and {{fled to the}} Champasak territory, where he set himself up at Donmotdang near the present city of Ubon. He made formal {{submission}} to Siam, when he annexed Champasak, but after {{the withdrawal of the}} Thai army, he was attacked and killed by troops from <b>Vientiane.</b> This action was instantly regarded by King Taksin as a great insult to him, and at his command, Somdej Chao Phya Mahakasatsuek invaded <b>Vientiane</b> with an army of 20,000 men in 1778. It would be useful here to briefly summarise the history of Laos which had been separated into two principalities of Luang Prabang and <b>Vientiane</b> {{since the beginning of the}} eighteenth century. The Prince of Luang Prabang, who was in enmity with the Prince of <b>Vientiane,</b> submitted to Siam for his own safety, bringing his men to join Somdej Chao Phya Mahakasatsuek in besieging the city.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{administrative}} capital of <b>Vientiane</b> had suffered through the Battle of <b>Vientiane</b> and several subsequent coups, {{there had been}} only one early military operation in Military Region 5Operation Triangle in July 1964. However, beginning 5 August 1971, there would be another.|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, {{attacks by}} the Lao People's Army against the Hmong people and others intensified, with {{soldiers}} killing four unarmed Hmong school teachers {{in addition to}} engaging in other human rights abuses according to the Lao Human Rights Council, the Centre for Public Policy Analysis and others. [...] The LPAF and its military intelligence {{play a major role}} in the arrest, imprisonment and torture of foreign prisoners in <b>Vientiane's</b> notorious Phonthong Prison and the communist Lao gulag system where Australians Kerry and Kay Danes were imprisoned and where civic activist Sombath Somphone may be imprisoned following his arrest in December 2012.|$|R
50|$|Although Sang Sinxay was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} read out loud or sung, this oral tradition has declined, and the poem is now rarely chanted in temples. One exception is the Lan Xang Heritage Group’s poem recital project, founded by Daravong Kanlagna, grandson of Mahasila Viravong. The group promoted the recital {{and the performance of}} Sang Sinxay by primary and secondary school students. Notably, Sang Sinxay was performed in Tokyo, by children who participated to the Poetry Reading and Folk Singing for Lao Children Project organized in collaboration with <b>Vientiane's</b> Children's Education Centre and the NGO Action with Lao Children (Deknoi Lao), and funded by Tokyo's Ota Ward.|$|R
5000|$|The Sisattanak Kiln Site {{lies just}} outside <b>Vientiane's</b> first city walls, which are dated to the 15th century. Radiocarbon dating of the kiln gives a 15th-17th century timeframe, with an earlier period of that range most likely. This is {{supported}} by the evidence of surface finds, which suggest that area kilns at higher elevations show a greater ratio of glazed to unglazed wares. The theory is that the kilns were moved up over time and that more glazed wares were fired over time. This {{is supported by}} the ceramics uncovered at VS8, a lower-elevation site, which were all of a utilitarian and domestic nature. They included pipes, domestic wares and architectural fittings.|$|R
