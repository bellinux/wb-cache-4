50|$|The randot stereotest is a <b>vectograph</b> random dot stereotest. It is {{frequently}} used for detecting amblyopia, strabismus and suppression, and for assessing stereoacuity. The Randot test can measure stereoacuity to 20 seconds of arc.|$|E
50|$|Eudoxia Muller Woodward (June 14, 1919 - January 20, 2008) was an American {{artist and}} {{chemistry}} researcher. She {{was known for}} her work with Edwin H.

50|$|In geometry, a spirangle is {{a figure}} {{related to a}} spiral. Spirangles are similar to spirals in that they expand from a center point as they grow larger, but they are made out of {{straight}} line segments, instead of curves. Spirangle <b>vectographs</b> are used in vision therapy to promote stereopsis and help resolve problems with hand-eye coordination.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{originally}} a monochrome [...] "black-and-white" [...] process only, experimental full-color <b>vectographs</b> were soon {{being made by}} Polaroid. During the 3D fad of 1953, vectographic 3D color motion picture prints that could be shown with ordinary unmodified projectors {{were expected to be}} a commercial reality soon, but the rapid waning of public enthusiasm for 3D discouraged efforts toward that end. The original full-color process was apparently never put to any commercial use.|$|R
50|$|Vectographs {{in their}} native form are transparencies, to be viewed by {{transmitted}} light or projected onto a suitable non-depolarizing screen, but by limiting {{the density of the}} images and backing the <b>vectograph</b> with a non-depolarizing aluminum-based paint, a print for viewing by reflected light can be produced.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{stereoscopic}} {{aerial reconnaissance}} photographs were {{printed in the}} form of vectographs, both as reflective prints for use by troops in the field and as transparencies to be projected onto a screen for group viewing and discussion. Instructional use was made of projected <b>vectograph</b> slides illustrating three-dimensional coordinate systems.|$|E
50|$|Credit for {{the concept}} of the <b>vectograph</b> is due to Joseph Mahler, cousin of famed {{composer}} and conductor Gustav Mahler. He immigrated to the U.S. from Czechoslovakia in 1938 and was hired by the Polaroid Corporation, where he worked with its founder, inventor Edwin Land, to develop his idea into a practical process.|$|E
50|$|In {{stereopsis}} tests (short: stereotests), {{slightly different}} images are shown to each eye, such that a 3D image is perceived in case stereovision is present. This {{can be achieved}} by means of <b>vectographs</b> (visible with polarized glasses), anaglyphs (visible with red-green glasses), lenticular lenses (visible with the naked eye), or head-mounted display technology. The type of changes from one eye to the other may differ depending on which level of stereoacuity is to be detected. A series of stereotests for selected levels thus constitutes a test of stereoacuity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>vectographs,</b> if any {{examples}} of the process may be called common, are those in the booklets of [...] "Ortho-Fusor" [...] stereoscopic eye exercises first issued by Bausch and Lomb in the 1940s and available for many years. Also relatively common is the Titmus Fly Stereotest, a greatly enlarged stereoscopic image of a fly used by optometrists and ophthalmologists to determine if patients, especially young children, have normal stereoscopic vision. Currently available vectographic vision training aids, marketed under the registered trademark name [...] "Vectogram", include a variety with the left-eye and right-eye images overlaid on separate transparent plastic sheets {{so as to be}} adjustable. Subjects include a quoits hoop, a spirangle, and a hyperstereoscopic view of the Chicago skyline.|$|R
40|$|Convergence {{insufficiency}} is {{a problem}} commonly seen in optometric practice. It is a syndrome that consists of greater exophoria at far than at near, a decreased near point of convergence, reduced positive relative convergence at near, and reduced negative 1. d. 5 re at 1 ve accommo at 1 on. It {{is one of the}} easiest binocular visual anamolies to treat with visual therapy. 8 Therapy procedures com-manly used to build base-out fusion at near include base in/base out flippers, Quoit <b>vectographs</b> and push-up training with physiological diplopia 12 awareness. Occasionally a binocular condition is seen which resembles a convergence insufficiency in many ways, but shows several different key aspects. This condition will be called a false convergence insufficiency in this paper. In false convergence insufficiency, an accommodative dysfunction is clearly present. In this paper I will present the differences between a true and false convergence insufficiency, and discuss etiology and treatment of the false convergence insufficiency. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three subjects with false convergence insufficiency were tested. An American Optical Ultramatic phoroptor was used to measure phorias at near and far, base out vergences at near, positive relative accommodation, negative relative accommodation, binocular crossed cylinder, and gradient A/CA ratio. Convergence near point was measured from the spectacle plane with a small ruler, using a 20 / 30 equivilent line and a transilluminator as convergence targets. M. E. M. retinoscopy was done with a 20 / 30 equivilent line as a target. Accommodative amplitudes were measured binocularly with a 20 / 30 equivilent line. Accommodative facility was measured with + 2. 00 /- 2. 00 flippers. Stereopsis at near was measured with Wirt rings. Forced vergence fixation disparity curves were plotted with a Disparometer through an A. O. Ultramatic phoroptor. The pupillary near reflex was tested and found to be normal in all patients...|$|R
5000|$|Around 2000, the Rowland Institute, {{once part of}} Polaroid and {{now part}} of Harvard University, {{introduced}} a modernized ink jet printer version of the technology under the name [...] "StereoJet". Color <b>vectograph</b> printing service for digital image files was offered to the public, but it was expensive and little-used. As of 2012 {{it is no longer}} available.|$|E
50|$|Land further {{developed}} and produced the sheet polarizers under the Polaroid trademark. Although the initial major application was for sunglasses and scientific work, it quickly found many additional applications: for color animation in the Wurlitzer 850 Peacock jukebox of 1942, for glasses in full-color stereoscopic (3-D) movies, to control brightness of light through a window, a necessary component of all LCDs, and many more. During World War II, {{he worked on}} military tasks, which included developing dark-adaptation goggles, target finders, the first passively guided smart bombs, and a special stereoscopic viewing system called the <b>Vectograph</b> which revealed camouflaged enemy positions in aerial photography.|$|E
50|$|An {{elementary}} <b>vectograph</b> is a {{polarizing filter}} sheet that encodes a photographic image as areas which polarize light {{more or less}} strongly, corresponding to the darker and lighter areas of the image. When the sheet is viewed by itself in ordinary light, a pale image is seen. When viewed through a uniformly polarizing filter sheet oriented in the same plane of polarization, the image is almost completely invisible. If either sheet is then rotated 90 degrees about its axis, so that their planes of polarization are {{at right angles to}} each other, the image becomes boldly visible.|$|E

A baseline of static performance must be established before these techniques can be applied to real -time processing. The theoretical foundation for an alternative to the Vander Lugt technique of re- cording complex spatial filters had been laid by Marathay in 1969. On the basis of his theory, a photosensitive <b>Vectograph</b> TM technique was investigated, in which the image is produced as a polarization pattern rather than as the silver grain image of conventional photography. (1) Photographic characteristics of sensitized Vectographs were determined. The resolution (> 700 1 p /mm) and the gray scale achieved indicate that the <b>Vectograph</b> material can also be used for recording Vander Lugt filters. (2) Theoretical analysis showed that the technique can be used to image and process objects in the same system without removal of the filter. It can also be used to generate halfwave plates for the pupil functions described by Toraldo di Francia for superresolution. (3) The <b>Vectograph</b> can perform addition and subtraction of functions recorded on it; it also is suitable for recording real -bipolar filter functions. (4) Variable- contrast images can be recorded. A variable-contrast <b>Vectograph</b> tar- get (VCVT), developed for optical testing, can not only vary the contrast of the recorded image but also reverse its contrast. In a similar fashion, a spatially variable birefringent filter (SVBF) was developed that permits spatial control of the wave- length of the transmitted light. Static and dynamic electro-optical properties of liquid crystal mixtures of cholesteryl-chloride, cholesteryl-nonanoate, and cholesteryl-oleyl-carbonate were studied to determine their feasibility as the modulator in a proposed photoconductor-liquid crystal sandwich, which would be used as a reversible recording medium. (1) Previous research had indicated that cholesteric liquid crystals are circularly dichroic in a narrow wavelength band. The present work showed that light transmitted within this band is actually elliptically polarized. The degree of ellipticity depends on the relationship between the probing wavelength and the wavelength at which the sample becomes circularly dichroic. Outside this narrow wavelength band, the crystals exhibited pure optical activity. (2) The dynamic electro-optical properties of the cholesteric trimixture were measured. An alternating electric field applied parallel to the helical axis of the liquid crystals resulted in a hysteresis in the electro-optical rotatory power of the crystals. The magnitude of the hysteresis would limit cycling of these liquid crystals to a maximum frequency of ^ 0. 10 Hz. (3) A bias voltage applied to the crystals in an attempt to improve the frequency response resulted in a field- induced memory. When the bias voltage was maintained, the optical rotatory power failed to stabilize. Prolonged exposure to the bias voltage severely diminished the electro-optical rotatory power of the crystals...|$|E
