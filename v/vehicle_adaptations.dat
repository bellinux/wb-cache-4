FEDIs {{have become more}} prevalent and complicated in recent years, yet designs differ widely between vehicle makes and models and {{little is known about}} how to design FEDIs to maximize benefits while minimizing risks of distraction or unsafe driving. The purpose of Task 1 was to document the range of FEDI designs that have been used or proposed.

Nearly every major automotive manufacturer that sells vehicles in the United States offers at least one model with an FEDI.

40|$|Driving {{can provide}} {{independent}} and efficient mobility. However, {{according to the}} driving license directive (91 / 439 /EEC) are persons with locomotor impairments are only allowed drive if their disabilities can be compensated. Compensation can be realised by <b>vehicle</b> <b>adaptations.</b> The directive provides meagre guidance on how vehicles should be adapted or how to verify that the compensatory requirements are fulfilled. This is {{a gap in the}} current process for licensing drivers with physical disabilities. Furthermore, the Swedish process from driver assessment to driver licensing and adaptation approval is complex, fragmented, and suffer from lack of communication between involved authorities. The objective of this thesis was to {{contribute to the development of}} a method to evaluate <b>vehicle</b> <b>adaptations</b> for driver with physical disabilities. The focus was on the evaluation of adaptations for steering, accelerating and braking. Three driving simulator experiments and one manoeuvre test with adapted vehicles were conducted. A group of drivers with tetraplegia driving with hand controls were compared to able-bodied drivers in the first experiment. Even if the drivers with tetraplegia had a longer brake reaction time they performed comparable to the able-bodied drivers. However, they spent more effort and were more tired in order to perform as well as the able-bodied drivers. It was concluded that the adaptation was not sufficient. An Adaptive Cruise Controller (ACC) was tested in the second experiment in order to find out if it could alleviate the load on drivers using hand controls. It was found that the ACC decreased the workload on the drivers. However, ACC systems need to be adjustable and better integrated. The results from the first two experiments were used to provide some guidelines for ACCsystems to be used by drivers with disabilities. The third experiment was preceded by a manoeuvre test with joystick controlled cars. The test revealed some problems, which were attributed to time lags, control interference, and lack of feedback. Four joystick designs were tested with a group of drivers with tetraplegia in the third experiment. It was concluded that time lags should be made similar to what is found in standard cars. Lateral and longitudinal control should be separated. Active feedback can improve vehicle control but should be individually adjusted. The experiments revealed that drivers with the same diagnose can be functionally very diverse. Thus, an adaptation evaluation should be made individually. Furthermore, the evaluation should include a manoeuvre test. Finally, it was concluded that the evaluation approach applied in the experiments was relevant but needs to be further developed...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{subjects}} with lower limb disabilities {{participated in a}} simulator study. The {{purpose of the study}} was to investigate how an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system together with two different hand controls for accelerator and brake influenced workload, comfort and driving behaviour and to further develop a method to evaluate <b>vehicle</b> <b>adaptations</b> for drivers with disabilities. The installed ACC system could maintain a constant speed selected and set by the driver and it also adapted speed in order to keep a safe distance to a leading vehicle. Furthermore, it included a stop-and-go function. Two common types of hand controls for accelerator and brake were used. The hand controls were different both with respect to function, single or dual levers, and position, on the steering column or between the front seats. The subjects were all experienced drivers of adapted cars equipped with hand controls. All subjects drove 100 km at two occasions, with and without the ACC system available but with the same hand control. Subjective workload was found to be significantly lower and performance better for the ACC condition. The difference in speed variation between manual and ACC supported driving increased with the distance driven which seems to support the previous finding. The subjects thought they could control both speed and distance to leading vehicles better while the ACC was available. ACC driving did not influence reaction time, speed level, lateral position or variation in lateral position. Headway during car following situations was shorter for the ACC condition compared to manual driving. The ACC was well received, trusted and wanted. It was concluded that the ACC system substantially decreased workload, increased comfort and did not influence safety negatively. The only difference found between the two types of hand controls was that drivers using the dual lever system had less variation in lateral position. The applied evaluation method proved to be useful but needs to be further developed...|$|E

The aim of the report is twofold: firstly, to present deficiencies in the current routines and secondly, compare Swedish conditions with those in other countries {{in order to provide}} a basis for improving the situation in Sweden. Thus, both national and international conditions are described in the report. In an earlier report, VTI Report 426, it was concluded that the present routines used to ensure that drivers with physical impairments are provided with the right adaptation are not satisfactory e. g. some form of adaptation evaluation is lacking. The report begins with a short description of the background and a description of how some central concepts such as impairment, disability, and handicap are used in the report. This is followed by a somewhat simplified and idealised description of what is called the mediating process i. e. from the initial assessment of fitness to drive to adaptation of the car and driving licensing. After this follows a presentation of how this process is implemented and works in Sweden of today. The following sections are devoted to the conditions in the other Nordic countries. This is followed by sections dealing with some European countries and what the EU member states have in common. The next sections are devoted to some countries outside Europe. Standards and competence centres have been considered so important in this context that these subjects are dealt with in separate sections.

Assessing the potential uptake of these new categories of vehicles requires an understanding of likely consumer responses. Previous in-depth explorations of appraisals and evaluations of {{electric vehicles}} have tended to focus on ‘early adopters’, who may not represent mainstream consumers. This paper reports a qualitative analysis of responses to electric cars, based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 40 UK non-commercial drivers (20 males, 20 females; age 24 – 70 years) {{at the end of a}} seven-day period of using a battery electric car (20 participants) or a plug-in hybrid car (20 participants).

Results highlight potential barriers to the uptake of current-generation (2010) plug-in electric cars by mainstream consumers. These include the prioritization of personal mobility needs over environmental benefits, concerns over the social desirability of electric vehicle use, and the expectation that rapid technological and infrastructural developments will make current models obsolete.

40|$|Aviation has {{experienced}} {{one hundred years}} of evolution, resulting in the current air transportation system dominated by commercial airliners in a hub and spoke infrastructure. While the first fifty years involved disruptive technologies that required frequent <b>vehicle</b> <b>adaptation,</b> the second fifty years produced a stable evolutionary optimization of decreasing costs with increasing safety. This optimization has resulted in traits favoring a centralized service model with high vehicle productivity and cost efficiency. However, it may also {{have resulted in a}} system that is not sufficiently robust to withstand significant system disturbances. Aviation is currently facing rapid change from issues such as environmental damage, terrorism threat, congestion and capacity limitations, and cost of energy. Currently, these issues are leading to a loss of service for weaker spoke markets. These catalysts and a lack of robustness could result in a loss of service for much larger portions of the aviation market. The impact of other competing transportation services may be equally important as casual factors of change. Highway system forecasts indicate a dramatic slow down as congestion reaches a point of non-linearly increasing delay. In the next twenty-five years, there is the potential for aviation to transform itself into a more robust, scalable, adaptive, secure, safe, affordable, convenient, efficient and environmentally friendly system. To achieve these characteristics, the new system will likely be based on a distributed model that enables more direct services. Short range travel is already demonstrating itself to be inefficient with a centralized model, providing opportunities for emergent distributed services through air-taxi models. Technologies from the on-demand revolution in computers and communications are now available as major drivers for aviation on-demand adaptation. Other technologies such as electric propulsion are currently transforming the automobile industry, and will also significantly alter the functionality of future distributed aviation concepts. Many hurdles exist, including technology, regulation, and perception.

In particular, covert and sustained hazards, like crosswinds, might require complex <b>vehicle</b> control <b>adaptations.</b> We investigated differences between drivers’ lateral responses in unexpected and expected (repeated) crosswind events using probabilistic topic modeling. First, each driver’s event-based steering wheel movements (angle and rate, 5 Hz) were transformed into symbolic words.

Results indicate that drivers may make fewer abrupt steering wheel movements when they encounter unexpected crosswinds. On the contrary, drivers {{are more likely to}} make continuous faster steering corrections to compensate crosswinds when they are expected. The topic models also classify unexpected and expected crosswind events better than traditional models that use single aggregated values across events (maximum steering wheel angle and rate).
