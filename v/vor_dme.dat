50|$|On {{aircraft}} {{equipped with}} advanced navigation equipment, the wind triangle is often solved within the flight management system, (FMS) using inputs {{from the air}} data computer (ADC), inertial navigation system (INS), global positioning system (GPS), and other instruments, (<b>VOR),</b> (<b>DME),</b> (ADF). The pilot simply reads the solution provided to him.|$|E
5000|$|When {{separation}} minima and route spacing {{are determined}} using a conventional sensor-based approach, the navigation performance data {{used to determine}} the separation minima or route spacing depend on the accuracy of the raw data from specific navigation aids such as <b>VOR,</b> <b>DME</b> or NDB. In contrast, PBN requires an RNAV system that integrates raw navigation data to provide a positioning and navigation solution.

50|$|Several NOTAMs {{had been}} issued for Ahmedabad airport, {{specifically}} {{the absence of}} approach lights, glide path was absent from the Instrument Landing System leaving only the localiser available. This still left VASI lights, <b>VOR,</b> <b>DME,</b> and localiser, which was sufficient to land aircraft even with visibility at 1600 M. The Airport Authority says it is a mandatory requirement that the pilot {{be able to see}} the runway from 500 feet and that if the pilot had not seen the runway, he should have never descended below 500 feet, and if the runway was visible, he should have been able to land. The fact that the aircraft landed 2.6 km from the airport showed that he had not sighted the runway.|$|E
5000|$|The {{flight control}} tower is 12 m high, and [...] it is {{equipped}} with low-visibility weather navigation and landing assistance systems like <b>VOR,</b> <b>DME,</b> NDB and radio beacon. Its runway is lined with strobe lights. Supplies are taken to Marambio Base during the whole year, to be later distributed to other Argentine bases nearby (except for Belgrano II). There are over 100 intercontinental flights every year. The parking platform lets in heavy cargo planes like the Hercules C-130 with access to fuel and concurrent services. There is also an hangar for the Argentine Air Force de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter that routinely operates from the base along the two Bell 212s that are deployed during the summer campaigns to support scientific activities and link to other Argentine bases.|$|E

50|$|AAI {{has four}} {{training}} establishments viz. The Civil Aviation Training College (CATC) at Allahabad, National Institute of Aviation Management and Research (NIAMAR) at Delhi and Fire Training Centres (FTC) at Delhi & Kolkata. An Aerodrome Visual Simulator (AVS) {{has been provided}} at CATC and non-radar procedural ATC simulator equipment is being supplied to CATC Allahabad and Hyderabad Airport. AAI has a dedicated Flight Inspection Unit (FIU) with a fleet of three aircraft fitted with flight inspection system to inspect Instrument Landing Systems up to Cat-III, <b>VORs,</b> <b>DMEs,</b> NDBs, VGSI (PAPI, VASI) and RADAR (ASR/MSSR). In addition to in-house flight calibration of its navigational aids, AAI undertakes flight calibration of navigational aids for the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy, Indian Coast Guard and other private airfields in the country.|$|R
50|$|By {{this time}} the Loran-C and Decca Navigator systems were {{dominant}} in the medium-range roles, and short-range was well served by <b>VOR</b> and <b>DME.</b> The expense of the clocks, lack of need, and the limited accuracy of a long wave system eliminated {{the need for such}} a system for many roles.|$|R
40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{deriving}} position from <b>VOR</b> (without <b>DME)</b> {{have been developed}} and evaluated in this study. These methods permit navigation to arbitrary waypoints using either two VOR's or one VOR and a clock. These algorithms have been tested in computer simulations and in flight tests. The single VOR method {{appears to be the}} most practical and is a candidate for an automated light plane area navigation system, called VORNAV...|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft {{parking space}} of [...] {{supports}} up to fourteen Boeing 737s and four Boeing 747s. The cargo terminal is [...] of covered space. The paved runway {{is laid out}} in the direction 10/28 is 3100 x 45 m. It can receive all modern jetliners up to the Boeing 747 in size. The airport is equipped with an ILS Cat II landing system and offers the following radio navigation aids: <b>VOR</b> - <b>DME</b> - NDB.|$|R
5000|$|VOR {{stations}} rely on [...] "line of sight" [...] {{because they}} {{operate in the}} VHF band—if the transmitting antenna cannot be seen on a perfectly clear day from the receiving antenna, a useful signal cannot be received. This limits <b>VOR</b> (and <b>DME)</b> range to the horizon—or closer if mountains intervene. Although the modern solid state transmitting equipment requires much less maintenance than the older units, an extensive network of stations, needed to provide reasonable coverage along main air routes, is a significant cost in operating current airway systems.|$|R
5000|$|VOR/DME {{refers to}} {{combined}} radio navigation station for aircraft, {{which consists of}} two radio beacons, placed together, a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (<b>DME).</b> <b>VOR</b> produces an angle between the station and the receiver in the aircraft, while DME does the same for range. Together, they provide the two measurements needed to produce a navigational [...] "fix" [...] using a chart.|$|R
50|$|The FAA also {{contends that}} only a single set of navigational {{equipment}} will be needed on an aircraft for both LAAS and WAAS capability. This lowers initial cost and maintenance per aircraft since only one receiver is required instead of multiple receivers for NDB's, <b>DME,</b> <b>VOR,</b> ILS, MLS and GPS. The FAA hopes this will result in decreased cost to the airlines and passengers as well as general aviation.|$|R
5000|$|The ATC 810 Simulator {{is used to}} {{introduce}} the student to the first stages of instrument flying by concentrating on procedures and IFR navigation. The Moncton Flight College owns and operates 3 ATC 810's which simulate the Piper Navajo. Both are fitted with HSI's, <b>DME's</b> <b>VOR's,</b> ADF's and dual radios. Each simulator also has a plotter to allow the student to see exactly {{what they have done}} during their session.|$|R
5000|$|Gaps in {{air traffic}} control and radar {{coverage}} over large stretches of the Earth's oceans, {{as well as an}} absence of most types of radio navigation aids, impose a requirement for a high level of autonomy in navigation upon transatlantic flights. Aircraft must include reliable systems that can determine the aircraft's course and position with great accuracy over long distances. In addition to the traditional compass, inertials and satellite navigation systems such as GPS all have their place in transatlantic navigation. Land-based systems such as <b>VOR</b> and <b>DME,</b> because they operate [...] "line of sight", are mostly useless for ocean crossings, except in initial and final legs within about 240 nmi km of those facilities. In the late 1950s and early 1960s an important facility for low-flying aircraft was the Radio Range. Inertial navigation systems became prominent in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|The Initial Approach Fix (IAF) is {{the point}} where the initial {{approach}} segment of an instrument approach begins. An instrument approach procedure may have more than one Initial approach fix and initial approach segment. The initial approach fix is usually a designated intersection, <b>VOR,</b> NDB, or <b>DME</b> fix. The initial approach fix may be collocated with the intermediate fix (IF) of the instrument approach and in such case they designate the beginning of the intermediate segment of the approach. When initial approach fix, and intermediate fix are combined there is no initial approach segment.|$|R
5000|$|An Area Navigation (RNAV) {{system is}} an onboard {{computer}} with display and may include an up-to-date navigation database. At least one VOR/DME station {{is required for}} the computer to plot aircraft position on a moving map or to display course deviation and distance relative to a waypoint (virtual VOR station). RNAV type systems have also been made to use two <b>VORs</b> or two <b>DMEs</b> to define a waypoint; these are typically referred to by other names such as [...] "distance computing equipment" [...] for the dual-VOR type or [...] "DME-DME" [...] for the type using more than one DME signal.|$|R
50|$|The airport resides at an {{elevation}} of 1280 feet (390 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 11/29 with an asphalt surface measuring 3,000 by 45 metres (9,843 ft × 148 ft). A second runway which is rarely used is designated 16/34 and also has an asphalt surface with a stretch of 1,801 by 30 metres (5,909 ft × 98 ft). The main runway, 11/29, has an ILS approach system and has its own VHF omnidirectional radio range (<b>VOR)</b> and <b>DME</b> station. It is also capable of handling aircraft such as the Boeing 747-400, but {{due to the lack}} of remote positions, this airport is mainly used by smaller aircraft. In September 2014, Monterrey commenced its first intercontinental flight in years when Aeromexico begins flying its Boeing 787 Dreamliner four days a week to Tokyo-Narita as a fuel stop to flights between Mexico City International Airport and Tokyo-Narita. Aeromexico stated that the flight will last while Tijuana International Airport, the usual gateway to Mexico from Asia, makes improvements to its runway. Monterrey was selected due to its importance to the country's economy and for being a popular business destination.|$|R
40|$|In {{civil and}} {{military}} aviation, ground based navigation aids (NAVAIDS) are still crucial for flight guidance {{even though the}} acceptance of satellite based systems (GNSS) increases. Part of the calibration process for NAVAIDS (ILS, <b>DME,</b> <b>VOR)</b> is to perform a flight inspection according to specified methods as stated in a document (DOC 8071, 2000) by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). One major task {{is to determine the}} coverage, or, in other words, the true signal-in-space field strength of a ground transmitter. This has always been a challenge to flight inspection up to now, since, especially in the L-band (DME, 1 GHz), the antenna installed performance was known with an uncertainty of 10 dB or even more. In order to meet ICAO's required accuracy of &plusmn; 3 dB it is necessary to have a precise 3 -D antenna factor of the receiving antenna operating on the airborne platform including all losses and impedance mismatching. Introducing precise, effective antenna factors to flight inspection to achieve the required accuracy is new and not published in relevant papers yet. The authors try to establish a new balanced procedure between simulation and validation by airborne and ground measurements. This involves the interpretation of measured scattering parameters gained both on the ground and airborne in comparison with numerical results obtained by the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) accelerated method of moments (MoM) using a complex geometric model of the aircraft. First results will be presented in this paper...|$|R
