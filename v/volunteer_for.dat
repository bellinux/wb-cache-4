5|$|The normal annual {{recruitment}} for the Indian {{army was}} 15,000 men, {{during the course}} of the war over 800,000 men <b>volunteered</b> <b>for</b> the army and more than 400,000 <b>volunteered</b> <b>for</b> non-combatant roles. In total almost 1.3 million men had <b>volunteered</b> <b>for</b> service by 1918. Over one million Indian troops served overseas during the war. In total, at least 74,187 Indian soldiers died in World War I.|$|R

40|$|In this article, I {{investigate}} {{the strength of}} intergenerational transmission of <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> non-profit associations in The Netherlands. Data from the Family Survey of the Dutch Population 2000 reveal that there are significant relations between current volunteering and parental volunteering in the past. While the transmission of <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> religious and quasi-religious (‘pillarized’) associations is due largely to the transmission of religion and social status from parents to their children, parental <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> pillarized associations has increased the likelihood of children’s <b>volunteering</b> <b>for</b> secular associations, even controlling for parental and children’s religion, education, wealth and personality characteristics. Consistent with a value internalization explanation, this spillover effect was not due to the direct social pressure of parents. ...|$|R
5|$|During the All Black tour of Australia, in {{the game}} against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914, the news was posted on the {{scoreboard}} that the British Empire – and therefore New Zealand and Australia – had declared war. On the ship home, the players collectively decided to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> military service. Three of them were killed, including Downing at Gallipoli, Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim McNeece at Messines.|$|E
5|$|In March 1990, Conway {{became an}} {{experimental}} bone marrow donor for Mark Stevenson, a 4-year-old with Hunter syndrome. The operation – {{the first of}} its kind involving an unrelated donor – was a success, allowing Mark to live to 24. Conway became an active <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the National Marrow Donor Program, claiming to have helped add over 500 entries to their donor registry.|$|E
5|$|In late 1913 Burgess {{was sent}} to Tasmania on {{exchange}} with the Australian Military Forces. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, he joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) rather than returning to New Zealand to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. He embarked for the Middle East with the 3rd Australian Field Artillery Brigade on 20 October 1914 aboard the P liner Geelong.|$|E

5|$|Limited {{demobilisation}} began {{during the}} final years of the war. In order {{to meet the needs of}} the war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service, including at least two years outside Australia, could <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> discharge.|$|E
5|$|Monk meets St. Claire, {{his wife}} Miranda (Gail O'Grady), and their advisor Gavin Lloyd (Ben Bass), {{and walks to}} the site where the {{assassination}} attempt occurred. He discovers Vasquez was a <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the St. Claire's campaign. When he goes to St. Claire campaign headquarters and questions a volunteer about Vasquez, that volunteer later dies under suspicious circumstances, enhancing Monk's suspicion about a link between the Vasquez and St. Claire cases.|$|E
5|$|While in college, Conway was {{a member}} of the Ursinius Meistersingers vocal music group, and the {{performing}} arts honor society Pi Nu Epsilon. He became a <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the American Red Cross Disaster Service in 1989, but quit in 1998 due to his perception of high-level corruption in the organization.

5|$|Davies {{was taken}} on {{as a member}} of the BBC Wales children's {{department}} in 1985 and given one-day contracts and commissions, such as illustrating for Why Don't You? As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the Sunday Sport before its launch to provide a football-themed daily strip; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for Crossroads in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.|$|E
5|$|Denied {{the use of}} compulsion, Chamberlain had {{to persuade}} Britons to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> {{essential}} war work, and fit young workers to leave the factories and enter the Army. He had to address mass meetings and issue posters. He found that workers were reluctant to exchange {{the comforts of home}} and wartime salaries for the uncertainties of the trenches and a wage of one shilling a day. Chamberlain had little confidence in voluntary schemes and they indeed proved unsuccessful, with only 9,000workers freed to be drafted into the Army at a time when Britain was sustaining huge casualties.|$|E

5|$|Feit did {{not feel}} {{comfortable}} with the monastic lifestyle at Assumption Abbey. He was sent to Jemez Springs, New Mexico, to a treatment retreat for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete. Feit joined the order as a staff member and worked his way into a supervisory role at the center. Father James Porter came to the center after {{he was known to}} have begun molesting children in the 1960s, and Feit cleared him for placement in another parish. Porter was later defrocked and imprisoned after abusing as many as 100 children. Feit left the priesthood in the 1970s. He got married, moved to the Phoenix area, and had three children. He worked at the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul as a food charity <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Hose Company #12, {{and later}} Hose Company #11, hired the first African-American firefighters in the city. One of these {{stations}} was located at 20th and Lake Streets. One {{of the first}} African-American firefighters in Omaha was James C. Greer, Sr. {{who was a member}} of the Omaha Fire Department from May 5, 1906, to August 1, 1933, and was a captain in the department for many years. Horse-drawn wagons were in use when he was assigned to the old No. 11 Station at Thirtieth and Spaulding Streets. He later served at the No. 4 Station at Sixteenth and Izard Streets. He retired as senior captain from the Omaha Fire Department in 1933. His son Richard N. Greer served as a <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the fire department in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Godley {{attended}} Staff College at Camberley but, {{following the}} outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, ended his studies early to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> service in Africa. Along with other officers of the Special Service Battalion, he helped to raise irregular mounted regiments. Godley was later adjutant to Colonel Robert Baden-Powell and was present during the Siege of Mafeking. He was also chief staff officer to Lieutenant Colonel Herbert Plumer and later commanded the Rhodesian Brigade. In 1900, Godley transferred to the Irish Guards before being appointed to the staff at Aldershot as commander of the Mounted Infantry. Three years later he transferred to Longmoor Military Camp, commanding the Mounted Infantry there until 1906.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, {{along with another}} brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age for volunteers was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By {{the time he reached}} South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of the}} contingent.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Waldmann {{applied for}} a career as {{an officer in the}} Luftwaffe for the first time. Travelling to Berlin, he was deemed {{suitable}} but at the age of 16 was too young to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> military service. After the outbreak of World War II, while still at school, Waldmann and his fellow students were forced into compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst). Waldmann was assigned to the Brunswick Mechanical Engineering Institute. Since Waldmann had intended to study aircraft construction after his military service, he was reassigned to the Institute of Aeronautical Metrology and Flight Meteorology at the Braunschweig-Waggum airfield under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Heinrich Koppe.|$|E
5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to <b>volunteer</b> <b>for</b> the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E
