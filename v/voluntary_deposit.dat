40|$|This study {{examines}} the feasibility {{and consequences of}} taking three actions: privatizing deposit insurance, establishing a <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance system for deposits {{in excess of the}} maximum amount of FDIC insurance, and increasing the limit on deposit insurance coverage for municipalities and other units of general government. As a result of the study, the FDIC does not recommend privatizing deposit insurance, providing a <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance system for deposits above the maximum amount of FDIC insurance, or increasing the limit on municipal deposits. The study begins by reviewing arguments made by the proponents of privatizing deposit insurance and concludes, first, that privatization will not result in the elimination of moral hazard since moral hazard is an effect of all types of insurance. Further, recent regulatory and statutory improvements in federal banking law have given the FDIC better tools to control moral hazard. Second, much of the regulatory burden on banks is unrelated to deposit insurance and will not go away with privatization. Third, privatization would not remove the taxpayer from ultimate responsibility for losses arising from a systemic crisis. Government intervention in a systemic failure—to prevent broader problems—is really an economic issue, not a deposit insurance issue...|$|E

I consider the state of Kansas, which had a system of <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance and where branch banking was strictly prohibited, and find that bank failure rates were highest in counties suffering the greatest agricultural distress and where deposit insurance system membership was the highest. The evidence for Kansas illustrates how prohibitions on branch banking caused unit banks to be especially susceptible to local economic shocks, and suggests that, despite regulations to limit risktaking, deposit insurance caused more bank failures than would have occurred otherwise.

We began collecting electronic theses early as well: <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> of Ph. D. theses began in 2001, and became mandatory in July 2002. The thesis collection was hosted on the ETD-db software platform developed at Virginia Tech. By 2008 {{it became clear}} that we needed to consolidate our repository platforms. We decided to move our electronic theses to EPrints Version 3, the platform in use for our institutional repository. We did not, however, want to lose the many unique features of the Virginia Tech ETD-db software, such as thesis-specific workflow, the ability for staff to communicate with thesis authors via email from within the ETD-db interface, and fine-grained, thesis-specific access controls. We also wanted to add new features that were not available in either platform, such as tracking the progress of a thesis through the complex local approval and release process, and the ability to store related documents, such as signed thesis forms and permissions letters, with the thesis but in a "dark" area of the record visible only to repository administrators. This briefing explains what was involved in the transition from ETD-db to EPrints for our thesis collection and how the Caltech Library took advantage of the flexibility of the EPrints platform to meet our requirements. It also suggests ways that other institutions may be able to adopt and build on what we've done, and why EPrints 3 may be a good electronic thesis repository solution for other institutions. ...|$|E

The HKU Scholars Hub, hosted in DSpace, began as the IR of The University of Hong Kong (HKU) in 2005. Asking for <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> of publications from HKU academics, it received little notice, and more importantly, little support from University senior management. In 2009 a new HKU initiative, Knowledge Exchange, adopted the Hub as a key vehicle to share knowledge and skill with the community outside HKU.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctorate of Business Administration (DBA) Government {{mandated}} {{institutions in}} Australia and Canada have continuously progressed banking regulation throughout time by making gradual alterations to prudential frameworks and supervisory practices. This has included the prompt domestic {{adaptation of the}} three Basel accords. A main objective is to ensure banking organisations become more resilient to stresses that impact their capital and liquidity adequacy. Banking organisations {{are faced with the}} task of transforming their balance sheets and funding profiles to not only strengthen their balance sheets but to curb heighted liquidity costs that have been brought on by regulatory reform. A review of existing literature on the components of bank funding, liquidity and procyclicality recognises their significance in ensuring individual bank stability and the prevarication of broader systemic implications in the wider economy. This dissertation has examined the historical evolution of the regulatory environments in both Australia and Canada and compared the components of bank balance sheets that offer insights into their funding preference and liquidity holdings, and provide early indicators for procyclicality within the banking sector. It has also had the goal of developing existing research and knowledge of liquidity stresses within bank balance sheets. This research has endeavoured to further balance sheet innovation, through action research that has been carried out over a five year period, to provide banking organisations with options to alter their balance sheets {{in order to meet the}} Basel III package of reforms and better deal with liquidity pressures, such as those that were evident in many countries throughout the most recent financial crisis. A new methodology for balance sheet transformation under Basel III, “ evergreen ” is articulated, with a suite of evergreen asset and liability products and balance sheet exposures being assessed for impact and acceptance within the banking industry. Verification of the evergreen method is demonstrated by the banking industry including it within their strategy for future balance sheet innovation; banks designing and constructing evergreen capability; the regulator encompassing it within prudential standards; and widespread acceptance of evergreen by investors and other financial market participants. Whilst components of evergreen are increasingly becoming a greater part of the banking industry within Australia, it is recognised that the concepts and models of evergreen, are at a primary juncture in their development and require substantial additional focus and research. The usefulness of this dissertation will be established through the particulars of future research settings and must be appraised to the degree that it appears correct, original and apt. Regarding deposits, this dissertation finds that: the existence of <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> insurance schemes would allow the competitive landscape for retail deposits to become about more than just price; operational deposits are not immune from procyclical competition; Australian banks have a much greater appetite and tolerance for at-call deposit raising; liquidity regulation has permanently shifted the ‘market rate’ for deposit funding above its ‘natural rate’; and foreign currency deposit raising may lead to banks running unhedged positions or developing a larger reliance towards United States Dollars. For wholesale funding, it is observed that: liquidity regulation has increased the reliance of banks on domestic financial markets to fulfil their financing needs; the volume of short-dated prime bank paper being issued in Australia has declined where there are consequences for the Bank Bill Swap Rates; and large differentials in the semi/quarterly spread can substantially impact the profitability of banking book products. The domestic implementation of the Basel III package of reforms on liquidity in both Australia and Canada has, in many ways, imitated the historical approach taken towards bank capital regulation. This dissertation deducts that, as there is for capital, the concept of ‘regulatory’ and ’economic’ liquidity now exists. Furthermore, regulation has introduced a predisposition to government bonds, which may have unintended consequences for both government sponsored issuers and bank investors. Finally, procyclicality must be monitored and managed by the government sponsored institution tasked with the role of implementing monetary policy, rather than institutions that implement and enforce prudential regulation...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{development}} of Savings and Credit Cooperatives in Mekelle Zone. The fundamental objective {{of this study is to}} asses and documents the evolution, performance and challenges of SACCOs in Mekelle Zone. A randomly selected seven sample SACCOs were taken to investigate the status, and their outreach performance based on the commonly accepted growth dimensions: governance, service delivery, financial performance and institutional capacity. A review of relevant documents and interview schedule were prepared and administered with randomly selected members and various committee members. Employee based SACCOs have laid the foundation in the development of SACCOs in Mekelle. SACCOs have shown a noticeable increase in number size diversity of membership post the over through of the command economy. They have increased from 8 prior the end of the command economy to 24 at present. The average membership per SACCO was 127 at the end of June 2006 / 7. Women share of membership was 33. 3 percent. They have expanded in their type of membership base to include some community based members such as: small traders and women traders working in the zone. Regarding governance of the SACCOs, they have a well-developed by law that portrays the hierarchical relationship of various committees giving the ultimate ruling power to the general assembly. How ever absenteeism and inactive and inactive participation is commonly observed in the SACCOs. Besides, women have been under represented in committees and general assembly meetings are not usually conducted on schedule. The SACCOs offer limited financial service. The types of the saving products offered by all SACCOs under the present survey are limited to shares, compulsory <b>deposits</b> and <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposits.</b> They have exhibited substantial growth in the amount of saving they mobilize and deposit per member. The SACCOs offer loans to their members mainly for construction of dwellings, purchase of house furniture, educational fees, medical and hospitalization expenses with repayment period ranging between 2 and 3 years. The Interest rate the SACCOs charge is not adequate to cover fund cost, operating expenses, acceptable range of profit margin and inflation. The SACCOs have exhibited substantial growth in the amount of loan they disburse. They have achieved good repayment performance As far as financial performance is concerned, the saving amount in relation to the total assets for the SACCOs was found to be with in the range of standard of excellence set by WOCCU. On the other hand, the members share to total assets was less than the standard of excellence in majority of the SACCOs. In terms of institutional capital to total asset, they have not maintained the standard of excellence. The SACCOs data under study reveals no delinquency so far. Majority of the SACCOs, have maintained the standard of excellence set on operating expense to total asset ratio; on the other hand, the net income to assets was compared unfavorably to the standard of excellence 10 percent. This is due to the lowest service price they charge to members. Even though the SACCOs are endowed with well educated members, they lack training and education opportunities. They gave little emphasis on training committee members. They also are constrained lack of office, office equipment and facilities. The factors that that limit the SACCOs’ growth identified in the study were: inadequate support and weak regulation and supervision, limited expansion in size and type of membership, inadequate efforts to enhance self governance, limited saving and loan products offered by SACCOs, absence of non financial services, inadequate service charges, poor financial performance, absence of training and educational opportunities, lack of office, office furniture and equipment, and poor record handling and inappropriate information system. Finally the study has proposed various interventions to be undertaken by stakeholders such as: training intervention, enabling the SACCOs be self reliant, active regulatory measures, diversified membership, diversified products, regularly revised service price, and developing appropriate information system...|$|R
40|$|The HKU Scholars Hub (the Hub) began {{service as}} a {{traditional}} institutional repository of The University of Hong Kong (HKU). However this format was not compelling to HKU researchers. Fortunately a subsequent reformation of the HKU statement on university mission and vision infused new life and purpose into the project. Over the next five years, {{in partnership with the}} Italian University Consortium, Cineca, the HKU Libraries transformed the Hub from an IR to a Current Research Information System. We expect that future development will see the Hub further transformed into a research information management system supporting both internal decision support and external public discovery. We will present new work developed recently to further these goals. IRs collect, manage and display publications, and their metadata. However, an institution’s research, expertise and capacity is described by more than publications. The Hub, hosted in DSpace, began as the IR of HKU in 2005. Asking for <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> of publications from HKU academics, it received little notice, and more importantly, little support from University senior management. In 2009 a new HKU initiative, Knowledge Exchange (KE), adopted the Hub as a key vehicle to share knowledge and skill with the community outside HKU. Upon winning grant support from the office of KE, the HKU Libraries chose Cineca as a development partner. Together we designed specifications to extend the data model of DSpace. We architected solutions to support non-publication objects, including people, grants, and patents. These entities are managed in new database tables with a flexible structure that is able to hold indexed and interlinked attributes, such as co-investigators, co-inventors, co-prize winners, research interests, languages spoken, supervision of postgraduate theses, etc. The structure has been designed to provide native support (through a backend UI) to the data model extensions. This will allow local operators to easily add new entities and new attributes, interlinkable to any internal or external corresponding record, without the need to write new code. Beginning with local data in several HKU silos, scripts will search for corresponding or augmented records in external sources, harvest and merge with Hub data. These sources are publication databases (Scopus, WoS, PubMed, etc.), funders (Hong Kong Research Grants Council, NIH, etc), patents (USPTO, Espacenet, Japan Patent Office, etc), and bibliometrics (Scopus, Google Scholar Citations, SSRN, etc). The DSpace user interface now delivers an integrated search and display on all objects and attributes, as well as on ones newly derived, such as a) authority work on name disambiguation and synonymy in Roman and Hanzi (漢字), b) visualizations on networks of co-authors, co-investigators, etc, c) metrics extracted from external sources, and d) internal alt-metrics of view and download counts, and more. In order to increase utility and the interchange of information, we have augmented DSpace’s OAI-PMH with several other protocols. 1) DOI. We register DOI numbers with CrossRef for all our e-theses (23, 000 in 2015), and will begin sending separate XML delineated bibliographies to CrossRef to allow us to harvest citation counts from CrossRef. 2) ORCID. As an early adopter of ORCID, we have created ORCID accounts and populated them with data from the Hub for all our professoriate staff. During the OR 2015 Meeting we will present the new developments made in collaboration with Cineca that have brought DSpace integration with ORCID to a new level: using the extended data model for DSpace described above, we are developing scripts to automatically query the scholar when new information comes into the Hub. Upon this scholar’s confirming one click, the script will automatically update the ORCID account. A similar future script, upon the scholar’s one click, will create and populate an ORCID account with information harvested from the Hub. 3) CERIF. We will soon implement the Common European Research Information Format (CERIF), for data exchange with other research entities. The Catalan Consortium and CSIC (mentioned below) have now used CERIF in this context to build central repositories. Beyond the open scholarship functions of an IR, the Hub now performs as a system for reputation management, impact management, and research networking and profiling [...] all of which are concepts included in the broad term, “Current Research Information System” (CRIS). These new objects and attributes curated from several trusted sources, and integrated into the present mashup, contextualize and highlight HKU research, and attract more hits, than an IR with only publications. A CRIS can provide discovery on internal resources to external users, and decision support to internal administration. Linked CRISes across several organizations or countries, using a common data interchange format such as CERIF, on top of providing federated discovery, can provide the sociological and organizational functions needed in e-science, e-research and cyberinfrastructure projects. The Hub has repurposed data once held in dark archives for HKU in-house administration purposes only. This data, after augmentation by the Libraries, provides discovery on HKU research and expertise. This data is then further harvested from the Hub for a multitude of purposes. HKU faculties are slowly abandoning their own data collection and web page creation methods in favour of using the web service of the Hub, to extract any Hub displayed element into XML. We re-package our data to ship to SSRN, so that the HKU Law Faculty can provide a monthly journal in SSRN’s LSN, etc. The Hub also enables the repurposing of Library staff. With the demise of print cataloguing, several staff found themselves without a job. Verifying, augmenting, and curating data incoming to the Hub has provided these staff with continuing and richer employment. And, the Hub project has newly purposed the HKU Libraries with another means of supporting their underlying institution. This is much welcomed in this era of lessened importance of the onsite physical collection. Using grant funding from the HKU Office of Knowledge Exchange, Cineca and HKU Libraries modularized this development work and placed it in open source on GitHub, with the name, “DSpace-CRIS”. Any DSpace site can now download and install as an optional add-on to DSpace. The Catalan Consortium of Research Universities has used it to build a regional portal that aggregates research information from all Universities in their region. EuroCRIS has used it for publication management and researcher profiles on their member organizations. Sites of other uptake include the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the CSIC Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (Spanish National Research Council). In recognition of DSpace-CRIS’ great flexibility, potential, and cost effectiveness, Cineca adopted DSpace-CRIS as the basis for their new “IRIS”, an enterprise CRIS platform which they are now installing in over 60 universities in Italy and abroad. A separate proposal to OR 2015 will give further detail on this. The new version of DSpace-CRIS that we will present at OR 2015, besides the important update relating to ORCID integration above described, includes a reworked search interface. We are introducing a new global search across all entities managed by the system to give surgical precision in search and discovery. These searches will return snippets of text with search terms highlighted in context. The DSpace-CRIS repository eco-system is now very rich. As an example, the researcher’s profile is composed of more than ten different sections covering general contact information, publications, projects, bibliometrics, theses, etc. Clicking on the returned highlighted search terms in context will take the user to the exact section where the desired information is displayed, rather than dropping the searcher confusingly {{at the top of a}} long complex record. This new global search will also enable operators to easily make new reports showing correspondence between data elements in disparate Hub entities, such as an interactive “Faculty Used Journals for Publications Report”, sortable by publication frequency, impact factor, year, author, underlying grant scheme, patents generated, etc. In summary, all involved with DSpace-CRIS wish to move this project further, to increase the utility of DSpace-CRIS, and its adoption in the open source community. We hope to find new ways to work with DuraSpace. This could mean providing a road map to the future for libraries stalled in IR development. It could mean providing an open source solution for IR / CRIS, as an alternative to commercial products. We would very much like to work with the community to find ways of convergence, DSpace-CRIS with mainstream DSpace. IRs and CRISes are changing, and their users and administrators are asking for new types of information and new ways to use them. We wish to fully collaborate with DuraSpace, to define a vision of the future, and make it happen for everyone that wishes this collaboration. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|During {{the winter}} of 2001 - 2002, in a sector of the {{district}} of Vaise (Lyons, Rhône), an archaeological excavation {{was carried out by}} the Institut national de recherches archéologiques préventives. On the right bank of the Saône, at a distance of approximately six kilometres {{to the north of the}} current junction of the river with the Rhône, the Vaise plain (altitude about 170 m) is limited by the buttresses of the Lyons plateau. Located 60 m from the bank of the Saône, above the plain, the sedimentary stratigraphy of Quai Paul Sédallian (168 m) depends on processes of slope and mainly of alluvial dynamics. The presence of an industrial fill and the poor legibility of the sedimentary succession did not facilitate analysis of the site. In such a context, geomorphological study thus proved essential. The occupation, attributed to the Burgundian Middle Neolithic era (NMB), is characterized by an anthropic ground level SL 303, the pit FS 229 and the structure E 246. The function of SL 303, the floor of a domestic area or a mere circulation level, remains unknown. Observed over a small area (43 m 2), it could form part of the installation characterised by the sub-quadrangular pit FS 229 and the structure E 246. The latter, with its irregular shape, yielded cremated human bones (0. 8 g and 128. 4 g) mixed with charcoals. A single burnt human bone comes from SL 303. The great majority of the bones are those of an adult, while some pieces belong to a child. These bones come from a true cremation (the bones were burnt fresh, at a temperature of between 750 and 1050 °). Pit FS 229 appears to contain selected bones (absence of trunk, hands and feet), while the structure E 246 holds pieces of various anatomical parts. The boundaries of the archaeological investigation reduce the possibilities of interpretation: the nature of the whole NMB occupation is difficult to identify; if FS 229 and E 246 concern funerary activity, the remainder delivered few indications arguing in favour of a domestic space. One argument rests on the representativeness of the ceramic ware, because we observe a clear prevalence of medium-sized containers. If the absence of fine forms can be explained by differential conservation, storage containers are missing. Cups and bowls represent the main pari of the identified recipients (ten out of eleven); only one large earthenware jar was identified. The sample seems incomplete or biased. The presence of human remains is not enough to draw the conclusion of a strictly funerary context. Neolithic dwellings, including some NMB examples, frequently deliver human bones, while in strictly sepulchral contexts, potsherds and partial remains are regularly present. Most of the data collected for the Middle, Recent and Late Neolithic show that the relationship between sepulchral and domestic spaces is very close, even if a true synchrony can seldom be established. Our configuration may as easily represent successive occupations as juxtaposed activities. Either the apparent selection of the ceramic goods on Quay Sédallian is to be put in relationship with conservation problems on the site, or it depends on the nature of the installation; the pots in that case would correspond to a choice with regard to funerary gestures. These two assumptions are not incompatible and can both be retained. Only truncated scraps remain from the occupation level: part of ground level SL 303, the pit FS 229 and the (probably natural) basin, E 246. Moreover, the distribution of the ceramological types by archaeological unit makes it possible to oppose the series of containers from SL 303 to those from E 246 and FS 229. The first contains only simple forms, whereas the definitely segmented profiles (earthenware jar with shoulders and vase with carinated and rounded bottom) come from the second. The simple forms are very fragmented, while the segmented profiles are complete or almost so. This difference, undoubtedly functional, leads us to interpret ground SL 303 as a circulation level, whereas E 246 and FS 229 concern deposits of cremated remains. From an archaeological point of view, structure E 246, FS 229 and SL 303 are dependent. The typology of the ceramics (24 pots, including 11 identifiable forms) attests to the synchrony of E 246 and FS 229 and of their contents (cremated bones). Ground SL 303, close to them, but with no stratigraphic relation, belongs to the same chrono-cultural phase. This surface could be contemporary with E 246 and FS 229. If SL 303 is a circulation level synchronous with the funerary activity, two different models can be proposed: 1) E 246 is a pit, in which part of the cremated remains was deposited, coming from a double pyre or two pyres. If the bone remains of FS 229 and E 246 concern the same two individuals, that implies an elaborate funerary process, but we cannot be sure that they belong to the same skeletons. The potsherds from these two entities cannot be connected to each other. 2) E 246 is not a pit, but a natural depression in an occupation level. It would represent an area on which funerary pyre remains were tossed aside, and E 246 would be part of this level, trapped in a depression. This assumption can be corroborated by the presence of the femur fragment found on the ground SL 303. The surface concerned by this level would include FS 229, E 246 and SL 303. The complete vessel VP 245, in E 246, combined with the random representation of the skeleton (head and members only present) suggests a <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposit</b> in connection with the remains of the cremation (bones and charcoals), thus meeting the definition of a «cremation deposit» (secondary burial). The poor conservation of the site (greatly damaged by the impact of industrial installations) and the sedimentary sequences did not facilitate the interpretation of the ground. To affirm an archaeological bond between the vestiges, we had AMS dating carried out on the cremated human bones. The results, consistent with NMB ceramic typology, ensure the chrono-cultural attribution and the association of the pots with the human bones (Lyon- 2164 (Oxa) : 5080 +/- 30 BP; more probable dates: - 3845, - 3817, - 3857, - 3939, - 3875 B. C.; for 95 %: from 3962 to 3792 B. C.). The treatment of the dead in NMB contexts concerns exclusively burials, practised in coffins or under a stone tumulus. Cases of partial cremation are however recorded at Mont-Vaudois (Héricourt, Haute-Saône). In the chrono-cultural context of the NMB (Cortaillod, Lagozza, Late Chassey), the tombs contain one or more skeletons. Sometimes, isolated human bones are found in dwellings. Some burials, often double, were carried out in caves or in storage pits in open domestic spaces. Generally, cremations are not encountered in the Late Chassey, Munzingen, Pfyn or Cortaillod horizons, contemporary with the NMB. We know only three examples of true cremation in the Middle Neolithic period: the necropolis of Camp-del-Ginebre (Caramany, Pyrénées-Orientales), two tombs of Abri 2, Fraischamp (Roque-sur-Perne, Vaucluse), and one deposit in a pit at Vallon de Gaude (Manosque, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence). In the majority of the cases where fire is used, the treatment concerns more the structure (stones, walls) than the bodies. While some skeletons carry specific traces of burning, it is not possible to speak of cremations. The use of fire in a sepulchral context seems more frequent during the Late Neolithic period. The practice of cremation appears marginal in the Neolithic era, and presents various forms in its final phase. The discovery of Sédallian seems to indicate that while inhumation seems to have dominated, cremation appears to have been more frequent than merely anecdotal or incidental. The latter emerges in Western Europe during the 4 th millennium ВС. It should be specified that the vestiges presented here illustrate the only certified cremation for the NMB. The ceramic corpus and the date agree for the attribution of this occupation to an early phase of the cultural group, in a southernmost position compared to the eponym zone of Franche-Comté and Burgundy. Un secteur du quartier de Vaise (Lyon, Rhône) a fait l'objet d'une fouille préventive au 51 - 53 quai Paul Sédallian. En rive droite de la Saône, à environ six kilomètres au nord de la confluence actuelle de cette rivière avec le fleuve Rhône, l'occupation attribuée au Néolithique moyen bourguignon (NMB) se caractérise par un sol anthropique SL 303, une fosse FS 229 et l'ensemble E 246. SL 303, observé sur une faible extension (43 m 2), pourrait faire partie de l'installation caractérisée par la fosse FS 229 et l'ensemble E 246, qui livrent des résidus de crémation. Un os humain brûlé provient de SL 303. Les os ont été brûlés à l'état frais et sont en majorité ceux d'un adulte, seuls quelques éléments appartiennent à un enfant. L'occupation NMB est difficile à caractériser, cependant FS 229 et E 246 se rapportent à une activité funéraire et peu d'éléments plaident en faveur d'un habitat. Parmi le corpus céramique, coupes et écuelles représentent l'essentiel des récipients identifiés (dix sur onze), une seule jarre a été reconnue. L'échantillon semble incomplet ou biaisé. Soit l'apparente sélection de ce mobilier est à mettre en relation avec l'état de conservation du site (fort impact destructeur des aménagements industriels), soit elle dépend de la nature de l'installation; les récipients traduiraient dans ce cas un choix en relation avec les gestes funéraires. En outre, la répartition des types par ensemble archéologique permet d'opposer la série des récipients issus du sol SL 303 à celle des excavations (E 246 et FS 229). La différence entre les formes représentées dans chaque contexte est sans doute fonctionnelle et conduit à interpréter le sol SL 303 comme un niveau de circulation, alors que E 246 et FS 229 se rapportent à des dépôts de vestiges de crémation. D'un point de vue archéologique, les faits E 246, FS 229 et SL 303 sont liés. La typologie de la céramique, ainsi que leur contenu (os humains brûlés), assurent la synchronie de E 246 et de FS 229. Le sol SL 303, proche, mais sans relation stratigraphique, appartient à la même phase chronoculturelle. Pour affirmer le lien archéologique entre les vestiges, un datage par le Centre de datation radiocarbone de Lyon sur os humains brûlés a été réalisé. Le résultat (Lyon- 2164 (Oxa) : 5080 +/- 30 BP), en adéquation avec la typologie céramique NMB, assure l'attribution chronoculturelle et l'association des récipients avec les os humains brûlés. Les vestiges de Sédallian illustrent la seule crémation certifiée pour le NMB. Le corpus céramique et la date sont en concordance pour attribuer cette occupation à une phase ancienne de ce groupe culturel, en position méridionale par rapport à la zone éponyme de la Franche-Comté et de la Bourgogne.

40|$|Both in its {{institutional}} {{range and}} in its penetration of financial markets, the microfinance sector in Bolivia rivals any in the world, and has played a major part in extracting the macro-economy from meltdown since the mid- 1980 s. We seek specifically to assess its impact on poverty, and do this through small-sample surveys on four microfinance institutions, two urban and two rural, using a range of poverty concepts: income (generated both through the borrower's enterprise and through the labour market), asset holdings and diversity, and various measures of vulnerability. All the institutions studied had, on balance, positive impacts on income and asset levels, with income impacts correlating negatively with income on account of poor households choosing to invest in low-risk, low-return assets. Microfinance may, however, augment vulnerability: average debt-service ratios of microfinance clients are disturbingly high, and if the coping mechanisms used by borrowers fail, borrowers may be {{forced out of the}} microfinance system, possibly resulting in decapitalisation and impoverishment. Poorer households are more restricted in their choice of coping strategy, and many as a consequence 'choose' coping strategies more likely to jeopardise their long-term income prospects, in particular asset sales and cuts in children's schooling. The more successful low-income borrowers are those who have <b>voluntary</b> savings <b>deposits</b> and do not rush into fixed capital purchases too early: collapse back into poverty is associated with multiple crises and the failure of one or more 'safety nets', in particular of one or more 'safety nets', in particular support from a member's solidarity group. The following actions appear to be promising for the further reduction of poverty in Bolivia: stronger efforts to mobilise rural savings, removal of lower limits on loan size, and the introduction of appropriate insurance mechanisms. In comparison with other anti-poverty measures, microfinance appears to be successful and relative cheap at reducing the poverty of those close to the poverty line, but ineffective, by comparison with labour-market and infrastructural measures, in reducing extreme poverty.

40|$|Since the {{droughts}} {{of earlier}} decades {{there have been}} great changes in Burkina Faso. Many arable and livestock farmers have had to take up other activities. However, since they have had no resources, they {{have been unable to}} support themselves and their families and were therefore not eligible for the usual types of credit. Now a small rural credit scheme employing simple procedures is enabling them to obtain loans. The scheme has been so successful that it has been extended. In North Yatenga the constant droughts have {{had a profound effect on}} the organization of the people, their activities and their production methods. As a result many of the farmers in the region are becoming poorer. During these drought years many of them have lost everything: their livestock, savings, implements and tools. For them the limiting factor now is available capital. It therefore appears essential to provide them with credit if the region is to be developed. Several attempts have been made at providing rural credit in the region but most have failed. Because of the low rate of repayment, the Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole (CNCA), which instituted the credit schemes, has had to terminate them. Credit for the poor An initiative of producers in Yatenga has led to a new credit scheme. Using the Grameen Bank type of mutual aid credit system which has been so successful in Bangladesh (see box), this scheme has been put set up by Sahel-Action, a Burkina Faso association, with CIRAD assistance in designing the scheme and seeking sources of funds. Currently the scheme is financed by the Caisse Francaise de Développement through the National Fund for Agricultural Cooperation (CNCA). The aim of the new scheme is to devise and institute a new form of credit suited to the economic situation in the region. A group of five people must first constitute a mutual aid fund which acts as collateral to enable its members to be granted loans. The scheme only collects <b>voluntary</b> <b>deposits</b> from its customers, which are entered in individual or community savings books, as well as individual contributions (5 % of loan received). These community fund contributions enable funds to be constituted for the beneficiaries and the latter to participate in the banking system capital. In a few years the customers will hold all the capital and will be able to influence the loan policy. The customers themselves choose the activities they wish to finance, e. g. crops, livestock, crafts and small retailing, and loans are granted provided that the activities are expected to be profitable. The methods of repayment depend on the production system. Consequently, there are many weekly instalments but these constitute only about 2 % of the overall sum. The guarantee for repayment is assured by the sense of community solidarity, which is very strong in an African context. The fear of social rejection and family disgrace is an incentive which is ultimately more reliable than a material guarantee, and the frequent low repayments are well-suited to the rather modest but regular incomes of the customers. Every month each group member in rotation has the right to a loan. Management is simplified as far as possible in order to reduce operating costs and to enable borrowers to manage the system themselves. A computer programme has been developed to enable the village officials responsible for managing the loans to follow all fund movements easily; they only intervene when a repayment has not been made. Organization of credit is based on the traditional organization of the district and the village and local banks form the partner of these village organizations. A satisfactory experiment Between July 1988 and July 1992 some 6, 500 loans of 5, 000 to 50, 000 CFA francs were granted among over 70 villages. The loans were initially very small but they have gradually increased with the growing confidence resulting from a better understanding of the scheme. The repayment rate has been 98 %. Many farmers say that they were only able to survive in the region because of being able to engage in activities which required credit. Without this income they would have had to leave. The women, who are very much affected by the scheme, say that credit enables them to become involved in the economy in the same way as the men. Some women have formed groups to take responsibility for the supply of cereals. Since 1991 the scheme has been extended to three other provinces in Burkina Faso and now similar schemes are being proposed in Niger, Indonesia and Madagascar. Since the droughts of earlier decades there have been great changes in Burkina Faso. Many arable and livestock farmers have had to take up other activities.
