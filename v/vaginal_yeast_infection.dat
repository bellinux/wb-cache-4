25|$|BV {{is caused}} by an {{imbalance}} of the naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. There {{is a change in}} {{the most common type of}} bacteria and a hundred to thousandfold increase in total numbers of bacteria present. Typically, bacteria other than Lactobacilli become more common. Risk factors include douching, new or multiple sex partners, antibiotics, and using an intrauterine device, among others. However, it is not considered a sexually transmitted infection. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms, and may be verified by testing the vaginal discharge and finding a higher than normal vaginal pH, and large numbers of bacteria. BV is often confused with a <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection</b> or infection with Trichomonas.|$|E
25|$|The {{successful}} {{partnership between}} Hazen in New York City and Brown in Albany {{was due in}} part to the efficiency of the United States Postal Service in the 1940s. In her New York City laboratory, Hazen cultured organisms found in soil samples and tested their ability to fight against two fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus responsible for the chronic disease cryptococcosis, which affects lungs, skin, and other body parts like the central nervous system, and Candida albicans, which causes candidiasis, which can be minor in some cases (e.g. a <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection),</b> or a serious infection in patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. If she found such promising antifungal activity in a particular culture, she would mail it to Brown in a mason jar.|$|E
40|$|Do probiotics {{decrease}} the incidence {{and symptoms of}} recurrent <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections?</b> Evidence-Based Answer: Maybe.

25|$|For infants: {{in cases}} {{that are related to}} fungal infection, such as Tinea capitis, doctors may {{recommend}} a treatment application of clotrimazole (commonly prescribed for jock itch or athlete's foot) or miconazole (commonly prescribed for <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections).</b>|$|R

2500|$|Vaginitis is the {{disruption}} of the healthy vaginal microbiota. The vaginal microbiota consists of those organisms which generally do not cause symptoms, infections, and results in good pregnancy outcomes, and is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species.

50|$|For <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection</b> in pregnancy, topical {{imidazole}} or triazole antifungals {{are considered}} the therapy of choice owing to available safety data. Systemic absorption of these topical formulations is minimal, posing little risk of transplacental transfer.

50|$|Probiotics (either as pills or as yogurt) do {{not appear}} to {{decrease}} the rate of occurrence of <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections.</b> No benefit has been found for active infections.

40|$|The {{increased}} number of <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections</b> {{in the past few}} years has been a disturbing trend, and the scientific community has been searching for its etiology. Several theories have been put forth to explain the apparent increase. First, the recent widespread availability of low-dosage, azole-based over-the-counter antifungal medications for <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections</b> encourages women to self-diagnose and treat, and women may be misdiagnosing themselves. Their vaginitis may be caused by bacteria, parasites or may be a symptom of another underlying health condition. As a result, they may be unnecessarily and chronically expose themselves to antifungal medications and encourage fungal resistance. Second, medical technology has increased the life span of seriously immune compromised individuals, yet these individuals are frequently plagued by opportunistic fungal infections. Long-term and intense azole-based antifungal treatment has been linked to an increase in resistant Candida and non-Candida species. Thus, the future of limiting antifungal resistance lies in identifying the factors promoting resistance and implementing policies to prevent it...|$|R
50|$|Though effective, {{antibiotics}} are {{not recommended}} for prevention of TD in most situations {{because of the risk}} of allergy or adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of preventive antibiotics may decrease effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection develop subsequently. Antibiotics can also cause <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections,</b> or overgrowth of the bacterium Clostridium difficile, leading to pseudomembranous colitis and its associated severe, unrelenting diarrhea.|$|R
50|$|Up to 40% {{of women}} seek {{alternatives}} to treat <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection.</b> Example products are herbal preparations, probiotics and vaginal acidifying agents.

However, the effectiveness of such treatments has not received much study.|$|E
50|$|For most {{purposes}} sitz baths {{with water}} are sufficient, though some people {{prefer to use}} saline water or water mixed with baking soda or mustard.

5000|$|Sulfanilamide (also spelled sulphanilamide) is a sulfonamide antibacterial. Chemically, it is {{an organic}} {{compound}} consisting of an aniline derivatized with a sulfonamide group.

50|$|During pregnancy, vaginal {{discharge}} volume increases {{as a result}} of the body's increased levels of estrogen and progesterone. The discharge is usually white or slightly gray, and may have a musty smell. The normal discharge of pregnancy does not contain blood or cause itching. The pH of the {{vaginal discharge}} in pregnancy tends to be more acidic than normal due to increased production of lactic acid. This acidic environment helps to provide protection from many infections, though conversely it also makes women more susceptible to <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections.</b>|$|R
50|$|Terconazole is an {{antifungal}} drug used {{to treat}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection.</b> It comes as a lotion or a suppository and disrupts the biosynthesis of fats in a yeast cell.

50|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection,</b> {{also known}} as candidal {{vulvovaginitis}} and vaginal thrush, is excessive growth of yeast in the vagina that results in irritation. The most common symptom is vaginal itching, which may be severe. Other symptoms include burning with urination, white and thick vaginal discharge that typically does not smell bad, pain with sex, and redness around the vagina. Symptoms often worsen just before a woman's period.|$|E
50|$|Vaginal yeast {{infections are}} {{typically}} treated with topical antifungal agents. A one-time dose of fluconazole is 90% effective in treating a <b>vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infection.</b> For severe nonrecurring cases, several doses of fluconazole is recommended. Local treatment may include vaginal suppositories or medicated douches. Other types of yeast infections require different dosing. Gentian violet {{can be used}} for thrush in breastfeeding babies. C. albicans can develop resistance to fluconazole, this being more of an issue in those with HIV/AIDS who are often treated with multiple courses of fluconazole for recurrent oral infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vaginal</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>infections</b> {{are due to}} {{excessive}} growth of Candida. These yeast are normally present in the vagina in small numbers. It is not classified as a sexually transmitted infection; however, it may occur more often in those who are frequently sexually active. Risk factors include taking antibiotics, pregnancy, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. Eating a diet high in simple sugar may also play a role. Tight clothing, type of underwear, and personal hygiene {{do not appear to}} be factors. Diagnosis is by testing a sample of vaginal discharge. As symptoms are similar to that of the sexually transmitted infections, chlamydia and gonorrhea, testing may be recommended.|$|R
