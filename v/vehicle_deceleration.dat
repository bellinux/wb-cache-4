Important results are the deformations (for example, steering wheel intrusions) of the occupant space (driver, passengers) and the decelerations (for example, head acceleration) felt by them, which must fall below threshold values fixed in legal car safety regulations. To model real crash tests, today's crash simulations include virtual models of crash test dummies and of passive safety devices (seat belts, airbags, shock absorbing dash boards, etc.).

5000|$|Kerner {{explains}} {{the nature of}} the F → S phase transitions by a competition of [...] "speed adaptation" [...] and [...] "over-acceleration". Speed adaptation is defined as the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration</b> to the speed of a slower moving preceding vehicle. Over-acceleration is defined as the vehicle acceleration occurring even if the preceding vehicle does not drive faster than the vehicle and the preceding vehicle additionally does not accelerate. In Kerner’s theory, the probability of over-acceleration is a discontinuous function of the vehicle speed: At the same vehicle density, probability of over-acceleration in free flow is greater than in synchronized flow. When within a local speed disturbance speed adaptation is stronger than over-acceleration, an F → S phase transition occurs. Otherwise, when over-acceleration is stronger than speed adaptation the initial disturbance decays over time. Within a region of synchronized flow, a strong over-acceleration is responsible for a return transition from synchronized flow to free flow (S → F transition).|$|E
50|$|Brakes on a {{race car}} are {{imperative}} in slowing and stopping the car at precise times and wear quickly depending on the road or track on which the car is being raced, how many laps are being run, track conditions due to weather, and how many caution runs require more braking. There are three variables to consider in racing: brake pedal displacement, brake pedal force, and <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration.</b> Various combinations of these variables work together to determine the stiffness, sensitivity, and pedal force of the brakes. When using the brakes effectively, the driver must go through a buildup phase and end with a modulating phase. These phases include attaining maximum deceleration and modulating the brake pressure. Brake performance is measured in bite and consistency. Bite happens when the driver first applies the brakes {{and they have not}} warmed up to the correct temperature to operate efficiently. Consistency is measured in how consistent the friction is during the entire time of braking. These two measurements determine the wear of the brakes.|$|E

Historically, safety monitoring has typically been carried out using accident data, though given the rarity of such events it is difficult to quickly detect change in accident risk at a particular site.

The method developed in this paper uses <b>vehicle</b> speeds and <b>decelerations</b> collected using standard in-situ loops and tubes, to determine conflicts using <b>vehicle</b> <b>decelerations</b> and to assess the possibility of automatic safety monitoring at Pelican crossings. Information on signal settings, driver crossing behaviour, pedestrian crossing behaviour and delays, and pedestrian-vehicle conflicts was collected synchronously through a combination of direct observation, video analysis, and analysis of output from tube and loop detectors.

Present study aims to analyze the deceleration behaviour of different vehicles types (like truck, car, motorized two and three-wheeler) on Nagpur-Mumbai Express Highway at Wardha, India. Drivers were asked to decelerate their vehicles from their maximum speed to zero speed in shortest time and their speed profiles are collected using Global Positioning System.

Following training, the trainee group experienced enhanced postural stability during specific phases of the task. In terms of vehicle kinematics, the main adaptation to training was that trained drivers reduced the extent to which they experienced <b>vehicle</b> <b>decelerations</b> during rapid turning compared to controls. Such a strategy may confer a safety benefit due to the increased risks associated with simultaneous braking while turning during an evasive manoeuvre. The newly learned strategy was consistent with the strategy used by a group of highly skilled drivers (driving instructors).

This paper reports three driving simulator experiments, designed to investigate {{the existence of the}} Psychological Refractory Period in the driving context and its effect on driver performance. The first two studies demonstrate that the effect is present when one or two surrogate in-vehicle tasks are presented in close temporal proximity to a lead vehicle braking event.

The new opportunities offered by mechatronics push R&D towards active safety systems, such as antilock braking system (ABS), traction control system (TCS), and electronic stability control (ESC).

40|$|Understanding driver {{behavior}} {{is important for}} the development of many applications such as microscopic traffic simulation models and advanced driver assistance systems. The car-following process is an important phase of driving behavior and takes place when a driver follows a lead vehicle and tries to maintain distance and relative speed within an acceptable range. A key to improving knowledge of {{driver behavior}} during this process is determining the information perceived by drivers that could influence their decisions. It has been believed for some time that the main kinematic parameters that affect driver judgment in car following are the relative speed, the distance separation, and the absolute speed. The research described investigated whether drivers are also able to use information on the lead <b>vehicle's</b> <b>deceleration</b> or acceleration during the car-following process through experimental validation of current car-following hypotheses. For this research, an instrumented vehicle was used to collect a large database of car-following time sequences, the analysis of which showed strong evidence that drivers are able to perceive information such as the deceleration or acceleration of the vehicle being followed, although no empirical relationship was determined. An example demonstrating the importance of such perception shows that modeling a driver trying to avoid a collision with a lead vehicle would lose 20 % of its fit accuracy if the lead-vehicle acceleration state were not considered...|$|R

It’ll be possible to realize rigid measures to obtain a reduction in the accident rate without penalizing more transport acts. These quantitative evaluations will affect road design in the future. Accidents caused from skidding between wheels and pavement are very frequent with low traffic flow: possible consequences are bumps against other vehicles or obstacles to the margins of the road (e. g. crash barrier, retaining or gallery walls) and run off road. Accidents due to hazardous maneuvers (overtaking), and accidents on crossing start when traffic flow increases (medium flow).
