40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that <b>Verlukast</b> is converted to <b>Verlukast</b> dihydrodiol in microsomes from 9 -naphthofIavone (BNF) -treated, but not uninduced Swiss Webster mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. We have examined the involvement of CYPIAI in this reaction in more detail. It is concluded that this reaction is catalyzed exclusively by CYP 1 AI in rats, mice, and humans based on the following criteria: 1) the epoxidation of <b>Verlukast</b> is negligible in uninduced rats, which express CYP 1 A 2 but not CYP 1 AI; 2) <b>Verlukast</b> epoxidation is highly inducible by BNF treatment(60 - to 200 -fold); 3) <b>Verlukast</b> epoxidation in BNF-treated rat microsomes was inhibited by a-naphthoflavone (ANF) treatment, indicating that this activity was mediated by the CYPIA subfamily; 4) > 95 % of <b>Verlukast</b> epoxidation in BNF-treated rat microsomes was inhibited by antibodies raised against CYP 1 A 1; and 5) <b>Verlukast</b> was epoxidlzed by human CYP 1 A 1 but not CYP 1 A 2. Thus, <b>Verlukast</b> epoxidation appears to be specific for rat, mouse...|$|E
40|$|The safety, {{tolerability}} and bronchodilator {{properties of}} inhaled <b>verlukast</b> (MK- 0679), a new potent and selective LTD 4 -receptor antagonist, were studied in 12 asthmatic subjects {{with more than}} 15 % increase in FEV 1 after salbutamol inhalation. On three separate study days the patients inhaled placebo, <b>verlukast</b> 2 mg and <b>verlukast</b> 8 mg from a metered dose inhaler according to a randomized, double-blind, cross-over allocation schedule. Pulmonary function and tolerability were assessed regularly and after 8 h a second dose of test drug was inhaled. Thirty minutes later a beta 2 -agonist dose-response curve was performed by inhaling salbutamol in cumulative doses of 200, 400 and 800 micrograms. <b>Verlukast</b> (8 mg) caused significant improvement in mean FEV 1 from 1. 5 through 8 h after inhalation as compared to placebo (P less than 0. 05). The maximum change in FEV 1 occurred at 2 h after inhalation with mean percent increases above baseline of 3. 5, 7. 7, and 9. 2 % after placebo, <b>verlukast</b> 2 mg and 8 mg, respectively. The bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol was significantly larger after <b>verlukast</b> 8 mg than after placebo pretreatment (P less than 0. 05), whereas <b>verlukast</b> 2 mg afforded no additive bronchodilator effect. We conclude that inhalation of the LTD 4 -antagonist <b>verlukast</b> induces modest but significant bronchodilatation and may be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} asthma. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of dose and {{food on the}} pharmacokinetic profile of orally administered <b>verlukast,</b> a leukotriene D 4 receptor antagonist, was investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers. This was an open, four-period, single dose, randomised, crossover design including the following doses: one 75 mg tablet, one 250 mg tablet, 500 mg (2 x 250 mg) and 500 mg immediately following a standard meal. There were dose-related increases in the AUC, although after 500 mg <b>verlukast</b> this was disproportionately greater than with 75 mg (P = 0. 04). Similarly, there were dose-related increases in C(max). No differences were observed in the t(max) between treatments. With respect to food, there was a 22 % decrease (P = 0. 02) in C(max) after 500 mg, and the AUC was 13 % less (P = 0. 052). The differences in the plasma concentration profiles betweeen fasted and fed states are {{not considered to be}} of clinical importance...|$|E
