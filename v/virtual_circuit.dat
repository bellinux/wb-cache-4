25|$|Onion routing is {{implemented}} by encryption {{in the application}} layer of a communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. Tor encrypts the data, including the next node destination IP address, multiple times and sends it through a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays. Each relay decrypts a layer of encryption to reveal only the next relay in the circuit in order to pass the remaining encrypted data on to it. The final relay decrypts the innermost layer of encryption and sends the original data to its destination without revealing, or even knowing, the source IP address. Because the routing of the communication is partly concealed at every hop in the Tor circuit, this method eliminates any single {{point at which the}} communicating peers can be determined through network surveillance that relies upon knowing its source and destination.|$|E

5000|$|X.25 {{supports}} {{two types}} of <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>virtual</b> calls (VC) and permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> (PVC). <b>Virtual</b> calls are established on an as-needed basis. For example, a VC is established when a call is placed and torn down after the call is complete. VCs are established through a call establishment and clearing procedure. On the other hand, permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> are preconfigured into the network. [...] PVCs are seldom torn down and thus provide a dedicated connection between end points.|$|R
50|$|ATM {{can build}} <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> and <b>virtual</b> paths either statically or dynamically. Static <b>circuits</b> (permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> or PVCs) or paths (permanent virtual paths or PVPs) {{require that the}} circuit is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} segments, one for each pair of interfaces through which it passes.|$|R
50|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (VC) is a {{means of}} {{transporting}} data over a packet switched computer network {{in such a way that}} it appears as though there is a dedicated physical layer link between the source and destination end systems of this data. The term <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> is synonymous with virtual connection and virtual channel. Before a connection or <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the interconnecting network. After that, a bit stream or byte stream may be delivered between the nodes; hence, a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> protocol allows higher level protocols to avoid dealing with the division of data into segments, packets, or frames.|$|E
50|$|A {{permanent}} <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (PVC) is a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> {{established for}} repeated/continuous use between the same DTE. In a PVC, the long-term association {{is identical to}} the data transfer phase of a virtual call. Permanent virtual circuits eliminate the need for repeated call set-up and clearing.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternate}} {{network configuration}} to <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> is datagram.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{of the use of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> comes with the ability to use them as a multiplexing layer, allowing different services (such as voice, frame relay, n* 64 channels, IP). The VPI is useful for reducing the switching table of some <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> which have common paths.|$|R
50|$|Datagram packet {{switching}} is also called connectionless networking because no connections are established. Technologies such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) create <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> {{on top of}} datagram networks. <b>Virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> are especially useful in building robust failover mechanisms and allocating bandwidth for delay-sensitive applications.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> {{communication}} resembles circuit switching, {{since both}} are connection oriented, meaning that {{in both cases}} data is delivered in correct order, and signalling overhead is required during a connection establishment phase.

5000|$|With <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> multiplexing, the {{communicating}} hosts {{agree to}} send only one packets {{belonging to a}} single high-level protocol on any given ATM <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit,</b> and multiple virtual circuits {{may need to be}} set up. It has the advantage of not requiring additional protocol-identifying information in a packet, which minimizes the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer, nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. This reduction in overhead tends to further improve efficiency (e.g., an IPv4 datagram containing a TCP ACK-only packet with neither IP nor TCP options exactly fits into a single ATM cell). The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit,</b> customers try to avoid using multiple circuits because it adds unnecessary cost.|$|E

5000|$|A network must {{establish}} a connection before two parties can send cells to each other. In ATM {{this is called}} a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (VC). It can be a permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (PVC), which is created administratively on the end points, or a switched <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (SVC), which is created as needed by the communicating parties. SVC creation is managed by signaling, in which the requesting party indicates the address of the receiving party, the type of service requested, and whatever traffic parameters may be applicable to the selected service.

ESnet is a high-speed network serving thousands of Department of Energy scientists and collaborators worldwide. OSCARS utilizes the Web services model and standards to implement communication with the system and between domains, and for authentication, authorization, and auditing (AAA). The management and operation of end-to-end <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> within the network is done at the layer 3 network level. Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) are used to create the <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> or Label Switched Paths (LSP’s).
