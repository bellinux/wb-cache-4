25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that posaconazole has in vitro {{activity}} similar to that of amphotericin B and itraconazole; therefore, it shows promise as an alternative therapy. However, <b>voriconazole</b> susceptibility varies. Because the correlation between in vitro data and clinical response has not been demonstrated, there is insufficient evidence to recommend either posaconazole or <b>voriconazole</b> for treatment of sporotrichosis at this time.|$|E
25|$|This species shows {{elevated}} {{resistance to}} antifungal drugs; however, four classes of drugs (itraconazole (a triazole), <b>voriconazole,</b> caspofungin and amphotericin B) demonstrate fungicidal effectiveness {{that is most}} pronounced in combination. One promising regimen combines <b>voriconazole</b> and caspofungin. Although disseminated infection carries a high mortality rate, the response of skin to treatment varies depending {{on the degree of}} drug susceptibility exhibited by the particular strain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Voriconazole,</b> (trade name Vfend) is a {{triazole}} antifungal medication used {{to treat}} and prevent invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 a small {{outbreak}} of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in North Carolina hospitals, involving five women who received steroid injections for pain management. In one of women the infection wasn't evident until 152 days after injection of the contaminated solution. Isolates from these patients were {{found by the}} FDA to be susceptible to all of <b>voriconazole,</b> itraconazole, and amphotericin B. In one patient the infection caused sacroiliitis, while the remaining four developed meningitis. Meningitis eventually caused death in one patient, while <b>voriconazole</b> was successful in treating infection in the four other patients. The outbreak was traced back to a single compounding pharmacy, which was found by the FDA to have inadequately controlled for sterility of its products.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{antifungal}} susceptibility {{tests of}} the entire genus Apophysomyces have revealed that amphotericin B and posaconazole are the most effective against A. variabilis infections when compared to itraconazole, ravuconazole, and <b>voriconazole.</b> Testing data has also showed that caspofungin and anidulafungin are inactive antifungal agents against all strains of the genus Apophysomyces.|$|E
25|$|Clinical infections due to Sporobolomyces salmonicolor {{are rare}} {{and there are}} {{currently}} no standard therapies for infection. Treatment with amphotericin B alone, and amphotericin B followed by either ketoconazole or fluconazole have been successful. In one case of endophthalmitis (mentioned in case report below), treatment with <b>voriconazole</b> was likewise successful. A small number of isolates however demonstrate resistance to fluconazole and micafungin.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, {{another group}} of azoles is the triazoles, which {{includes}} fluconazole, itraconazole, and <b>voriconazole.</b> The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles {{have been shown to}} have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, several {{compounds}} (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where {{shown to}} effectively inhibit {{the growth of}} P.destructans including benzalkonium chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, pyrithione zinc and sulconazole. The same study showed that P.destructans was sensitive to Amphotericin B, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and <b>voriconazole,</b> while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and <b>voriconazole,</b> may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|A 31-year-old woman {{went to her}} {{physician}} {{because of}} decreased vision in her left eye. The left eye showed fibrinous exudates, posterior synechiae and vitritis. After a vitreous sample {{was sent to the}} lab for identification, the yeast was identified as Sporobolomyces salmonicolor. The recommended treatment was <b>voriconazole</b> 200mg, twice a day for two months. Improvement in the left eye was seen within a week. Exposure to mould and yeast within a military hospital in Finland lead to an outbreak of asthma, alveolitis and rhinitis. The building was known to have severe water and mould damage. After performing inhalation provocation tests, four cases of asthma caused by Sporobolomyces salmonicolor were reported. An additional seven workers were diagnosed with rhinitis. All seven individuals with rhinitis acted positively in nasal S.salmonicolor provocation tests. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor was recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid of three patients in a hospital, one of whom was a kidney transplant recipient. Heavy growth of S.salmonicolor was recovered from utility rooms on the floors of each patient, and from the hospital rooms of two patients. It was suggested that this particular case was most likely caused by contamination. During the collection process, S.salmonicolor was most likely introduced into the CSF as a contaminant.|$|E
2500|$|A {{diagnosis}} of E. dermatitidis {{infection of the}} CNS can only be reliably achieved following biopsy. For systemic infections there are few treatment options, and E. dermatitidis is described as [...] "notoriously resistant" [...] to antifungal drugs. During the North Carolina outbreak, treatment with <b>voriconazole</b> was effective in four out of the five patients, and all of <b>voriconazole,</b> itraconazole, and amphotericin B {{were found to be}} effective in vitro. Terbinafine has also been found to be effective in vitro, and combinations of antifungal drugs can have a synergistic effect against E. dermatitidis. A 2012 article found that of reported cases, 44% of patients responded to amphotericin B treatment, 50% responded to <b>voriconazole</b> treatment, and 71.4% responded to itraconazole therapy.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Voriconazole</b> is used {{to treat}} {{invasive}} aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients, including people undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), who have [...] hematologic cancers or who undergo organ transplants.|$|E
2500|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{treatments of}} infections caused by Exserohilum {{are still very}} scarce. Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with amphotericin B, itraconazole and/or <b>voriconazole.</b> Although E. rostratum is sensitive to amphotericin B, a common antifungal agent, the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent drug repurposing screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and lanoconazole as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints. It {{has also been shown}} to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has potential as a treatment for CNS infections as well, though not reaching levels as high as the azoles.|$|E
2500|$|On the whole, oral {{fluconazole}} and intravenous amphotericin B {{are used}} in progressive or disseminated disease, or in immunocompromised individuals. Amphotericin B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including itraconazole or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. Itraconazole is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and <b>voriconazole</b> have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis. [...] Because the symptoms of valley fever are similar to the common flu and other respiratory diseases, it is important for public health professionals {{to be aware of the}} rise of valley fever and the specifics of diagnosis. [...] Greyhound dogs often get valley fever as well, and their treatment regimen involves 6–12 months of Ketoconazole, to be taken with food.|$|E

50|$|Posaconazole {{has been}} {{approved}} by the European Commission as a salvage therapy for refractory coccidioidomycosis. Clinical trials are now ongoing for further evaluation. <b>Voriconazole</b> is also being studied in salvage therapy for refractory cases. A case report indicated that <b>voriconazole</b> in combination with amphotericin B as salvage therapy for disseminated coccidioidomycosis was successful.|$|E
