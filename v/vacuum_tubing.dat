In new construction, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> is usually installed during a [...] "rough-in" [...] phase once the building interior framing is complete, after other in-wall utilities (e.g. plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.), and just before drywall, paneling, or other surface finishes are installed. Strictly speaking, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> should probably be installed before cabling (for electric power, telephone, LAN, etc.), since routing of wiring is usually less constrained than tubing. In a similar manner to plumbing and electrical fixtures, the vacuum inlet fittings and final connections are installed in a finish phase, after the wall finishing is complete.|$|E

40|$|<b>Vacuum</b> {{insulated}} <b>tubing</b> (VIT) is a high-performance, double-walled tubular {{product that}} provides temperature isolation {{in response to}} various production challenges such as permafrost issues and high-viscosity oil. VIT maintains wellbore temperatures to prevent hydrate formation near the mudline which can impede a cold startup. VIT helps maintain lower viscosity levels, reducing the need for artificial lift and increasing total ultimate recovery. Some well test operations involve alternate periods of production and shut-in. When deepwater operations are involved, VIT helps prevent paraffin and hydrating problems...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the {{invention}} of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thinwall <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> made the central vacuum system more affordable in the United States.

50|$|Retrofitting of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> in {{existing}} structures can be surprisingly straight forward or more difficult, {{depending on the}} anatomy of the building. A home remodeling project can generate large amounts of irritating plaster dust and other demolition and construction dirt. Installing a central vacuum early in the project makes ongoing cleanup much easier, especially {{if it is a}} filterless true cyclonic unit, which can inhale even abrasive or sharp construction debris without concerns about bag clogging or breakage.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, {{the owner}} of a new house under {{construction}} may choose to pre-install <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> and control wiring in the walls, but to defer purchase of the central unit, hose, and tools to reduce cash flow requirements. Installing tubing and wiring for a central vacuum in new construction is definitely much easier if done before the drywall and other wall finishes. The short-term cost savings of deferring full system completion should be weighed against the great convenience of having a functional vacuum system, especially during the commissioning and move-in period, which generate more than the usual amount of debris to be cleaned up.|$|E

40|$|We present initial {{results of}} in situ 14 C system blank and {{calibration}} sample measurements obtained using the in situ 14 C extraction scheme {{developed at the}} University of Cologne. The 14 C extraction scheme specifically exploits the phase transformation of quartz to cristobalite in order to quantitatively extract the carbon as CO 2 and follows a scheme that is different to that of existing extraction systems. Features are offline furnace extraction, single pass catalytic oxidation using mixed copper (I,II) oxide as catalyst, the use of UHV-compatible components and of <b>vacuum</b> annealed copper <b>tubing.</b> The design allows a relatively rapid sample throughput - two samples per day {{as opposed to the}} current 2 days per sample that can be done on other lines - and can accommodate samples ranging between 0. 5 and 4 g of clean quartz. Following extraction and cleaning, the CO 2 gas is measured using the gas ion source of the MICADAS AMS facility at ETH Zurich. The extraction system yields low systems blanks (10 + 16 /− 10 x 103 atoms 14 C, ± 1 σ) and the initial results indicate that further improvements are achievable. Measurements of the CRONUS-A standard sample show a good reproducibility and results are consistent with published values. We also present the first in situ 14 C results for the CRONUS-R standard material...|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} neon's discovery, neon tubes {{were used}} as scientific instruments and novelties. However, the scarcity of purified neon gas precluded its prompt application for electrical gas-discharge lighting {{along the lines of}} Moore tubes, which used more common nitrogen or carbon dioxide as the working gas, and enjoyed some commercial success in the US in the early 1900s. After 1902, Georges Claude's company in France, Air Liquide, began producing industrial quantities of neon as a byproduct of the air liquefaction business. From December 3-18, 1910, Claude demonstrated two large (12 m long), bright red neon tubes at the Paris Motor Show.These neon tubes were essentially in their contemporary form. [...] The range of outer diameters for the glass tubing used in neon lighting is 9 to 25 mm; with standard electrical equipment, the tubes can be as long as 30 m.

50|$|A {{principal}} concern when {{designing a}} central vacuum system is avoiding situations {{likely to cause}} clogging of the tubing with debris such as toothpicks, hairpins, needles, or similar-shaped objects. The most important safeguard is at the vacuum inlets, which are intentionally designed with a tighter radius of curvature than any other bends in the system. This is done to ensure that if any vacuumed debris becomes stuck, it will jam right at the inlet, where it is easiest to discover and to remove. Well-designed central <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> rarely or never clogs unless severely abused (e.g. vacuuming wet plaster, wet flour, or other sticky substances).|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} for storing vacuum hose is the [...] "Hide-A-Hose" [...] system, which uses suction {{to draw the}} hose into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> in the wall for storage. Hose lengths used are typically 30/40/50 ft (9/12/15 m). Successful installation of such systems requires special fittings, and careful design and workmanship, to ensure smooth hose retraction into the tubing for storage. A scaled-down 10-foot (3 m) version (such as [...] "Spot by Vroom") is available for quick cleaning in locations such as mud rooms and laundry rooms. The original [...] "Vroom" [...] system, which is still available, uses suction to operate a cabinet-mounted hose reel with a 24 ft (7.3 m) hose, rather than storing the hose within the wall tubing.|$|E
5000|$|Routing {{and design}} of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> layout {{is very similar to}} drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing, with the {{exception}} that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required. Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages. Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal [...] "running start". In some jurisdictions, fire code regulations require that an intumescent firestop collar be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a firewall. If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external pipe insulation to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} active removal of silicone oil with low and high viscosity through a 23 -gauge transconjunctival cannula using an external vacuum pump. METHODS: This study was conducted as a prospective, interventional case series. A total of 22 eyes of 21 patients [1000 centistokes (cSt) : 17 eyes, 5700 cSt: 5 eyes] were included in this study. All patients underwent active silicone oil removal via the entire lumen of a 23 -gauge microcannula with suction pressure of a 650 - 700 mm Hg vacuum using an external <b>vacuum</b> pump. A <b>tubing</b> adaptor from the Total Plus Pak® (Alcon, Fort Worth, USA) was used to join the microcannula and silicone vacuum tube connected to an external vacuum pump. Main outcome measures were mean removal time, changes of intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity, and intraoperative and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Mean removal time (min) was 1. 49 ± 0. 43 for 1000 cSt and 7. 12 ± 1. 27 for 5700 cSt. The IOP was 18. 57 ± 7. 48 mm Hg at baseline, 11. 68 ± 4. 55 mm Hg at day 1 postoperatively (P< 0. 001), and 15. 95 ± 4. 92, 16. 82 ± 3. 81, 17. 41 ± 3. 50, and 17. 09 ± 3. 01 mm Hg after one week, one month, three months, and six months, respectively. All patients showed improved or stabilized visual acuity. There was no occurrence of intraoperative or postoperative complications during the follow up period. CONCLUSION: This technique for active removal of silicone oil through a 23 -gauge cannula using an external vacuum pump is fast, effective, and safe {{as well as economical}} for silicone oil with both low and high viscosity in all eyes with pseudophakia, aphakia, or phakia. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} is {{described}} the application of esr spectroscopy {{to the study of}} novel transient radical-anions formed by the addition of the ammoniated electron to both anions and neutral molecules at 200 K. The apparatus used employs the multicapillary mixing chamber described by earlier workers in this field 48 {{with the addition of a}} low temperature modification to the main flow system. Prior to mixing, solutions of sodium and the substrate in liquid ammonia are cooled to temperatures in the range = 200 to 240 K by passing them through a cryostat comprising ca. 2 m of 6 mm i. d. glass tubing immersed in a methanol/C 02 bath set slightly below the required temperature. The heat capacity of the bath is sufficient to prevent any appreciable heating « 1 ° K) while the esr spectrum is recorded. The temperature of the solutions is maintained during transference to the multicapillary mixer by means of <b>vacuum</b> jacketed <b>tubing.</b> Chapter 5 describes the application of this technique to a series of ring- and N-substituted benzamides and thiobenzamides. In general, ring-substituted benzamides exist in their mono-ionised form in liquid ammonia and electron attachment to these results in the formation of the radical-dianions ArCONH 2 -. These radical-dianions show restricted rotation about the bond from the ring to the amide group and give rise to esr spectra of low symmetry. N-methyl- and 2 -fluoro- benzamides showed anomalous behaviour in that their esr spectra afford couplings from a full complement of magnetic nuclei, i. e. electron attachment takes place to the unionised molecules. The N,N-dimethyl- substituted benzamides, having no acidic amide protons, give rise to their corresponding radical-anions ArCONH(Me) 2 ":'"and these, unlike the ring-substituted compounds, afford highly symmetric spectra. HO calculations are employed to facilitate the assignment of coupling constants to particular nuclei; the assymetry of the spin density distribution being simulated by application of the so-called S effect. A value of Qc = - 2 · 75 ± 0 · 24 mT is derived for the a-IT-interaction parameter for the benzamide ring. Benzamide radical-anions in general have half-lives of the order of ms. N,N-dimethylbenzamide is unique in that it is stable for up to an hour at 200 K and can be observed by a conventional static reduction technique. Ethylene itself proves resistant to reduction by solutions of alkali metals in liquid ammonia but substitution in this molecule by groups such as carboxy-, acetyl-, or vinyl- have an activating effect. Chapters 6 and 7 describe the preparation and characterisation by esr spectroscopy of a series of partially reduced a/S-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Chapter 6 is devoted to the ketyls of acyclic and cyclic a/S-unsaturated ketones, and Chapter 7 to the radical-anions of a,ß-unsaturated acids, esters and nitriles. The open-chain ketyls are found to exist, like the neutral molecules, as s-cis and s-trans conformers. A value,of - 2 · 45 mT has been derived for the õ‖-interaction parameter for the vinyl protons. Vaules of "experimental" spin densities are compared with those derived from simple MO theory, to facilitate the assignrnent of coupling constants. The simple MO theory is modified to distinguish between s-cis and s-trans conformations. Assignment of coupling constants in the series of cyclic ketyls derived from 2 -cyclo- hexenone straightforward. The couplings show that in most cases the ketyls exist in conformations with lifetimes generally greater than 10 - 6 s and that the methylene protons are either in almost pure axial or equatorial positions. The ketyl of 2 -cyclopentenone is planar. The esr spectrum of the 2 -cyclohexenone ketyl shows modulation of certain hyper fine couplings due to ring inversion occuring during the time of the esr experiment with an activation energy of 23 - 59 kJ mol-I. Inclusion of·a proton source in the reduction medium of 3, 5, 5 -trimethyl- 2 -cyclohexenone enables the neutral radical to be observed. Static reduction tends to lead to the formation of semidiones arising through oxidation of the radical-anions. Ionisation of the a,ß-unsaturated acids in liquid ammonia results in the s-cis and s-trans isomers becoming equivalent and single species corresponding to [R 1 R 2 C = CR 3 C 02] 2 are observed in the flow system. These radical-anions are short lived and give rise to esr spectra of low intensity. The radical-anion of fumaric acid was observed by reduction of acetylenedicarboxylic acid. Partial. reduction of a,ß-unsaturated esters yields somewhat more stable radical-anions which show s-cis and s-trans conformations. Radical-anions of maleic and fumaric esters are) found to isomerise and give rise to several isomeric and conformeric species. Reduction of ethyl propiolate gives rise not only to its own radical-anion but also to that of ethyl acrylate as a secondary species. The high-field spectral lines of the former compound are of enhanced intensity, probably through the agency of Chemically Induced Dynamic Electron Polarisation (CIDEP). ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Glass dust waste creates chronic {{environmental}} problems, mainly {{due to the}} inconsistency {{of waste}} glass streams. Glass is widely used in our lives through manufactured products such as sheet glass, bottles, glassware, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing.</b> Glass is an ideal material for recycling. The use of recycled glass helps in energy saving. The increasing awareness of glass recycling speeds up inspections {{on the use of}} waste glass with different forms in various fields. One of its significant contributions is to the construction field where the waste glass was reused for concrete production. The properties of concretes containing glass dust waste as fine aggregate were investigated in this study. Glass dust waste was used as a partial replacement for sand at 10 %, 20 % and 50 % of concrete mixes. Compression strength for 7, 14 and 28 days concrete of age were compared with those of concrete made with natural fine aggregates. The results proved that highest strength activity given by glass dust waste after 28 days. The compressive strength of specimens with 10 % glass dust waste content were 32. 9373 MPa, higher than the concrete control specimen at 28 days. Using glass dust waste in concrete is an interesting possibility for economy on waste disposal sites and conservation of natural resources...|$|E
30|$|Glass {{in general}} is a highly {{transparent}} material formed by melting a mixture of materials such as silica, soda ash, and CaCO 3 at high temperatures followed by cooling during which solidification occurs without crystallization. Glass is widely used in our lives through manufactured products such as sheet glass, bottles, glassware, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubing</b> (Park et al. 2004). The concept of using waste glass in concrete is not new; early efforts were conducted in the 1960 s to use crushed waste glass {{as a replacement for}} aggregate. However, these attempts were not satisfactory due to the strong reaction between the alkali in cement and the reactive silica in glass, namely ASR (Alya et al. 2012). In this phenomenon the amorphous silica in glass is susceptible to attack by the alkaline environment and would depolymerize to form a monomer Si(OH) 4, which could further react with alkalis such as Na+, K+ and Ca 2 + to form the ASR gel. This ASR gel can absorb water and swell inside the microstructure of concrete, resulting in internal stress. Once the internal stress exceeds the strength of concrete, severe cracking and damage may occur (Du and Tan 2013). When waste glass is collected, different color glass is often intermixed. Mixed color glass cannot be recycled, however, because a mixing of coloring agents results in an unpredictable and uncontrollable color in the new glass. Machines are capable of using optical sensors to efficiently sort large glass pieces by color; however, sorting small glass pieces is not economical and much of this unrecyclable glass cullet is then landfilled. As the economic and environmental consequences of landfilling rise, the incentive to reuse glass cullet has grown. The concrete industry is one of the potential ways of reusing millions tons of glass cullet per year either as aggregate or supplementary cementitious material (SCM) (Mirzahosseini and Riding 2014). Although work on the use of finely ground glass as a pozzolanic material also started as early as 1960 s, most of the work in this area is relatively recent, and has been encouraged as a result of continual accumulation of waste glass and its consequent environmental issues (Shayan and Xu 2006). On the other hand, limited work (one study by this time) has been carried out on the application of ground glass as SCM in SCC (Liu 2011).|$|E
