5000|$|If, for example, a {{centrifugal}} fan moves 1,000 CFM at 70°F {{it will also}} move 1,000 CFM at 200°F. The air <b>volume</b> <b>delivered</b> by the {{centrifugal fan}} is not affected by density. However, since the 200°F air weighs {{much less than the}} 70°F air, the centrifugal fan will create less static pressure and will require less brake horsepower. When a centrifugal fan is specified for a given CFM and static pressure at conditions other than standard, an air density correction factor must be applied to select the proper size fan to meet the new condition. Since 200°F air weighs only 80% of 70°F air, the centrifugal fan will create less pressure. To get the actual pressure required at 200°F, the designer would have to multiply the pressure at standard conditions by an air density correction factor of 1.25 (i.e., 1.0 / 0.80) to get the system to operate correctly. To get the actual horsepower at 200°F, the designer would have to divide the brake horsepower at standard conditions by the air density correction factor.|$|E

50|$|An Inductive pump is a magnetically {{regulated}} {{positive displacement}} pump used to pump liquids and gases. It is capable of handling many corrosive chemicals as well as solvents and gases. It {{is characterized by a}} single piston that reciprocates within a magnetic field and therefore doesn’t require a dynamic seal to link the piston to an outside mechanical power source. Check valves are placed {{at both ends of the}} piston housing allowing the simultaneous suctioning and pumping that reverses with each stroke. This is known to reduce pulsations especially at higher flow rates. The piston and housing are constructed of materials that are inert to many liquids and gasses. Because the piston and housing are non-plastic materials the positive displacement chamber does not change in dimension from flexing and distortion thus allowing inductive pumps to remain very accurate with no significant changes over time. Inductive pumps are extremely accurate as each stroke contains the same volume created by a solid piston inside a solid chamber. The number of strokes can be counted or timed to determine the total <b>volume</b> <b>delivered.</b> They can be used in sterile and controlled environments as they will not leak to the outside of the housing even if the piston has experienced wear.|$|E
50|$|In reverse pipetting, {{the volume}} {{aspirated}} {{to the tip}} is bigger than the <b>volume</b> <b>delivered</b> to the receiving vessel.The excess of volume compensates for the liquid that remains as film inside the tip during dispensing. Liquid aspiration is achieved by creating vacuum {{by means of the}} vertical travel of a metal or ceramic piston within an airtight sleeve. As the piston moves upward, driven by the depression of the plunger, a vacuum is created in the space left vacant by the piston. Air from the tip rises to fill the space left vacant, and the tip air is then replaced by the liquid, which is drawn up into the tip and thus available for transport and dispensing elsewhere.When the pipette knob is pressed on an air displacement pipette, the piston inside the instrument moves down to let air out. Air is displaced by the piston. The volume of air displaced is equivalent to the volume of liquid aspirated.These pipettes are capable of being very precise and accurate. However, since they rely on air displacement, they are subject to inaccuracies caused by the changing environment, particularly temperature and user technique. For these reasons this equipment must be carefully maintained and calibrated, and users must be trained to exercise correct and consistent technique.Alternative solutions to improve reproducibility and accuracy of manual pipetting operations are based on anthropomorphic liquid handling robots capable to handle air displacement pipettes.|$|E

Next to EN-protocol violations due to insufficient care, we hypothesized technical factors to be responsible for this deficit. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the accuracy of EN feeding pump systems frequently used in the ICU. METHODS: Thirteen commercially available EN feeding pumps with their own delivery systems were tested in 12 sessions with different EN feeding tubes and EN formulas in a laboratory setting. The reproducibility of the measurements was determined for the 8 best performing EN feeding pump systems. RESULTS: There were clinically important differences between prescribed <b>volumes</b> and <b>delivered</b> <b>volumes</b> of EN in the tested EN feeding pump systems. The deficit in volume ranged from + 66 mL (surplus of 66 mL) to - 271 mL (deficit of 271 mL) per 24 hours (14 % of prescribed volume). Viscosity of test fluids (water/EN feeding formulas) and resistance of test tubes had no influence on the <b>delivered</b> <b>volume</b> by the tested EN feeding pump systems, because differences between prescribed <b>volumes</b> and <b>delivered</b> <b>volumes</b> were consistently found for each system while varying these test settings.

Therefore, the definition of sample amount can be either volume or time-based. In the present work, four configurations for sample introduction (two for each approach) were tested in order to establish if the different strategies affect the analytical signal in MSFIA systems. The mean absorbance value from ten consecutive injections of a bromothymol blue solution obtained for the time-based strategy was lower than that provided by the volume-based approach as the exact <b>volume</b> <b>delivered</b> by each configuration was different from the “theoretical” volume. For time-based configurations, the exact <b>volume</b> <b>delivered</b> is 2 – 5 % lower than the theoretical value while for volume-based configurations, the <b>volume</b> <b>delivered</b> was between 6 and 46 % larger than the theoretical volume.

Methods Laboratory technicians and village health workers collected blood from a finger prick using each device in random order, and deposited the blood either on filter paper or into a suitable casette-type RDT. Consistency and accuracy of <b>volume</b> <b>delivered</b> was determined by comparing the measurements of the resulting blood spots/heights with the measurements of laboratory-prepared pipetted standard volumes. The effect of varying blood volumes on RDT sensitivity {{and ease of use}} was also observed.
