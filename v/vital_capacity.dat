5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the forced <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (FVC) {{and the negative}} inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's <b>vital</b> <b>capacity.</b> Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|Spirometry {{measures}} {{the amount of}} airflow obstruction present and is generally carried out after {{the use of a}} bronchodilator, a medication to open up the airways. Two main components are measured to make the diagnosis: the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a breath, and the forced <b>vital</b> <b>capacity</b> (FVC), which is the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a single large breath. Normally, 75–80% of the FVC comes out in the first second and a FEV1/FVC ratio of less than 70% in someone with symptoms of COPD defines a person as having the disease. Based on these measurements, spirometry would lead to over-diagnosis of COPD in the elderly. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria additionally require a FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted. People with COPD also exhibit a decrease in diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) due to decreased surface area in the alveoli, as well as damage to the capillary bed.|$|E

25|$|Strengthening {{exercises}} {{have led}} to improvements in strength and motor functions in patients with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity in cases of mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease. Patients perform exercises when at their best, 45 minutes to one hour after medication. An 8-week resistance training study geared towards the lower legs found that patients with Parkinson's Disease gained abdominal strength, and improved in their stride length, walking velocity and postural angles. Also, due to the forward flexed posture and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson’s disease, deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial for improving chest wall mobility and <b>vital</b> <b>capacity.</b> Exercise may correct constipation.|$|E
500|$|Other lung {{function}} tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) {{and flow of}} air that can be inhaled and exhaled. The maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled is called the <b>vital</b> <b>capacity.</b> In particular, how much a person is able to exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1) {{as a proportion of}} how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). This ratio, the FEV1/FEV ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive. Another test is that of the lung's [...] diffusing capacity – this {{is a measure of the}} transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{toxicity}} symptoms {{result from}} an inflammation that {{starts in the}} airways leading to the lungs and then spreads into the lungs (tracheobronchial tree). The symptoms appear in the upper chest region (substernal and carinal regions). This begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing. If breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen continues, patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a stethoscope (bubbling rales), fever, and increased {{blood flow to the}} lining of the nose (hyperaemia of the nasal mucosa). X-rays of the lungs show little change in the short term, but extended exposure leads to increasing diffuse shadowing throughout both lungs. Pulmonary function measurements are reduced, as noted by a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can hold (<b>vital</b> <b>capacity)</b> and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity. Tests in animals have indicated a variation in tolerance similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity, as well as significant variations between species. When the exposure to oxygen above [...] is intermittent, it permits the lungs to recover and delays the onset of toxicity.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of the diaphragm and the thoracic and abdominal muscles during various static and dynamic respiratory maneu-vers was studied in six trained men by measuring intrathoracic (esophageal) and intra-abdominal (gastric) pressures together with lung volumes.

The dynamic maneuvers were forced inspiratory and expiratory <b>vital</b> <b>capacities</b> and maximal voluntary ventilation.

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of long term exercise on respiratory muscle strength, maximal inspiratory (Pl max) and expiratory (PE max) pressures, pulmonary volumes and capacities and anthropometric parameters were measured in a group of 101 male runners aged 16 to 58 years. The runners exhibited significantly (p less than 0. 05) lower PE max (202 +/- 41 cm H 2 O and significantly greater residual lung volumes (RV) (2. 08 +/- 0. 49 L) than predicted values for normal subjects of similar height and age. Forced <b>vital</b> <b>capacities</b> were not different (p greater than 0. 05) from values reported for normal non-smoking populations. These data suggest that running may cause a non-pathological increase in RV, perhaps mediated by reductions in expiratory muscle strength.

40|$|High {{altitude}} natives have enlarged <b>vital</b> <b>capacities</b> and residual volumes (RV). Because pulmonary volumes are {{an indication}} of functionally relevant traits, such as diffusion capacity, {{the understanding of the}} factors (genetic/developmental) that influence lung volumes provides insight into the adaptive responses of highlanders. In order to test for the effect of growth and development at high altitude on lung volumes, we obtained forced <b>vital</b> <b>capacities</b> (FVC), RV, and total lung capacities (TLC) for a sample of 65 Peruvian females of mostly Quechua origins (18 – 34 years) who were sub‐divided into two well‐matched groups: 1) sea‐level born and raised females (BSL, n = 34) from Lima, Peru (150 m), and 2) high‐altitude born and raised females (BHA, n = 31) from Cerro de Pasco, Peru (4, 338 m). To determine Quechua origins, Native American ancestry proportion (NAAP) for each individual was assessed using a panel of 70 ancestry informative markers. NAAP was similar between groups (BSL = 91. 71 %; BHA = 89. 93 %; P = 0. 240), and the analysis confirmed predominantly Quechua origins. After adjusting for body size and NAAP, BHA females had significantly higher FVC (3. 79 ± 0. 06 l; P < 0. 001), RV (0. 98 ± 0. 03 l; P < 0. 001) and TLC (4. 80 ± 0. 07 l; P < 0. 001) compared to BSL females (FVC = 3. 33 ± 0. 05 l; RV = 0. 69 ± 0. 03 l; TLC = 4. 02 ± 0. 06 l). NAAP was not associated with FVC (P = 0. 352) or TLC (P = 0. 506). However, NAAP was positively associated with RV (P = 0. 004). In summary, results indicate that developmental exposure to high altitude in females constitutes an important factor for all lung volumes, whereas both genetic and developmental factors seem to be important for RV.

500|$|Exercise {{programs}} are recommended {{in people with}} Parkinson's disease. There {{is some evidence that}} speech or mobility problems can improve with rehabilitation, although studies are scarce and of low quality. Regular physical exercise with or without physical therapy can be beneficial to maintain and improve mobility, flexibility, strength, gait speed, and quality of life. When an exercise program is performed under the supervision of a physiotherapist, there are more improvements in motor symptoms, mental and emotional functions, daily living activities, and quality of life compared to a self-supervised exercise program at home. In terms of improving flexibility and range of motion for people experiencing rigidity, generalized relaxation techniques such as gentle rocking have been found to decrease excessive muscle tension. Other effective techniques to promote relaxation include slow rotational movements of the extremities and trunk, rhythmic initiation, diaphragmatic breathing, and meditation techniques. As for gait and addressing the challenges associated with the disease such as hypokinesia (slowness of movement), shuffling and decreased arm swing; physiotherapists have a variety of strategies to improve functional mobility and safety. Areas of interest with respect to gait during rehabilitation programs focus on, {{but are not limited to}} improving gait speed, the base of support, stride length, trunk and arm swing movement. Strategies include utilizing assistive equipment (pole walking and treadmill walking), verbal cueing (manual, visual and auditory), exercises (marching and PNF patterns) and altering environments (surfaces, inputs, open vs. closed). Strengthening exercises have shown improvements in strength and motor function for people with primary muscular weakness and weakness related to inactivity with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. However, reports show a significant interaction between strength and the time the medications was taken. Therefore, it is recommended that people with PD should perform exercises 45 minutes to one hour after medications when they are at their best. Also, due to the forward flexed posture, and respiratory dysfunctions in advanced Parkinson's disease, [...] deep diaphragmatic breathing exercises are beneficial in improving chest wall mobility and <b>vital</b> <b>capacity.</b> Exercise may improve constipation.|$|E

However, increased body fat deploys direct mechanical effects on the respiratory system independent of asthma. Obese individuals breathe at low tidal volumes and high respiratory rate. Increased BMI leads to a reduced functional residual capacity and expiratory reserve volume [15, 16].
