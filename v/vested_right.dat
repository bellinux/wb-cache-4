As real estate development projects continue to increase in scope and expense, and as zoning regulations become more complex and sensitive to environmental awareness, the <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> debate will remain a contentious issue in land use law. The three dominant <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> rules in use today generally assume that <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> protection requires an all-or-nothing result, forcing the debate to revolve almost solely around tuning: should <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> protection be granted now or later? This outcome affords no compromise; either developers get all the protection from new regulations they want and local governments get no flexibility to adapt projects to evolving public interests, or local governments get all the flexibility they want, and developers risk losing their projects altogether.

6000|$|A remedy was sought. The people {{believed}} they had found it; not {{in the destruction of}} universal suffrage, but in the enlargement of it. It was an odd idea, and ingenious. You must understand, the constitution gave every man a vote; therefore that vote was a <b>vested</b> <b>right,</b> and could not be taken away. But the constitution did not say that certain individuals might not be given two votes, or ten! So an amendatory clause was inserted in a quiet way; a clause which authorised the enlargement of the suffrage in certain cases to be specified by statute. To offer to [...] "limit" [...] the suffrage might have made instant trouble; the offer to [...] "enlarge" [...] it had a pleasant aspect. But of course the newspapers soon began to suspect; and then out they came!

6000|$|As the filled barrows {{are going}} into the salting-house, we observe a little urchin running {{by the side of}} them, and hitting their edges with a long cane, in a {{constant}} succession of smart strokes, until they are fairly carried through the gate, when he quickly returns to perform the same office for the next series that arrive. The object of this apparently unaccountable proceeding is soon practically illustrated by a group of children, hovering about the entrance of the salting-house, who every now and then dash resolutely up to the barrows, and endeavour to seize on as many fish as they can take away at one snatch. It is understood to be their privilege to keep as many pilchards as they can get in this way by their dexterity, in spite of a liberal allowance of strokes aimed at their hands; and their adroitness richly deserves its reward. Vainly does the boy officially entrusted with the administration of the cane, strike the sides of the barrow with malignant smartness and perseverance--fish are snatched away with lightning rapidity and pickpocket neatness of hand. The hardest rap over the knuckles fails to daunt the sturdy little assailants. Howling with pain, they dash up to the next barrow that passes them, with unimpaired resolution; and often collect their ten or a dozen fish a piece, in an hour or two. No description can do justice to the [...] "Jack-in-Office" [...] importance of the boy with the cane, as he flourishes it about ferociously in the full enjoyment of his <b>vested</b> <b>right</b> to castigate his companions as often as he can.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pertinent}} issues in contemporary European conflict of laws is the tension between Community law and traditional choice of law rules. The biggest problem comes not from the transposition of member state rules on choice of law into methodologically comparable EC Regulations, but rather from the so-called country-of-origin principle. This principle holds, broadly, that EU member states may not impose obligations on a provider {{of goods and services}} that go beyond the obligations imposed by the provider 2 ̆ 7 s home state. Originally conceived mainly with public law obligations in mind, the principle has an impact on choice of law insofar as it bars member states from applying their own law to the provider 2 ̆ 7 s conduct, even if they have the closest connections to this conduct. The exact relationship between the so called country of origin principle, and private international law, has long puzzled scholars and courts. Yet attempts at explanation and reconciliation have so far been unsuccessful because they started from an inappropriately narrow understanding of private international law. Integrating comparative legal history, this paper proposes a broader understanding of private international law beyond the current post-Savignyan approach. Thus broader approach makes it possible to recognize how the country of origin principle is remarkably similar to an almost forgotten and universally rejected private international law approach - the <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> theory. The article demonstrates the parallels between the country of origin principle and US, English, French and German historical versions theories of <b>vested</b> <b>rights.</b> This insight presents an interesting challenge. The <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> theory is now universally rejected because the criticism brought forward against it was and is felt to be irrefutable. One might think the same criticism would be able to bring the country of origin principle down, too. Indeed, the article shows how current criticism of the country of origin principle replicates to a large degree earlier criticism made against the <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> theory. Remarkably, however, it shows also that the country of origin principle can refute the criticism. The return of <b>vested</b> <b>rights,</b> and its regained ability to overcome seemingly irrefutable criticism, hold a broader lesson. The rise and fall (and rebirth) of private international law approaches depends less on abstract considerations and more on general ideas and ideologies of the times - in this case, economic liberalism...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{response}} to Professor Jed Shugerman’s Economic Crisis and the Rise of Judicial Elections and Judicial Review, HARVARD LAW REVIEW (2010). Professor Shugerman argues that the widespread adoption of judicial elections in the 1850 ’s and the embrace by the first generation of elected judges of countermajoritarian rationales for judicial review helped to effect a transition from the active, industry-building state of the early nineteenth century to the 2 ̆ 2 laissez-faire constitutionalism 2 ̆ 2 of the Lochner era. This response argues that Professor Shugerman overstates the causal relationship between the elected judiciary’s robust constitutional defense of 2 ̆ 2 <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> 2 ̆ 2 and the iconic, if unrepresentative, 2 ̆ 2 substantive due process 2 ̆ 2 of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. If we are to draw a line of historical causation between the mid-century <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> decisions and the so-called 2 ̆ 2 laissez-faire constitutionalism 2 ̆ 2 of the Lochner era, it must necessarily run through the watershed historical events of slave emancipation and the industrialization of labor, as well as the transformative constitutional changes set in motion by the Reconstruction amendments. To the extent that Lochner-era courts did constitutionalize economic liberty in a manner that warrants the label 2 ̆ 2 laissez-faire constitutionalism, 2 ̆ 2 they were inspired less by the 2 ̆ 2 Jacksonian 2 ̆ 2 <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> jurisprudence that preceded the Civil War than by the constitutional and industrial revolutions that followed it...|$|R
