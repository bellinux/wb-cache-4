5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes and oceans). Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the railway line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek in the late 1880s required the immigration of Chinese labour. In December 1888, the South Australian Chinese Immigration Act came into effect, effectively putting a stop to the immigration increase. Those Chinese workers already in Darwin had proved themselves reliable, hard-working and good citizens. After {{the decline of the}} gold rush, the Chinese population competed for jobs with the White population. Not only did Asians compete successfully against Europeans for jobs that were scarce, but they also diversified into other profitable areas such as <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> and tailoring. Consequently, the retail trade was almost entirely in Chinese hands and their success was resented by Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Gardening {{began to}} be a major pursuit of the working and middle classes in the twentieth century. In the inter-war period there was a concerted attempt to {{encourage}} working-class men to abandon their traditional leisure activities in favour of activity in the garden, which was often given over to <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing.</b> Gardens were a deliberate part of the council housing schemes of the period, although the high density housing used in Scotland meant that there was less provision on the garden-suburb model than in England. Allotments were seen as one solution and by 1939 there were over 20,000 in Scotland. It was among the middle classes that domestic gardening took off in this period, fuelled by horticultural shows, open gardens, items in newspapers and increasing use of landscape features.|$|E

2500|$|Kak Tin (...) (...) {{is located}} south of Sun Chui Estate and Sun Tin Wai Estate. It {{was one of}} the five Punti villages in Sha Tin founded about 400 years ago by Tsang (...) clanspeople, {{originally}} from Shandong. The villagers were historically farmers engaged in rice and <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> supported by pig and poultry rearing. The village had a population of 130 in 1899 and 220 in 1960. About 80 households of the Tsangs are still residing in the village. While most of the village houses have been demolished and replaced by modern small houses, the houses Nos. 11 and 12 of Third Street, erected in the 1920-1930s, remain. [...] No. 11 has been listed as a Grade III historic building since 2010.|$|E
60|$|Now, one of {{the ways}} of getting at the capital value of the land is to see what the {{railways}} have paid for it. The very best rice land, taking the Japanese dollar at three shillings, is about £65:10s per acre. Unirrigated land for <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> is something over £9:12s., and forest £2:11s. As these are railway rates, they may be fairly held to cover large areas. In private sales the prices may reasonably be higher.|$|E
60|$|The way {{was most}} difficult, since shortly {{after leaving the}} river I {{encountered}} lofty cliffs split by numerous long, narrow fiords, each of which necessitated a considerable detour. As the crow flies it is about twenty miles {{from the mouth of}} the river to Thuria, but be-fore I had covered half of it I was fagged. There was no familiar fruit or <b>vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> upon the rocky soil of the cliff-tops, and I would have fared ill for food had not a hare broken cover almost beneath my nose.|$|E

60|$|And {{as for the}} Analogie, though I am apt {{enough to}} think that the hairs of several Animals may be {{perforated}} somewhat like a Cane, or at least have a kind of pith in them, first, because they seem as 'twere a kind of <b>Vegetable</b> <b>growing</b> on an Animal, which growing, they say, remains a long while after the Animal is dead, and therefore should like other Vegetables have a pith; and secondly, because Horns and Feathers, and Porcupine's Quils, and Cats Bristles, and the long hairs of Horses, which come very neer the nature of a mans hair, seem all of them to have a kind of pith, and some of them to be porous, yet I think it not (in these cases, where we have such helps for the sense as the Microscope affords) safe concluding or building on more then we sensibly know, since we may, with examining, find that Nature does in the make of the same kind of substance, often vary her method in framing of it: Instances enough to confirm this we may find in the Horns of several creatures: as what a vast difference is there between the Horns of an Oxe, and those of some sorts of Staggs as to their shape? and even in the hairs of several creatures, we find a vast difference, as the hair of a man's head seems, as I said before, long, Cylindrical and sometime a little Prismatical, solid or impervious, and very small; the hair of an Indian Deer (a part of the middle of which is described in the third Figure of the fifth Scheme, marked with F) is bigger in compass through all the middle of it, then the Bristle of an Hogg, but the end of it is smaller then the hair of any kind of Animal (as may be seen by the Figure G) the whole belly of it, which is about two or three Inches long, looks to the eye like a thread of course Canvass, that has been newly unwreath'd, it being all wav'd or bended to and fro, much after that manner, but through the Microscope, it appears all perforated from side to side, and Spongie, like a small kind of spongy Coral, which is often found upon the English shores; but though I cut it transversly, I could not perceive that it had any pores that ran the long-way of the hair: the long hairs of Horses CC and D, seem Cylindrical and somewhat pithy; the Bristles of a Cat B, are conical and pithy: the Quils of Porcupines and Hedghoggs, being cut transversly, have a whitish pith, {{in the manner of a}} Starr, or Spur-rowel: Piggs-hair (A) is somewhat triagonal, and seems to have neither pith nor pore: And other kinds of hair have quite a differing structure and form. And therefore I think it no way agreeable to a true natural Historian, to pretend to be so sharp-sighted, as to see what a pre-conceiv'd Hypothesis tells them should be there, where another man, though perhaps as seeing, but not forestall'd, can discover no such matter.|$|E
