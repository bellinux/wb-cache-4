But discretionary transfers are seen as temporary income. Provinces use part of them to increase capital expenditures and another part to reduce own taxes.

The existing station will have to be rebuilt to accommodate the increased volume of passengers using the station.

The transfer to the BMT Canarsie Line's Third Avenue station would consist of a passageway that will be [...] long. The most complicated of the transfers will be the connection between the 42nd Street station and the Grand Central station on the IRT Flushing Line. To allow for the connection to be built, a 900-foot long tunnel would be built under 42nd Street from the west side of Third Avenue to Second Avenue. The Flushing Line station might have to be significantly reconstructed in anticipation of the increased volume of passengers and due to Americans with Disabilities Access requirements for the transfer. To allow for necessary vents and emergency exits to be built, cut-and-cover would be used. The final transfer would be between the 55th Street station and the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station on the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Either shielded mining or cut-and-cover would be used to complete the connection. The existing station would have to be modified to allow for the transfer passageway to be built.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of Higher Education in Vancouver, Canada, November 2009 Transfer students make up a substantial share of undergraduates at four-year institutions in the United States. Among 1999 - 2000 bachelor’s degree recipients, about one in three reported that they had transferred to their degree-granting institution (Peter & Cataldi, 2005). In a nationally representative sample of undergraduates in 2003 - 04, half of fourthand fifth-year students at four-year institutions reported that they began their postsecondary education at a different institution (U.

In view of the substantial share of undergraduates at baccalaureate-granting institutions who transfer, 1 it is important to assess the educational experience of these students, who are likely to face academic, social, and personal challenges in the transition to a new institution (Ishitanti, 2008; Laanan, 2001; Townsend & Wilson, 2006).

50|$|Technology {{transfer}}, {{also called}} {{transfer of technology}} (TOT), {{is the process of}} transferring (disseminating) technology from the places and ingroups of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among universities, from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from governments to businesses, across borders, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among governments or universities and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) knowledge transfer. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. <b>Vertical</b> <b>transfer</b> occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.|$|E

Harbison [...] continued this line of thought by investigating whether the two genera differed in their ability to transfer.

Since nearly all RT genes function in retrovirus replication and/or the movement of transposable elements, it is reasonable to imagine that retrons might be mobile genetic elements, but there has been little supporting evidence for such a hypothesis, save for the observed fact that msDNA is widely yet sporadically dispersed among bacterial species in a manner suggestive of both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>transfer.</b> Since it is not known whether retron sequences per se represent mobile elements, retrons are functionally defined by their ability to produce msDNA while deliberately avoiding speculation about other possible activities.|$|E
5000|$|Wolbachia is a cytoplasmically {{inherited}} intracellular bacteria. It can {{generally be}} found in the reproductive organs of its host species and can be transferred from female to offspring through the egg cytoplasm. This particular form of bacteria has been known to cause many reproductive and sex ratio disorders in various insect species. However, it seems to hold a beneficial relationship when present in the host species, M. uniraptor, with reference to fecundity or the ability to induce reproduction of fertile, viable offspring specifically under uniparental reproduction. The actual process of gamete duplication differs among the insects that have been infected with Wolbachia, including a similar species of wasp called Muscidifurax raptorellus. The bacterium has been known to cause negative side effects such as cytoplasmic incompatibility, thelytoky, and feminization in the reproductive habits of these various insect species. Traditionally, M. uniraptor determines the sex of offspring using haplodiploidy. The males are produced as haploids from unfertilized eggs while the females are produced as diploids from fertilized eggs. According to this practice, M. uniraptor would normally produce both male and female offspring. However, in M. uniraptor, Wolbachia causes thelytoky, a type of parthenogenesis in which females asexually reproduce only female offspring. Studies have shown that M. uniraptor generally follows the process of automixis, or meiotic thelytoky, where meiosis occurs in the developing oocyte and diploidy is restored by fusing the meiotic or mitotic products yielding diploid females or haploid males. However, the bacterium, Wolbachia, has evolved with this species of wasp through <b>vertical</b> <b>transfer</b> to induce irreversible thelytokous reproduction of only female offspring. When M. uniraptor females receive experimentally administered antibiotics, such as rifampicin, the strains of Wolbachia become eradicated, and the females should hypothetically be able to produce both male and female offspring since the bacteria are not present to induce thelytoky. However, the resulting male offspring of these experiments do not carry viable sperm. This implies that Wolbachia establishes itself early in the females in order to ensure its transfer into further hosts, at the risk of removing the current host's ability to sexually reproduce by not allowing it to produce fertile, viable male offspring. These studies establish three primary reasons for why M. uniraptor has become so dependent on Wolbachia for survival and reproduction. As previously stated, the males of the species no longer produce viable sperm for sexual reproduction. Additionally, the females do not respond to any cues or advances by the males for sexual reproduction. Finally, the females loose a major muscle in their spermathecae that allow them to contain sperm after sexual reproduction. Therefore, without the symbiotic relationship between Wolbachia and M. uniraptor, the wasp species would not persist alone by means of sexual reproduction because of these evolutionary alterations that increase the fitness of the persisting relationship with the bacteria. The bacteria have seemingly inhibited the wasps' reproductive pathways through selective pressures to increase the fitness of their relationship, and {{studies have shown that the}} wasp is unlikely to regress to its former state of sexual reproduction as a result of these genetic alterations. One can conclude that Muscidifurax uniraptor now holds an endosymbiotic relationship with Wolbachia, and it has evolved to depend on these bacteria for reproduction and survival which results in the successful relationship we currently observe.|$|E
