500|$|With their {{experiences}} in Morocco, the Spanish Army decided to fund a development program for a new Spanish light tank. The new vehicle was {{to be based on}} the Renault FT, which was the most numerous armored <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> with the Spanish Army at the time and one of the most widely used by foreign armies. [...] The program was spearheaded by Captain of the Artillery Carlos Ruiz de Toledo, who had first commanded the battery of Schneider CA1 assault tanks in Morocco; Toledo felt that the tank would become an extremely important asset in future conflicts and felt that the Spanish Army required a Spanish-built model. [...] As a result, he toured a number of European states in an effort to collect information on new trends in tank design and attempt to integrate these into the Spanish tank program. [...] The resulting tank was known as the Carro de Combate Trubia serie A, or the [...] "Series A Trubia Tank".|$|E
