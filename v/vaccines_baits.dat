40|$|In Europe, the {{elimination}} of wildlife rabies using oral rabies vaccination [ORV] of foxes for more than 30 years has been a success story. Since a comprehensive review on {{the scope of the}} different oral rabies <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> distributed across Europe has not been available yet, we evaluated the use of different <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> over the entire period of ORV [1978 - 2014].

Depending on many factors, the extent to which oral rabies virus vaccines were used varied considerably resulting in huge differences in the number of vaccine doses disseminated in ORV campaigns as well as in large spatial and temporal overlaps. Although vaccine virus strains derived from the SAD rabies virus isolate were the most widely used, the success of ORV campaigns in Europe cannot be assigned to a single oral rabies virus vaccine alone.

An attenuated mutant of M. bovis, Mycobacterium bovis BCG (bacille Calmette Guerin [1]), is often the vaccine used in wildlife vaccination trials worldwide [2 - 8]. In countries such as UK and the Republic of Ireland, Eurasian badger (Meles meles) vaccination field trials are becoming part of the TB control strategies [9]. Field vaccination trials are also ongoing in Spain, where the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa) is regarded as the main driver of animal TB at the wildlife-livestock inter-face [10 - 12]. In Mediterranean Spain, modeling of tuberculosis in wild boar populations predicted that over 70 % of the an-nual cohort of wild boar piglets would be needed to be vaccinated in order to significantly reduce the prevalence of the disease and eventually eradicate the infection [13].

40|$|To improve both {{safety and}} {{stability}} of the oral vaccines used {{in the field to}} vaccinate foxes against rabies, a recombinant vaccinia virus, which expresses the immunizing G protein of rabies virus has been developed by inserting the cDNA which codes for the immunogenic glycoprotein of rabies virus into the thymidine kinase (TK) gene of the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus. The efficacy of this vaccine was tested by the oral route, primarily in foxes. The immunity conferred, a minimum of 12 months in cubs and 18 months in adult animals, corresponds to the duration of the protection required for vaccination of foxes in the field. Innocuity was tested in foxes, domestic animals, and in numerous European wild animal species that could compete with the red fox for the <b>vaccine</b> <b>bait.</b> No clinical signs or lesions were observed in any of the vaccinated animals during a minimum of 28 days post vaccination.

In the present study, we carried out field deployment of bait according to the established method of bait marking in early spring and early summer to compare the effects of seasonality on bait uptake rates. All baits contained rhodamine B (RhB) which was subsequently detected in the hair and whiskers of captured badgers. During the 8  days of bait feeding at 14 badger setts, 99 % of baits deployed in spring, and 100 % of those deployed in summer were removed. The presence of RhB in captured badgers indicated high rates of uptake amongst adult badgers in spring (93 %) and summer (98 %). Only cubs captured in summer showed evidence of having taken bait (91 %). Between 67 % and 100 % of each social group was estimated to have taken bait. The detection of RhB in 96 % of badgers captured at outlier setts, where bait was not fed, suggested that deployment at main setts alone may be sufficient to target a relatively high proportion of the badger population. The number of baits deployed per marked badger suggested that a similar level of uptake might be achievable using fewer baits. The results clearly demonstrate the potential value of the bait-marking methodology for delivering <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> to badgers during spring and summer, but that deployment in early summer is necessary to target cubs...|$|R
40|$|Rabies is a fatal viral {{zoonosis}} that {{is transmitted}} by bite contact with saliva of an infected animal. In the U. S., human deaths are rare, but each year over 5, 000 rabid animals are reported and over 90 % of cases are from wildlife. Multiple species of carnivores and bats {{are the primary}} sylvatic reservoirs in the U. S., and several variants circulate independently among these two taxonomic orders. Rabies prevention efforts led by USDA APHIS Wildlife Services using live recombinant <b>vaccine</b> <b>baiting</b> began in 1995 and currently target raccoons and canids, but {{the territory of the}} south-central skunk rabies virus variant has been expanding in recent years, leading to incursions into areas previously free of carnivore rabies. Colorado has been one such area, where multiple species of bats were the main rabies reservoir prior to 2007. By 2012, the number of rabid striped skunks exceeded rabid bats in Colorado. Larimer County and Weld County, in Northern Colorado, both witnessed skunk rabies epizootics starting in 2012 that have continued through 2013. Despite spillover events into raccoons, red foxes, companion animals, and livestock during 2012 and 2013, no other host species appears to support independent circulation of the south-central skunk variant in Northern Colorado. Virus isolation from salivary glands of rabid animals will help to quantify the likelihood for secondary transmission from spillover hosts and guide intervention strategies targeting wildlife. We describe the spatiotemporal pattern of the epizootic and predict likely areas of spread along the Front Range of Northern Colorado...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} during 1996 – 2000 to develop baits for delivering an oral rabies vaccine to raccoons (Procyon lotor) and coyotes (Canis latrans). A bait was sought that: (1) was {{attractive to the}} target species, (2) could be distributed by aircraft, (3) was as effective (or more so) than the currently used fish meal polymer bait, and (4) could be produced in large numbers by automated procedures and could be purchased by user groups at substantially lower cost. Ten field trials were conducted to document raccoons’ bait flavor preferences, evaluate a new <b>vaccine</b> sachet <b>bait</b> coated with various attractants, and determine if the sachet bait would effectively deliver Raboral V-RG oral rabies vaccine (Merial Limited, Athens, Georgia, USA) to this species. Raccoons preferred fish and crustacean-based flavors over those derived from plant materials. Raccoon visits to tracking stations, frequency of bait removals, and percent of sachets discarded by this species that were emptied of placebo vaccine indicated efficacy of the new bait was equal or superior to the currently used fish meal polymer bait. A field trial conducted in fall 1998 compared aerially distributed vaccine-laden sachet and polymer baits and showed {{there was no difference}} between the percent of raccoons from the test and reference areas subsequently found positive for rabies antibody. Four bait trials to determine coyote response to sachet baits were conducted in 1997 – 98. The propensity for canids to gulp or bolt smaller food items is well known. Thus, a first trial involved offering fish-flavored sachet baits of different sizes to 30 captive coyotes to determine if smaller size baits were more frequently swallowed intact. Two field trials were also conducted in fall 1997 to determine if free-ranging coyotes discriminated among sachet baits coated with different attractants. Finally, Raboral V-RG-laden poultry-flavored sachet baits were aerially dropped and the percent of seropositive coyotes was compared with coyotes from surrounding areas where fish meal polymer <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> had been distributed. Captive coyotes did not swallow sachet baits intact, regardless of size. Bait preference field trials indicated that coyotes preferred poultry, cheese/beef tallow, and fish-flavored sachet baits and that such baits were taken at the same rate as polymer baits. A sample of coyotes from the area baited with vaccine-laden sachet baits had a markedly higher (P = 0. 01) seropositivity rate than coyotes from areas where vaccine was distributed in polymer baits. Sachet bait production could be facilitated by automated technology and sachet baits used either as an alternative vaccine delivery device or in combination with the fish meal polymer bait...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} 10  years of absence, sylvatic rabies re-appeared in Italy in 2008. To prevent disease spread, three oral rabies {{vaccination}} (ORV) campaigns targeting red foxes were performed through manual distribution of <b>vaccine</b> <b>baits</b> between January and September 2009. As these campaigns proved unsuccessful, {{at the end}} of December 2009, baits started being distributed using helicopters, allowing uniform coverage of larger areas in a shorter time period. From winter 2009 to autumn 2016, a total of 15 ORV campaigns (four emergency, four regular and seven preventive ORV) were implemented through aerial distribution of baits. In this study, we assessed the costs of the aerial ORV campaigns, which were aimed at eradicating the disease and reobtaining the rabies-free status. Cumulative costs per km(2) were estimated at € 59. 45 during emergency campaigns and ranged between € 51. 94 and € 65. 67 in the regular vaccinations. The main portion of costs for ORV programmes were related to baits supply and distribution: € 49. 24 (82. 83 %) in emergency campaigns and from € 40. 33 to € 43. 35 in regular ORVs (71. 97 % and 66. 02 %, respectively). At the end of each ORV campaign, the efficacy of vaccination activities was estimated by assessing the proportion of foxes testing positive for tetracycline biomarker in jawbone, indicating bait intake. Results revealed that the proportion of foxes that ingested baits varied between 70. 97 % and 95. 51 %. Statistical analysis indicated that reducing the density of dropped baits could potentially lead to a cost-saving of 22. 81 %, still maintaining a satisfactory level of bait intake by the fox population...|$|R
