2500|$|In 1940, President Roosevelt asked Millis {{to become}} the {{permanent}} arbiter between General Motors (GM) and the United Auto Workers (UAW). The 1937 collective bargaining agreement between {{the company and its}} union established a temporary, <b>voluntary</b> <b>arbitration</b> procedure, which was made permanent in the 1940 contract. It was the first permanent arbitration mechanism in any mass production industry, and not only the union but many companies and politicians were eager to see it succeed. [...] Several of President Roosevelt's aides and confidantes urged Millis to accept the position. He agreed. However, Millis refused the large salary that was offered to him, and instead took only the same moderate salary he had been receiving at the university. Although he was arbitrator for only a few months, he laid the groundwork for smooth labor relations not only at General Motors but set a pattern for arbitration that spread throughout the manufacturing sector of the economy.|$|E

40|$|New Zealand and Australia share {{a common}} {{heritage}} of compulsory arbitration. This article explores {{the way in which}} New Zealand has departed from this tradition. Three phases in the deconstruction of compulsory arbitration and reregulation of industrial relations are identified. The first is associated with the events that led up to the Industrial Relations Act 1973. That statute formally endorsed the growth of free collective bargaining and introduced the North American distinction between disputes of interest and disputes of rights. The second is identified with the fourth Labour government (1984 - 1990), which made <b>arbitration</b> <b>voluntary</b> in a climate of extensive economic liberalization and encouraged a shift from occupational awards to a mixture of industry and enterprise bargaining. The third is presently unfolding as the new National government begins work on its election pledge to shift the basis of union legitimacy from historical registration to employee choice. If completed, the third phase will ensure the substitution of centralization and compulsion with decentralization and voluntarism in the framework of collective labour law in New Zealand.

5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the case, {{commentators}} focused on the impact it would have on securities arbitration. [...] "Unless arbitration procedures are fair both in fact and in appearance," [...] warned Constatine Katsoris, a Fordham law professor and securities arbitrator, [...] "their present popularity as a means of resolvingsecurities disputes will be greatly diminished". In particular he was concerned about backlash resulting from the standard form contracts most brokerages signed their clients to, calling on them to make <b>arbitration</b> <b>voluntary.</b> He also recommended that the arbitration forums run by NASD and the exchanges, traditionally formed of securities-industry professionals, to include members of the public both on panels and in their administration. If that requires some adjustments by the securities industry—so be it. The price will be small enough in view of the advantages of arbitration to the industry. The public's perception of fairness, however, must be zealously guarded, for it extends far beyond the issue of arbitration. It goes to {{the very heart of the}} public's trust in the securities markets themselves; and, this trust must be preserved for those markets to stay healthy. Michael Durrer, a law student at William & Mary, echoed Katsoris, adding suggestions to amend the 1934 Act to allow for an express private right of action and for NASD and the exchanges to establish an amount in controversy threshold, an upper limit on arbitrable claims.|$|R

5000|$|Tait was {{a friend}} of Colenso and shared Dean Stanley's Erastian views (that the conference should not have been called without some royal authority) but when the Canadians again {{requested}} a Conference in 1872, he concurred. The American bishops suggested a further conference in 1874, Kerfoot of Pittsburgh delivering the request in person. Importantly, the Convocation of the Province of York had changed its position and now supported the Conference idea. 108 of the 173 bishops accepted the invitation, although the actual attendance was a little smaller. The first gathering was in Canterbury Cathedral on St Peter's Day, 29 June. The bishops then moved Lambeth for the First Session on 2 July, after Holy Communion at which Tait presided and Thomson of York preached, the bishops gathered in the library. One half day was assigned to each of the six main agenda areas. The reports of the special committees (based in part upon those of the committee of 1867) were embodied in the encyclical letter, which described the best mode of maintaining union, <b>voluntary</b> boards of <b>arbitration,</b> the relationship between missionary bishops and missionaries (a particular problem in India), chaplains in continental Europe, modern forms of infidelity and the best way of dealing with them and the condition, progress and needs of the churches. A final service of thanksgiving took place in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 July. Attending bishops included 35 English, 9 Irish, 7 Scots, 19 American and 30 [...] "Colonial and Missionary". One bishop suffragan and a number of former colonial bishops with commissions in England also attended as full members. The costs of the conference were met by the English bishops and a programme of excursions was organised by the member of Parliament J. G. Talbot. The Latin and Greek texts of the encyclical were again produced by Wordsworth of Lincoln.|$|R

50|$|The second {{conference was}} called at the {{suggestion}} of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, but it was postponed because of the war between Russia and Japan. The Second Peace Conference was held from 15 June to 18 October 1907. The intent of the conference was to expand upon the 1899 Hague Convention by modifying some parts and adding new topics; in particular, the 1907 conference had an increased focus on naval warfare. The British attempted to secure limitation of armaments, but these efforts were defeated by the other powers, led by Germany, which feared a British attempt to stop the growth of the German fleet. Germany also rejected proposals for compulsory arbitration.

5000|$|The {{powers of}} the NDMB were {{severely}} limited by its inability to issue “directive orders” with regard to labor disputes. [...] Under Roosevelt’s executive order, only the secretary of labor could certify the NDMB to rule on disputes threatening defense production. [...] Such certification only occurred during disputes that the federal conciliation service could not resolve. [...] Thus, partly because of its inability to render final decision, the NDMB emphasized collective bargaining and voluntarism, rather than federal determination, in settling labor disputes. [...] In the two cases where <b>voluntary</b> <b>arbitration</b> and mediation had failed and management refused to accept Board recommendations, the president seized the plants by executive order. [...] Therefore, although the NDMB was often criticized for lacking formal powers of arbitration, the threat of governmental seizure and public pressure to comply with its recommendations gave the Board substantial authority in dispute mediation.|$|E

The law provided for <b>voluntary</b> <b>arbitration</b> of disputes between the interstate railroads and their workers organized into labor unions. It applied to individuals who worked on moving trains which transported freight and passengers between states. Workers who maintained railroad cars, and station clerks, did not come under the statute's jurisdiction.

Adair's actions were in direct violation of Section 10 of the Erdman Act which made it illegal for employers to [...] "threaten any employee with loss of employment" [...] or to [...] "unjustly discriminate against an employee because of his membership in ... a labor corporation, organization or association." [...] Adair was indicted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, which upheld the law as constitutional.
