2500|$|The [...] "Law on Vocational Education" [...] {{was issued}} in 1996. Vocational {{education}} embraces higher vocational schools, secondary skill <b>schools,</b> <b>vestibule</b> <b>schools,</b> vocational high schools, job-finding centers and other adult skill and social training institutes. To enable vocational education to better accommodate {{the demands of}} economic re-structuring and urbanization, {{in recent years the}} government has remodeled vocational education, oriented towards obtaining employment, and focusing on two major vocational education projects to meet society's ever more acute demand for high quality, skilled workers. These are cultivating skilled workers urgently needed in modern manufacture and service industries; and training rural laborers moving to urban areas. To accelerate vocational education in western areas, the Central Government has used government bonds to build 186 vocational education centers in impoverished western area counties.|$|R

The building's foundation {{is made of}} locally quarried limestone, while the building's walls were built with red brick. A louvered belfry, which {{may not have been}} added until 1883, tops the building's low-sloping roof. Courses of corbelled brick along the roof line form the building's cornice. The <b>vestibule</b> at the <b>school's</b> entrance is sided with clapboard and rests on a concrete foundation. 53 octagonal schoolhouses were built in the United States, of which the school was the only one built in Illinois. The school is one of three of these octagonal schoolhouses which is still standing.|$|R
