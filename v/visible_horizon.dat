5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation was}} carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that pilot Roger Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flying training, although had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. He and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where he is going. However, {{on the night of the}} accident, visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a <b>visible</b> <b>horizon,</b> and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.|$|E
500|$|The {{night of}} February 8 was dark, with no visible moon or stars, and no <b>visible</b> <b>horizon.</b> As the two airliners {{approached}} similar positions, their pilots had no points of reference {{with which to}} determine actual separation distance or position. Flight 663's departure turn, and Pan Am's subsequent turn left to its assigned heading, had placed the two aircraft on an apparent collision course. The Boeing rolled right and initiated a descent {{in an attempt to}} avoid a collision. In response, Eastern 663 initiated an extreme right turn in order to pass safely. The captain of Pan Am 212 later estimated that the two aircraft had passed between [...] of each other, while the first officer estimated that the distance was only [...]|$|E
500|$|While Villeneuve {{was searching}} for Allemand, the Rochefort {{squadron}} was passing south along the Spanish coast in search of Villeneuve, anchoring at Vigo on 16 August without having seen any sign of the combined fleet. Villeneuve had not left instructions at Vigo for the Rochefort squadron and Allemand was uncertain where his superior was intending to sail to. One of Villeneuve's scouting frigates meanwhile had spoken with a Danish ship that reported a fleet of 25 British ships of the line actively searching the region for the combined fleet. When {{on the evening of}} 14 August Villeneuve's scouts sighted the ship of the line [...] under Captain Edward Griffiths, the frigate [...] and the captured Didon to the west, the French admiral assumed they were an advance guard of this British fleet and turned away to the south, the impression encouraged by frantic signals raised by Dragon. In fact, these ships were the only British forces in the region. The Danish ship had been boarded by Dragon earlier in the day and her crew deliberately fed misinformation about British strength. When the French scouts sighted Dragon, the presence of the captured Didon and Captain Griffiths' signals, that were made to an expanse of empty sea beyond the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> on the French ship, successfully misled the French admiral into fleeing a non-existent fleet.|$|E

2500|$|The CFI who {{prepared}} Kennedy for {{his private}} pilot checkride {{stated that he}} had [...] "very good" [...] flying skills for his level of experience. Four months before the crash, Kennedy passed the FAA's written airplane instrument examination and later enrolled in an instrument rating course. He continued to receive flight instruction in New Jersey in his plane, including flights from CDW to MVY. His instructors said Kennedy required help working the rudder pedals to taxi and land the plane because of his ankle injury. During a training flight at night under instrument conditions, his instructor stated that Kennedy {{had the ability to}} fly the airplane without a <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> but may have had difficulty performing additional tasks under such conditions. He also stated that the pilot was not ready for an instrument evaluation, and needed additional training. The instructor {{at the time of the}} crash was not aware that Kennedy would be flying in those conditions without an instructor on board. The CFI further stated that he had talked to Kennedy on the night of the accident and offered to fly with him that night. He stated that Kennedy had the capability to conduct a night flight to Martha's Vineyard as long as a <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> existed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other three}} NCs, NC-1, NC-3, and NC-4, {{set out on}} what was {{intended}} as the first demonstration of transatlantic flight, via Newfoundland and the Azores, on 8 May 1919. [...] As junior officer, Mitscher, who had been allotted {{to one of the}} commands, lost his command when NC-2 had to be broken up for parts. [...] He went on the flight as one of the pilots of the NC-1. The group met heavy fog off the Azores, making flight in the crudely instrumented aircraft extremely dangerous. [...] Without a <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> it was extremely difficult to keep the aircraft in level flight. [...] NC-1 tried different altitudes and soldiered on for several hours before eventually putting down just short of the Azores and was damaged beyond repair in the rough seas.|$|E
6000|$|The captain, however, did {{not share}} in the general satisfaction. Out in [...] "blue water" [...] he feared no gale, {{but no one knew}} better than himself that the enemy was about to assail him at his weakest moment--when close to land. No one, however, could guess his {{thoughts}} as he stood there upon the quarter-deck, clad in oil-skins, drenched with spray, glancing now at the compass, now at the sails, or at the scarce <b>visible</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

60|$|Captain Truck had {{continued}} to pace the deck moodily and alone, during the whole evening, and he only seemed {{to come to a}} recollection of himself when the relief passed him {{on his way to the}} wheel, at eight bells. Inquiring the hour, he got into the mizzen rigging, with a night-glass, and swept the horizon in search of the Foam. Nothing could be made out, the darkness having settled upon the water in a way to circumscribe the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> to very narrow limits.|$|E
60|$|The {{second night}} we passed here was fine, {{and not very}} cold (the mean {{temperature}} being 27 degrees) and we kept ourselves quite warm by pine-wood fires. On the following morning the sun tinged the sky of a lurid yellow-red: to the south-west, over the plains, the belts of leaden vapour were fewer (twelve being distinguishable) and much lower than on the previous evening, appearing as if depressed on the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon.</b> Heavy masses of clouds nestled into all the valleys, and filled up the larger ones, the mountain tops rising above them like islands.|$|E
60|$|It was broad {{daylight}} when Sergeant Dunham awoke, and the exclamation of surprise that escaped him, as {{he rose to}} his feet and began to look about him, was stronger than it was usual for one so drilled to suffer to be heard. He found the weather entirely changed, the view bounded by driving mist that limited the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> to a circle of about a mile in diameter, the lake raging and covered with foam, and the Scud lying-to. A brief conversation with his brother-in-law let him into the secrets of all these sudden changes.|$|E

6000|$|Westward from Chillong {{the most}} distant Garrow hills visible are about forty miles off; and eastward those of Cachar, which are loftier, are about seventy miles. To the south the view {{is limited by the}} Tipperah hills, which, where nearest, are 100 miles distant; while to the {{south-west}} lies the sea-like Gangetic delta, whose horizon, lifted by refraction, must be fully 120. The extent of this view is therefore upwards of 340 miles in one direction, and the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> of the observer encircles an area of fully thirty thousand square miles, which is greater than that of Ireland! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the spot}} where he and Esther had conferred, he reached the {{boundary}} of the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> from the rock. Here he stopped, and ventured a glance {{in the direction of the}} place he had just quitted. The sun was near dipping into the plains beyond, and its last rays lighted the naked branches of the willow. He saw the ragged outline of the whole drawn against the glowing heavens, and he even traced the still upright form of the being he had left to his misery. Turning the roll of the swell, he proceeded with the feelings of one, who had been suddenly and violently separated from a recent confederate, for ever.|$|E

He seeth but the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> around him, and considereth the rest of the world, temporarily, as a blank. I look for loyal service in that Sancho, in despite of his knavery, and count upon him as one of the truest of my followers." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{all this}} time, {{the day is}} dawning, and the light is {{beginning}} to diffuse itself over the entire panorama of ocean and sky. As means were afforded, each look eagerly took in {{the whole range of}} the western horizon, and a chill of disappointment settled on every heart, as suspicion gradually became confirmation, that no land was visible. The vessels had passed, in the night, those bounds of the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon,</b> where masses of clouds had settled; and no one could any longer doubt that his senses had been deceived by some accidental peculiarity in the atmosphere. All eyes now turned again to the admiral, who, while he felt the disappointment in his inmost heart, maintained a dignified calm that it was not easy to disturb.|$|E
60|$|A {{cry from}} the watch on deck arrested the discourse, while a sudden {{brightness}} broke on the night, illuminating the vessels and the ocean, as if a thousand lamps were shedding their brilliancy upon the surrounding portion of the sphere. A ball of fire was glancing athwart the heavens, and seemed {{to fall into the}} sea, at the distance of a few leagues, or at the limits of the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon.</b> Its disappearance was followed by a gloom as profound as the extraordinary and fleeting light had been brilliant. This was only the passage of a meteor; but it was such a meteor as men do not see more than once in their lives--if it is seen as often; and the superstitious mariners did not fail to note the incident among the extraordinary omens that accompanied the voyage; some auguring good, and others evil, from the event.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning at}} {{daylight}} {{there was a}} calm so profound that the sleepers at Willow Creek were not awakened until the sun rose in a cloudless sky and glittered over the new-born sea with ineffable splendour. It was a strange and sad though beautiful sight. Where these waters lay like a sheet of glass, spreading out to the scarce <b>visible</b> <b>horizon,</b> the grass-waves of the prairie had rolled in days gone by. There were still some knolls visible, some tops of trees and bushes, like islets on the sea, {{and one or two}} square masses of drift-wood floating slowly along with the now imperceptible current, like boats under full sail. Here and there could be seen several wooden houses and barns, some of which had come down from the upper parts of the settlement, like the hut of old Liz, and were stranded awkwardly on shoals, while others were still drifting over the watery waste.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not often}} {{that the blood}} of Ishmael moved at the rate with which the fluid circulates in the veins of {{ordinary}} men; but now he felt it ready to gush from every pore in his body. The animal was aroused, in his most latent energies. Ever as he advanced he heard those shrieks, which sometimes seemed ringing among the clouds, and sometimes passed so nigh, as to appear to brush the earth. At length there came a cry, in which {{there could be no}} delusion, or to which the imagination could lend no horror. It appeared to fill each cranny of the air, as the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> is often charged to fulness by one dazzling flash of the electric fluid. The name of God was distinctly audible, but it was awfully and blasphemously blended with sounds that may not be repeated. The squatter stopped, {{and for a moment he}} covered his ears with his hands. When he withdrew the latter, a low and husky voice at his elbow asked in smothered tones-- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} said that the wind was dry and the air misty, or rather so {{pregnant}} with a thin haze, as to give it the appearance of a dull, smoky light. In such a state of the weather, the eye, more especially of one placed on an elevation, is unable to distinguish what is termed the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon</b> at sea. The two elements become so blended, that our organs cannot tell where the water ends, or where the void of the heavens commences. It is a consequence of this in distinctness, that any object seen beyond the apparent boundary of water, has the appearance of floating in the air. It is rare for the organs of a landsman to penetrate beyond the apparent limits of the sea, when the atmosphere exhibits this peculiarity, though the practised eye of a mariner often detects vessels, which are hid from others, merely because they are not sought in the proper place. The deception may also be aided by a slight degree of refraction.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{let myself}} {{down to the}} ledge, {{and found that it}} was {{impossible}} to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This fact confirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of course, the 'forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes' could allude to nothing but elevation above the <b>visible</b> <b>horizon,</b> since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, 'northeast and by north.' This latter direction I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance. In the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.|$|E
