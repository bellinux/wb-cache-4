50|$|The {{deformation}} resistant {{capacity of}} SMA {{stems from a}} coarse stone skeleton providing more stone-on-stone contact than with conventional dense graded asphalt (DGA) mixes (see above picture). Improved binder durability {{is a result of}} higher bitumen content, a thicker bitumen film, and lower air <b>voids</b> <b>content.</b> This high bitumen content also improves flexibility. Addition of a small quantity of cellulose or mineral fibre prevents drainage of bitumen during transport and placement. There are no precise design guidelines for SMA mixes available in Europe. The essential features, which are the coarse aggregate skeleton and mastic composition, and the consequent surface texture and mixture stability, are largely determined by the selection of aggregate grading and the type and proportion of filler and binder. In the US, detailed mix design guidelines have been developed for SMA and published by the US National Asphalt Pavement Association in their Quality Improvement Publication QIP 122 as given in the references.|$|E

One of the main issues with porous asphalt mixture is having an adequate amount of air <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> for its performance. High air <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> will increase the infiltration rate but reduces its durability and vice versa. Gyratory compacted samples were fabricated at various air void contents i. e. 17. 5 %, 20 % and 22. 5 % using aggregate gradations adopted from Australian and Singaporean specifications. The samples were tested for permeability, resilient modulus and abrasion loss. From the analysis, {{it was found that}} the increase in the <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> improves the permeability but adversely affects the resilient modulus and the mixture's performance under abrasion. The resilient modulus and abrasion loss show similar pattern at low air <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> where no significant difference between both mixture types but at high <b>voids</b> <b>content,</b> finer compositions shows to be more durable. Therefore, it can be concluded that the air <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> influences the performance of porous asphalt mixtures...|$|E

The objective of this research is to have a deep insight of the effect of air <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> on the temperature evolution, transport and storage of heat in asphalt mixture under dry conditions. With this objective, asphalt mixture slabs with different air <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> have been built and their thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, light absorptivity and thermal diffusivity related to their temperature evolution have been measured when they are exposed to infrared light and during the cooling process.

40|$|This {{study was}} based on the {{elements}} of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 4 - 19 that focused on the aggregate tests related to the permanent deformation and moisture susceptibility of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavements. Five coarse and six fine aggregates were used in this research program. The effect of these aggregates on the HMA pavement performance was assessed by constructing and testing test sections in the Indiana Department of Transportation/Purdue Accelerated Pavement Testing (INDOT/Purdue APT) facility located in West Lafayette, Indiana. The relationships between the aggregate properties and the HMA pavement performances were analyzed using statistical and regression analyses. The uncompacted <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> of coarse aggregate was found related to the rutting performance of coarse-graded HMA mixtures. The higher the uncompacted <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> value, the higher the resistance of HMA pavements against rutting. The uncompacted <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> of fine aggregates was related to the rutting performance of fine-graded HMA mixtures. The rutting resistance increases with the uncompacted <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> of the fine aggregate. This study also observed that the in-place binder film thickness was related to the rutting performance of fine-graded HMA pavements. The thicker the binder film, the lower the rutting resistance. The methylene blue value (MBV) and the amount of material passing the 0. 075 mm sieve (p 0. 075) of the fine aggregate were related to the stripping potential of fine-graded HMA mixtures. The rutting performance of the fine-graded HMA mixtures under wet conditions was also related to the uncompacted <b>voids</b> <b>content</b> of the fine aggregate. This study also found that the in-place binder film thickness and methylene blue value of p 0. 075 were significantly related to the rutting performance of the fine-graded HMA mixtures tested under wet conditions.

Due to variations in properties for different filler types, e. g. particle size, density, mineral composition, Rigden voids, specific surface area and binder interaction, the same filler amount by weight yields variations in occupied volume and bind different amounts of bitumen.

Virtual low-temperature bending beam test for dense-graded asphalt concrete was built and executed by discrete element method and PFC 3 D (particle flow code in three dimensions). Virtual tests were applied to analyze the impacts by content, distribution, and size of air voids on the low-temperature properties of dense-graded asphalt concrete.

The mixtures differed in both aggregate size and gradation. In order to evaluate durability effects, performance tests were performed on unconditioned, moisture conditioned and ovenaged samples. The results indicate that density (air void content) is a significant factor in the performance and durability of hotmix asphalt mixtures. Its effects vary with aggregate size and gradation, but increases in mixture density (reductions in air <b>voids</b> <b>content)</b> produce improvements in the dynamic modulus (reduction of rutting potential) and fatigue life of a mixture.

On the basis of rheological and thermal analyses, as well as observations of laminates produced by different processing conditions, curing pressure appears the most influent factor affecting the <b>void</b> <b>content.</b> This work compares different methods for void analysis and quantitative evaluation (ultrasonic scan, micro-computed tomography, acid digestion, SEM image analysis) evidencing their applicative limitations. Carbon/epoxy laminates were produced in autoclave or oven by vacuum bag technique, using different processing conditions, so that <b>void</b> <b>contents</b> ranging from 0 % to 7 % volume were obtained. Effects of porosity over laminates mechanical performances are analysed. The results of tensile and compressive tests are discussed, considering the effect that different curing cycles have over <b>void</b> <b>content</b> as well as over fibre/resin fraction. Interlaminar strength, as measured by short beam shear tests, which is a matrix-dominated property, exhibits a reduction of failure strength up to 25 % in laminates with the highest <b>void</b> <b>content,</b> compared to laminates with no porosity...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{interest of}} measuring {{the level of}} internal porosity in composite materials lies {{in the possibility of}} relating <b>void</b> <b>content</b> with macro and micro-structural properties and hence with composite manufacturing quality. In the particular case of commingled E-glass/polypropylene composites, processing parameters, such as moulding pressure and material temperature, have been demonstrated to influence <b>void</b> <b>content,</b> which is in turn affecting mechanical and impact properties of the material. It is of paramount importance therefore to dispose of a simple and reliable method for <b>void</b> <b>content</b> determination on these composites, which are increasingly used e. g., in automotive industry, for their energy absorbing properties and their low cost. In this paper, void measurements in E-glass/polypropylene commingled laminates are performed by analysing images from optical micrographs. Voids were classified, due to their size and orientation, as microvoids, intratow voidage, coplanar voids and extensive voids. In practice, optical microscopy of specimens was able to detect <b>void</b> <b>contents</b> of less than 1 % using a statistical point-counting technique. Computerised analysis of the micrographs was also possible, based on the grey scale difference existing between voids {{and the rest of the}} composite image (matrix, reinforcement).

40|$|Void {{formation}} {{is a common}} problem in many composite material manufacturing processes. Composites fail when micro-cracks, which usually originate at voids, propagate through the material. The mechanical properties of a lamina depend {{not only on the}} constituent properties, but also on the tow packing configuration, <b>void</b> <b>content</b> and <b>void</b> distribution. This paper develops a method to determine the mechanical properties of a tow and lamina and develops a progressive failure model to predict the strength of a lamina with varying <b>void</b> <b>content,</b> <b>void</b> distribution and tow packing configuration, using finite element analysis. The strength a lamina with various tow packing configurations, <b>void</b> <b>content</b> and <b>void</b> distribution were investigated utilizing the progressive failure model. The tow packing configuration can affect the strength of a lamina by approximately 25 percent. Voids located near the gaps between the tows severely affect the strength of the lamina. The transverse stiffness of tows in a lamina also significantly affects the failure strength and strain of the lamina...|$|R
