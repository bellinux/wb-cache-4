40|$|Purpose. To achieve high-fidelity optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) imaging of ex vivo collector channels (CCs) exiting Schlemm's canal (SC) using a paired-angle rotating scanning <b>endoscopic</b> <b>probe.</b> Methods. An <b>endoscopic</b> <b>probe</b> {{was developed}} to guide an OCT laser beam onto human cadaver eye tissue samples to detect CCs.

40|$|Polymer {{optical fibre}} (POF) is a {{relatively}} new and novel technology that presents an innovative approach for ultrasonic endoscopic applications. Currently, piezo electric transducers are the typical detectors of choice, albeit possessing a limited bandwidth due to their resonant nature and a sensitivity that decreases proportionally to their size. Optical fibres provide immunity from electromagnetic interference and POF in particular boasts more suitable physical characteristics than silica optical fibre. The most important of these are lower acoustic impedance, a reduced Young's Modulus and a higher acoustic sensitivity than single-mode silica fibre at both 1 MHz and 10 MHz. POF therefore offers an interesting alternative to existing technology. Intrinsic fibre structures such as Bragg gratings and Fabry-Perot cavities may be inscribed into the fibre core using UV lasers. These gratings are a modulation of the refractive index of the fibre core and provide the advantages of high reflectivity, customisable bandwidth and point detection. We present a compact in fibre ultrasonic point detector based upon a POF Bragg grating (POFBG) sensor.

40|$|Lung cancer {{diagnosis}} via breath {{analysis has}} to overcome some issues {{that can be}} summarized by two crucial points: (1) further developments for more performant breath sampling technologies; (2) discovering more differentiated volatile fingerprints to be ascribed to specific altered biological mechanisms. The present work merges these two aspects in a pilot study, where a breath volume, sampled via <b>endoscopic</b> <b>probe,</b> is analyzed by an array of non-selective gas sensors. Even if the original non-invasive methods of breath analysis has been laid in favour of the endoscopic means, the innovative technique here proposed allows {{the analysis of the}} volatile mixtures directly sampled near the tumor mass. This strategy could open the way for {{a better understanding of the}} already obtained discrimination among positive and negative cancer cases. The results obtained so far confirm the established discrimination capacity. This allows to discriminate the different subtypes of lung cancer with 75 % of correct classification between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. This result suggests that a 'zoom-in' on the cancer settled inside the human body can increase the resolution power of key-volatiles detection, allowing the discrimination among different cancer fingerprints. We report this novel technique as a robust support for a better comprehension of the promising results obtained so far and present in literature; it is not to be intended as a replacement for non-invasive breath sampling procedure with the endoscope.

Patients with reflux symptoms often have more than average reflux of acidic contents in the esophagus. However, frequently there is a discrepancy between the severity of esophageal exposure to gastric content and the severity of symptoms. Esophageal sensitivity seems to be an important factor in symptom generation. This thesis aimed to address the perception of reflux and its modulation, with a specific focus on the role of esophageal mucosal barrier function within this spectrum. In the first part of the thesis we demonstrate that an enhanced esophageal sensitivity of the esophagus is associated with impaired barrier function of the esophageal epithelium, irrespective of the presence of erosions.

In addition, positional guidance on the spinal cord is not commonly available during surgery, {{with the exception of}} neuronavigation techniques based on static pre-surgical data and of radiation-based methods, such as fluoroscopy. A fast, bedside, intraoperative real-time imaging, particularly necessary during the positioning of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>probes</b> or tools, is an unsolved issue. The objective of our work, performed on experimental rats, is to demonstrate potential intraoperative spinal cord imaging and probe guidance by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Concurrently, we aimed to demonstrate that the electromagnetic OCT irradiation exerted no particular effect at the neuronal and synaptic levels. OCT is a user-friendly, low-cost and endoscopy-compatible photonics-based imaging technique. In particular, by using a Fourier-domain OCT imager, operating at 850 nm wavelength and scanning transversally with respect to the spinal cord, we have been able to: 1) accurately image tissue structures in an animal model (muscle, spine bone, cerebro-spinal fluid, dura mater and spinal cord), and 2) identify the position of a recording microelectrode approaching and inserting into the cord tissue 3) check that the infrared radiation has no actual effect on the electrophysiological activity of spinal neurons.

40|$|Spectrally-encoded {{endoscopy}} (SEE) is an ultraminiature endoscopy {{technology that}} acquires high-definition images of internal organs through a sub-mm <b>endoscopic</b> <b>probe.</b> In SEE, a grating {{at the tip}} of the imaging optics diffracts the broadband light into multiple beams, where each beam with a distinctive wavelength is illuminated on a unique transverse location of the tissue. By encoding one transverse coordinate with the wavelength, SEE can image a line of the tissue at a time without using any beam scanning devices. This feature of the SEE technology allows the SEE probe to be miniaturized to sub-mm dimensions. While previous studies have shown that SEE has the potential to be utilized for various clinical imaging applications, the translation of SEE for medicine has been hampered by challenges in fabricating the miniature grating inherent to SEE probes. This paper describes a new fabrication method for SEE probes. The new method uses a soft lithographic approach to pattern a high-aspect-ratio grating {{at the tip of}} the miniature imaging optics. Using this technique, we have constructed a 500 mm-diameter SEE probe. The miniature grating {{at the tip of the}} probe had a measured diffraction efficiency of 75 %. The new SEE probe was used to image a human finger and formalin fixed mouse embryos, demonstrating the capability of this device to visualize key anatomic features of tissues with high image contrast. In addition to providing high quality imaging SEE optics, the soft lithography method allows cost-effective and reliable fabrication of these miniature endoscopes, which will facilitate the clinical translation of SEE technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} process for gas turbine combustion systems includes single-burner high-pressure combustion tests {{as an important}} validation step. In these tests {{the performance of a}} combustor is investigated at realistic gas turbine conditions. Measurement techniques that are typically used in these tests include mass flow meters, thermocouples, pressure transducers, and probes for exhaust-gas composition measurements. These measurement techniques, however, do not provide direct information of the flame behavior. Chemiluminescence measurements have proven to being a valuable and robust technique to close this gap. This paper summarizes the results of chemiluminescence measurements performed at Siemens full-scale high-pressure single-burner combustion test rigs at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne, Germany. To minimize the impact of the measurement system on the experiment, the optical access to the test rigs was provided by a water-cooled <b>endoscopic</b> <b>probe.</b> The probe was located in a side-wall downstream of the burner, viewing upstream towards the burner outlet. The probe was successfully operated up to full engine pressure and flame temperatures of approximately 1900 K. For the detection of the chemiluminescence signal different approaches were applied: • Spectral analysis of the chemiluminescence signal were done by using an USB spectrometer. • For flame imaging up to two intensified CCD cameras were applied. In front of the cameras various combinations of optical filters were installed to selectively record the respective chemiluminescent species (OH*, CH*, CO 2 *). • For studies with special focus on combustion dynamics an intensified high-speed CMOS camera was used. High-repetition-rate measurements were used for identifying the shapes of flame modes. • Acoustic pressure oscillations inside the combustion chamber were recorded by pressure transducers simultaneously to the camera images. This allows the pressure oscillations to be correlated with flame fluctuations during post-processing. Generally, the robustness of endoscopic chemiluminescence measurements was successfully demonstrated in numerous tests at realistic gas turbine conditions. The applied imaging setups provided new information about the connection between the flame position and NOx emissions as well as the correlation of flame fluctuations and pressure oscillations. Hence, they have become a valuable experimental tool to improve the evaluation and understanding of the combustor performance. Future work will focus on further improvement of quantitative evaluations by compensation of line-of-sight image integration, reabsorption of OH* by OH, and beam steering...|$|R
