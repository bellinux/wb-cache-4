40|$|It {{is shown}} {{how to write}} the Kirkwood-Rihaczec quasiprobability {{distribution}} as an expectation value of the vacuum state. We do this, by writing the position eigenstates as a "displacment" of the <b>vacumm.</b> We also give a relation between the Glauber-Sudarshan and Kirkwood-Rihaczec quasiprobability distributions...|$|E

The library is now used {{for several years}} in research and operational contexts, for instance for producing fi gures and reports, validating models, converting data, or making simple or advanced diagnostics.

40|$|The {{most popular}} {{technique}} for the metalic finishing of plastic are electroplating and vacuum metallizing. Electroplating for plastics is {{a surface coating}} process with metal in the electrolyte cell, where the role of plastic is as a catode, and metal as an anode. Vacuum metallizing for plastics is {{a process in which}} plastics surfaces are thinly coated with metal by exposing them to the vapor of metal that has been evaporated under <b>vacumm...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we present a local hidden {{variables}} model for all experiments involving photon pairs produced in parametric down conversion, based on the Wigner representation of the radiation field. A modification of the standard quantum theory of detection is made {{in order to give}} a local realist explanation of the counting rates in photodetectors. This model involves the existence of a real zeropoint field, such that the <b>vacumm</b> level of radiation lies below the threshold of the detectors. Comment: 7 pages, no figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a time {{dependent}} cosmological constant is considered {{in a family of}} scalar tensor theories. Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models for <b>vacumm</b> and perfect fluid matter are found. They have a linear expansion factor, the so called coasting cosmology, the gravitational "constant" decreace inversely with time; this model satisfy the Dirac hipotesis. The cosmological "constant" decreace inversely with the square of time, therefore we can have a very small value for it at present time.

40|$|The DZERO VLPC Cryostat and the Superconducting Solenoid both {{require an}} {{insulating}} Vacuum of 10 {sup - 5 } Torr or less. There is a vacuum {{system on the}} Detector Platform consisting of 2 Turbomolecular vacuum pumps and their associated piping, valves, instrumentation that are dedicated to this task. This vacuum equipment requires an operator interface and control logic in order to function properly. The operator interface allows an operator to monitor, control and configure the proper pumping setup required at any given time. The control logic is needed to protect the <b>Vacumm</b> vessels and Vacuum equipment from catastrophic events that may harm them. This is typically done with interlock chains or strings...|$|E
40|$|Notwithstanding its {{multiple}} technical applications, {{the fundamental}} {{processes of the}} <b>vacumm</b> arc technique have been insufficiently explored experimentally and theoretical discussions have involved certain contradictions. In particular the main parameters and dimensions of the cathode spots have been under discussion for some time. To answer these current questions, a new system, the high speed framing camera (HSFC), was designed to combine a long distance observation with microscopic resolution and nanosecond time resolution. This camera was used to study the microscopic behaviour of cathode spots in a pulsed high current vacuum arc. The observations described reveal that a single cathode spot, as normally observed by optical means, consists {{of a number of}} simultaneously existing microscopic subspots, each with a diameter of about 15 micrometer, 30 - 50 micrometer apart and a microsecond lifetime...|$|E
40|$|An {{extended}} chiral SU(3) {{model is}} applied to the description of dense, hot and strange hadronic matter. The degrees of freedom are the baryon octet and decuplet and the spin- 0 and spin- 1 meson multiplets. The parameters of the model are fitted to the hadron masses in <b>vacumm,</b> infinite nuclear matter properties and soft pion theorems. At high densities the appearance of density isomers cannot be ruled out and extrapolation to finite temperature exhibits a first order phase transition at T ≈ 150 MeV. The predicted dropping baryon masses lead to drastically changed particle ratios compared to ideal gas calculations.

40|$|In {{this work}} we study a {{dissipative}} field theory where the dissipation process is manifestly related to dynamical entanglement {{and put it}} in the holographic context. Such endeavour is realized by further development of a canonical approach to study quantum dissipation, which consists of doubling the degrees of freedom of the original system by defining an auxiliary one. A time dependent entanglement entropy for the <b>vacumm</b> state is calculated and a geometrical interpretation of the auxiliary system and the entropy is given in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We show that the dissipative dynamics is controlled by the entanglement entropy and there are two distinct settings: in the early times the holographic interpretation is solution of a slightly deformation of General Relativity; in the later times the quantum system is related to the dynamical formation of an event horizon and the simplest holographic model is a Vaidya solution.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the Polyakov loop and string tension at zero and finite temperature in QED 2. Using bozonization {{the problem is}} reduced to solving the Schrödinger equation with a particular potential determined by the ground state. In the presence of two sources of opposite charges the vacuum angle parameter θ changes by 2 π(q/e), independent {{of the number of}} flavors. This, in turn, alters the chiral condensate. Particularly, in the one flavor case through a simple computer algorithm, we explore the chiral dynamics of a heavy fermion. The Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1 dimensions, has expediently been used as a metaphor of color screening in gauge theories. 1 In its massless form it is reduced to a free field theory and, consequently, solved exactly. 2 With massive fermions the theory is no longer solvable. 3 Here, fractionally charged test particles are confined quite analogously to quark confinement in QCD. 5, 6, 7 In the Matsubara formalism the model at finite temperature in equilibrium is equivalent to an Euclidean field theory of compact imaginary time τ. The strategy is to solve the model on a circle S 1 where we use the powerfull machinery of bosonization and Wick rotate by the replacement L → β, it → x, x → τ. The Wilson line on the circle corresponds to the Polyakov loop in Euclidean space of compact τ. The bosonization is carried out in the interaction picture defined by free massless fermions: iγ∂ψ = 0. The Hamiltonian posseses a residual gauge symmetry. In view of this degeneracy the ground state of the theory is the theta <b>vacumm,</b> quite analogously to QCD.
