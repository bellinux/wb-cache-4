This effect, called Zener breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode {{to be used as a}} precision <b>voltage</b> <b>reference.</b> The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical <b>voltage</b> <b>reference</b> circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).|$|E

25|$|Many simple DC power {{supplies}} regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a <b>voltage</b> <b>reference</b> using a shunt regulator {{such as a}} Zener diode, avalanche breakdown diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.|$|E
