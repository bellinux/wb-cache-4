5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and water feed pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control <b>valve</b> <b>events,</b> which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the <b>valve</b> <b>events</b> to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E
500|$|Maunsell {{initiated}} trials with Urie N15 No.442 in 1924, {{and proved}} that better performance {{could be obtained}} by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements. As a result, Clayton reduced the N15 cylinder diameter to [...] and replaced the safety valves with Ross pop valves set to [...] boiler pressure. The Urie boiler was retained, though the Eastleigh superheater {{was replaced by a}} Maunsell type with 10 per cent greater superheating surface area. This was supplemented by a larger steam chest and an increased-diameter chimney casting specially designed for the rebuilds. It incorporated a rim and capuchon to control exhaust flow into the atmosphere. <b>Valve</b> <b>events</b> (the timing of valve movements with the piston) were also revised to promote efficient steam usage and the wheels were re-balanced to reduce hammerblow.|$|E
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in <b>valve</b> <b>events</b> caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|E
50|$|While {{electro-hydraulic}} and camless VVA systems offer {{control over}} the <b>valve</b> <b>event,</b> the componentry for such systems is currently complicated and expensive.

2500|$|The {{valve gear}} {{assembly}} originally designed by Holcroft {{for use on}} the N1 class regulated {{the timing of the}} <b>valve</b> <b>events</b> that admitted steam into the cylinder, increasing efficiency whilst reducing mechanical wear and the effects of hammerblow on the track. Holcroft incorporated a new method of driving the middle cylinder from the right-hand set of the two outside Walschaerts valve gear without the need to use a separate set of valve gear between the frames, saving overall weight. This was achieved by using the combination lever assembly that controlled the fore and aft movement of the valve spindle, which admitted [...] "live" [...] steam into the cylinder and ejected [...] "spent" [...] steam through the ports.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} first briefly review {{knowledge}} of {{the current state of}} the art technologies that are in production as opposed to approaches that are currently only being investigated at a research level. Next, more novel methods of the gas exchange process are introduced to identify the improved synergies between the engine and the boosting machine. The major findings to improve the gas exchange process that emerge from this review are comprised of four aspects (depending on the location where the novel technologies are implemented) : charge air pressurization/de-pressurization improvement, combustion efficiency enhancement within the chamber, <b>valve</b> <b>event</b> associated development and exhaust system optimization. Although the interaction between these technologies on different aspects of the gas exchange process was found to be highly complex the optimization or the combination of these technologies is anticipated to further improve a downsized turbocharged SI engine’s performance...|$|R
5000|$|Nissan {{introduced}} its Variable <b>Valve</b> <b>Event</b> and Lift (VVEL) in 2007 as the world's second CVVL system. The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW’s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; {{this is why it}} does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric control shaft inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric control shaft, the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift.|$|R

50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle cylinder gear of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the front valve spindles. This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in <b>valve</b> <b>events</b> brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and pivot bracket, affecting the <b>valve</b> <b>events</b> when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination lever assembly to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} for Compressed Natural Gas Direct Injection (CNGDI) vehicle has been explored recently. Through DI system {{there is an}} area that needs improvement on the performance outcome.

The CNGDI performance is analyzed for the converted petrol four stroke cycle, spark ignition port injection engine to CNGDI engine. The experimental on CNGDI engine is tested. The simulation model on CNGDI engine called the base model has been developed and correlated with the experimental result. By referring to the base model, the simulation model for the CNGDI is developed and calibrated. Through the CNGDI calibrated model, the valve opening and closing time on both valve has been adapted and compared with the performance result before and after the adjustment. The results are based on cylinder pressure, volumetric efficiency, engine torque and engine power with varied engine speed from 1000 to 6000 rpm.

50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, {{variable valve timing}} (VVT) {{is the process of}} altering the timing of a <b>valve</b> lift <b>event,</b> and is often used to improve performance, fuel economy or emissions. It is increasingly being used in combination with variable valve lift systems. There are many ways in which this can be achieved, ranging from mechanical devices to electro-hydraulic and camless systems. Increasingly strict emissions regulations are causing many automotive manufacturers to use VVT systems.|$|R
40|$|In {{a future}} 'hybrid' mode {{internal}} combustion engine capable of running in spark ignition (SI) and controlled auto ignition-CAI (also known as Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition-HCCI) modes, transition between these modes, during changes in engine load and speed, will play a crucial role. The valve train and engine management system (EMS) must provide a fast and smooth transition between these two very different combustion modes keeping all relevant engine and combustion parameters in an acceptable range. In order to obtain such transition between SI and HCCI and SI, a <b>valve</b> <b>event</b> (duration, timing and lift) has to be variable, which consequently leads to high demands on the valve train and therefore a need for its higher degree of flexibility. Two valve train concepts, one with a Cam Profile Switching (CPS) and phaser system and the other camless using Fully variable Valve Train (FVVT) are presented. The use of both concepts for transitions from SI to HCCI to SI are experimentally investigated on a single cylinder research engine fuelled with commercially available gasoline fuel (95 RON). Experimental results obtained together with benefits and obstacles in using each of these strategies are presented and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The gas {{exchange}} process between a heavy duty diesel engine and its turbocharger turbine is characterized through {{measurements of the}} unsteady boundary conditions imposed by the engine environment on the turbine. Particle Image Velocimetry is implemented at the inlet of the twin-entry turbine to characterize the unsteady velocity field over a typical engine exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>event.</b> These data indicate that although the flow is highly unsteady, crank-ensemble-averaged discrete point measurements at the turbine inlet accurately represent the periodic unsteady boundary conditions. High frequency response instrumentation is employed to obtain measurements of the temperature, pressure, and velocity fluctuations at the inlet and exit of the twin-entry turbine over one engine cycle. The resulting boundary conditions indicate highly unsteady flow through the turbine with periods of significant mass and energy accumulation in the turbine. This {{large amount of energy}} storage during the engine cycle represents a significant departure from steady flow turbine performance descriptions, as the energy content of the inlet flow to the turbine is utilized over some finite period of time following the entrance of that flow into the turbine. This significantly reduces the likelihood that simply applied quasi-steady assumptions will ever demonstrate success in predicting unsteady turbine performance. ...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{more fully}} developed, {{electronic}} valve operation will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, {{could be made}} much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or [...] "dead hole". Another even more significant advancement will be {{the elimination of the}} conventional throttle. When a car is run at part throttle, this interruption in the airflow causes excess vacuum, which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder, placed just before the intake valves. With electronic valve operation, {{it will be possible to}} control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At part throttle, when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each <b>valve</b> <b>event,</b> and opens it all the way up.|$|R
2500|$|For the 2009 {{model the}} G35 sedan was {{replaced}} by the G37 sedan. The G37 sedan was first unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show for the European market.

The G37s VQ37VHR engine has been touted by car magazines and reviewers as an improvement over the VQ35HR engine mostly adding much more refinement and smoother engine operation, especially at high rpm where the VQ35HR engine was frequently criticized for NVH and sounding strained, harsh and loud. The often criticized too aggressive clutch engagement, notchiness of the 6-speed manual in the G35 and engine vibrations transferred through the shifter and pedals in the G35 6MT cars was also addressed in the new G37 models.|$|R

OBJECTIVE: To predict age and sex specific outcomes of patients after aortic valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical valves and stented porcine bioprostheses, and to provide evidence based support for the choice of prosthesis. METHODS: Meta-analysis of published results of primary aortic valve replacement with bileaflet mechanical prostheses (nine reports, 4274 patients, and 25, 726 patient-years) and stented porcine bioprostheses (13 reports, 9007 patients, and 54, 151 patient-years) was used to estimate the annual risks of postoperative <b>valve</b> related <b>events</b> and their outcomes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{advanced}} passive {{pressurized water}} reactor (PWR) is being constructed in China and the passive residual heat removal (PRHR) system was designed to remove the decay heat. During accident scenarios with increase of heat removal from the primary coolant system, the actuation of the PRHR will enhance the cooldown of the primary coolant system. There is a risk of power excursion during the cooldown of the primary coolant system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} analyze the thermal hydraulic behavior of the reactor coolant system (RCS) at this condition. The advanced passive PWR model, including major components in the RCS, is built by SCDAP/RELAP 5 code. The thermal hydraulic behavior of the core is studied for two typical accident sequences with PRHR actuation to investigate the core cooling capability with conservative assumptions, a main steam line break (MSLB) event and inadvertent opening of a steam generator (SG) safety <b>valve</b> <b>event.</b> The results show that the core is ultimately shut down by the boric acid solution delivered by Core Makeup Tank (CMT) injections. The effects of CMT boric acid concentration and the activation delay time on accident consequences are analyzed for MSLB, which shows that there is no consequential damage to the fuel or reactor coolant system in the selected conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{valve timing}} {{is a very}} closely studied event and effects the {{performance}} of an IC Engine greatly {{with respect to the}} Brake Power Produced, Volumetric Efficiency and Emissions etc. The <b>valve</b> <b>event</b> if varied and experimented with, can result in higher efficiencies and overall improved performance of the Engine. Hence, various researchers have attempted to temper with the valve timing and thus many Variable Valve Timing systems have been proposed till date with many of them being implemented by various manufacturers. However, on reviewing the presently employed systems, the lack of existence of a single system capable of independently altering both the timing and the lift of the valves was recognized. Thus, a single system capable of achieving the above was thought of and designed. A rack and pinion mechanism powered by a programmed servo motor mounted vertically seemed most practical in achieving this within the size and space constraints. A single cylinder diesel Engine was simulated with „Lotus Engine Simulation‟ software to derive the optimum valve angles and lifts for a range of the Engine operating speed and the system was accordingly programmed and designed to achieve them. The system was designed in „Creo‟ software and analysed correspondingly in „Ansys‟ software and then finally assembled on a Diesel Engine in the lab...|$|R
