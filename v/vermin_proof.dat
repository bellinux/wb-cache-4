50|$|There is a {{walk around}} 'Seaton's Historic Farm', which {{is now part of}} the {{national}} park. Seatons Farm is how one man and his wife turned every bit of wire into something useful. Jim Seaton hand made 3 km/1.8 miles of kangaroo proof fence by hand, with posts of local saplings, which are rot and <b>vermin</b> <b>proof.</b> The property was occupied in the late 1920s and during the Depression it was set up as a farm. Times and the land were hard and the buildings represent this. The sheds have walls made from flattened corrugated iron so that it stretched further. One of the sheds is full of old wire, iron sheets, bottles, everything you can imagine. All the old machinery is still there, sitting where it was when the family sold the property to the Government in the 1980s. A unique place, showing how the less well off farmers did it in the early and mid 1900s.|$|E
50|$|Behind {{the manor}} house are the farm buildings, which are {{constructed}} {{on the most}} approved principle. The piggeries are arranged round a separate yard, with an incline from the sleeping compartments towards the yard, and food is passed into the troughs from a covered passage {{at the back of}} the styes. The sheds, dormitories, and fattening stalls of all the other animals are arranged on each side of a large substantial edifice, with a tramway passing down the centre of the building, by which food is easily conveyed to them. The stables for the cart-horses are ventilated by means of Venetian blinds at each end and openings beneath the eaves of the roof. The granary is a spacious fire and <b>vermin</b> <b>proof</b> building, erected on brick arches, with iron girders, and divided into compartments for every eort of grain. The wheelwright's shop is a large and well-lighted room, sixty feet long, with a sawmill on one side of it. Around it are arranged the fire hose, buckets, plugs, &c., which are kept in perfect order and ready at a moment's notice. A steam-engine of eight-horse power is employed in driving the machinery, which is adapted to a variety of purposes, such as elevating the sheaves, thrashing and cleaning corn, cutting chaff, straw, turnips, and mangold-wurtzel, crushing oil-cake, splitting beans and peas, bruising oats, grinding corn, grinding tools, working the sawmill, and pumping water for the fountains. The ricks are built upon cast-iron straddles, so as to resist the invasion of rats and mice. Nearly 100 men are constantly employed upon the estate.|$|E
50|$|Gray's work at Myall Park {{focussed}} on seed raising, with {{planting and}} watering {{work in the}} garden the responsibility of Gordon. While Gray was working at Myall Park the infrastructure to support {{the functions of the}} garden were improved. Drawing on his prior experience, Gray designed suitable nursery structures. According to Gordon, he built for Gray the types of structures that the Victorian Government would not supply for him at Wail in Victoria. The nursery consisted of a single-storey timber building with a potting room and a seed storage room, connected by a covered entry to a timber-framed glasshouse/misting room with a concrete slab floor. The timber building was constructed first and the glasshouse was a later addition. A yard {{to the rear of the}} buildings housed four large timber hardening bays. The nursery was built by Harry Howe, with the assistance of cabinetmaker Bill Dunmall, who fitted out the <b>vermin</b> <b>proof</b> seed storage room with silky oak cabinet drawers. Cypress pine milled on the property was used in the construction of the buildings. A catalogue system was used to record seed source and date, supplier and usage. Details of propagations, planting locations and survival rates were all recorded. Around this time a large single room, lined with tall cupboards and work benches was constructed at the Gordon family residence house, to provide an art space for Dorothy and to store herbarium specimens. The house is now located within the Myall Park pastoral property, just outside the Botanic Garden boundary. The herbarium specimens formerly located in the house are now held by the Myall Park Botanic Garden.|$|E
5000|$|The {{requirement}} for an offset tie down will occur when <b>vermin</b> <b>proofing</b> {{must be placed}} between the column or post, and a wooden bearer, for example to stop termites travelling up through a concrete or wooden post or column directly into the bearer {{and the rest of}} the building. The [...] "ant capping", typically a 0.5mm to 0.8mm thick galvanised steel sheet, must be placed between the post and the bearer overlapping the perimeter of the post by approximately 20mm to 40mm or more. The cranked eye bolt is fastened to the post using a bolt though the eye, the crank in the shaft allowing the shaft to be positioned so that it does not impede the overlap of the [...] "ant capping" [...] up through the bearer.|$|R

40|$|Wildlife tourism {{involves}} a broad sweep of experiences that includes {{all of the}} aspects of the tourism genre with the distinguishing feature of animals as the primary attraction. The uniqueness of Australian wildlife in combination with factors such as remoteness and rarity appear to have provided the ideal context for successful wildlife tourism operations. Barna Mia, located in a large remnant wood-land in the central southern wheatbelt of Western Australia, is approximately 165 km southeast of the state’s capital, Perth. Dryandra Woodland, the location of Barna Mia, consists of a closely grouped and connected cluster of native remnant vegetation blocks. The enclosure is surrounded by electrified, <b>vermin</b> <b>proof</b> fencing to keep feral predators out and the captive fauna in. The results of the visitor survey at Barna Mia suggested the experience provided {{a great sense of}} satisfaction amongst respondents. This was both in terms of the overall satisfaction as well as satisfaction with specific parts of the experience. The feeling of being ‘in the wild ’ may have been enhanced by the lack of barriers between visitors and the animals and the absence of constraints on animal movement through the enclosure. Improving the operation of Barna Mia as an attraction in itself and as part of the Dryandra Woodland product may serve to improve its success as an attraction. However, an innately attractive tourism experience cannot work without appropriate integration within the specific wildlife tourism product of Dryandra Woodland, while coordination with tourism on a regional scale is also important...|$|E
40|$|Aerosols {{of natural}} and {{anthropogenic}} origin have important climate effects through interaction with clouds, which are among the main uncertainties in climate models due to the large variability of aerosol sizes, types and 3 D-distributions [1]. Experimental investigations are typically restricted to high concentrations in industrial and urban aerosol plumes although in more remote areas already slight changes in the aerosol concentrations can have a large impact. This study reports on investigations of aerosols over a remote natural laboratory, along the ~ 1500 km long <b>Vermin</b> <b>Proof</b> Fence, also called “State Barrier Fence”, in Western Australia. This Fence, built {{in the first decade}} of the 20 th century, separates an area of > 100. 000 square km of homogeneous terrain, converted to arable land (west), from the natural vegetation of inner Australia, conserved as a nature preserve (east). The Fence protects the agriculture from an invasion of animals but also protects the nature preserve from farming pressure and serves as a clear cut between the two types of landscape. Recent satellite images indicate that the Fence also works as a separation line between different meteorological regions. Clouds, for example, develop more often over regions with natural vegetation [2]. Early surveys of aerosols over Australia [3] found generally clean conditions with less than 1000 ultrafine (~ 20 nm) particles / cm 3 throughout most of Australia. Local enhancements were occasionally observed in coastal areas, but, for the analysis of particle distributions they were considered to be unimportant. However, higher numbers of ultrafine particles were now also found downwind of tropical eucalyptus forests on the Australian east coast...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctorate}} is {{to investigate}} an alternative to petroleum based thermal insulations, by using natural and recycled materials. The methodology used is centered {{on the use of}} the basic ingredients of waste animal fats, waste oils and a potash derived lye mixture, combined to create a crude soap. This soap is aerated to produce a lightweight structure that is capable of preventing or reducing heat transfer between areas of differing temperatures. Experimental testing reveals that this non-toxic product can be strengthened, made waterproof, <b>vermin</b> <b>proof</b> and fire retardant, whilst the results from the thermal testing laboratory confirm that aerated soap insulation functions as a moderate performer. The step-by-step experimental methodology applied, alongside the thermal conductivity and resistance results contained within this thesis, can be used as a gauge for future potential improvements to build from. Currently there are gaps in knowledge and practice with regards to environmental thermal insulation. There are other environmental insulations, but more research needs to be initiated regarding recyclable, biodegradable, renewable and organic components and ingredients within the insulation make-up. Industry trends are to improve the better performing petroleum insulations, whilst seemingly unwilling to compromise on environmental problem relief. This doctorate provides suggestions on how to reduce some of the environmental problems by replacing or diluting the toxic elements of petroleum insulation. Soap insulation is unique and as such makes a significant contribution to knowledge. This uniqueness is evidenced through the literature review and the systematic investigation of the research topic. The awarding of a worldwide patent on soap insulation protects the manufacture of thermal insulation comprising of solid aerated soap panels, derived from animal fats and lye. This idea of combining basic soap ingredients, then aerating the mixture to create thermal insulation is new and as such contributes to new knowledge. The publishing of a journal paper titled “Can Soap be a Sustainable Alternative to Petroleum-Based Thermal Insulation?” in the journal of Structural Survey. (Read & Arayici, 2015) emphasize the contribution of this research. Read & Arayici, (2015) describes the ingredients used, the manufacturing process and the improvement measures taken to create the soap insulation. Publishing is one method of making this research known to the global community. Academics can then engage with fellow academics or collaborate with industry to further this research or to commercialise this knowledge. Aerated soap research can widen the understanding of possible new alternative thermal insulation ideas. This creates a small yet original and significant opportunity to reduce the associated carbon footprint and environmental costs accrued each time that petroleum insulation is produced...|$|E
