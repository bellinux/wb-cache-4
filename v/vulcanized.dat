The {{purpose of the}} work: the development of methods of the wear resistance increase of the <b>vulcanizing</b> equipment friction assemblies {{on the base of}} the selective transfer processes, using the metallorganic additives to the lubrication materials. The metal-cladding lubrication material for the friction pairs steel-bronze and the method of receiving the antifriction antiwear friction surface have been developed.

25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of <b>vulcanized</b> rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was tacky when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|E

25|$|Natural rubber is an {{elastomer}} (an elastic hydrocarbon polymer) {{that originally}} {{was derived from}} latex, a milky colloidal suspension found in specialised vessels in some plants. It is useful directly in this form (indeed, the first appearance of rubber in Europe was cloth waterproofed with unvulcanized latex from Brazil). However, in 1839, Charles Goodyear invented <b>vulcanized</b> rubber; a form of natural rubber heated with sulfur (and a few other chemicals), forming cross-links between polymer chains (vulcanization), improving elasticity and durability.|$|E
25|$|Another process {{involves}} {{conversion of}} assorted polymers into petroleum by {{a much less}} precise thermal depolymerization process. Such a process {{would be able to}} accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including thermoset materials such as <b>vulcanized</b> rubber tires and the biopolymers in feathers and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be used as fuels or as feedstock. A RESEM Technology plant of this type in Carthage, Missouri, USA, uses turkey waste as input material. Gasification is a similar process but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.|$|E
