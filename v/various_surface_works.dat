We accurately obtained residual stress from spotted diffraction patterns by X-ray stress measurement using an imaging plate (IP). On the other hand, a conventional X-ray stress measurement method using a scintillation counter was more effective in accurately obtaining residual stress from diffraction patterns with low P/B ratio than X-ray measurement using IP. Residual stresses on <b>various</b> <b>worked</b> <b>surfaces</b> of TiAl intermetallic compound were obtained by appropriately using these methods...|$|R

40|$|The optimum {{selection}} of equipment fleets in <b>surface</b> <b>work</b> operations {{is a key}} element to the success of any road construction project. For years, computer simulations have been used to predict the performance of construction operations based on process flows and resources utilized.

This paper proposes a hybrid mechanism that integrates discrete event simulation and genetic algorithms to efficiently determine the best resource combination for the <b>surface</b> <b>work</b> operations in road construction. The paper employs genetic algorithms (GAs) for minimizing the total cost of <b>surface</b> <b>work</b> operations examined.
