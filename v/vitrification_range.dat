30|$|Clay {{deposits}} {{are widely}} distributed within many geological formations from Carboniferous to recent age. They {{are located in}} the region of Nile Valley and Delta, {{as well as in the}} Western and Eastern Desert of Egypt. Most of these deposits are used for the applications in many ceramic industries, for example, whiteware, refractories, heavy clay products, and Portland cement (Hanna and Stoops 1977; Said 1990; Youssef 2008). Clays are classified according to their particle size, mineral and chemical compositions, and other properties (Grim 1962, 1968; Grimshaw 1971; Norton 1969; Konta 1979, Burst 1991). Many authors indicated that kaolinite-rich clay materials are refractory with a high <b>vitrification</b> <b>range,</b> low plasticity, white-to-buff burning colour and a low-drying and firing shrinkage. Moreover, montmorillonite-rich clays are non-refractory with low vitrification ranges, high plasticity, buff-to-red burning colour, and a high-drying and firing shrinkage. In contrast, illite-rich clays are falling between kaolinitic and montmorillonitic clays and exhibit wide variations. Lightweight clay aggregates may be produced by firing pellets of low-grade montmorillonite-rich clays with or without adding to the <b>vitrification</b> <b>range.</b> After firing, the clay pellets swell or bloat owing to gas releases within the firing bodies during the liquid phase. On cooling, these low-grade montmorillonite clays conserve the cellular texture, and lightweight aggregate is obtained (Serry et al. 1985; Konta 1995; Karaman et al. 2006; Bernhardt et al. 2013; Ismail et al. 2016, Ismail et al. 2018; Risdanareni et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|A new approach, termed SMILE (Small Module Inductively Loaded Energy), for the {{vitrification}} of {{high level}} nuclear wastes (HLW) is described. Present vitrification systems liquefy the HLW solids and associated frit material in large high temperature melters. The molten mix is then poured into small ({approximately} 1 m{sup 3 }) disposal canisters, where it solidifies and cools. SMILE eliminates the separate, large high temperature melter. Instead, the BLW solids and frit melt inside the final disposal containers, using inductive heating. The contents then solidify and cool in place. The SMILE modules and the inductive heating process are {{designed so that}} the outer stainless can of the module remains at near ambient temperature during the process cycle. Module dimensions {{are similar to those}} of present disposal containers. The can is thermally insulated from the high temperature inner container by a thin layer of refractory alumina firebricks. The inner container is a graphite crucible lined with a dense alumina refractory that holds the HLW and fiit materials. After the SMILE module is loaded with a slurry of HLW and frit solids, an external multi-turn coil is energized with 30 -cycle AC current. The enclosing external coil is the primary of a power transformer, with the graphite crucible acting as a single turn ``secondary. `` The induced current in the ``secondary`` heats the graphite, which in turn heats the HLW and frit materials. The first stage of the heating process is carried out at an intermediate temperature to drive off remnant liquid water and water of hydration, which takes about 1 day. The small fill/vent tube to the module is then sealed off and the interior temperature raised to the <b>vitrification</b> <b>range,</b> i. e., {approximately} 1200 C. Liquefaction is complete after approximately 1 day. The inductive heating then ceases and the module slowly loses heat to the environment, allowing the molten material to solidify and cool down to ambient temperature...|$|E
40|$|Whiteware {{compositions}} prepared using Pugu kaolin {{and industrial}} grade quartz and feldspar were studied {{with respect to}} varying sintering temperatures. The strength developed was correlated to mullite (3 Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 2) content and the microstructure. It was observed that within the <b>vitrification</b> temperature <b>range,</b> the strength mainly depended on the mullite content and the bulk density. Above the <b>vitrification</b> temperature <b>range</b> {{the deterioration of the}} strength is due to the coarsening of mullite needles and bloating...|$|R
40|$|Floor tile body recipes were {{prepared}} using granite fine quarry waste (GFQW) and oil palm fiber ash (OPFA) {{as raw materials}} with clearly defined {{physical and chemical properties}} at single sieve residues and different fast fired temperatures under industrial conditions. The most suitable formulations with the corresponding optimum moisture contents were determined and further fired at different peak temperatures under laboratory conditions in order to establish their <b>vitrification</b> <b>ranges</b> and optimum firing temperatures. The tested peak firing temperatures were varied at 20 ºC intervals from 1140 to 1180 ºC for floor tile bodies. The physical and thermal properties of the fired bodies such as colour, water absorption, linear firing shrinkage, and bulk density were measured. Furthermore, consideration was given to the phase and microstructural evolution of the developed tile bodies. X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with thermogravimetry were used to analyse the phases formed before and after firing. The experimental results showed {{that it was possible to}} obtain a floor tile body with the properties in accordance with TIS 37 - 2529...|$|R
