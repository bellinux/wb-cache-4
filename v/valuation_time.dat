40|$|The time {{trade-off}} (TTO) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used health state valuation methods and was recently used to develop a set of values for the EQ- 5 D descriptive system from 3000 members of the UK general population. However, there is currently very little understanding of precisely what determines responses to TTO questions. The data that were used to generate this set of values are ideal for addressing this question since they contain a plethora of information relating to the respondents and their cognition during the TTO exercise. A particularly useful characteristic of this dataset is the existence of visual analogue scale (VAS) valuations on the same states for the same respondents. The results suggest that age, sex and marital status are the most important respondent characteristics determining health state valuations. The VAS valuations were found to add very little to the explanatory power of the models. Health state <b>valuation</b> <b>Time</b> trade-off Visual analogue scale EQ- 5 D...|$|E
40|$|INFFER (Investment Framework for Environmental Resources) was {{developed}} to help investors of public funds to improve the delivery of outcomes from environmental programs. It assists environmental managers to design projects, to select delivery mechanisms, and to rank competing projects {{on the basis of}} benefits and costs. The design of INFFER and the activities of the INFFER projects are based on extensive experience of working with environmental managers and policy makers. This experience has highlighted a number of important practical lessons, that have strongly influenced the design and implementation of INFFER. These lessons include the need for simplicity, training and support of users, trusting relationships with users, transparency, flexibility, compatibility with the needs and contexts of users, and supportive institutional arrangements. In additions, the developers have paid close attention to the need for processes that are theoretically rigorous, resulting in a tool that deals appropriately and consistently with projects for different assets types, of different scales and durations, consistent with Benefit: Cost Analysis. The paper outlines theoretical considerations underpinning the way that INFFER deals with asset <b>valuation,</b> <b>time</b> lags, uncertainty, and the design of the metric used to rank projects.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the allocative efficiency of two popular non-market allocation mechanisms — the lottery (random allocation) and the waiting line (queue system).

Inefficiency occurs due to resource misallocation in both mechanisms and the incurrence of rent-seeking costs in the waiting line.

Does {{the choice}} of method of {{forecast}} of index stock returns and {{the choice of}} investment strategy depend on index's industry affiliation? Prague 2015. 57 pages. Bachelor thesis (Bc.) Charles University, Faculty of Social Science, Institute of Economic Studies. Supervisor Michala Moravcova. Author's Email: Dobryashkina@gmail. com Supervisor's Email: Moravcovamichala@gmail. com Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to analyze and reveal {{if there is any}} dependence of index stock return valuation method on index's industry affiliation. The question about profitable strategy to react to valuation method's forecasts is also investigated. I focus on three methods of valuation: technical analysis, time series forecast and combination of rules from both technical and times series forecast rules, and test them on 10 Dow Jones Industrial Indices. Double-or-out strategy is compared to buy-and-hold strategy by estimation of its excess return. I found no dependence of choice of method on index's industry affiliation. However, the double-or-out strategy was proved to outperform buy-and-hold strategy in all of the industries.

40|$|AbstractWe {{show that}} tolls that are linear in the latency {{of the maximum}} latency path are {{necessary}} and sufficient to induce heterogeneous network users to independently choose routes that lead to traffic with minimum average latency. This improves upon the earlier bound of O(n 3 lmax) given by Cole, Dodis, and Roughgarden in STOC 03. (Here, n {{is the number of}} nodes in the network; and lmax is the maximum latency of any edge.) Our proof is also simpler, relating the Nash flow to the optimal flow as flows rather than cuts. We model the set of users as the set [0, 1] ordered by their increasing willingness to pay tolls to reduce latency—their <b>valuation</b> of <b>time.</b> Cole et al. give an algorithm that computes optimal tolls for a bounded number of agent valuations, under the very strong assumption that they know which path each user type takes in the Nash flow imposed by these (unknown) tolls. We show that in series parallel graphs, the set of paths traveled by users in any Nash flow with optimal tolls is independent of the distribution of <b>valuations</b> of <b>time</b> of the users. In particular, for any continuum of users (not restricted to a finite number of valuation classes) in series parallel graphs, we show how to compute these paths without knowing α. We give a simple example to demonstrate that if the graph is not series parallel, then the set of paths traveled by users in the Nash flow depends critically on the distribution of users’ <b>valuations</b> of <b>time...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} proper <b>valuation</b> of <b>time</b> when {{estimating}} {{the demand for}} recreational goods where time costs represent {{a substantial portion of}} the “purchase price”. To estimate recreational demand, this paper employs revealed preference data and the associated analytical method — travel cost analysis — and stated preference data and the associated analytical method — contingent behavior analysis. The contingent behavior analysis considers hypothetical increases in access fees, travel time, and travel distance. Based on the responses to these contingencies, this analysis improves the monetary <b>valuation</b> of <b>time</b> costs using the effect of increased access fees as the monetary benchmark. As strong evidence of this improvement, implementing the adjusted time costs in the regression system greatly improves the consistency between the parameters of the revealed preference and stated preference data sets. This implementation also improves the consistency between levels of demand and changes in demand. Similarly, this paper improves the valuation of transportation-related costs. ______________________________________ I wish to thank several people for their guidance and assistance.

The latter dominates, so that aggregate consumer welfare increases with return policy. ...|$|R
