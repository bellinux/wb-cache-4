The input to the mapper consists of the subregions subregion_j with their extent, the drone type needed, network lines and elevation points in the subregion and the waypoints. For the subregions located along the <b>vertical</b> <b>edge</b> of the sections associated with their section id, reducer pairs the corresponding left and right subregions. The subregions can thus be merged if they are covered by the same drone type. The output from the reducer consists of the entire set of subregions, including the merged subregions. All non boundary subregions are emitted as is.|$|R

Then the binarized image is enhanced by removing noise. After that, new <b>Vertical</b> <b>edge</b> based method is used to detect the number plate {{because of the high}} availability of the <b>vertical</b> <b>edges</b> in the number plate rather than the horizontal <b>edges.</b> Using <b>vertical</b> <b>edge</b> detection reduces the computation time. After that scan the image horizontally and vertically by pixel information are used to detect the license plate.

The <b>vertical</b> <b>edge</b> information is extracted using a top-hat transform. The candidate region and type of ISO-Code is obtained using a Spatial Structure Window (SSW) which wraps around the <b>vertical</b> <b>edges.</b> The ISO-Code is extracted using texture clustering by the K-Means algorithm which is then recognized by a Back-propagation Neural Network (BP).

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{buildings}} change detection. <b>Vertical</b> <b>edges</b> of buildings are extracted in pairs of aerial images respectively, {{taking advantage of the}} character that <b>vertical</b> <b>edges</b> intersect at their vanishing point without fail.

And the changes of buildings are detected by carrying on the change analysis using these coordinates and the three dimensional city models. Finally, experiments are given. The results show that the approach proposed by this paper is feasible and the changes of buildings can be detected accurately. 1...|$|R

40|$|We study bond {{percolation}} on {{the square}} lattice with one-dimensional inhomogeneities. Inhomogeneities are introduced in the following way: A vertical column {{on the square}} lattice is the set of <b>vertical</b> <b>edges</b> that project to the same vertex on Z. Select vertical columns at random independently with a given positive probability. Keep (respectively remove) <b>vertical</b> <b>edges</b> in the selected columns, with probability p, (respectively 1 -p). All horizontal <b>edges</b> and <b>vertical</b> <b>edges</b> lying in unselected columns are kept (respectively removed) with probability q, (respectively 1 -q). We show that, if p > p_c(Z^ 2) (the critical point for homogeneous Bernoulli bond percolation) then q can be taken strictly smaller then p_c(Z^ 2) {{in such a way}} that the probability that the origin percolates is still positive.
