50|$|The lode clearly {{consists}} of a magmatic lead-zinc-association (more precisely a sphalerite-pyrite-galena-chalcopyrite association) enriched in silver. The importance of the Cantonnier-lode lies in the diversity of its secondary alteration minerals, some very rare species being present. Amongst these galena-derived lead minerals we find chromates (crocoite, embreyite and <b>vauquelinite),</b> arsenates (mimetesite) and molybdates (wulfenite). <b>Vauquelinite</b> indicates the presence of copper.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} minerals {{were discovered}} at the deposit: aikinite (1789), <b>vauquelinite</b> (1819), cassedanneite (1988), crocoite (1766), pyrophyllite (1829), phenicochroite (1839), embreyite (1972).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vauquelinite</b> is {{a complex}} mineral with the formula CuPb2(CrO4)(PO4)(OH) making it a {{combined}} chromate and phosphate of copper and lead. It forms a series with the arsenate mineral fornacite.|$|E
50|$|Crocoite is {{commonly}} found as large, well-developed prismatic adamatine crystals, although {{in many cases}} are poorly terminated. Crystals are of a bright hyacinth-red color, translucent, and have an adamantine to vitreous lustre. On exposure to UV light some of the translucency and brilliancy is lost. The streak is orange-yellow; Mohs hardness is 2.5-3; and the specific gravity is 6.0.It was discovered at the Berezovskoe Au Deposit (Berezovsk Mines) near Ekaterinburg in the Urals in 1766; and named crocoise by F. S. Beudant in 1832, from the Greek κρόκος (krokos), saffron, in allusion to its color, a name first altered to crocoisite and afterwards to crocoite. In the type locality the crystals are found in gold-bearing quartz-veins traversing granite or gneiss and associated with crocoite are quartz, embreyite, phoenicochroite and <b>vauquelinite.</b> Phoenicochroite is a basic lead chromate, Pb2CrO5 with dark red crystals, and <b>vauquelinite</b> a lead and copper phosphate-chromate, Pb2CuCrO4PO4OH, with brown or green monoclinic crystals. <b>Vauquelinite</b> was named after L. N. Vauquelin, who in 1797 discovered (simultaneously with and independently of M. H. Klaproth) the element chromium in crocoite.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant genus}} Vauquelinia is named in his honor, {{as is the}} Vauquelin, an egg white foam {{associated}} with molecular gastronomy, and the mineral <b>vauquelinite,</b> discovered at the same mine as the crocoite from which Vauquelin isolated chromium.|$|E

It forms a series with the phosphate mineral <b>vauquelinite.</b> [...] It forms variably green to yellow, translucent to transparent crystals in the monoclinic - prismatic crystal system. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.3 and a specific gravity of 6.27.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} {{oxidized}} veins containing galena, sphalerite and pyrite. Associated secondary minerals include cerussite, phoenicochroite, <b>vauquelinite,</b> willemite, wulfenite, galena, sphalerite, pyrite, tennantite and chalcopyrite. It {{has been reported}} from several mining districts in Arizona and one in Nevada. It has also been reported from the Antofagasta Region of Chile and the Anarak District of Esfahan Province, Iran.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the nearly}} {{ubiquitous}} quartz more common minerals in the lode are baryte, calcite, chalcedony, finely disseminated chalcopyrite and nickel-bearing pyrite (variety bravoite). Primary ore minerals are silver-bearing galena and sphalerite; traces of native silver {{have also been}} found. Of great importance are the numerous secondary ore minerals, amongst them some very rare species. Besides cerussite, crocoite and pyromorphite appear anglesite, embreyite, hisingerite and mimetesite. Most likely dundasite, leadhillite, <b>vauquelinite</b> and wulfenite are also present (need confirming).|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the common}} {{minerals}} quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, biotite, muscovite {{as well as}} calcite, dolomite and gypsum rarer minerals occur, for example actinolite, allanite, andalusite, antigorite, apatite, arsenopyrite, baryte, cassiterite, chalcedony, chalcopyrite, chlorite, chromite, clinopyroxene, chrysotile, cordierite, cyanite, epidote, galena, garnet, goethite, graphite, hematite, hornblende, ilmenite, kaolinite, limonite, magnetite, manganite, marcasite, montmorillonite, prehnite, psilomelane, pyrite, pyrolusite, pyrrhotite, rutile, sillimanite, sphalerite, sphene, staurolite, tourmaline and zircon. Some very rare minerals do exist as well, like anglesite, autunite, beryl, cerussite, covellite, crocoite, greenockite, nontronite, pyromorphite, scheelite, native silver, stibnite and wulfenite, and also extremely rare minerals like chalcolite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, ozokerite (pseudo-mineral) and <b>vauquelinite.</b>|$|E
50|$|These fine- to medium-grained rocks have {{a rather}} dark appearance, {{they are quite}} rich in green {{hornblende}} but nearly devoid in alkali feldspar (less than 10 volume percent). Their SiO2-contents are fairly low, so they compositionally approach dioritic rocks. In the past this facies has been extensively quarried (Tabataud quarry south of Nontron). Associated with this facies are several NW-SE striking mineralised veins that have been mined for lead, silver and zinc. Mining activity stopped in 1939. The Cantonnier vein is famous for very rare mineralisations. Besides baryte, calcite, chalcedony, dolomite, galena, marcasite, pyrite and sphalerite occur very rare minerals like anglesite, cerussite, crocoite, dundasite, embreyite, hisingerite, leadhillite, mimetite, ozokerite (pseudomineral), pyromorphite, native silver, <b>vauquelinite</b> and wulfenite.|$|E

This is of importance as often the crystals are found {{adjacent to each other}} in the same matrix through paragenetic relationships. The Raman spectrum of crocoite shows three bands in the CrO 4 stretching region at 856, 841 and 825 cm- 1, phoenicocroite at 856, 848, 839 and 826 cm- 1, hemihedrite at 847, 837 and 824 cm- 1, iranite bands at 865, 846 and 818 cm- 1, macquartite at 857, 840 and 814 cm- 1. The Raman spectra of fornacite and <b>vauquelinite</b> are complicated by the presence or AsO 4 and PO 4 units in the structure and often the spectra are broad and vary with chemical composition. A comparison of the spectra of these minerals is made with that of the hexavalent chromate mineral edoylerite.

40|$|Summary. Some {{structural}} analogies {{found in}} tsumebite, <b>vauquelinite,</b> forns. cite, and brackebuschite {{make it possible}} to place these secondary lead minerMs in the s~me series with general formula Pb~MeII(Z) (XQ) (Y 04), where MelI is a bivalent cation as Cu 2 + or Mn 2 +, Z is the hydroxyl group or the w~ter molecule, X is S, Cr, or V, ~nd Y is P, As, or V. Some crystallochemical onsiderations are developed in order to explain how the replacement ofthese elements affects the crystM structure in these substances. EtCENT studies undertaken in this Inst i tute on the crystal struc-ure of fornacite and <b>vauquelinite</b> show that close similarities exist between these and two other lead minerals: tsumebite and bracke-buschite. The results allow us to place these minerals in the same series, according to their structural relationships, and, though their structures are quite complicated, to develop some crystallochemical considerations concerning the effects that replacements of ions of differing sizes may cause in these structural frameworks. The structure of braekebuschite, Pb 2 Mn(VO 4) 2 H 20, was determined in 1955 (Donaldson and Barnes). The unit-cell parameters are a ~ 7 " 68 /~, b = 6 " 15 •, c = 8 " 88 -~, fi ~ 111 ~ 50 ' and the space group is P 21 /m = C~;. In 1966 Nichols determined the structure of tsumebite, Pb~Cu [POaSO 4 OH], which has the space group P 21 /m = C~h and parameters a = 8 - 70 A, b- 5. 80 A, c = 7 - 85 _~, fi [...] 111 ~ 30 '. Bideaux, Nichols, and Will iams (1966) described a new mineral, analogous to tsumebite, with formula Pb 2 Cu[AsO 4 SO 40 tI], the san~le space group as tsmnebite and parameters a= 8. 85 A, b= 5. 92 -~, c~ 7 " 84 A, f i = 112 ~ 36 '. Cocco, Fanfani, and Zanazzi (1967) determined the crystal structure of fornaeite, Pb~Cu[AsO 4 CrO 40 H]. Its parameters are a = 8. 10 _~, b = 5. 90 A, c = 17. 55 A, fi = 110 ~ 00 ' with space group P 21 /c = C~h.

40|$|Timroseite, Pb_ 2 Cu_ 5 ^(2 +) (Te^(6 +) O_ 6) _ 2 (OH) _ 2, and paratimroseite, Pb_ 2 Cu_ 4 ^(2 +) (Te^(6 +) O_ 6) _ 2 (H_ 2 O) _ 2, are two new tellurates from Otto Mountain near Baker, California. Timroseite {{is named}} in honor of Timothy (Tim) P. Rose and paratimroseite is named for its {{relationship}} to timroseite. Both new minerals occur on fracture surfaces and in small vugs in brecciated quartz veins. Timroseite is directly associated with acanthite, cerussite, bromine-rich chlorargyrite, chrysocolla, gold, housleyite, iodargyrite, khinite- 4 O, markcooperite, ottoite, paratimroseite, thorneite, <b>vauquelinite,</b> and wulfenite. Paratimroseite is directly associated with calcite, cerussite, housleyite, khinite- 4 O, markcooperite, and timroseite. Timroseite is orthorhombic, space group P 2 _ 1 nm, a = 5. 2000 (2), b = 9. 6225 (4), c = 11. 5340 (5) Å, V = 577. 13 (4) Å^ 3, and Z = 2. Paratimroseite is orthorhombic, space group P 2 _ 12 _ 12 _ 1, a = 5. 1943 (4), b = 9. 6198 (10), c = 11. 6746 (11) Å, V = 583. 35 (9) Å^ 3, and Z = 2. Timroseite commonly occurs as olive to lime green, irregular, rounded masses and rarely in crystals as dark olive green, equant rhombs, and diamond-shaped plates in subparallel sheaf-like aggregates. It has a very pale yellowish green streak, dull to adamantine luster, a hardness of about 2 1 / 2 (Mohs), brittle tenacity, irregular fracture, no cleavage, and a calculated density of 6. 981 g/cm^ 3. Paratimroseite occurs as vibrant "neon" green blades typically intergrown in irregular clusters and as lime green botryoids. It has a very pale green streak, dull to adamantine luster, a hardness of about 3 (Mohs), brittle tenacity, irregular fracture, good { 001 } cleavage, and a calculated density of 6. 556 g/cm^ 3. Timroseite is biaxial (+) with a large 2 V, indices of refraction > 2, orientation X = b, Y = a, Z = c and pleochroism: X = greenish yellow, Y = yellowish green, Z = dark green (Z > Y > X). Paratimroseite is biaxial (–) with a large 2 V, indices of refraction > 2, orientation X = c, Y = b, Z = a and pleochroism: X = light green, Y = green, Z = green (Y = Z >> X). Electron microprobe analysis of timroseite provided PbO 35. 85, CuO 29. 57, TeO_ 3 27. 75, Cl 0. 04, H_ 2 O 1. 38 (structure), O≡Cl – 0. 01, total 94. 58 wt%; the empirical formula (based on O+Cl = 14) is Pb_(2. 07) Cu^(2 +) _(4. 80) Te^(6 +) _(2. 04) O_(12) (OH) _(1. 98) Cl_(0. 02). Electron microprobe analysis of paratimroseite provided PbO 36. 11, CuO 26. 27, TeO_ 3 29. 80, Cl 0. 04, H_ 2 O 3. 01 (structure), O≡Cl – 0. 01, total 95. 22 wt%; the empirical formula (based on O+Cl = 14) is Pb_(1. 94) Cu^(2 +) _(3. 96) Te^(6 +) _(2. 03) O_(12) (H_ 2 O) _(1. 99) Cl_(0. 01). The strongest powder X-ray diffraction lines for timroseite are [d_(obs) in Å (hkl) I]: 3. 693 (022) 43, 3. 578 (112) 44, 3. 008 (023) 84, 2. 950 (113) 88, 2. 732 (130) 100, 1. 785 (multiple) 33, 1. 475 (332) 36; and for paratimroseite 4. 771 (101) 76, 4. 463 (021) 32, 3. 544 (120) 44, 3. 029 (023, 122) 100, 2. 973 (113) 48, 2. 665 (131) 41, 2. 469 (114) 40, 2. 246 (221) 34. The crystal structures of timroseite (R_ 1 = 0. 029) and paratimroseite (R_ 1 = 0. 039) are very closely related. The structures are based upon edge- and corner-sharing sheets of Te and Cu polyhedra parallel to (001) and the sheets in both structures are identical in topology and virtually identical in geometry. In timroseite, the sheets are joined to one another along c by sharing the apical O atoms of Cu octahedra, as well as by sharing edges and corners with an additional CuO_ 5 square pyramid located between the sheets. The sheets in paratimroseite are joined only via Pb-O and H bonds...|$|E
