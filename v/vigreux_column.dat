2500|$|A <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column,</b> {{named after}} the French glass blower Henri Narcisse Vigreux [...] (16 December 1869 – 25 October 1951), {{is a type of}} air {{condenser}} in which a glass blower has modified the simple tube to include an abundance of downward-pointing indentations, thus dramatically increasing the surface area per unit length of the condenser the <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> was invented in 1904. Such columns are often used to add the theoretical plates required in fractional distillation, and present added cost for their manufacture, which can include designs with or without an outer glass cylinder (jacket), open to air or allowing fluid circulation, or, to aid in insulation, an outer vacuum jacket.|$|E
50|$|A {{laboratory}} {{fractionating column}} {{is a piece}} of glassware used to separate vaporized mixtures of liquid compounds with close volatility. It can also be called a fractional column. Most commonly used is either a <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> or a straight column packed with glass beads or metal pieces such as Raschig rings.|$|E
50|$|Fractionating columns help to {{separate}} the mixture by helping the mixed vapors to cool, condense, and vaporize again in accordance with Raoult's law. With each condensation-vaporization cycle, the vapors are enriched in a certain component. A larger surface area allows more cycles, improving separation. This is the rationale for a <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> or a packed fractionating column. Spinning band distillation achieves the same outcome by using a rotating band within the column to force the rising vapors and descending condensate into close contact, achieving equilibrium more quickly.|$|E
30|$|Figure  2 a {{shows the}} {{complete}} setup {{used for the}} ammonium removal in which four parts can be distinguished. With a laboratory vacuum pump (4) (KNF Laboport, USA), air is drawn through the stripping and scrubbing part of the setup equipped with <b>Vigreux</b> <b>columns</b> (total length of 0.4  m, 0.032  m diameter), a commonly used laboratory fractionating <b>column</b> (1). The <b>Vigreux</b> <b>columns</b> provide in both parts an exchange surface between the gas and the liquid phase that pass in counter-current through the columns. The vacuum is regulated by a valve (2) and a cold finger (3) is used to protect the vacuum pump against the gas vapours formed. The supernatant (in the stripping part) and the sulphuric acid solution (in the scrubbing part) were introduced into three-necked flasks of 5 and 3 L, respectively. Both <b>Vigreux</b> <b>columns</b> were provided with a splash head to prevent the supernatant and sulphuric acid solution ending up in the scrubbing part and valve/cold finger, respectively, because of the air stream through the entire system.|$|R
50|$|So-called {{bubble-cap}} or valve-cap trays {{are examples}} of the vapor and liquid contact devices used in industrial distillation columns. Another example of vapor and liquid contact devices are the spikes in laboratory <b>Vigreux</b> fractionating <b>columns.</b>|$|R
30|$|Even in {{the best}} combination, the time {{interval}} that was necessary for stripping was 17  h, which is quite long. We, however, {{have to take into}} consideration that only a limited increase of temperature (323.15  K or 50  °C) and pH (8.5) was applied, as {{we did not want to}} deactivate the micro-organisms that were present in the supernatant of the digestate. The system itself was not optimized for the stripping step, but it is obvious that the process would benefit from increasing working temperature and pH. In our self-developed laboratory setup, fractionating <b>columns</b> (in particular, <b>Vigreux</b> <b>columns)</b> were used to investigate ammonium removal and to demonstrate the resulting decrease of the inhibitory effect of NH 4 + during the subsequent digestion process. However, we believe that scaling up of the results obtained (significant ammonium removal and recovery) towards pilot scale or even full scale is certainly realistic. For these scale sizes, the use of packed columns will be more appropriate instead of the commonly used laboratory fractionating columns [17].|$|R
30|$|Figure  2 b shows a {{schematic}} {{drawing of the}} stripping and scrubbing process. In the stripping part, the supernatant (thin fraction) of the digestate is continuously stirred using a magnetic stir bar and is continuously pumped over a <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> at a flow rate of 7 L h− 1 using a peristaltic pump (Watson–Marlow 520 S, Belgium). The 2000  mL of supernatant used was obtained by centrifugation of 2450  mL digestate at 4000  rpm (Jouan C 412, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The ammonium present in the supernatant is volatized as ammonia through the combination of temperature increase and pH increase. As {{we did not want}} to deactivate the microorganisms present in this supernatant—as this could negatively influence further digestion—we were limited in both the temperature and pH increase that could be applied. We used a temperature of 323.15  K (50  °C), which was the temperature of the thermophilic reactor from which the original digestate was taken, and the pH was only increased from 7.8 to 8.5 using 4  M NaOH. The heating happened with a glass hot water bath and NaOH was added dropwise with an addition funnel of 0.25 L. During the stripping process, we aimed for a significant ammonium removal of 90 %; the monitoring was done through regular sampling. The air that is drawn through the system takes the ammonia from the stripping part to the scrubbing part, which initially contains 1 L H 2 SO 4 1  M. The sulphuric acid is also continuously stirred and pumped over a <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> at a flow rate of 7 L.h− 1 resulting in the formation of (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The stirring (in both the stripping and scrubbing part) and heating (only in the stripping part) was accomplished by a Heating Magnetic Stirrer FB 15001 from Thermo Fisher Scientific (USA).|$|E
30|$|In {{our present}} study, which is {{actually}} a continuation of our previous research [23], it was examined if such a stripping and scrubbing process {{can be applied to}} selectively remove and recover the TAN present in the thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. For this purpose, a self-developed laboratory setup is built, which initially used Vigreux columns, a commonly used laboratory fractionating column. To create an intense contact between the gas and liquid phases during stripping and scrubbing, the digestate and the acid solution, respectively, were recirculated over Vigreux columns, while an airstream was used to transport the ammonia from the stripping to the scrubbing part of the installation. Comparing treated (ammonium removed via stripping) and untreated digestate (no ammonium removal) allowed us to verify if the ammonium present in this particular digestate really exerts an inhibitory effect on the biogas production or not. In a next phase, the stripping and scrubbing process was further investigated by testing different combinations of a <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> and a Dufton column, the latter being another type of fractionating column.|$|E
30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is generally}} considered {{as one of the}} most sustainable technologies for the production of renewable energy. The main bottleneck of the digestion process is the rather low conversion efficiency of organic material which is partly due to the accumulation of ammonia/ammonium. This nitrogen issue can thus be avoided by removing the ammonium present in the digestate by means of a stripping and scrubbing process. In this study, a self-developed laboratory-scale setup for stripping and scrubbing was developed and applied on a thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. This easily built system can be used to study stripping and scrubbing of any digestate. Our digestion experiments have demonstrated that after 8  days of incubation, the biogas yield is 36 % higher after removal of the ammonium from the digestate compared to the untreated digestate. This proves the inhibitory effect of ammonium at a concentration of 2.3  g L− 1 NH 4 +–N for this particular digestate. In addition, the stripping and scrubbing process ensures that ammonium is removed from the digestate and recovered in the form of (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can act as nitrogen fertilizer. The stripping and scrubbing process was investigated with three different combinations of two types of commonly used laboratory fractionating columns, namely a <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> and a Dufton column for their gas–liquid partition potential. Without optimizing for ammonium removal, the column combination Vigreux (for the stripping part)—Dufton (for the scrubbing part) could remove 87 % of the ammonium from the supernatant (obtained after centrifugation of the digestate), while simultaneously 90 % of the stripped ammonium was recovered as (NH 4) 2 SO 4. The overall efficiency for the nitrogen recovery is thus almost 80 %.|$|E
30|$|The EU {{reference}} method states some specifications for the distillation, which include that the apparatus must be leak-tight, the regularisation of the distillation rate must be possible, a rapid and complete condensation of the alcohol vapours must occur, {{and the first}} distillation fractions must be collected in an aqueous medium. As example, the EU {{reference method}} provides a classical distillation apparatus consisting of a 20 -cm <b>Vigreux</b> rectifying <b>column,</b> a 10 -cm straight-rimmed West condenser (a variant of a Liebig condenser), and a 40 -cm cooling coil (European Commission 2000). However, other suitable distillation devices may be applied, e.g. such as specified by IUPAC (1968). The only method performance requirement for the distillation apparatus is that the distillation of 200  mL of a water-alcohol solution with known concentration close to 50  % vol must not cause a loss of alcohol of more than 0.1  % vol (European Commission 2000). The classical distillation is comparably time-consuming, difficult to automate and problematic for some samples (such as liqueurs) that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For these reasons, our group has introduced the use of automatic steam distillation for the purpose in 2003 (Lachenmeier et al. 2003) [English summary version published in 2004 (Lachenmeier 2004)]. Using optimised settings of the steam-distillation device, the method had a wide application range for alcoholic beverages between 2 and 80  % vol with identical results to classical distillation. In follow-up studies, we have shown the applicability for complex matrices such as egg liqueurs (Lachenmeier et al. 2005), alcohol powders (Bauer-Christoph and Lachenmeier 2005) or cherry-spirit containing cakes (Lachenmeier et al. 2007).|$|R
30|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{to produce}} biogas {{is generally considered}} {{as one of the}} most sustainable technologies for the production of renewable energy. During this microbial process, organically bound nitrogen is released as ammonium that ends up in the digestate and finally may inhibit the process. In this study, it is investigated if ammonium can be removed and recovered out of the liquid fraction of a thermophilic digestate from a potato processor. This is achieved at laboratory scale through an easy and self-designed stripping and scrubbing process using <b>Vigreux</b> and Dufton <b>columns,</b> which are commonly used laboratory fractionating columns. The stripping is performed at pH 8.5 and at 323.15  K (50  °C), which results in the volatilization of the ammonium present in ammonia. Subsequently, the stripping gas charged with ammonia is put into contact with a sulphuric acid solution, resulting in (NH 4) 2 SO 4, which can be used as an N–S fertilizer. In addition, the digestion experiments have demonstrated that the biogas yield is 36 % higher after removal of the ammonium from the digestate compared to the untreated digestate.|$|R
30|$|The {{determination}} of the alcoholic strength in spirits and liqueurs is required to control the labelling of alcoholic beverages. The reference methodology prescribes a distillation step followed by densimetric measurement. The classic distillation using a <b>Vigreux</b> rectifying <b>column</b> and a West condenser is time consuming and error-prone, especially for liqueurs that may have problems with entrainment and charring. For this reason, this methodology suggests {{the use of an}} automated steam distillation device as alternative. The novel instrument comprises an increased steam power, a redesigned geometry of the condenser and a larger cooling coil with controllable flow, compared to previously available devices. Method optimization applying D-optimal and central composite designs showed significant influence of sample volume, distillation time and coolant flow, while other investigated parameters such as steam power, receiver volume, or the use of pipettes or flasks for sample measurement did not significantly influence the results. The method validation was conducted using the following settings: steam power 70  %, sample volume 25  mL transferred using pipettes, receiver volume 50  mL, coolant flow 7 L/min, and distillation time as long as possible just below the calibration mark. For four different liqueurs covering the typical range of these products between 15 and 35  % vol, the method showed an adequate precision, with relative standard deviations below 0.4  % (intraday) and below 0.6  % (interday). The absolute standard deviations were between 0.06  % vol and 0.08  % vol (intraday) and between 0.07  % vol and 0.10  % vol (interday). The improved automatic steam distillation devices offer an excellent alternative for sample cleanup of volatiles from complex matrices. A major advantage are the low costs for consumables per analysis (only distilled water is needed). For alcoholic strength determination, the method has become more rugged than before, and there are only few influences that would lead to incomplete distillation. Our validation parameters have shown that the performance of the method corresponds to the data presented for the reference method and we believe that automated steam distillation, can be used for the purpose of labelling control of alcoholic beverages.|$|R
40|$|Active {{component}} analysis of fermented milk flavor by gas chromatography) ABSTRACT. Fermented milk is milk processed product {{that to be}} one source of nutritious food for humans. The action of food component such as flavor is accepted, sense of taste and smell generated complex assessment of food flavors in the mouth. The flavor components of fermented milk together and {{interact with each other}} when consumed and cause the perception of taste between like or dislike. This {{is an important factor in}} developing diversification of fermented milk product so as to attract customers other than in terms of aspects of nutrition and health. Flavor is one of the most important criteria in the acceptance of a food ingredient. During processing and storage flavor change easily. This study used gas chromatography to detect the formation of the active component of the flavor of fermented milk. The purpose of this study was to determine the active components in fermented milk which is the formation of flavor. This research was conducted in the Laboratory of Animal Feed Laboratory of the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Chemistry Unsyiah and PAU Food and Nutrition IPB Bogor. This study uses a Likens - Nickerson distillation stage concentrated with <b>Vigreux</b> <b>column</b> and identified by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometer. Gas chromatography has identified that the class of acids, alcohols, esters and alkanes group forming an active component in the flavor of fermented milk although relatively varied. In yoghurt, acid found in relatively high amount of alcohol is more varied in its kind. Yogurt with single culture L. bulgaricus has more ketones and aldehydes components. Volatile components were detected mostly in kefir acids, alcohols, esters and alkane derivatives. The curd is dominated by acidic components in addition to alcohol and aldehyde...|$|E
30|$|The key to an {{efficient}} stripping process {{lies in the}} design of the contact system between the TAN-rich digestate and the gas to strip out the NH 3. The aim is to maximize the level of contact while minimizing the energy costs. The most common stripping systems use continuously packed towers [17]. Other options are spray towers, low profile units, bubble diffusers, aspirators, surface aerators and high-intensity mixers. Selection of the appropriate technology is both case and site specific. Limoli et al. [18] investigated ammonia removal from raw manure digestate by means of a turbulent mixing stripping process. Batch tests demonstrated that sodium hydroxide was the most suitable alkaline chemical to control pH, as it is easy to handle and minimizes treatment time and costs. When NaOH was applied to treat raw digestate at pH 10 and a temperature of 296.15  K (23  °C), TAN removal efficiency reached 89 % after 24  h of turbulent mixing stripping. Provolo et al. [19] investigated the performance of a stripping process based on a new concept of installation in which slow-rate NH 3 volatilization was promoted in a closed reactor containing continuously mixed digestate. Jiang et al. [20] investigated ammonia removal through air stripping of digested dairy manure using packed columns. Temperature and pH were identified as sensitive parameters for the process. When the temperature of the digestate was maintained at mesophilic level (308.15  K or 35  °C) during the stripping process, the optimized pH for ammonia stripping was 10.3 resulting in 90 % ammonia removal. In various studies, self-built laboratory setups were used to strip ammonium from wastewater or digestate. Yuan et al. [21] demonstrated the removal of ammonia from wastewater using a continuous-flow rotating packed bed as an air stripper at ambient temperature. Bousek et al. [22] studied the impact of strip gas composition on side stream ammonia stripping of digestate. For this purpose, they used a laboratory-scale batch stripping and scrubbing plant constructed from glass elements. The stripping unit was equipped with a fast-rotating pedal at the upper end that functioned as a foam destruction device. The stripper was connected to the scrubber unit via a horizontal laboratory glass tube. The scrubber column (<b>Vigreux</b> <b>column)</b> and a 1 L round bottom flask were operated in parallel current mode using 1  M H 2 SO 4 as scrubbing media.|$|E
