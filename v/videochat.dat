40|$|Bilayer {{segmentation}} of live {{video in}} uncontrolled environments {{is an essential}} task for home applications in which the original background of the scene must be replaced, as in <b>videochats</b> or traditional videoconference. The main challenge in such conditions is overcome all difficulties in problem-situations (e. g., illumination change, distract events such as element moving {{in the background and}} camera shake) that may occur while the video is being captured. This paper presents a survey of segmentation methods for background substitution applications, describes the main concepts and identifies events that may cause errors. Our analysis shows that although robust methods rely on specific devices (multiple cameras or sensors to generate depth maps) which aid the process. In order to achieve the same results using conventional devices (monocular video cameras), most current research relies on energy minimization frameworks, in which temporal and spacial information are probabilistically combined with those of color and contrast...|$|R

The topic concerned is a rather new service area which provides service to the clients in a difficult situation {{on the internet and}} which has been working for past few years in a few KI centres (workplaces). No professional has tried to search it systematically or describe it in more detail yet. Considering the fact the internet is a widely used medium in our population nowadays, a high future potential of these services can be expected in the field of psychosociology. Therefore this diploma disertation aims to give {{a detailed description of the}} on-line chat and <b>videochat</b> functioning and necessary connections at KI centres (workplaces) in order to create a quidebook to the basics of these services for specialists and amateurs who are interested in this topic. Secondly, this diploma disertation is written to inform about the process of implementing the on-line chat into KI centres (workplaces) at three contemporary providers in CR, and to make the readers understand what the whole process is about.

40|$|Parents and {{children}} increasingly spend time living apart due to marital separation and work travel. I investigated parent [...] child separation {{in both of}} these contexts to find that current technologies frequently do not meet the needs of families. The telephone is easy-to-use and ubiquitous but does not provide an engaging way of communicating with children. <b>Videochat</b> is more emotionally expressive and has a greater potential for engagement but is difficult to set up and cannot be used by a child without the help of an adult. Both telephone and <b>videochat</b> fail {{to meet the needs of}} remote parenting because they focus on conversation rather than care and play activities, which are the mechanism by which parents {{and children}} build closeness. I also saw that in both types of separation the motivation to connect at times conflicted with desire to reduce disruption of the remote household. To address some of these issues, I designed a system called the ShareTable, which provides easy-to-initiate <b>videochat</b> with a shared tabletop activity space. After an initial lab-based evaluation confirmed the promise of this approach, I deployed the ShareTable to four households (two sets of divorced families). I collected data about the families' remote interactions before and during the deployment. Remote communication more than doubled for each of these families while using the ShareTable and I saw a marked increase in the number of communication sessions initiated by the child. The ShareTable provided benefits over previous communication systems and supported activities that are impossible with other currently available technologies. One of the biggest successes of the system was in providing an overlapped video space that families appropriated to communicate metaphorical touch and a sense of closeness. However, the ShareTable also introduced a new source of conflict for parents and challenged the families as they tried to develop practices of using the system that would be acceptable to all involved. The families' approach to these challenges as well as explicit feedback about the system informs future directions for synchronous communication systems for separated families.

Throughout {{the month of}} its use, the families employed the ShareTable to participate in shared activities, share emotional moments, and communi-cate closeness through metaphorical touch. The ShareTable provided a number of advantages over the phone and was easier to use than standard videoconferencing. However, it did also introduce concerns over privacy and new sources of conflict about appropriate calling practices. We relate our findings to the larger research landscape and present implications for future work. Author Keywords Computer-mediated communication, divorced families...|$|E

This chat system was tested to ascertain if {{it was able to}} create more social presence than a traditional web conferencing system. The two systems were found to create similar amounts of social presence during use. Implications for educational use and future web conferencing systems are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an automatic segmentation algorithm for video frames captured by a (monocular) webcam that closely approximates depth segmentation from a stereo camera. The frames are segmented into foreground and background layers that comprise a subject (participant) {{and other objects}} and individuals. The algorithm produces correct segmentations even {{in the presence of}} large background motion with a nearly stationary foreground. This research makes three key contributions: First, we introduce a novel motion representation, referred to as “motons, ” inspired by research in object recognition. Second, we propose estimating the segmentation likelihood from the spatial context of motion. The estimation is efficiently learned by random forests. Third, we introduce a general taxonomy of tree-based classifiers that facilitates both theoretical and experimental comparisons of several known classification algorithms and generates new ones. In our bilayer segmentation algorithm, diverse visual cues such as motion, motion context, color, contrast, and spatial priors are fused by means of a conditional random field (CRF) model. Segmentation is then achieved by binary min-cut. Experiments on many sequences of our <b>videochat</b> application demonstrate that our algorithm, which requires no initialization, is effective in a variety of scenes, and the segmentation results are comparable to those obtained by stereo systems.

40|$|Today, cross-device {{capabilities}} {{has become}} the de facto standard among most applications, enabling users to access an application, and in some cases, resume their previous session, from a various of devices. While this allows the user to run the same application on different devices, there still exists no widespread solution providing the ability to transfer an ongoing application session from one device to another, continuing the ongoing session immediately. As users we?ve asked have considered such functionality to be of potential great value, this is definitely something worth exploring. In this thesis, we have investigated and proved that a generic, cross-device session mobility platform is possible and feasible, but not without {{a certain level of}} application modification, which we believe is a reasonable requirement. A truly generic cross-device session mobility platform should work with any application, irrespective of the type of the application and the type of terminal it is running on. This becomes a challenge, considering that the nature of an application may vary a lot from application to application. Our proposed solution, the Migration Platform (MP), is realized as a centralized peer-to-peer architecture. It consists of two entities; the Migration Server (MS) and the Migration Client (MC), the latter installed as a software on each device. Together, the MS and MC will provide any application with cross-device session mobility capabilities. Upon switching device (i. e. upon a migration), a direct data channel between source and target device is established. The state of the application about to be migrated is transferred over this data channel, and passed to the application on the target device. This enables the application to resume the application session from where it was left off on the source device. By suggesting a workaround, we also make this scheme viable for real-time communication applications. The applications that are to utilize the capabilities provided by the MP need to implement an interface to the MC, as well as a user interface enabling the user to trigger migration functions from the application. This way, the application can invoke migration functions provided by the MC, and the MC can invoke the application-specific functions specified in the interface. By having the application developers implement the required functions, we provide them with complete freedom when it comes to how they want to apply the migration functionalities, both when it comes to behavior and appearance. We implemented a proof of concept in the web environment, primarily based on the bleeding edge technology, WebRTC, an API currently being drafted, enabling browser to browser communication. Using the exact same generic scripts, we implement session mobility features in four, arguably different, demo applications; a HTML 5 video streaming application, a YouTube streaming application, a <b>videochat</b> application and a Chrome browsing extension. With this, we showcased the behavior of the session mobility features, as well as proved the viability of our proposed solution. </p...|$|E
