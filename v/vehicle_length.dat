30|$|Thanks {{to these}} results, the average {{performance}} {{analysis of a}} broadcast protocol in a network with Poisson node distribution {{can be carried out}} by simply studying a deterministic scenario, where the nodes are placed in correspondence to the average positions of the corresponding Poisson-based scenario.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a MATLAB simulation of fuzzy traffic controller for controlling traffic flow at multilane isolated signalized intersection. The controller is developed {{based on the}} waiting time and <b>vehicles</b> queue <b>length</b> at current green phase, and <b>vehicles</b> queue <b>lengths</b> at the other phases. For control strategy, the controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal waiting time, queue length and delay time. In this research, the isolated intersection model used consists of two lanes in each approach. Each approach has two different values of <b>vehicles</b> queue <b>length</b> and waiting time, respectively, at the intersection. The maximum values of <b>vehicles</b> queue <b>length</b> and waiting times are selected as the inputs to controller for optimized control of traffic flows at the intersection. A traffic model and fuzzy traffic controller are developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controllers under different conditions. In the end, by comparing the experimental result obtained by the vehicle-actuated controller (VAC) and fuzzy traffic controller (FTC) which improves significant performance for intersections, we confirmed the efficiency of our intelligent controller based fuzzy inference system...|$|R
40|$|From an {{operations}} standpoint, {{the most}} important task of a traffic surveillance system is determining reliably whether the facility is free flowing or congested. The second most important task is responding rapidly when the facility becomes congested. These tasks are {{complicated by the fact}} that conventional vehicle detectors only monitor discrete points along the roadway. The detectors are typically placed at least 0. 5 km apart and conditions between the detectors must be inferred from the local measurements. It can take several minutes before an incident between detectors is observable in the point measurements and even longer to differentiate between noise and a true incident. To address such issues, this paper uses existing detector stations to match vehicle measurements between stations and monitor the entire roadway. Earlier work has already demonstrated the methodology using effective <b>vehicle</b> <b>lengths</b> measured with dual loop detectors. This paper extends the work by presenting a method to estimate <b>vehicle</b> <b>lengths</b> from single loop detectors and then applies the vehicle reidentification methodology to these common detectors with good results. The work should prove beneficial for traffic management and traveler information applications, while promising to be deployable in the short term...|$|R

Many combinations of motor cars and trailers are possible, with individual <b>vehicle</b> <b>lengths</b> from 17 to 25 m and widths from 2.6 to 3.2 m.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} to estimate traffic speed using a sequence of images from an uncalibrated camera. We assert that exact calibration {{is not necessary to}} estimate speed. Instead, we use 1) geometric relationships inherently available in the image, 2) some common-sense assumptions that reduce the problem to a one-dimensional (1 -D) geometry, 3) frame differencing to isolate moving edges and track vehicles between frames, and 4) parameters from the distribution of <b>vehicle</b> <b>lengths,</b> to estimate speed.

40|$|Difficulties with {{an earlier}} set of {{equations}} are explained by deriving the {{equations of motion}} of a rigid body moving in a perfect fluid that is itself accelerating and contains velocity gradients.

50|$|The {{cab forward}} truck {{configuration}} is currently common among European and Japanese truck manufacturers, because the laws governing overall <b>vehicle</b> <b>lengths</b> are strict {{and the body}} style allows longer trailers or a longer cargo area for the same overall length than a standard truck (with an engine compartment ahead of a conventional cabin). Better visibility and maneuverability in tight quarters, such as for city delivery, is a benefit of locating the truck's cab up front. Large trucks of this type are most often described as cab over engine (COE) or cab over models.|$|R
