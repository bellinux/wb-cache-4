50|$|One curious {{window on}} the practicalities of ostracism comes from the cache of 190 ostraka {{discovered}} dumped in a well next to the acropolis. From the handwriting {{they appear to have}} been written by fourteen individuals and bear the name of Themistocles, ostracised before 471 BC and were evidently meant for distribution to voters. This was not necessarily evidence of electoral fraud (being no worse than modern <b>voting</b> <b>instruction</b> cards), but their being dumped in the well may suggest that their creators wished to hide them. If so, these ostraka provide an example of organized groups attempting to influence the outcome of ostracisms. The two-month gap {{between the first and second}} phases would have easily allowed for such a campaign.|$|E

[...] in Paris unilaterally designates its own candidates in Occitania constituencies without taking into consideration the remarks of the local Occitan adherents: the contemptuous and strategic choice of Paris is considered particularly scandalous in Occitania in the department of Tarn-et-Garonne and in the second constituency of the Gers. [...] "Bastir Occitania" [...] then decides to supporting in the second constituency of Tarn-et-Garonne the presidential majority (but dissident) candidacy of Thierry Hamelin whose substitute is both close to [...] "Bastir" [...] and adherent to [...] "En Marche!", and in vying with a legitimate [...] "En Marche !"

40|$|Voting represents, arguably, {{the most}} {{important}} right and responsibility of a citizen in a democracy. Nevertheless, few adults are with an intellectual or developmental dis-ability vote, and few are provided systematic instruction on voting or how {{to participate in the}} political process. Regrettably, 44 states have disenfranchisement provisions that prohibit many people with an intellectual disability from voting. These state provisions are in conflict with federal laws, which mandate that citizens with disabilities are guaranteed the same rights as citizens without disabil-ities. This study is a preliminary investigation of the per-spective of a sample of support personnel regarding the value of voting for people with an intellectual or develop-mental disability and the extent towhich they have provided <b>voting</b> <b>instruction</b> to their clients. The findings revealed that very few clients vote, are registered to vote, or are provided any instruction on how to vote or be informed about voting positions.

40|$|Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have voluntarily formed {{transnational}} {{political groups}} and invariably follow the <b>voting</b> <b>instructions</b> of these groups. This is intriguing {{as there are}} few obvious incentives for doing so. Unlike national parties, for example, the political groups in the European Parliament are not punished by the electorate if they are divided on key issues, as citizens {{know very little about}} what goes on inside the European Parliament. This paper pieces together an explanation of why the European political groups exist and why they have become so powerful by looking at the determinants of group cohesion and by undertaking a spatial analysis of voting in the European Parliament. MEPs who share preferences on a range of issues on the European Union policy agenda have an incentive to establish a division-of-labour contract and to share the costs of collecting information. Once internal party policy specialization and agenda setting has been established, MEPs have incentives to follow the <b>voting</b> <b>instructions</b> of their group owing to the advantages of cohesion in a context of repeated voting. © 2008 The Royal Society.

40|$|Among {{the various}} {{challenges}} facing unions, membership participation and workers empowerment by tools of direct participation within management concretely challenges {{the ability of}} unions of representing the diversity of workers' interests. Indeed, a participatory management involves a redefinition of the unions' strategies. Should union blame this trend of direct participation? Recently, these questions were concretely asked to the CGIL-FIOM union, in Italy. In 2010 and 2011, {{the direction of the}} Fiat Company decided to use referenda, {{in order to avoid the}} refusal of CGIL-FIOM to sign a new agreement about labour conditions in three Italian factories. The direction of the Fiat Company promised, in case of approval by workers, to maintain industrial activities and, in case of refusal, to close these factories. Consequently, the unions were confronted to as strong dilemma: what is the best way to react to this direct participation of workers? Our research about these three referenda is focused on the link between direct participation, public debate and unions' strategies. We present an argument in two main steps. Firstly, we want to show how unions have progressively inverted the democratic sense of these referenda: instead of giving <b>voting</b> <b>instructions,</b> they have chosen to indirectly fuel the public debate, by diffusing arguments and ideas towards workers. The direct participation of workers was used by unions to adopt a "deliberative" activism, to convince workers to resist. Secondly, we also questioned the limits of this strategy: whereas the rates of refusal were surprisingly high within the two firsts referenda, the workers finally decided to support the agreement for the third referendum. These high levels, indirectly supported by unions, have finally frightened the workers, who feared that their factory were definitely. It opens a discussion about the ability of unions to act efficiently within the public debate...|$|R
