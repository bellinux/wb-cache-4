25|$|During development, Saab had {{opted to}} power the type using a single large {{turbofan}} engine. Originally, the British Rolls-Royce Medway engine had been selected {{to power the}} Viggen, which was then considered to be ideal for {{the basis for a}} supersonic engine equipped with a fully modulated afterburner; however, development of the Medway engine was cancelled due to the intended launch aircraft, the de Havilland Trident, being downsized during development. In place of the Medway, Saab chose to adopt a licence-production version of the American Pratt & Whitney JT8D engine, the Volvo RM8, instead. The RM8 was heavily redesigned, using new materials to accommodate flight at Mach-2 speeds, a Swedish-built afterburner, and a fully <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Propelling nozzles {{may have}} a fixed geometry, or they may have {{variable}} geometry to give different exit areas to control {{the operation of the}} engine when equipped with an afterburner or a reheat system. When afterburning engines are equipped with a C-D nozzle the throat area is <b>variable.</b> <b>Nozzles</b> for supersonic flight speeds, at which high nozzle pressure ratios are generated, also have variable area divergent sections.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{temperature}} limitations {{with the}} gas turbines, jet engines do not consume all the {{oxygen in the}} air ('run stoichiometric'). Afterburners burn the remaining oxygen after exiting the turbines, but usually do so inefficiently due to the low pressures typically found at {{this part of the}} jet engine make the subsequent nozzle inefficient at extracting the heat energy; however afterburners still gain significant thrust, which can be useful. Engines intended for extended use with afterburners often have <b>variable</b> <b>nozzles</b> and other details.|$|R

30|$|Figures  20 and 21 {{show the}} percent {{variation}} explained by x and y, respectively. Going {{back to the}} argument of adding factor 4, using Fig.  20, {{it is easy to}} see that factor 4 is contributing to the x variations especially for the <b>variable</b> <b>nozzles</b> TFA and WOB. Thus, it is necessary to add factor 4 to the model. Figure  21 shows that only factors 1 and 2 are contributing to the variation of y. Figure  22 shows the residual plot of the ECD model, and no trend is observed on the residual plot. Thus, the model is valid.|$|R
