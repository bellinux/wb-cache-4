5|$|McClintock's {{cytogenetic}} research {{focused on}} developing ways to <b>visualize</b> and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular {{part of her}} work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using carmine staining to <b>visualize</b> maize chromosomes, and showed {{for the first time}} the morphology of the 10 maize chromosomes. This discovery was made because she observed cells from the microspore as opposed to the root tip. By studying the morphology of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to link specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 Genetics paper on the characterization of triploid maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to her 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to <b>visualize</b> the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and will build up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to <b>visualize</b> any recovered serial number.|$|E

40|$|The present {{research}} examined how actionversus state-oriented individuals (Kuhl & Beckmann, 1994) utilize their working memory capacity under varying situational demands. Participants <b>visualized</b> either a demanding or an accepting person, after which their working memory capacity was assessed. Among action-oriented participants, <b>visualizing</b> a demanding person led to greater operation spans (Study 1) and superior memory for intention-related information (Study 2) than <b>visualizing</b> an accepting person. State-oriented participants displayed the opposite pattern, such that <b>visualizing</b> an accepting person led to greater operation spans (Study 1) and superior memory for intentions (Study 2) than <b>visualizing</b> a demanding person.
