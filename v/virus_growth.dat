25|$|Interferons {{were first}} {{described}} in 1957 by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann at the National Institute for Medical Research in London; the discovery {{was a result}} of their studies of viral interference. Viral interference refers to the inhibition of <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> caused by previous exposure of cells to an active or a heat-inactivated virus. Isaacs and Lindenmann were working with a system that involved the inhibition of the growth of live influenza virus in chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes by heat-inactivated influenza virus. Their experiments revealed that this interference was mediated by a protein released by cells in the heat-inactivated influenza virus-treated membranes. They published their results in 1957 naming the antiviral factor they had discovered interferon. The findings of Isaacs and Lindenmann have been widely confirmed and corroborated in the literature.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of protein-based virus quantification assays. In general, these methods quantify either {{the amount of}} all protein or the amount of a specific virus protein in the sample rather {{than the number of}} infected cells or virus particles. Quantification most commonly relies on fluorescence detection. Some assay variations quantify protein directly in a sample while other variations require host cell infection and incubation to allow <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> prior to protein quantification. The variation used depends primarily on the amount of protein (i.e. virus) in the initial sample and the sensitivity of the assay itself. If incubation and <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> are required, cell and/or virus lysis/digestion are often conducted prior to analysis. Most protein-based methods are relatively fast and sensitive but require quality standards for accurate calibration, and quantify protein, not actual virus particle concentrations. Below are specific examples of widely used protein-based assays.|$|E

Consequently, we identified the region of the V protein that is essential for its oligomerization and for complex formation with NP protein. We also identified a host protein, AlP 1 /Alix, involved in apoptosis and efficient budding of several enveloped viruses as an interacting partner of the V and NP proteins. Depletion of AIP 1 /Alix by small interfering RNA suppressed <b>virus</b> <b>growth.</b> These data suggest that the conserved carboxyl terminus of the V protein {{plays an important role in}} <b>virus</b> <b>growth...</b>|$|E

40|$|Microbicide {{candidates}} with promising in vitro activity are often advanced for evaluations using human primary tissue explants {{relevant to the}} in vivo mucosal transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), such as tonsil, cervical, or rectal tissue. To compare <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> or the anti-HIV- 1 efficacies of candidate microbicides in tissue explants, a novel soft-endpoint method was evaluated to provide a single, objective measurement of <b>virus</b> <b>growth.</b> The applicability of the soft endpoint is shown across several different ex vivo tissue types, with the method performed in different laboratories, and for a candidate microbicide (PRO 2000). The soft-endpoint method was compared to several other endpoint methods, including (i) the growth of virus on specific days after infection, (ii) the area under the <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> curve, and (iii) {{the slope of the}} <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> curve. <b>Virus</b> <b>growth</b> at the assay soft endpoint was compared between laboratories, methods, and experimental conditions, using nonparametric statistical analyses. Intra-assay variability determinations using the coefficient of variation demonstrated higher variability for <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> in rectal explants. Significant virus inhibition by PRO 2000 and significant differences in the growth of certain primary HIV- 1 isolates were observed by the majority of laboratories. These studies indicate that different laboratories can provide consistent measurements of anti-HIV- 1 microbicide efficacy when (i) the soft endpoint or another standardized endpoint is used, (ii) drugs and/or virus reagents are centrally sourced, and (iii) the same explant tissue type and method are used.

40|$|The {{effects of}} virus {{infection}} and lysis of a marine Vibrio sp. on C, N, and P turnover {{and the growth}} efficiency of noninfected bacterioplankton were studied {{in a series of}} dilution cultures. The cultures were enriched with various sources of organic matter and N and P. The growth of the Vibrio host and the growth of the natural bacterioplankton were measured by immunofluorescence and 4 (prm 1), 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole staining methods, respectively. Lysis products resulting from infection of the Vibrio sp. caused an increase in metabolic activity and cell production by the noninfected bacterioplankton. In P-limited cultures, the addition of viruses increased the uptake of dissolved organic carbon by 72 % and the potential alkaline phosphatase activity by 89 % compared with control cultures without viruses. Our data suggest that input of available phosphorus through virus-induced Vibrio lysates occurred, which caused an increase in the bacterial nutrient uptake. The growth efficiency of noninfected bacteria was reduced in the presence of viruses compared with the control without <b>viruses</b> (<b>growth</b> efficiencies, 0. 08 (plusmn) 0. 03 and 0. 24 (plusmn) 0. 02, respectively).

40|$|The {{expression}} of the gene for the murine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) is induced in response to <b>viruses,</b> <b>growth</b> factors, and phorbol esters. In this report we show that the accumulation of TIMP mRNA after Newcastle disease virus induction is caused by transcriptional activation of the gene. Comparison of the sequences of cDNA and genomic clones along with RNase protection and primer extension analyses revealed that the murine TIMP gene possesses multiple cap sites and that the exon 1 consists exclusively of 5 '-noncoding sequences. We observed that DNA regions analogous to those found upstream of the virus-inducible interferon genes are present within intron 1 of the TIMP gene. To investigate the possible role of TIMP intron 1 in gene expression, we used a functional assay based on the transfection of plasmids in which the DNA segment to be tested is placed in proximity to a marker gene driven by the heterologous herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Our results indicate that TIMP intron 1 contains DNA sequence elements capable of modulating the activity of a heterologous promoter in two different ways: (i) by enhancing constitutive expression and (ii) by conferring virus inducibility. These results suggest that intron 1 {{may be involved in}} the transcriptional regulation of TIMP gene expression...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{on the growth}} of herpes simplex virus type 1 in trigeminal ganglia was investigated. Four-week-old mice were infected on an abrased cornea with herpes simplex virus type 1. Forty-eight hours after infection, trigeminal ganglia ipsilateral with infected eyes were removed and placed in culture. Incubation of infected ganglia {{in the presence of}} a pool of nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for glycoproteins of gB and gE suppressed <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> by greater than 90 %. This was comparable to the amount of suppression observed when infected ganglia were incubated in hyperimmune serum. Individual monoclonal antibodies were less efficient, being able to inhibit <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> by only two- to threefold. The mechanism of suppression was examined. Reduction in <b>virus</b> <b>growth</b> was observed under conditions in which all susceptible ganglion cells were infected in vitro before nonneutralizing monoclonal antibody was added. Similar results were obtained in tests with virus-infected neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, suppression of infectious progeny was seen in the absence of complement and immunologically reactive cells. Thus, neither virus neutralization nor immunocytolysis could account for the effects of antibody on <b>virus</b> <b>growth.</b> Rather, the data suggest that antibody can bind to herpes simplex virus type 1 -infected neuronal cells and suppress intracellular virus replication...|$|E
