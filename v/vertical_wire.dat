40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} circuit parameters of <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> over a lossy ground in partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) models. The full-wave PEEC formulation of the <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> is presented, and formulas of circuit parameters for the <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> are derived using the Sommerfeld integral. Frequency responses of circuit parameters are discussed for both poor and good grounds, respectively. The results are validated numerically using the numerical electromagnetic code (NEC 2). It is found that the lossy ground can be replaced with the weighted images in the electromagnetic analysis for the <b>vertical</b> <b>wires.</b> The lossy ground can be even replaced with the perfect conducting ground for the closely spaced <b>vertical</b> <b>wires.</b> The difference of the current and potential on the wires might not be significant if the imaginary part of ground dielectric constant {{is much greater than}} its real part. Using the perfect conducting ground can reduce computing resources significantly in the electromagnetic analysis.

40|$|ISBN 978 - 1 - 4244 - 5833 - 2 International {{audience}} 3 D integrated {{technology is}} a very attractive option for many advanced consumer products meeting specifications {{of the next generation}} of market key drivers such as mobile phones, set-top-boxes and HDTV. By replacing single chip packages with 3 D devices, higher transistor density and low power saving are achieved. Moreover, data travel distances shortens and the manufacturing cost decreases through die reuse generalization. Networks-on-chip are among the design paradigms that benefit the most out of the 3 D integration technology. Manufacturing processes of high density <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> are sub-optimal and the low yield and low densities of vertical interconnects make difficult the design of high performance communication fabrics. In this paper, a configurable fault tolerant vertical link is proposed for inter-die communication in stacked 3 D systems. In 3 D systems, face to high TSV defect densities, the link ensures correct inter-die communication and degrades its performance, as transmitted data is serialized and sent on functional <b>vertical</b> <b>wires.</b> For different 3 D NoC configurations, the latency degradation under uniform traffic is up to 16 % while the area overhead due to the link configuration fabric is up to 30 %, as up to 75 % of <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> are unavailable...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} density of VLSI circuits, the interconnection wires are getting packed even closer. This {{has increased the}} effect of interaction between these wires on circuit performance and hence, the importance of controlling crosstalk. We consider the gridded channel routing problem where, specifically, the channel has 3 routing layers in the VHV configuration. Given a horizontal track assignment for the nets, we present an optimal algorithm for minimizing the crosstalk between <b>vertical</b> <b>wiring</b> segments in the channel by finding an optimal vertical layer assignment for them. We give an algorithm that minimizes total crosstalk between <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> on the same V layer on adjacent columns of the grid in O(ν logν) time using O(ν) memory, where the channel has ν columns. We then extend this algorithm to consider crosstalk between wires in nonadjacent columns and between wires on different layers. Finally, we show how our algorithms can be extended to take crosstalk tolerance specifications for nets into account...|$|R
40|$|D {{technology}} promises higher {{integration density}} and lower interconnection complexity and delay. At present, however, not much work on circuit applications {{has been done}} {{due to lack of}} insight into 3 -D circuit architecture and performance. In this paper, we investigate the interconnect distributions of 3 -D circuits. We divide the 3 -D interconnects into horizontal <b>wires</b> and <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> and derive their wire-length distributions, respectively. Based on the stochastic wire-length distributions, we calculate 3 -D circuit interconnect delay distribution. We show that 3 -D structures effectively reduce the number of long delay nets, significantly reduce the number of repeaters needed, and dramatically improve the performance. With 3 -D structures, a circuit can work at a much higher clock rate (double, even triple) than with 2 -D. However, we also show that the impacts of <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> on chip area and interconnect delay may limit the number of device layers that we can integrate...|$|R
50|$|The 1981 test {{campaign}} provided valuable data and computer models for {{interaction of the}} pantograph with the catenary contact wire, and {{shed light on the}} very sensitive dynamics. Very large <b>vertical</b> <b>wire</b> excursion (over 30 cm, or 1 foot) had been observed in the 1981 tests, and were blamed on the pantograph catching up with the travelling wave it set up in the contact wire. For this reason, it was not only necessary to modify the catenary to increase the travelling wave speed, but also to fine-tune the pantograph itself.|$|E
5000|$|At low {{frequencies}} the antenna requires a good low resistance ground to be efficient. The RF ground is typically constructed of a [...] "star" [...] of many radial copper cables buried about 1 ft. in the earth, extending {{out from the}} base of the <b>vertical</b> <b>wire,</b> and connected together at the center. The radials should ideally be long enough to extend beyond the displacement current region near the antenna. At VLF frequencies the resistance of the soil becomes a problem, and the radial ground system is sometimes raised and mounted a few feet above ground, insulated from it, to form a counterpoise.|$|E

A mural instrument that measured angles from 0 to 90 degrees was called a mural quadrant. They were utilized as astronomical devices in ancient Egypt and ancient Greece. Edmond Halley, {{due to the lack}} of an assistant and only one <b>vertical</b> <b>wire</b> in his transit, confined himself to the use of a mural quadrant built by George Graham after its erection in 1725 at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Bradley's first observation with that quadrant was made on the 15th of June, 1742.|$|E

5000|$|Since the <b>vertical</b> <b>wire</b> is {{the actual}} {{radiating}} element, the antenna radiates vertically polarized radio waves in an omnidirectional radiation pattern, with equal power in all azimuthal directions. [...] The axis of the horizontal wire makes little difference. The power is maximum in a horizontal direction or at a shallow elevation angle, decreasing to zero at the zenith. This makes it a good antenna at LF or MF frequencies, which propagate as ground waves with vertical polarization, but it also radiates enough power at higher elevation angles to be useful for sky wave ("skip") communication. The effect of poor ground conductivity is generally to tilt the pattern up, with the maximum signal strength at a higher elevation angle.|$|E

In July 1968 four pairs of mice were introduced into the habitat. The habitat was a 9 ft square metal pen with 4.5 ft sides. Each side had four groups of four <b>vertical,</b> <b>wire</b> mesh [...] "tunnels." [...] The [...] "tunnels" [...] gave access to nesting boxes, food hoppers, and water dispensers.

50|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>wires</b> {{were used}} for observing transits of stars, each wire {{furnishing}} a separate result. The time of transit over the middle wire was estimated, during subsequent analysis of the data, for each wire by adding or subtracting the known interval between the middle wire and the wire in question. These known intervals were predetermined by timing a star of known declination passing from one wire to the other, the pole star being best on account of its slow motion.|$|R
