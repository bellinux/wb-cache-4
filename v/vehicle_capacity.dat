25|$|Moggill Ferry is a cross-river cable ferry {{operated}} by Stradbroke Ferries that connects Moggill and Riverview. Henry Stanley was rowing {{people across the}} river in 1873. He held the lease, which set the fees for the service from 1881-1884. In the 1940s the ferry was motorised under the joint control of the Brisbane and Ipswich City Councils, that ferry which carried four cars at a time {{is now in the}} ferry reserve on the Moggill side of the river. Sometime in the 1970s a 20 <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacity</b> vessel Stradbroke Star formerly on the North Stradbroke Island to Toondah Harbour route and owned by Stradbroke Ferries commenced servicing the crossing.|$|E

2500|$|A light railway is a British English term {{referring}} to a railway built at lower costs and to lower standards than typical [...] "heavy rail". These lighter standards allow lower costs of operation {{at the price of}} slower operating speeds and lower <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacity.</b> They were permitted under the Light Railways Act 1896 and intended to bring railways to rural areas. The London Docklands Light Railway, has more rapid transit style features than would be typical of light rail systems, but fits within the U.K. light railway definition.|$|E
2500|$|Mainstream {{transport}} {{planning in}} Europe has, by contrast, never {{been based on}} assumptions that the private car was the best or only solution for urban mobility.

Some cities outside Europe have also consistently linked transport to sustainability and to land-use planning, notably Curitiba, Brazil, Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Canada.|$|E

In the computational study, the following parameters are used: the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>capacity</b> is randomly {{generated from the}} uniform distribution with range [n/ 5,  2 n /  5]; further, its round-trip delivery time for each hospital is randomly generated from the uniform distribution with range [3, [...] 5] h.

40|$|Telebus is Berlin's {{dial-a-ride}} {{system for}} handicapped people who cannot use the public transportation system. The service {{is provided by}} a fleet of about 100 mini-buses and includes assistance in {{getting in and out}} of the vehicle. Telebus has between 1, 000 and 1, 500 transportation requests per day. The problem is to schedule these requests onto the vehicles such that punctual service is provided while operation costs are minimized. Addi tional constraints include pre-rented vehicles, fixed bus driver shift lengths, obligatory breaks, and different <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacities.</b> We use a set partitioning approach for the solution of the bus scheduling problem that consists of two steps. The first clustering step identifies segments of possible bus tours ("orders") such that more than one person is transported at a time; the aim in this step is to reduce the size of the problem and to make use of larger <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacities.</b> The problem of selecting a set of orders such that the traveling distance of the vehicles within the orders is minimal is a set partitioning problem that can be solved to optimality.

2500|$|The parkway {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1928 when {{the town of}} Smithtown deeded over [...] of land to the Long Island State Park Commission via public vote. Due to land use restrictions in Nassau County, Sunken Meadow was the first park east of New York City, because provisions for a parkway would be near impossible to build. Construction of the parkway commenced after the Sagtikos opened in September 1952, with the interchange at the Northern State Parkway. The first portion opened to traffic in November 1954 from the Northern State/Sagtikos to NY25, with a slated completion in 1956. The parkway was completed in April1957, opening on the 1st. As part of the parkway opening, improvements were made to Sunken Meadow State Park, including expanded <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacity</b> and a longer boardwalk. In 2001, the Sunken Meadow was proposed in a study to receive a widening, which would include new bus and carpool lanes.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{simultaneously}} allocating customers to depots, finding the delivery routes and determining the vehicle fleet composition is addressed. A multi-level composite heuristic is proposed and two reduction tests {{are designed to}} enhance its efficiency. The proposed heuristic is tested on benchmark problems involving up to 360 customers, 2 to 9 depots and 5 different <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacities.</b> When tested on the special case, the multi-depot vehicle routing, our heuristic yields solutions {{almost as good as}} those found by the best known heuristics but using only 5 to 10 % of their computing time. Encouraging results were also obtained for the case where the <b>vehicles</b> have different <b>capacities...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{finding that}} <b>vehicle</b> engine <b>capacity</b> {{significantly}} tended to influence driver attitude in all roads outside urban areas {{may be explained}} by the fact that more powerful vehicles not only can more easily use higher speeds but also they create the impression that slowing down is easier; this seems to be often true. This finding confirms existing results indicating that beliefs on the impact of <b>vehicle</b> engine <b>capacity</b> to driver speeding behaviour [2].|$|R

50|$|Turbine {{interchanges}} offer {{slightly less}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacity</b> because the ramps typically turn {{more often and}} change height more quickly. They also require more land to construct than the typical four-level stack interchange.|$|E
50|$|Dimensional weight favors shippers {{of dense}} objects and penalizes those who ship {{lightweight}} boxes. A box of unpopped corn kernels {{will likely be}} charged by gross weight; a box of popcorn will probably be charged by its dimensional weight. This is because the large box of popcorn takes {{up a lot of}} space but does not fill up a <b>vehicle's</b> <b>capacity</b> in terms of weight, making it an inefficient use of space.|$|R
30|$|NSGA-II is a {{population}} based algorithm and some solutions should be constructed for initialization. Clustering approach {{is used for}} construction of initial population of solutions.

30|$|The VRP {{is one of}} {{the applied}} {{problems}} in the real world. This problem consists {{of a large number of}} customers in which everyone has a known demand level.

30|$|The capacitated {{vehicle routing problem}} (CVRP) is {{a vehicle}} routing problem (VRP) in which the {{constraints}} lie mainly in the <b>vehicle</b> <b>capacities</b> and the maximum distance that each vehicle can travel (Zhang et al. 2008). The defined <b>capacity</b> of the <b>vehicles</b> makes CVRP the problem that it is, which arguably holds the closest similarity to the constraints that real life applications are under. The VRP {{does not take into}} consideration the <b>capacity</b> of the <b>vehicles</b> which play a huge role in the decision making when it comes to distribution.|$|R
30|$|The CVRP is a {{situation}} in which a number of customers with individual demands are satisfied by a number of homogenous vehicles, each with a given capacity, from a central depot. The objective of the problem is to determine the set of optimal routes traveled by a number of identical vehicles with minimal travel costs (Toth and Vigo 2002). A route is feasible when it begins and ends at the central depot, with each customer serviced exactly once, and the total demand on any route does not exceed the <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>capacity</b> (Christiansen and Lysgaard 2007).|$|R
