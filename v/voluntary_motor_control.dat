40|$|Motor {{overflow}} is involuntary overt {{movement or}} covert muscle activity that cooccurs with voluntary movement. Overflow {{is present in}} several pathological conditions, {{as well as in}} neurologically healthy children and older adults, and can be induced in healthy young adults under effortful conditions.

Issues regarding the interpretation and reporting of findings are also discussed.

40|$|Abstract. Current {{models of}} human <b>motor</b> {{learning}} and <b>control</b> typically employ continuous (or near continuous) movement commands and sensory information.

We present this model together with the results of initial simulation of robot control.

40|$|SummaryThe corticospinal tract is an {{important}} target for motor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI) in animals and humans [1 – 5]. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> output depends on the efficacy of synapses between corticospinal axons and spinal motoneurons, which can be modulated by the precise timing of neuronal spikes [6 – 8]. Using noninvasive techniques, we developed tailored protocols for precise timing of the arrival of descending and peripheral volleys at corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses of an intrinsic finger muscle in humans with chronic incomplete SCI. We found that arrival of presynaptic volleys prior to motoneuron discharge enhanced corticospinal transmission and hand <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> output. The reverse order of volley arrival and sham stimulation did not affect or decreased <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> output and electrophysiological outcomes. These findings are the first demonstration that spike timing-dependent plasticity of residual corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses provides a mechanism to improve motor function after SCI. Modulation of residual corticospinal-motoneuronal synapses may present a novel therapeutic target for enhancing <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> output in motor disorders affecting the corticospinal tract...|$|R

[...] Cognition includes perception, memory, learning, executive functions, language, constructive abilities, <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>control,</b> attention, and mental speed. The most significant, however, are inattention, thought process abnormalities, comprehension abnormalities, and language abnormalities. The extent of the impairment is variable because inattention may impair several cognitive functions. Sufferers may complain of forgetfulness, being [...] "confused", or being [...] "unable to think straight". Despite the similarities, subsyndromal delirium {{is not the same}} thing as mild cognitive impairment. The fundamental difference is that mild cognitive impairment is a dementia-like impairment, which does not involve a disturbance in arousal (wakefulness).|$|E

5000|$|Many {{theories}} of the cause of PD symptoms point {{to the death of}} dopamine-producing neurons within the central nervous system due to oxidative stress. This oxidative stress is caused by metabolism and the production of molecules known as free radicals. Accumulation of these free radicals within the brain can cause damage to neurons. Additionally, dopamine producing neurons are particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress due to the relatively high levels of metabolism associated with the production of dopamine, resulting in comparatively higher amounts of free radicals being produced by these dopamine-producing neurons. [...] The effects of dopamine within the brain are widespread, including the control of <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>control.</b> With the death of these dopamine-producing cells within an area of the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra, the central nervous system has less control over the body, resulting in the tremors and rigidity seen in patients with Parkinson's disease.|$|E

50|$|Basal ganglia are a {{group of}} nuclei of varied origin in the brains of {{vertebrates}} that act as a cohesive functional unit. The basal ganglia {{are associated with a}} variety of functions, including <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> <b>control,</b> procedural learning relating to routine behaviors. Nowadays, the basal ganglia is implicated primarily in action selection, meaning execution of a task at a given time. The main components of the basal ganglia are the striatum, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, and the subthalamic nucleus. The largest component, the striatum, receives input from many brain areas but sends output only to other components of the basal ganglia. The pallidum receives input from the striatum, and sends inhibitory output to a number of motor-related areas. The substantia nigra {{is the source of the}} striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex, and projects to the globus pallidus.

40|$|Previous brain imaging studies {{investigating}} the brain processing of scratching used an exogenous intervention mimicking scratching, performed {{not by the}} subjects themselves, but delivered by an investigator. In real life, scratching is a conscious, <b>voluntary,</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>motor</b> response to itching, which is directed to the perceived site of distress. In this study we aimed to visualize in real-time by brain imaging the core mechanisms of the itch-scratch cycle when scratching was performed by subjects themselves. Secondly, we aimed to assess the correlations between brain patterns of activation and psychophysical ratings of itch relief or pleasurability of scratching. We also compared the patterns of brain activity evoked by self-scratching vs. passive scratching. We used a robust tridimensional Arterial Spin Labeling fMRI technique that is less sensitive to motion artifacts: 3 D gradient echo and spin echo (GRASE) - Propeller. Active scratching {{was accompanied by a}} higher pleasurability and induced a more pronounced deactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, in comparison with passive scratching. A significant involvement of the reward system including the ventral tegmentum of the midbrain, coupled with a mechanism deactivating the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), suggests that itch modulation operates in reverse to the mechanism known to suppress pain.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the BMCA protocol for upper limb with the addition of shoulder voluntary tasks. The voluntary response index (VRI) was calculated from quantitative analysis of sEMG data during defined voluntary movement in neurologically intact people for comparison with that of patients after neurological injuries. The BMCA protocol included one bilateral and 4 unilateral voluntary tasks at different joints of both arms. The VRI, measured from 19 neurologically intact participants, comprises the total muscle activity recorded for the <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> task (magnitude). The calculated similarity index (SI) for each phase of each task show the similarity of "the distribution of activity across the recorded muscles" for that task in this group off participants. The VRI magnitude values from right and left sides for different tasks showed no significant difference (ANOVA: FSide: 0. 09, P =  0. 77). Therefore these values were pooled before calculating SI. SI values were higher for tasks against gravity: elbow flexion (0. 99 ± 0. 03), wrist flexion with palm up (0. 98 ± 0. 03) and wrist extension with palm down (0. 97 ± 0. 07). On the other hand, the SI values were the lowest for bilateral shoulder abduction (0. 84 ± 0. 08) and shoulder adduction (0. 84 ± 0. 08). To validate this index for clinical use, serial studies on patients with neurological impairments should be performed.

40|$|Primary {{motor cortex}} (MI) plays an {{important}} role in <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> behaviour, yet considerable debate remains on how neural processing within this brain region contributes to motor function. This article provides a brief review of the dominant conceptual frameworks used to interpret MI activity, notably servo-control during the 1970 s and early 1980 s, and sensorimotor transformations since that time. The former emphasized the use of feedback, but was abandoned because delays in sensory feedback could not permit sufficient feedback gains to generate observed patterns of limb movement. The latter framework focuses attention on identifying what coordinate frames, or representations, best describe neural processing in MI. However, studies have shown that MI activity correlates with a broad range of parameters of motor performance from spatial target location, hand or joint motion, joint torque and muscle activation patterns. Further, these representations can change across behaviours, such as from posture to movement. What do heterogeneous, labile neural representations mean and how do they help us understand how MI is involved in volitional <b>motor</b> <b>control?</b> Perhaps what is required is a new conceptual framework that re-focuses the experimental problem back on processes of control. Specifically, optimal feedback control has been proposed as a theory of the volitional motor system and it is argued here that it provides a rich, new perspective for addressing the role of MI and other brain regions in volitional <b>motor</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

In our first study, the alterations in <b>voluntary</b> <b>motor</b> functions in the upper and lower limb muscles of spastic subjects were delineated through a comparative study with age-matched controls. Moreover, the test-retest reliability was evaluated for each measure. We noted a marked reduction in peak isometric torques, associated with a tendency towards an increase in antagonist co-contraction ratios for all the muscles tested in these spastic subjects. Of interest is that the elbow flexion torque was inversely related to the clinical severity of spasticity [...] especially that of its upper extremity score. Furthermore, the peak torque was the most reproducible measure. In our second study, the effects of 20 sessions of TENS applied to the radial nerve for 60 min every weekday over 4 weeks was investigated. In contrast to placebo stimulation, TENS produced a significant reduction in upper extremity spasticity after 4 weeks and a significant decrease in the tibialis anterior co-contraction ratio after 2 weeks of stimulation. Furthermore, 4 weeks of TENS, but not placebo stimulation, led to a significant improvement in elbow extension torque as compared with the control values in the majority (67 %) of hemiparetic subjects.
