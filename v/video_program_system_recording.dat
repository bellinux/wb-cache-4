5000|$|The {{portion of}} the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which {{resulted}} in the creation of CableCARDs is known as Section 629, instructing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to: ...assure the commercial availability to consumers of multichannel <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> and other services offered over multichannel <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> <b>systems,</b> of converter boxes, interactive communications equipment, and other equipment used by consumers to access multichannel <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> and other services offered over multichannel <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> <b>systems,</b> from manufacturers, retailers, and other vendors not affiliated with any multichannel <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> distributor.|$|R
50|$|In Germany {{and some}} other European countries, the older {{standard}} <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> <b>system</b> (VPS) is in use also known as format 2. Effectively, the two systems {{do the same thing}} and most modern VCRs and stand-alone DVD recorders work with both signals.|$|R
25|$|Various {{other kinds}} of {{information}} are sent over the teletext protocol. For instance, Programme Delivery Control signals—used by video recorders for starting/stopping recording at the correct time even during changes in programming—are sent as teletext packets. A similar, but different, standard <b>Video</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>System</b> is also used for this purpose.|$|R
25|$|A {{closely related}} service is the <b>Video</b> <b>Program</b> <b>System</b> (VPS), {{introduced}} in Germany in 1985. Like teletext, this signal is also broadcast in the vertical blanking interval. It consists only of 32 bits of data, primarily {{the date and}} time for which the broadcast of the currently running TV programme was originally scheduled. Video recorders can use this information (instead of a simple timer) in order to automatically record a scheduled programme, even if the broadcast time changes after the user programmes the VCR. VPS also provides a PAUSE code; broadcasters {{can use it to}} mark interruptions and pause the recorders, however advertisement-financed broadcasters tend not to use it during their ad breaks.|$|R
50|$|Yet another {{service in}} the U.S. that relied on data {{delivery}} via the VBI like teletext, was the Guide+ (Guide Plus, {{also referred to as}} GuidePlus+ as well) service provided and developed by Gemstar. There were several models of television sets made throughout the 90s by Thomson Consumer Electronics under the RCA and General Electric brands that had built-in Guide+ decoders. Guide+ was an on-screen interactive program guide that provided current TV schedule listings, as well as other information like news headlines. Some Guide+ equipped sets from RCA even had an IR-emitting sensor that could be plugged {{into the back of the}} TV, to control a VCR to record programs which could be selected from the on-screen Guide+ listings. In some ways, this was very similar to the <b>Video</b> <b>Programming</b> by Teletext|Video Programming by Teletext (VPT), <b>Video</b> <b>Program</b> <b>System</b> (VPS), and Programme Delivery Control (PDC) features of British/European teletext.|$|R
50|$|The FRS {{responds}} to the increasing demand for access to information and the public need for one source of comprehensive environmental information about a given place. Under the major U.S. environmental statutes—the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, etc.--there was no mandate for the individual EPA programs to pool their data to create complete pictures of a facility's environmental footprint. FRS accomplishes this by matching the various <b>program</b> <b>system</b> <b>records</b> according to address matches into a singe master record.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a technique for using instruction counters to track nondeterminism in {{the execution of}} operating system kernels and user <b>programs.</b> The operating <b>system</b> <b>records</b> the number of instructions between consecutive nondeterministic events and information about their nature during normal operation.

We describe the application of this technique to four areas: Performance monitoring: The technique can be used to instrument an operating system to capture long traces of memory references. Unlike current techniques, it performs the gathering in a postmortem phase and therefore has negligible effect on the computation itself during the monitoring phase. We expect trace periods that are longer than what existing techniques can capture by orders of magnitude with little or no noticeable perturba [...] ...|$|R
40|$|As the {{proportion}} of <b>video</b> <b>programs</b> {{is expected to grow}} significantly, video services will require a huge amount of Internet bandwidth in the future.

40|$|Video broadcast/multicast over {{wireless}} access networks {{is an attractive}} research issue {{in the field of}} wireless communication. With the rapid improvement of various wireless network technologies, it is now possible to provide high quality video transmission over wireless networks. The high quality video streams need higher bandwidth. Hence, during the video transmission through wireless networks, {{it is very important to}} make the best utilization of the limited bandwidth. Therefore, when many broadcasting video sessions are active, the bandwidth per video session can be allocated based on popularity of the <b>video</b> sessions (<b>programs).</b> Instead of allocating equal bandwidth to each of them, our proposed scheme allocates bandwidth per broadcasting video session based on popularity of the <b>video</b> <b>program.</b> When the <b>system</b> bandwidth is not sufficient to allocate the demanded bandwidth for all the active video sessions, our proposed scheme efficiently allocates the total system bandwidth among all the scalable active video sessions in such a way that higher bandwidth is allocated to higher popularity one. Using the mathematical and simulation analyses, we show that the proposed scheme maximizes the average user satisfaction level and achieves the best utilization of bandwidth. The simulation results indicate that a large number of subscribers can receive a significantly improved quality of video. To improve the video quality for large number of subscribers, the only tradeoff is that a very few subscribers receive slightly degraded video quality.

The reason is that as unaffiliated <b>video</b> <b>programming</b> becomes affiliated programming, the latter is then withheld from rival MVPDs.
