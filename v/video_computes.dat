In the ED, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. Her abdomen was distended with mild right upper quadrant tenderness. The emergency physician performed an abdominal ultrasound expecting to find free intraperitoneal fluid; instead, a large, fluid-filled cystic structure was identified.

40|$|An {{overview}} {{of research in}} automated gesture spotting, tracking and recognition by the Image and <b>Video</b> <b>Computing</b> Group at Boston University is given. Approaches for localization and tracking human hands in video, estimation of hand shape and upper body pose, tracking head and facial motion, as well as efficient spotting and recognition of specific gestures in video streams are summarized. Methods for efficient dimensionality reduction of gesture time series, boosting of classifiers for nearest neighbor search in pose space, and model-based pruning of gesture alignment hypotheses are described. Algorithms are demonstrated in three domains: American Sign Language, hand signals like those employed by flight-directors on airport runways, and gesture-based interfaces for severely disabled users. The methods described are general and can be applied in other domains that require efficient detection and analysis of patterns in time-series, images or video. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of methods have been {{published}} that aim to evaluate various components of multi-view geometry systems. Most of these {{have focused on the}} feature extraction, description and matching stages (the visual front end), since geometry computation can be evaluated through simulation. Many data sets are constrained to small scale scenes or planar scenes that are not challenging to new algorithms, or require special equipment. This paper presents a method for automatically generating geometry ground truth and challenging test cases from high spatio-temporal resolution video. The objective of the system is to enable data collection at any physical scale, in any location and {{in various parts of the}} electromagnetic spectrum. The data generation process consists of collecting high resolution <b>video,</b> <b>computing</b> accurate sparse 3 D reconstruction, video frame culling and down sampling, and test case selection. The evaluation process consists of applying a test 2 -view geometry method to every test case and comparing the results to the ground truth. This system facilitates the evaluation of the whole geometry computation process or any part thereof against data compatible with a realistic application. A collection of example data sets and evaluations is included to demonstrate the range of applications of the proposed system...|$|R
