50|$|On April 5, 2007, {{at around}} 16:00 EEST (13:00 UTC) the ship ran aground on a well-marked {{volcanic}} reef east of Nea Kameni, within the caldera of the Greek island of Santorini, began taking on water, and listed up to 12 degrees to starboard before her watertight doors were reportedly closed (a report which was later refuted when the wreck was examined). The 1,195 passengers, mostly Americans and 60 Canadians, were initially all {{reported to be}} safely evacuated in {{three and a half}} hours, with four injuries. Some passengers, including a group of 77 students from Paisley Magnet School in North Carolina, were evacuated from the car ramp through the former car deck onto boats, but some passengers had to climb down rope ladders from the higher decks. The ship was towed off the rocks, and her list stabilized. Later, it was reported that two French passengers were missing. The large amount of water taken on board led to the ship sinking shortly before 7:00 EEST on April 6, 2007, only a few hundred meters from the shore.Video footage shows that, toward the end, the ship completely inverted before settling stern first onto the sea floor. It was later reported that the tip of the bulbous bow was only 62 meters (203 feet) below sea level, but the stern was in water up to 180 meters (590 feet) deep. It is feared that the wreck would soon slide deeper and sink into the submerged caldera of the volcanic island.It has been speculated that the deep, almost <b>vertical</b> <b>shore</b> of the bathtub-like caldera made it impossible to beach the ship and save her from becoming a total loss.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntertidal {{molluscs}} {{are known}} to possess specific respiratory organs that permit aerial breathing during emersion. Patella vulgata is a widely distributed intertidal species found from low-water spring tide to high-water neap tidal level. In order to determine metabolic adaptations to habitat, carbon fluxes associated with respiration and calcification of P. vulgata living at high-shore, middle-shore and low-shore levels were compared. Seasonal aerial respiration was measured using an infrared gas analyser; seasonal underwater respiration and calcification were calculated from dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. P. vulgata showed net CaCO 3 deposition at all seasons, although the high-shore level limpet annual calcification rate was relatively low due to longer air exposure. Both aerial and underwater respiration rates were highly correlated with seasonal temperature variations and followed the <b>vertical</b> <b>shore</b> gradient, with stronger fluxes for low-shore tidal level limpets and lower fluxes for high-shore level limpets that must limit energy expenditure. P. vulgata appears to be well adapted to aerial exposure, with average hourly respiration fluxes stronger in air than in water. This study demonstrates that P. vulgata calcification and respiration are reduced in upper shore levels and are important factors determining the upper distribution limit of the species...|$|E

However, the armoring has severely narrowed some beaches. Public access to the beaches has also been reduced in areas where development exists in an unbroken line contiguous to the beach.

40|$|Highly mobile predators such as {{fish and}} crabs {{are known to}} migrate from the subtidal zone to forage in the {{intertidal}} zone at high-tide. The extent and variation of these habitat linking movements along the <b>vertical</b> <b>shore</b> gradient have not been examined before for several species simultaneously, hence not accounting for species interactions. Here, the foraging excursions of Carcinus maenas (L.), Necora puber (Linnaeus, 1767) and Cancer pagurus (Linnaeus, 1758) were assessed in a one-year mark-recapture study on two replicated rocky shores in southwest U. K. A comparison between the abundance of individuals present on the shore at high-tide with those present in refuges exposed at low-tide indicated considerable intertidal migration by all species, showing strong linkage between subtidal and intertidal habitats. Estimates of population size based on recapture of marked individuals indicated that an average of ~ 4000 individuals combined for the three crab species, can be present on the shore during one tidal cycle. There was also a high fidelity of individuals and species to particular shore levels. Underlying mechanisms for these spatial patterns such as prey availability and agonistic interactions are discussed. Survival rates were estimated using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model from multi-recapture analysis and found to be considerably high {{with a minimum of}} 30 % for all species. Growth rates were found to vary intraspecifically with size and between seasons. Understanding the temporal and spatial variations in predation pressure by crabs on rocky shores is dependent on knowing who, when and how many of these commercially important crab species depend on intertidal foraging. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} diet of these species is strongly based on intertidal prey including key species such as limpets; hence intertidal crab migration could be associated with considerable impacts on intertidal assemblages...|$|E
40|$|The {{size of the}} cusps of the {{prominent}} radular tooth of seven species of molluscs which live on the <b>vertical</b> rocky <b>shores</b> of Rottnest Island varied directly {{with the size of}} conspecific individuals, but showed considerable differences between species. Siphonaria kurracheensis, a pulmonate limpet, had much smaller teeth, and Nerita atramentosa, a nerite, had much larger teeth than other species of similar size of body. Although all seven species gained food by scraping algae from the rock, > 80 % of the faeces of the chiton Clavarizona hirtosa, the nerite, and the littorine Nodilittorina australis were inorganic materials, probably superficial layers of rock. The mean rate of production of inorganic material in faeces in these seven species was directly and closely related to the mean size of the cusps of the radular teeth. One interpretation of this relationship is that it may predict the outcome of competitive interactions between species which live at the same level of the shore. The superior competitor would be the species with the greater rate of egestion of inorganic material relative {{to the size of the}} cusps of its teeth and weight of its body, as has been shown for Collisella and Siphonaria. However, other studies suggest that behaviour and the nature of the surface of the rock may over-ride grazing abilities to influence the outcome of some competitive interactions...|$|R
40|$|The fauna {{associated}} with the littoral seaweeds of St Croix Island was investigated in terms of numbers and biomass.

A model depicting feeding relationships {{and the role of}} seaweed epifauna in the littoral zone is given and suggests that epifauna feed on detritus, plankton, algae or other epifauna and are in turn preyed upon, selectively or nonselectively, by littoral macrofauna and transient predators...|$|R

No wave-tank evidence was found to support the contention that high tide shore platforms are presently being formed by storm wave activity. Notches {{on the sides of}} the blocks were caused by aeceleration of waves constricted between the block and tank sides. Such constrictton and attendant increase in velocity may also favour rapid erosion in sea arches, caves and closely spaced stacks.

40|$|Artificial {{structures}} are becoming common {{features of the}} landscape in shallow waters of urban areas, but very {{little is known about}} their ecology. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), intertidal seawalls replace considerable portions of natural habitats, including rocky shores. Previous studies have shown that seawalls and rocky shores generally support similar assemblages of plants and animals, with important differences in relative abundances of some species. The behaviour of key consumers can have a fundamental role in structuring benthic assemblages, and it is, therefore, necessary to assess whether it is changed by the replacement of natural habitats with artificial structures. This study compares patterns of movement of the common patellid limpet Cellana tramoserica between seawalls and <b>vertical</b> rocky <b>shores.</b> The distances displaced, the orientation of movement and the homing behaviour of marked individuals were recorded from day to day, {{over a period of several}} tidal cycles (14 d) and for a longer period (ca. 3 mo), on several seawalls and rocky shores. Short-term patterns of movement (1 to 14 d) did not differ between structures. In contrast, after 3 mo, although the orientation of the movement remained random on both kinds of structures, limpets on seawalls had dispersed longer distances and tended not to retain their original positions. These results suggest that long-term dispersal of C. tramoserica, rather than foraging bouts, could be altered by the replacement of rocky shores with artificial structures. Differences in use of habitat by key consumers should be incorporated in models aimed at identifying the mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of different assemblages on natural and artificial structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} distribution of nine species of combtooth blennies between {{the surface and}} 1, 5 m depth was studied at selected rocky shore sections of the Mediterranean Sea in NE Spain and the W coast of Italy. Significant differences in mean depths of sojourn {{and the degree of}} depth overlap allow the distinction of species subgroups: species preferring the uppermost shore (Coryphoblennius galerita, Aidablennius sphynx and Lipophrys trigloides), those mostly found in a middle stratum (Lipophrys canevai, Scartella cristata, Parablennius incognitus, Parablennius gattorugine) and two species with the lowest depth of sojourn (Parablennius pilicornis, Parablennius zvonimir). The relative depth position showed little seasonal variation and was similar at both Spanish and ltalian sites. The species of each subgroup which shows a high degree of spatial overlap is distinguished in other dimensions of its ecological niches, in particular by different feeding habits and differences in shelter characteristics.

40|$|Understanding the {{ecological}} role of artificial structures, such as seawalls, in shallow coastal waters {{is necessary in}} order to plan sound strategies of conservation and management of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), about 50 % of the foreshore is made of retaining seawalls This study evaluates the changes caused to natural assemblages of organisms by these structures, by comparing intertidal assemblages between seawalls and <b>vertical</b> rocky <b>shores.</b> The following hypotheses were tested: that assemblages on seawalls would differ from those on rocky shores at mid-, but not at low-shore levels; where assemblages differ between habitats, there would be differences in cover/abundances of widespread species; patterns would be consistent among locations and through time; the variability of assemblages at the scales of 10 s of cm and metres would differ between seawalls and rocky shores at mid- and low-shore levels. To test these hypotheses, assemblages on seawalls and rocky shores were sampled at three locations, at roughly 4 -monthly intervals, over a period of about 18 months. Results indicated that mid-shore assemblages on seawalls were different from those on rocky shores, but {{this was not the case}} at low-shore levels. Few taxa were unique to either habitat. Cover of common species of algae and sessile animals and abundances of mobile grazers were variable with few consistent patterns. Variability at the scales sampled differed between habitats and heights on the shore. Seawalls and rocky shores, in general, supported a similar suite of species, but patterns of abundance and variation differed among locations and from height to height in each habitat. The implications of these findings for the future management of seawalls are briefly considered...|$|R

The vertical structure of the mean longshore current is found to be well described by a logarithmic profile and a relationship between bed shear stress and bottom roughness, including the influence of ripples and mega-ripples, was also found. The vertical structure of the mean cross shore current (undertow) is modeled using an eddy viscosity closure scheme to solve for the turbulent shear stress and includes contributions from breaking wave rollers. These models of the vertical profiles of longshore and cross shore mean currents are combined to formulate a quasi three dimensional model to describe the cross shore distribution of the longshore current. This model includes turbulent mixing due to the cross shore advection of mean momentum of the longshore current by the mean cross shore current and contributions from wave rollers[URL] Commander, Brazilian Nav...|$|R
40|$|Artificial structures, such as pier pilings, {{floating}} pontoons, breakwaters and seawalls {{are becoming}} common features of landscape in shallow coastal waters of urbanised areas, in some areas, replacing considerable portions of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), approximately 50 % of the shore {{is composed of}} retaining seawalls or other built habitats. Intertidal seawalls and other similar structures provide new surfaces for colonisation by benthic organisms and therefore provide new intertidal habitats for estuarine animals and plants. They {{have the potential to}} supplement natural habitat by supporting natural assemblages, in terms of species composition and relative abundances. Alternatively, artificial structures may support only a subset of natural assemblages, provide habitat for additional species not found on nearby rocky shores, or provide habitat in which some species are consistently missing and additional species found (a combination of the previous two models). Understanding the ecological role that seawalls and other intertidal structures have in urbanised estuaries is important in planning of developments along foreshores. This study compared intertidal assemblages, at each of three different heights among seawalls and nearby horizontal and <b>vertical</b> rocky <b>shores</b> to specifically test the model that seawalls support the same assemblages of animals and plants as are found on natural rocky reefs. Hypotheses from this model were tested at three study locations by measuring abundances of animals and plants in quadrats in replicate sites on each structure. Results indicated that, at mid- and highshore levels, there were frequent differences between assemblages on natural shores and seawalls. In contrast, at lower levels, differences between assemblages on seawalls and vertical rocky reefs were small compared to differences between sites on each structure. Nevertheless, it appeared that the seawalls and rocky shores examined supported a similar suite of species and most differences were due to relative abundances and frequencies of occurrence of the species present. It is, however, premature to conclude that seawalls support similar assemblages to rocky shores until more intensive sampling has been done, specifically to search for rare species. In addition, until we have more knowledge on ecological processes in these assemblages, seawalls should not be considered as surrogates for natural shores. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.

40|$|In estuaries, {{we often}} see {{predictable}} patterns of {{spatial and temporal}} variation in both physical and biological factors. This results in an excellent system in which to study variation in population and community dynamics. Longitudinal gradients are heavily influenced by mixing of inputs from the nearshore ocean or rivers. Vertically, tidal elevation on shore is a proxy for a gradient of stress due to factors like aerial exposure or food availability. Consequently, both longitudinal position along the estuary and <b>vertical</b> position on <b>shore</b> can affect demographic patterns of benthic estuarine invertebrates and interactions between species. To this end, I documented demographic factors of the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida, along both a longitudinal estuarine gradient that is heavily influenced by the nearshore ocean and a vertical elevation gradient in Tomales Bay, California (Chapter 1). Secondly, I investigated the composition and competitive effects of the sessile community on stages throughout oyster life history along these same gradients. I also investigated competitive effects on earlier life stages in San Francisco Bay, California, which has a different estuarine structure and sessile community than Tomales Bay (Chapter 2). Position along both the longitudinal and vertical gradient in Tomales Bay influenced recruitment and growth but not survival. Increasing water residence time toward {{the head of the}} estuary best predicted recruitment patterns, while a longitudinal food gradient peaking mid-bay best predicted intertidal oyster growth. Subtidal oyster growth did not show significant longitudinal variation. Thus, while benthic and pelagic processes can be coupled in an estuarine system, this link can vary with tidal elevation. Competition directly affected earlier life history stages but not later stages. In Tomales Bay, size of recruits by the end of their first growing season was significantly reduced but total recruitment was not affected. In San Francisco Bay, we found the opposite pattern such that total recruitment was reduced by presence of competitors but growth was not affected. There was variation in both percent cover and composition of the sessile communities in each bay. These results better our understanding of how variation in habitat characteristics and life history stage together alter demography and species interactions...|$|R
