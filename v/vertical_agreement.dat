50|$|A <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> is a {{term used}} in {{competition}} law to denote agreements between firms {{at different levels of}} the supply chain. For instance, a manufacturer of consumer electronics might have a <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> with a retailer according to which the latter would promote their products in return for lower prices. Franchising is a form of <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement,</b> and under European Union competition law this falls within the scope of Article 101.|$|E

[...] The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs to plead a horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy). The prospect of establishing a violation per se is much more appealing to plaintiffs than the potential difficulty and costliness of proving a § 1 claim under the rule of reason.|$|R

50|$|Under European Union {{competition}} law, some agreements infringing Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 81(1) of the EC Treaty) {{are considered}} to be de minimis and therefore accepted. Horizontal agreement, that is one between competitors, will usually be de minimis where the parties' market share is 10% or less, and a <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement,</b> between undertakings operating at different levels of the market, where it is 15% or less.|$|E

This type of agreement may also be useful evidence for a plaintiff attempting to prove the existence of a {{horizontal cartel}}.|$|E
40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the current legal {{framework}} for <b>vertical</b> <b>agreements</b> in the EU and the US. Over the last ten years, antitrust rules governing these agreements have undergone thorough reform. In the EU, the old sector-specific block exemptions were replaced by Regulation 2790 / 99, applicable to all sectors of the economy. In addition, changes introduced to the procedural rules {{have led to the}} decentralisation of Article 81 (3) and the removal of the notification requirement. In like manner, in the US the Supreme Court has gradually taken vertical restraints out of the per se illegality rule. What Sylvania achieved in placing non-price vertical restraints under the rule of reason in the late 1970 s, the Khan judgment did for maximum resale price maintenance in 1997, whilst most recently and most significantly in 2007 the Leegin case followed suit for minimum resale price maintenance.

40|$|This report summarises the {{economic}} theory and case law {{as it relates}} to recent cases involving <b>vertical</b> <b>agreements</b> specifying horizontal price links. We first identify two classes of vertical restraints with horizontal effects, by reviewing existing case law, and show that they can be analysed using the same logic. We demonstrate that the horizontal link, although commonly referred to as a most favoured nation guarantee, is actually more akin to a price matching guarantee. Building on this, we review the main insight from the well-established literature on price guarantees to demonstrate that there was good reason for competition authorities to scrutinise recent on-line market cases. We then summarise the main insights from the very recent academic economics literature which, based on case law, has focused directly on <b>vertical</b> <b>agreements</b> specifying horizontal price links. The report concludes with recommendations arising from our existing insights and points to areas where more research is needed...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose: Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) are flexible {{to solve}} various surveying tasks which make them useful in many disciplines, including forestry. The main {{goal of this}} research is to evaluate the quality of photogrammetry-based digital surface model (DSM) from low-cost UAV’s images collected in non-optimal weather (windy and cloudy weather) and environmental (inaccessibility for regular spatial distribution of ground control points - GCPs) conditions. Materials and Methods: The UAV-based DSMs without (DSMP) and with using GCPs (DSMP-GCP) were generated. The <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> assessment of the UAV-based DSMs was conducted by comparing elevations of 60 checkpoints of a regular 100 m sampling grid obtained from LiDAR-based DSM (DSML) with the elevations of planimetrically corresponding points obtained from DSMP and DSMP-GCP.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Recent {{research}} on generation of digital surface models (DSMs) using image matching methods revealed a {{great potential of}} DSM application in forestry, especially in forest inventory. However, research dealing with DSM generation from digital aerial images are still lacking in Croatia. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was}} to present the workflow for generating high density DSM from colour infrared (CIR) digital stereo aerial images using area-based image matching algorithm. Materials and Methods: The high density DSM was generated from colour infrared digital aerial stereo images using Dense DTM algorithm of PHOTOMOD software - an area-based image matching algorithm which operates on the principle of cross-correlation approach. To evaluate the quality of the generated DSM, an agreement assessment with manual stereo measurements was conducted over three different land cover classes (forests, shrubs, grasslands) using the same images as for DSM generation. Results: The good <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> between the generated DSM and stereo measurement was achieved for all three land cover classes present at the research area. The highest <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> was obtained for the grassland land cover class (RMSE= 0. 36), slightly lower for forest (RMSE= 0. 62), whereas the lowest <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> was obtained for shrub land cover class (RMSE= 0. 83). Conclusions: The results of this research are very promising and suggest that the high density DSM generated from digital aerial stereo images and by using the proposed methodology has the potential to be used in forestry, primarily in forest inventory. Therefore, further research should be focused on generation of CHM by subtracting available DTM from the high density DSM and on the examination of its potential for deriving various forest attributes...|$|E

50|$|Exemptions to Article 101 {{behaviour}} {{fall into}} three categories. First, Article 101(3) creates an exemption where {{the practice is}} beneficial to consumers, e.g., by facilitating technological advances (efficiencies), but does not restrict all competition in the area. In practice very few official exemptions were given by the Commission and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission has agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those fixing sale prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market {{in the case of}} horizontal agreements and 15% each in the case of <b>vertical</b> <b>agreements</b> (the de minimis condition). In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve.

A major {{concern is that the}} port operator may integrate into shipping and sabotage competitors, thereby rendering the competitive auction irrelevant. The standard policy recommendation to mitigate this problem, is to ban the seaport from operating in the shipping market. Yet such a prohibition may be useless if it can be circumvented by an (illegal) underhand agreement between the port operator and a shipper. In this paper we show that a ban on vertical integration, even when underhand agreements are possible, increases welfare if combined with a (sufficiently high) floor on the cargo-handling fee that operators can bid in the auction. In the absence of such a floor, however, a Demsetz auction is worse than having no regulation of the bottleneck monopoly. Our results apply beyond the port and shipping markets, to any monopoly bottleneck that can monopolize a downstream market. The results only require that profits with an underhand <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> be lower than with legal vertical integration...|$|E
40|$|The Master's thesis {{provides}} {{readers with}} a basic analysis of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010. The mentioned regulation confers a benefit of the so called block exemption on broad spectrum of vertical agreements including in this context also certain agreements among competing undertakings. Since agreements enjoying {{the benefit of the}} block exemption are presumed to meet criteria stipulated in Article 101 (3) TFEU, the block exemption eliminates legal uncertainty which undertakings whose agreements distort competition within the meaning of Article 101 (1) TFEU would otherwise face. It follows that {{it is not necessary to}} examine such agreements on its merits. Thus, transaction costs are reduced. Structure of the thesis is chosen so that it reflects three main questions concerning applicability of the block exemption, namely whether (i) an agreement falls within the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010, whether (ii) it contains black clauses (hard-core restrictions) and whether (iii) it contains (non-severable) grey clauses. After a brief description of wider connections and general issues in Chapter One, in Chapter Two the thesis deals with the scope of Commission Regulation 330 / 2010 with respect to the notion of <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement,</b> the role of intellectual property rights, the treatment of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|While the Russian Federation {{represents}} a significant opportunity for growth, that opportunity is coupled with serious risks. As {{it relates to}} managing product distribution, Russian vertical restraint law remains significantly more restrictive {{than that of the}} U. S. and, since unless a company is fully integrated, it must manage its distribution system by way of vertical agreements, presents a large problem for businesses seeking to conduct business in Russia. While Russia has made significant steps in the right direction, the lack of consistent application of economic analysis to evaluation of vertical restraints leaves companies exposed. Further, the sometimes inconsistent application of the laws also makes it hard to predict how any particular <b>vertical</b> <b>agreement</b> would be evaluated. Neither American nor Russian antitrust laws establish a list of possible vertical restraints. Thus, there is no exhaustive guidance regarding how these restraints should be treated. U. S. antitrust laws, however, generally place all vertical restraints into one of two categories, intrabrand restraints and interbrand restraints. Intrabrand restraints are those that restrain the downstream firm’s freedom with regard to the resale of the product at issue (distribution restrictions). Interbrand restraints are those that restrict a downstream or upstream firm’s freedom to deal with competitors of the firm imposing the restraint (interbrand restrictions). It should be noted that Russian law does not make this distinction. </span...|$|E

Evidence presented here implies a non-transitory reduction in the degree of price discrimination against Swiss customers of medium- and large-sized cars in the years after the Notice came into effect. The total gain to Swiss buyers of cars is very conservatively estimated to be six times the total cumulative budget of the Swiss Competition Commission during the years 2003 - 2006; the best estimate of those gains exceed a quarter of a billion Swiss Francs during the same period. By 2006 the cumulative price reduction of the Swiss Competition Commission's action resulted in average savings per medium- and large-sized car that are estimated to be 929 and 2113 Swiss Francs, respectively. Moreover, the recurring annual gain to Swiss consumers of this measure by the Swiss Competition Commission is conservatively estimated to exceed ten times the latter's current annual budget, providing some indication of the "value for money" that effective competition law can have, even in economies with ostensibly open borders. competition law, <b>vertical</b> <b>agreements,</b> motor vehicle trade, Switzerland...|$|R
