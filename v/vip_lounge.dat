500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good. His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how you {{came up in the}} hood and how you had to make it out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite so much about the marriage or the divorce", Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's <b>VIP</b> <b>lounge,</b> appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him.

500|$|... "Migrate" [...] is an up-tempo hip hop club track. Lyrically, it {{is about}} the freedom and {{independence}} of a girls' night out. It documents Carey's whereabouts and where she migrates from and to: [...] "from the car to the club to the bar to the <b>VIP</b> <b>lounge</b> to the after-party to the hotel" [...] and contains a reference to Patrón, a brand of Mexican tequila. As the song is about movement from one place to another, T-Pain tells her to [...] "bounce" [...] in response. Carey displays a sense of [...] "confident, social forwardness" [...] on [...] "Migrate". Nick Levine of Digital Spy thought that Carey sounded her [...] "most diva-like" [...] on the song, with the references to champagne being [...] "compliments of the club" [...] while the DJ plays her [...] "jam". Melodically, Carey delivers the track over a [...] "repeating" [...] chorus backed by a [...] "descending echo-synth". It contains a reduced number of notes in order to further accentuate the hook. While Carey employs a [...] "sassy" [...] tone of voice, both her and T-Pain's vocals are processed with Auto-Tune. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic thought that the use of Auto-Tune on Carey's vocals served a [...] "dual purpose", and explained that while it [...] "camouflages her slightly diminishing range" [...] it also made her sound [...] "modern". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt that T-Pain sounded more interesting than Carey despite the use of Auto-Tune.|$|E
