5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their <b>voices</b> <b>against</b> the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Tension between {{whites and}} Chinese {{immigrants}} in the late 19th century American West was particularly high, especially in the decade preceding the violence. The massacre in Rock Springs was the violent outburst of years of anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States. The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act suspended Chinese immigration for ten years, but not before thousands of immigrants came to the American West. Most Chinese immigrants to Wyoming Territory took jobs with the railroad at first, but many ended up employed in coal mines owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. As Chinese immigration increased, so did anti-Chinese sentiment from whites. The Knights of Labor, {{one of the foremost}} <b>voices</b> <b>against</b> Chinese immigrant labor, formed a chapter in Rock Springs in 1883, and most rioters were members of that organization. However, no direct connection was ever established linking the riot to the national Knights of Labor organization.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the victorious}} Allies of World War I had {{prohibited}} {{the union of}} Austria and Germany, their reaction to the Anschluss was mild. Even the strongest <b>voices</b> <b>against</b> annexation, particularly those of Fascist Italy, France and Britain (the [...] "Stresa Front") were not backed by force. In the House of Commons Chamberlain said that [...] "The hard fact is that nothing could have arrested what has actually happened [...] unless this country and other countries had been prepared to use force." [...] The American reaction was similar. The international reaction {{to the events of}} 12 March 1938 led Hitler to conclude that he could use even more aggressive tactics in his plan to expand the Third Reich. The Anschluss paved the way for Munich in September 1938 because it indicated the likely non-response of Britain and France to future German aggression.|$|E
2500|$|Nottinghamshire NUM {{executive}} Henry Richardson {{argued that}} the Nottinghamshire miners would have probably voted for strike had they not been subjected to so much intimidation {{within days of the}} walk-out in Yorkshire, which prompted many to defy the Yorkshire pickets as a matter of principle. [...] At some pits, most miners initially refused to cross picket lines formed by Welsh miners but returned to work when more aggressive pickets arrived from Yorkshire. [...] After the strike, Mick McGahey, {{one of the most prominent}} <b>voices</b> <b>against</b> a national ballot, said that he accepted [...] "some responsibility" [...] for alienating the Nottinghamshire miners through aggressive picketing. [...] Jonathan and Ruth Winterton have suggested that the greater success of picketing in Lancashire, a region with little tradition of militancy, might be ascribed to the more cautious tactics of the North Yorkshire area of the NUM, which worked with local officials in Lancashire to coordinate respectful picketing, in contrast to the aggressive tactics adopted by the Doncaster NUM in Nottinghamshire. The Marxist academic Alex Callinicos has suggested that the NUM officials had failed to make the case to their members adequately and believes that the Nottinghamshire miners were simply ignorant of the issues.|$|E

Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical <b>voices</b> <b>against</b> the casting. When asked about casting a white cast to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
