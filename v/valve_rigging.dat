By examining the surfaces of stem and packing after testing by microscopy and EDX, {{it is possible to}} define the tribological circuit which controls the behavior of the interface, and hence to explain the physics which underlies the experimental observations. This opens the way to novel and more effective methods for the design of stem seals for low friction and leakage...|$|R

Lighting plays a dynamic role in the game. While Tapp begins with a lighter, other light sources such as flashlights or camera flashes can be found later in the game. Minigames are {{a major part of the}} game. These include a searching game in which an X-ray view is used to avoid dangers like razors or syringes, and a game that involves grabbing a key before a [...] "Pain meter" [...] fills and wounds Tapp. Other puzzle minigames include powering fuse boxes, placing rotating gears in a box, and aligning steam <b>valves.</b> Doors <b>rigged</b> with shotguns attached to pulleys are in place all around the asylum. When the player encounters one of these doors, they must press a randomly assigned button before the pulley falls too far, or the gun will discharge. There are puzzles called [...] "environmental traps", in which Tapp must use different elements in the environment, use the in-game camera, or go to certain locations to accomplish a task.|$|R

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} testing rig is {{a machine}} {{that is used to}} test the hydraulic valves. The present testing rigs are used according to only some particular specification, but in ourproject we have developed a process and implemented the idea for building a UniversalHydraulic Testing Rig which can be able to test any kind of valves with simple adjustments. The hydraulic valves are mainly designed to carry out the flow of the hydraulic fluid with thedesired pressures. But it is observed that there are many pressure losses in the flow whichleads to the unreached flow pressures as expected. In a pre-project to this work a patentedhydraulic valve designed to improve the flow pressure of the hydraulic fluid. The main targetof the design of the valve is to decrease pressure losses and give maximum output from theother end of the valve. The Hydraulic Testing Rig is designed with the help of design softwareand flow simulation process helps to know about the pressure flow from inlet to outlet ofthe valve. After the testing of the design, the valve is tested on the new universal hydraulictest rig developed in this project. With the future use of the hydraulic <b>valve</b> test <b>rig,</b> thesimilarities and variations are observed from both the simulations done and test results canbe compared to optimize the valve design further. With the combination of hydraulic test rigand redesign hydraulic valve we will provide and experimental test rig possibility to bringthe better and maximum design that could be attained reducing the energy losses in hydraulicvalve designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry and the}} design of engines are strongly ruled by performance and legislation demands. First order aspects defining the main functions of a component are well known and new challenges appear at a lower scale. Wear reduction {{is defined as a}} second order problem and requires decreasing the scale of observation of components down to roughness. This thesis work and its aim lie within the scope of wear improvements and are focused on the injection cam/roller contact of heavy duty diesel engines. In order to reach the aim several material and methods are used: a <b>valve</b> train <b>rig</b> test, roughness characterisation and different manufacturing processes. It is shown by experiments that the flank and nose of injection cams are specific areas with specific roughness (higher density of summits Sds) compared {{to the rest of the}} cam. The wear is characterized by rounded-off of summits (Ssc). From those results and since wear processes are strongly linked to the pressure generated between the mating surfaces, the development of a rough contact model is of great interest. An elastic rough contact model is implemented and improved later on by an elasto-plastic description of materials. The simulations are validated by a wear test and are used to rank the ability of surfaces (both cam and roller) to face wear problems. The ratio of plastically deformed peaks shows that the flank and nose of the cam are reacting badly to pressures. Additionally the rough contact allows ranking/optimization of different machining processes with respect to their expected functional contact performance. Future work will be to use such a model to choose a good combination of surfaces (cam and roller) in order to reduce wear...|$|R
40|$|A {{brake pipe}} system {{consisting}} of 120 m of pipe and four triple valves was assembled {{to test the}} response of the pipe and triple valves with variations on branch pipe, bulb size and the triple <b>valve</b> design. The <b>rig</b> included one combined reservoir relay type and three triple valves directly connected to auxiliary reservoirs and cylinders. The research work established {{that it was possible to}} propagate valve operations in a pipe at sonic velocity if pressure profiles and bulb volumes were optimal. The reasons why propagations are limitedto 100 - 150 m/s for minimum and service applications and 250 m/s for emergency applications are discussed. It was also established that larger ‘gulps’ in brake pipe pressure can be achieved with either larger bulbsand/or less restrictions to bulb mass flow. Branch pipe diameter was also found to be significant to bulbmass flows. The change to the use of combined reservoir relay type systems was identified as a significant source of reduced performance of the bulb resulting in reduced ‘gulp’ in the brake pipe. Recommendations are made for the improvement of existing systems and for directions of future research...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Despite the {{extensive}} research work {{carried out on}} flow through short square-edged orifice plates {{over the last century}} (e. g. Johansen, 1930; Benedict, 1977; Alvi et al., 1978; Swamee, 2005; ESDU, 2007), gaps in the engineering data still exist for certain ranges of flow conditions and geometries. The majority of data available in the literature are for Newtonian fluids in the turbulent flow regime (ESDU, 2007). Insufficient data have been observed for the orifice with pipe diameter ratio, β = 0. 2, in the laminar flow regime. There are no experimental data for β = 0. 3 and 0. 57. The objective of this thesis was to conduct wide-ranging experimental studies of the flow in orifice plates, which included those geometrical configurations, by measuring pressure loss coefficients and discharge coefficients across the orifice plates using both Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The test work was conducted on the <b>valve</b> test <b>rig</b> at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Four classical circular short square-edged orifice plates having, β = 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 57 and 0. 7, were tested. In addition, two generation 0 Von Koch orifice plates (Von Koch, 1904), with equivalent cross sectional area were also tested for β = 0. 57. Water was used as Newtonian fluid to obtain turbulent regime data and also for calibration purposes to ensure measurement accuracy and carboxymethyl cellulose, bentonite and kaolin slurries were used at different concentrations to obtain laminar and transitional loss coefficient data. The hydraulic grade line method was used to evaluate pressure loss coefficients (Edwards et al., 1985), while the flange tap arrangement method was used to determine the discharge coefficients (ESDU, 2007). A tube viscometer with three different pipe diameters was used to obtain the rheological properties of the fluids. The results for each test are presented in the form of pressure loss coefficient (kor) and discharge coefficient (Cd) against pipe Reynolds number (Re...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis was undertaken {{as part of a}} project to design and build an electro-hydraulic vibration testing machine of unusual configuration using the limited manufacturing facilities of the departmental workshops of the Engineering School of the University of Tasmania. A sketch showing the basic concept of the vibrator design is shown in Chapter 1. Technical limitations concerning available means of measurement and manufacture resulted {{in the development of a}} series of four-way spool valves featuring thin axial flutes milled in the spool lands to limit the area gradient and allow, a long stroke relative to the flow rating of the <b>valve.</b> An experimental <b>rig</b> to measure spool forces and flow characteristics under various static and dynamic conditions is {{described in}} detail. Difficulties experienced in the operation of the rig are discussed together with suggested lines of rig development. Digital simulation of hydraulic servo-mechanisms by the Runge Kutta technique is examined in detail particularly with respect to the causes of numerical instability. An alternative approach based on the Method of Characteristics is also described and found to be particularly useful for systems containing long pipelines. The latter method is based on the velocity of pressure propagation in the fluid media and the results of an experimental investigation to determine this velocity as a function of pressure in a flexible high pressure hose are presented...|$|R
40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{requirements for}} the degree Master Technology: Chemical Engineering in the FACULTY OF ENGINEERING at the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, 2009 The prediction of the energy losses when designing pipeline and pumping systems requires accurate loss coefficient data. But the loss coefficient data found in the open literature was not adequate for predicting the loss coefficient for Saunders straight-through diaphragm valves. As more accurate loss coefficient data to enable more efficient pipeline designs are scarce in the open literature, it is problematic to predict the head loss due to the pipeline fittings, and particularly for diaphragm valves. Most of the data given in the literature are for turbulent flow based on water. Due to water shortages mining operations are forced to increase their solids concentrations and to operate in laminar flow (Slatter, 2002). Consequently {{there is a need}} to determine loss coefficient data in laminar flow for valves used in these industries to ensure energy efficient designs (Pienaar et al., 2001; 2004) or if needed, to derive a new correlation to predict losses through Saunders diaphragm valves. However, a systematic study of various sizes of diaphragm valves of different manufacturers to ascertain, if the same loss coefficient can be applied, has never been done. Therefore a comparison will be made between the data produced in this work and the existing correlations. The objective of this research was to determine loss coefficient data in laminar, transitional and turbulent flow for the Saunders type straight-through diaphragm valves ranging from 40 mm to 100 mm in the fully open, 75 %, 50 % and 25 % open positions, using a range of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The test work was conducted on the <b>valve</b> test <b>rig</b> in the Flow Process Research Centre at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. This work investigated only Newtonian and time independent homogeneous non-Newtonian fluids or slurries flowing through Saunders straight-through diaphragm valves in the turbulent, transitional and laminar regimes. Weir-type Saunders valves and time-dependent fluid behaviour were not investigated in this study. Preamble Non-Newtonian Loss Coefficients for Saunders Diaphragm Valves A Mume Kabwe The results for each test are presented in the form of valve loss coefficient (kvalve) against Reynolds number (Re). This thesis adds new loss coefficient data to the open literature, and a new correlation, which will be useful for designing pipelines in industries, as well as contributing to the academic debate in this discipline...|$|R
40|$|At the NASA Glenn Research Center, a {{characterization}} rig {{was designed}} and constructed {{for the purpose of}} evaluating high bandwidth liquid fuel modulation devices to determine their suitability for active combustion control research. Incorporated into the rig s design are features that approximate conditions similar to those that would be encountered by a candidate device if it were installed on an actual combustion research rig. The characterized dynamic performance measures obtained through testing in the rig are planned to be accurate indicators of expected performance in an actual combustion testing environment. To evaluate how well the characterization rig predicts fuel modulator dynamic performance, characterization rig data was compared with performance data for a fuel modulator candidate when the candidate was in operation during combustion testing. Specifically, the nominal and off-nominal performance data for a magnetostrictive-actuated proportional fuel modulation valve is described. Valve performance data were collected with the characterization rig configured to emulate two different combustion rig fuel feed systems. Fuel mass flows and pressures, fuel feed line lengths, and fuel injector orifice size was approximated in the characterization <b>rig.</b> <b>Valve</b> performance data were also collected with the valve modulating the fuel into the two combustor rigs. Comparison of the predicted and actual valve performance data show that when the valve is operated near its design condition the characterization rig can appropriately predict the installed performance of the valve. Improvements to the characterization rig and accompanying modeling activities are underway to more accurately predict performance, especially for the devices under development to modulate fuel into the much smaller fuel injectors anticipated in future lean-burning low-emissions aircraft engine combustors...|$|R
