500|$|Hippocratic {{medicine}} was humble and passive. The therapeutic approach {{was based on}} [...] "the healing power of nature" [...] ("vis medicatrix naturae" [...] in Latin). According to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to re-balance the four humours and heal itself (physis). Hippocratic therapy focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, Hippocrates believed [...] "rest and immobilization [...] of capital importance." [...] In general, the Hippocratic {{medicine was}} <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> the patient; treatment was gentle, and emphasized keeping the patient clean and sterile. For example, only clean water or wine were ever used on wounds, though [...] "dry" [...] treatment was preferable. Soothing balms were sometimes employed.|$|E

500|$|Following {{her first}} {{appearance}} in 1969, Driver remained {{in the role of}} Betty continuously. She suggested in 1999 that if she gave up she would die [...] "within a month from sheer boredom". In a 2006 interview she laughed off the notion of retirement, saying: [...] "From day one on The Street everyone has been <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> me. In fact, I'm godmother to Bill Roache's son. So as long as they want me, I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was {{very much a part of}} plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations. Driver died on 15 October 2011, having appeared in over 2,800 episodes of Coronation Street.|$|E
500|$|Within {{four days}} prior to the release, Yeezus was leaked online. The New York Times wrote that the leak [...] "stirred up a Twitter frenzy" [...] and {{received}} widespread media coverage. The Washington Post commented on {{the significance of the}} leak: [...] "Kanye West’s new album didn’t leak online over the weekend. It gushed out into the pop ecosystem like a million barrels of renegade crude — ominous, mesmerizing and of great consequence." [...] Critics were <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> Yeezus regarding critical reviews, but others viewed the release as [...] "musical and commercial suicide," [...] and [...] "fans live-blogged their own befuddlement on Twitter and Facebook." [...] The New Yorker Sasha Frere-Jones suggests that Yeezus may be preferred over any of West's previous works in coming decades by a new generation due to the [...] "lean vibrancy" [...] of the album. [...] "One of the most fascinating aspects of Yeezus arrival is the discursive crisis it's caused, produced by a fast-react culture colliding with a work of art so confounding," [...] wrote The Atlantic columnist Jack Hamilton.|$|E
500|$|The Duchess of Marlborough was angered when Abigail {{moved into}} rooms at Kensington Palace that Sarah {{considered}} her own, though she rarely if ever used them. In July 1708, {{she came to}} court with a bawdy poem written by a Whig propagandist, probably Arthur Maynwaring, that implied a lesbian relationship between Anne and Abigail. The Duchess wrote to Anne telling her she had damaged her reputation by conceiving [...] "a great passion for such a woman... strange and unaccountable". Sarah thought Abigail had risen above her station, writing [...] "I never thought her education was such as to make her fit company for a great queen. Many people have liked the humour of their chambermaids and have been <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> them, but 'tis very uncommon to hold a private correspondence with them and put them upon {{the foot of a}} friend." [...] While some modern commentators have concluded Anne was a lesbian, most have rejected this analysis. In the opinion of Anne's biographers, she considered Abigail nothing more than a trusted servant, and was a woman of strong traditional beliefs, who was devoted to her husband.|$|E

He persuaded the republicans that he was the least monarchist of the monarchists, and persuaded the monarchists that he was the least republican of the republicans. On 30 August 1871, the Assembly voted 494 to 94 to change the title of Thiers from Chief of the Executive Power to President of the Republic, under the authority of the National Assembly. It was a remarkable political achievement; the Third Republic had been created with the votes of the anti-republican monarchists. In private, he was not <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> the assembly; [...] he told a friend that [...] "I have an Assembly of 150 insurgents [...] and four hundred poltrons (chicken-hearts).

Conductor Leo Blech wasn't <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> her and, as she wrote in her autobiography, she even contemplated suicide after the performance. In 1947 she claimed national attention as Verdi's Lady Macbeth under Fritz Busch. A wealth of parts followed, from Strauss and Verdi to Wagner, Puccini, and Tchaikovsky. In Stockholm she built up a steady repertoire of roles in the lyric-dramatic field, including Donna Anna, Aida, Lisa, Tosca, Venus, Sieglinde, Senta and the Marschallin, one of her favourite roles (though she later lamented that she was never asked to sing it outside of Stockholm), [...] all sung in Swedish.

Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.

2500|$|Though {{the public}} {{response}} to Scott was generally favorable during the Paramount years, the film critics were less so, repeatedly making unfavorable comparisons to Lauren Bacall and Tallulah Bankhead, beginning with Bob Thomas' March 1945 comment about her screen test: [...] "Her throaty voice may well make Lauren Bacall {{sound like a}} mezzo soprano." [...] When the most prominent critic of the era, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, gave a bad review of You Came Along (1945), Scott's film debut, she recalled, [...] "Being very young and naïve at the time, I didn't know you weren't supposed to do such things, so I called him up and complained.

2500|$|Lucas's {{decision}} to cast [...] "unknowns" [...] was not taken favorably {{by his friend}} Francis Ford Coppola and the studio. Lucas needed an established actor to play the important Obi-Wan Kenobi character. Producer Gary Kurtz said, [...] "The Alec Guinness role required a certain stability and gravitas as a character... which meant we needed a very, very strong character actor to play that part." [...] Before Guinness was cast, Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune (who starred in Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress) was considered for the role. According to Mifune's daughter, Mika Kitagawa, her father turned down Lucas' offers for Kenobi and Darth Vader because [...] "he was concerned about how the film would look {{and that it would}} cheapen the image of samurai... At the time, sci-fi movies still looked quite cheap as the effects were not advanced and {{he had a lot of}} samurai pride." [...] Guinness was one of the few cast members who believed that the film would be successful; he negotiated a deal for 2% of the one-fifth gross royalties paid to George Lucas, which made him quite wealthy in later life. He agreed to take the part of Kenobi on the condition that he would not have to do any publicity to promote the film. Lucas credited him with inspiring the cast and crew to work harder, saying that Guinness contributed significantly to the completion of the filming. Harrison Ford said, [...] "It was, for me, fascinating to watch Alec Guinness. He was always prepared, always professional, always <b>very</b> <b>kind</b> <b>to</b> the other actors.
