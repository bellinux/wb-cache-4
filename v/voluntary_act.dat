5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common in the 4th century BC and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the 1st century AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BC in the island of Thasos. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, but in most cases the documentation deals with a <b>voluntary</b> <b>act</b> {{on the part of the}} master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).|$|E

Some countries like the United States have avoided the common law conclusion in Regina v.

25|$|There may be {{evidence}} of retainer sacrifice {{in the early}} dynastic period at Abydos, when {{on the death of}} a King he would be accompanied with servants, and possibly high officials, who would continue to serve him in eternal life. The skeletons that were found had no obvious signs of trauma, leading to speculation that the giving up of life to serve the King may have been a <b>voluntary</b> <b>act,</b> possibly carried out in a drug induced state. At about 2800 BCE any possible evidence of such practices disappeared, though echoes are perhaps to be seen in the burial of statues of servants in Old Kingdom tombs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{corporate}} sponsors are criticized {{for having a}} conflict of interest. For example, some of the prominent sponsors of these advertisements include businesses that sell the expensive equipment needed to perform screening mammography; {{an increase in the}} number of women seeking mammograms means an increase in their sales, which has led critics to say that their sponsorship is not a <b>voluntary</b> <b>act</b> of charity, but an effort to increase sales. The regulated drug and medical device industry uses the color pink, positive images, and other themes of the pink ribbon culture in direct-to-consumer advertising to associate their breast cancer products with the fear, hope, and wholesome goodness of the breast cancer movement. This is particularly evident in advertisements designed to sell screening mammograms.|$|E

40|$|The body-of-Christ-metaphor: {{instrument}} for the effective {{execution of the}} missional commission Practice suggests that many AFM pastors are possibly so busy with numerous tasks and responsibilities that {{they are unable to}} effectively mobilise their assembly members to actively partici- pate in <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts</b> of service (cf. Eph. 4 : 12). The conse- quence is that such assemblies are often unable to function effectively in the carrying out of the missional commission (according to Matt. 28 : 19). Pastors are unsuccessful in working more effectively through the mobilisation of their members as part-time voluntary workers in the carrying out of the missional commission, according to the advice Moses’ father-in-law gave him (cf. Ex. 18).   The mobilisation of members takes place through the empower- ing of members to discover and develop their gifts and allowing their involvement in <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts</b> of service. The emphasis of this article lies in what Hendriks (2004 : 11) calls “congregational theology”. According to Hendriks (2004 : 25) congregational theology is a theology being practised by body-of-Christ-meta- phor assemblies (cf. Eph. 4 : 11 - 16). The metaphor of assem- blies choosing to function as the body-of-Christ where the importance of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts</b> of service of members is emphasised enjoys further development in this article...|$|R

25|$|Ius migrationis: The {{right to}} {{preserve}} one's level of citizenship upon relocation to a polis of comparable status. For example, {{members of the}} cives Romani (see below) maintained their full civitas when they migrated to a Roman colony with full rights under the law: a colonia civium Romanorum. Latins also had this right, and maintained their ius Latii if they relocated to a different Latin state or Latin colony (Latina colonia). This right did not preserve one's level of citizenship should one relocate to a colony of lesser legal status; full Roman citizens relocating to a Latina colonia were reduced {{to the level of}} the ius Latii, and such a migration and reduction in status had to be a <b>voluntary</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E

40|$|Certain {{questions}} can be asked considering New Testament guidelines {{with regard to the}} functioning and expectations of an assembly structure surrounding the origin of the AFM church: Is the ministry of the AFM-pastor and member still relevant? Are the pastors successful in effectively guiding their assemblies in making use of their own members for <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts</b> of service? This entails the caring of their member and the execution of the assemblies’ missional command? How can the pastors systematize their ministries {{in such a way that}} the equipping task of members can be made more effective? This task implies the discovery and equipping of members for <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts</b> of service in the assembly as described amongst others in Ephesians 4 : 12. The purpose of this article is to provide a better understanding concerning the body-of-Christ-metaphor: ministry of an AFM assembly member...|$|R
40|$|During recent decades, Benjamin Libet’s {{experiments}} on awareness of <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts</b> {{have been a}} focus of the interest of neuroscientists and philosophers. As is well known, Libet has shown that awareness of intending to act “here and now” (for example, the free and spontaneous decision to bend the wrist) is preceded by {{about a half a}} second of measurable electric change of the motor cortex. More recent experiments have even shifted the neural anticipation to 10 seconds. The current paper has two main aims. Firstly, it presents a comparison between the results of these experiments and what Aristotle and Kant have argued about the role played by the arational element in conscious <b>voluntary</b> <b>acts.</b> Secondly, it provides an analysis of the limits of the peculiar condition in which the experiments have been carried out {{as well as of the}} interpretation of their results...|$|R
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is a small}} region at {{the base}} of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size.

2500|$|It is {{reasonable}} to designate this moment as the discovery of Yucatán [...] even [...] "of Mexico", if one uses [...] "Mexico" [...] {{in the sense of}} the borders of the modern nation state [...] but it should be noted that Hernández's expeditionaries were not the first Spaniards to tread on Yucatán. In 1511 a boat of the fleet of Diego de Nicuesa, which was returning to Hispaniola, wrecked near the coast of Yucatán, and some of its occupants managed to save themselves. At the moment in which the soldiers of Hernández saw and named El gran Cairo, two of those shipwrecked sailors, Jerónimo de Aguilar and Gonzalo Guerrero, were living in the area of Campeche, speaking the Mayan dialect of the area, and Gonzalo Guerrero even seems to have been governing an indigenous community. This does not remove the merit of Hernández as a discoverer: one may insist that merit of discovery ought to involve a <b>voluntary</b> <b>act,</b> not a shipwreck; Nicuesa's shipwrecked sailors who were not sacrificed or worked to death by their Maya captors ended up enslaved.|$|E

2500|$|Where the {{actus reus}} {{is a failure}} to act, {{there must be a}} duty of care. A duty can arise through contract, a {{voluntary}} undertaking, a blood relation with whom one lives, and occasionally through one's official position. [...] Duty also can arise from one's own creation of a dangerous situation. On the other hand, it was held in the U.K. that switching off the life support of someone in a persistent vegetative state is an omission to act and not criminal. Since discontinuation of power is not a <b>voluntary</b> <b>act,</b> not grossly negligent, and is in the patient's best interests, no crime takes place. In this case it was held that since a PVS patient could not give or withhold consent to medical treatment, it was for the doctors to decide whether treatment was in the patient's best interest. It was reasonable for them to conclude that treatment was not in the patient's best interest, and should therefore be stopped, when there was no prospect of improvement. It was never lawful to take active steps to cause or accelerate death, although in certain circumstances it was lawful to withhold life sustaining treatment, including feeding, without which the patient would die.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 October 2017 the High Court {{handed down}} its single joint judgment. In a {{unanimous}} judgment, the Court interpreted s 44(i) {{according to the}} [...] "ordinary and natural meaning" [...] of its language. [...] On that approach, it firstly affirmed the view taken in Sykes v Cleary {{that the question of}} eligibility is to be determined with reference to the point of nomination. [...] The Court then followed the reasoning of the majority in Sykes v Cleary. [...] It decided that the fact of citizenship was disqualifying, regardless of whether the person knew of the citizenship or engaged in any <b>voluntary</b> <b>act</b> of acquisition. It emphasised that to hold otherwise would introduce an element of subjectivity that [...] "would be inimical to the stability of representative government". It followed that each of Joyce, Ludlam, Nash, Roberts and Waters had been ineligible to be elected. However, Canavan and Xenophon had been eligible. It was determined that Canavan, under Italian law, was not a citizen of Italy. It was found that Xenophon was a British Overseas citizen, but that this did not give him the right to enter or reside in the United Kingdom; therefore, for the purposes of s 44(i), he was neither a citizen nor entitled to the rights and privileges of a citizen of the United Kingdom. The Court declared the seats of the ineligible members to be vacant; it ordered that the vacancy in the House of Representatives be filled through a by-election and that the vacancies in the Senate be filled by [...] "special counts" [...] (recounts or countbacks) of the ballot papers in each State, subject to supervision by a Justice of the Court. [...] At the directions hearing, the Chief Justice had approved the Commonwealth's undertaking to pay the costs of the referred parties and of Tony Windsor (intervening in the Joyce case).|$|E
