40|$|The thesis {{looks at}} the {{communication}} between the management shore and crew on board vessels, and examines the role of such communication in influencing OHSM in two Chinese chemical shipping companies. The {{study was conducted in}} the shore offices of two companies, as well as on four of their chemical tankers. The data was mainly collected by semi-structured interviews, supplemented by field observations, informal discussions and document analyses. By examining major areas of communication closely related to OHSM, i. e., <b>shore</b> to <b>ship</b> <b>communication</b> for work support, <b>shore</b> to <b>ship</b> <b>communication</b> for management control, <b>ship</b> to <b>shore</b> <b>communication</b> for safety reporting, <b>ship</b> to <b>shore</b> <b>communication</b> for safety suggestions, the study presents the range of purposes behind communication between the two. The study shows that <b>communication</b> between <b>shore</b> management and <b>ship’s</b> crew is significantly influenced by divergent interests between the two. It reveals a set of socio-economic and cultural factors that underlie their communication. As a consequence, such communication has noticeable influence on crew’s shipboard working practices as well as indirect effects on crew’s health, safety and well-being. The findings of this study show that shore-ship communication is mainly in an asymmetrical form. It was generally disengaged with the concerns of OHSM. The communication contributed to an unfavourable working environment. The study suggested that communication achieved very limited outcomes for OHSM. The study concludes by calling policy makers as well as industrial practitioners to rethink the role of communication in effective OHSM and reshape maritime regulatory strategy in promoting OHSM in the global shipping industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Transmitting <b>voice</b> <b>communication</b> over untrusted {{networks}} puts {{personal information}} at risk. Although voice streams are typically encrypted to prevent unwanted eavesdropping, additional features of <b>voice</b> <b>communication</b> protocols might still allow eavesdroppers to dis-cover {{information on the}} transmitted content and the speaker. We develop a novel approach for unveiling the identity of speakers who participate in encrypted <b>voice</b> <b>communication,</b> solely by eavesdropping on the encrypted traffic. Our approach exploits the concept of voice activ-ity detection (VAD), a widely used technique for reducing the bandwidth consumption of voice traffic. We show that the reduction of traffic caused by VAD techniques creates patterns in the encrypted traffic, which in turn reveal the patterns of pauses in the underlying voice stream. We show that these patterns are speaker-characteristic, {{and that they are}} sufficient to undermine the anonymity of the speaker in encrypted <b>voice</b> <b>communication.</b> In an empirical setup with 20 speakers our analysis is able to correctly identify an unknown speaker in about 48 % of all cases. Our work extends and generalizes existing work that exploits variable bit-rate encoding for identifying the conversation language and content of encrypted voice streams. ...|$|R
