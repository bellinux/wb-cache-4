Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) contribute significantly {{to the formation of}} ozone and photochemical oxidants and their associated impact on human health has become a major issue worldwide. Volatilisation is a significant process in determining the fate of organic compounds in the environment. In this study, <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of VOCs (specifically benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) from a wastewater collection basin, also called the oily sewer basin (OSB) was measured using a flux chamber method and the VOCs were characterised. Theoretical models {{that can be used to}} estimate <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> were also studied. Meteorological data was collected to evaluate the effect of temperature, humidity and wind speed on <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate.</b> This study showed that toluene and ethylbenzene have the highest <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> compared to benzene and o-xylene. It was found that system conditions and physicochemical properties of a compound have a significant effect on volatilisation. It was also identified that the measured concentrations of VOCs escaping from the OSB do comply with Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations 85 of 1993 standards.

Volatilised lindane was determined directly by passing a partial air stream through an adsorbent. Applications of a lindane formulation onto soil and plant surfaces were performed using a moving nozzle. Soil volatilisation experiments were conducted using differnt air velocities (0. 4, 1. 1, 1. 7 m/s). At higher air velocities the <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> increased from 12 % to 31 % within 24 h (initial dose 100 %).

40|$|A {{method for}} {{studying}} the <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of materials using a conventional thermobalance and standard sample holders is described. This was used to study two dyes; CI Disperse Yellow 54 and CI Disperse Red 60. Using pure reference materials, a relationship between <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> and vapour pressure based on the Langmuir equation for free evaporation was used to calibrate the system. Thus, the vapour pressures of the dyes could be determined. Heats of sublimation and vaporisation were calculated from a plot of the logarithm of the vapour pressure against reciprocal absolute temperature. Extrapolation of the vapour pressure vs. temperature curve outside the experimentally measured region for Red 60 was made using the melting point and heat of fusion found by DSC.

Toluene extracts of the adsorbent were analyzed by gas chromatography. Volatilisation from soil surfaces within 24 hours increased in the order parathion-methyl = fenpropimorph < endosulfan < lindane < trifluralin. For all compounds volatilisation from French beans was higher as compared to volatilisation from soil surfaces. <b>Volatilisation</b> <b>rates</b> from plant surfaces were 50 - 70 per cent for parathion-methyl, endosulfan, fenpropimorph, and lindane.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{contribution}} of straw bedding, concrete floors, slats, and slurry in the pits to ammonia emission in a straw-bedded group-housing system for sows, the ammonia volatilisation response of urination on the potential emitting surfaces from a sow house was studied under laboratory conditions. Ammonia is mainly produced by hydrolysis of the urea in the urine: a process {{that depends on the}} characteristics of the surface of the emitting area. For the study, substrate samples were obtained from the surfaces of a concrete floor in the walking alley (A), slurry pits under the drinking area and the waiting area (D and W) and from the straw bedding (S 1, S 2, S 3). The latter represented straw with respectively a small (S 1), an average (S 2) and a high (S 3) content of slurry dropped by the sows. The controls were a sample of slurry from a reference conventional housing system with sows kept individually on partly slatted floors (R), and a sample of unsoiled fresh straw from the farm depot (S 0). After sprinkling 150 ml of urine on each sample, the ammonia volatilisation (E in mg), maximum <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> (rmax in mg/h) and time of occurrence of the maximum <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> (tmax in h) were measured during 7 days. Paired comparisons of the predicted means were based on standard error of differences (SEDs, probability P 0 · 05) and most from the slurry from the reference system (1686 mg, P 0 · 05). The highest <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> occurred from the concrete floor in the walking alley (17 · 5 mg/h, P> 0 · 05). The <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> peaked soonest with heavily soiled straw, slurry in the pit under the waiting and drinking area, concrete floor and slurry from the reference system, and latest from unsoiled straw (P> 0 · 05). The results reveal that in a sow house with straw bedding, the largest source of ammonia emission is a urine puddle on the concrete floor in the walking alley, and the smallest is a urination on straw, irrespective of the slurry content of the straw. Only at high slurry contents in the straw bedding does the rate at which ammonia is produced from urea increase. The implication is that straw bedding in a group-housing system for sows decreases the ammonia emission per m 2 after a urination; however, its effect on other gaseous emissions remains to be clarifie...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatilisation}} of the formulated herbicide trifluralin from soil surfaces {{was tested}} under defined conditions in a wind tunnel system. Seven experiments with {{different sets of}} climatic parameters were performed. The following air parameters were varied: velocity 0. 4 m/s, 1. 0 - 1. 2 m/s, 1. 8 m/s; temperature 15 degree Celsius, 20 - 21 degree Celsius; relative humidity 31 percent, 48 - 51 percent, 78 percent. The amount volatilised was quantified by analysing the trifluralin concentration in the air during four time intervals between 0 and 24 hours. The <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> for trifluralin ranged from 64 to 96 percent (initial dose 100 percent).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} the applied crop protection products on crops is lost to the atmosphere. Models describing the prediction of volatility and potential fate of these substances in the environment have become an important tool in the pesticide authorisation procedure at the EU level. The main topic {{of this research is}} to assess the rate and extent of volatilisation of ten pesticides after application on field crops. RESULTS: For eight of the ten pesticides, the <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rates</b> modelled with PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local scales) corresponded well to the calculated rates modelled with ADMS (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System). For the other pesticides, large {{differences were found between the}} models. Formulation might affect the volatilisation potential of pesticides. Increased leaf wetness increased the volatilisation of propyzamide and trifloxystrobin at the end of the field trial. The reliability of pesticide input parameters, in particular the vapour pressure, is discussed. CONCLUSION: Volatilisation of propyzamide, pyrimethanil, chlorothalonil, diflufenican, tolylfluanid, cyprodinil and E- and Z-dimethomorph from crops under realistic environmental conditions can be modelled with the PEARL model, as corroborated against field observations.

40|$|Vitrification was {{considered}} as one potential treatment option for four types of wet intermediate level radioactive waste (wet ILW) arising from decommissioning of a UK Magnox nuclear power station. Here we discuss the results of initial laboratory scale trial vitrification studies using suitable glass compositions which were previously short listed from a matrix of 80 potential candidates. The results of the initial trials have (a) demonstrated the feasibility of vitrification of these wet ILWs at 35 wt% (dry) waste loading; (b) confirmed that the candidate glasses exhibit acceptable chemical durabilities; and (c) enabled further down-selection to three final candidate glasses which have undergone detailed analysis and testing, which {{will be discussed in}} a forthcoming publication. Waste loading of 35 wt% (dry) waste has been demonstrated for all four waste permutations under consideration, and results indicate that achievable final waste loading limits may be considerably higher. For most glasses studied Cs retention was 60 – 75 %; however, this result was partly attributable to high <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rates</b> resulting from the especially high surface area / volume ratio of the small laboratory melts studied.

40|$|Depending {{on their}} vapour pressure, {{volatilisation}} {{can be one}} of the main pathways of emission of pesticides into the environment. The volatilisation of fenpropimorph was studied in a field experiment in which the fungicide was sprayed onto a sugar beet crop. <b>Volatilisation</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated by measuring the concentration gradient in air, using the Aerodynamic and Bowen Ratio methods. A simplified computation model was used to simulate pesticide volatilisation, together with the concurrent processes of penetration into the plant leaves and phototransformation. Input data for the model had already been obtained by carrying out a wind-tunnel study with fenpropimorph, whereby field conditions were imitated. The computations yielded a reasonable description of the level and rate of decline of fenpropimorph volatilisation in the first 4 h after spraying. The continued volatilisation 2 and 3 days after spraying could be described by assuming that a fraction of the deposit was poorly exposed with comparatively low rates of the decline processes. In the first 3 days, penetration of fenpropimorph into the plant leaves was computed to be the main route for the pesticide (52 % of the dosage), with substantial contributions from volatilisation (12 %) and phototransformation (11 %). The computation model can be developed further as a tool for extrapolating results on volatilisation from small-scale experiments to field conditions, but this requires more information on the effect of environmental conditions on the model parameters...|$|R

During development of this product (a mixture of diacetylmorphine and caffeine), in vitro experiments were performed simulating 'chasing the dragon': the technique used by addicts for inhalation of heroin after volatilisation. Samples were heated on aluminium foil using a heating device and the vapours were collected and analysed using a HPLC-UV method. The recovery of diacetylmorphine and caffeine in vapours was studied after volatilisation of different powder mixtures at temperatures between 200 and 350 degrees C. Furthermore, the volatilisation set-up was combined with an Andersen sampler to determine the sizes of aerosol particles. Only small differences in recovery of diacetylmorphine and caffeine were found between temperatures and between powder mixtures: 46 - 62 % of diacetylmorphine from the sample was recovered in vapour and 65 - 83 % of caffeine. The only degradation product detected in vapour was 6 -acetylmorphine (4. 1 - 7. 1 %). In the temperature range studied, temperature mainly influenced the <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate.</b> Mass median aerodynamic diameters of aerosols from diacetylmorphine-containing samples ranged from 1. 8 - 4. 1 microm; 45 - 60 % of each sample was recovered as aerosol particles < 5 microm.

40|$|Abstract. The {{occurrence}} of alkylated volatile iodide and selenide species was evidenced and investigated in water, sediments and overlying atmosphere of three major European estuaries, {{such as the}} Gironde (F), the Rhine (NL) and the Scheldt (B/NL), along with the salinity gradient. For iodine, up to eight volatile species were observed as alkyl-iodides in estuarine waters. The major one (ca. 40 %) was methyl-iodide (MeI) with average seasonal concen-trations ranging from 1 to 100 pmol l− 1. Other species observed were found to correspond to several halomethane derivatives and light alkyl-iodide species. For selenium, dimethyl selenide (Me 2 Se) was the main compound (ca. 90 %) over three methyl-selenides encountered in estuarine waters. Me 2 Se average seasonal concentrations were found to range between 0. 2 and 100 pmol l− 1 in the water column. The {{occurrence of}} methylated iodides and selenides seems to be mainly related to the algae’s biomass turnover as indicated by photosynthetic pigment tracers (i. e. chlorophyll a and phaeopigments) and seasonal variation of surface water concentrations. The production and release of gaseous iodide and selenide compounds may then result from natural biological pathways leading to the methylation of their inorganic form. Finally, significant <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rates</b> were evaluated leading to average seasonal flux rates for total volatile iodide and selenide compounds ranging from 4 to 100 and from 1 to 75 nmol m− 2 d− 1, respectively. Estuarine mass balance estimated from MeI and Me 2 Se distributions indicates that volatilisation to the atmosphere represents a primary sink for MeI and Me 2 Se from estuarine surface waters...|$|R

However, excessive inputs of N {{will lead to}} inefficient use and large N losses to the environment, which can adversely affect air and water quality, biodiversity and human health. To {{examine the effects of}} controlled-release fertilisers (CRF) on yield, we measured ammonia volatilisation, N use efficiency (NUE) and photosynthetic rate after anthesis in summer maize hybrid cultivar Zhengdan 958. Maize was grown using common compound fertiliser (CCF), the same amount of resin-coated controlled release fertiliser (CRFIII), the same amount of sulphur-coated controlled release fertiliser (SCFIII) as CCF, 75 % CRF (CRFII) and SCF (SCFII), 50 % CRF (CRFI) and SCF (SCFI), and no fertiliser. We found that treatments CRFIII, SCFIII, CRFII and SCFII produced grain yields that were 13. 15 %, 14. 15 %, 9. 69 % and 10. 04 % higher than CCF. There {{were no significant differences in}} grain yield among CRFI, SCFI and CCF. We also found that the ammonia <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rates</b> of CRF were significantly lower than those of CCF. The CRF treatments reduced the emission of ammonia by 51. 34 % to 91. 34 % compared to CCF. In addition, after treatment with CRF, maize exhibited a higher net photosynthetic rate than CCF after anthesis. Agronomic NUE and apparent N recovery were higher in the CRF treatment than in the CCF treatment. The N uptake and physiological NUE of the four yield-enhanced CRF treatments were higher than those of CCF. These results suggest that the increase in NUE in the CRF treatments was generally attributable to the higher photosynthetic rate and lower ammonia volatilisation compared to CCF-treated maize...|$|R

The experiments were evaluated together with the data of other studies of the 'Arbeitskreis Spraydrift' and are now the bases of the estimation of spraydrift within the registration of pesticides in Germany. Apart from all above variations in application of pests experiments with fluorescent dyes along a trial with an area of 115 m" 2 modeling an orchard of wall-fruit were carried out in order to quantify exclusively the influence of meteorological factors.

The rate of N mineralisation following the amendment of soils with biosolids over a range of specific environmental conditions needs to be accurately quantified to prevent overloading the soil with N in excess of plant uptake. The N release characteristics of anaerobically digested dewatered biosolids cake (DBC), lime-amended biosolids (LAB) and alum sludge (AS), in comparison to urea {{as a source of}} readily available N, were investigated in a soil incubation study. The experimental design included two soil types and three moisture regimes (25 %, 50 % and 100 % gravimetric water holding capacity (GWHC)). There was no significant effect of soil type on the proportion or rate of N mineralisation. Nitrogen mineralisation rate was greater for LAB and AS compared with DBC and lime amended biosolids which had been stockpiled (LABs) for 12 months. The rate of N mineralisation was also dependent on moisture and was generally greater at 50 % GWHC compared to 25 % GWHC, but at 100 % GWHC losses of N were observed, especially from soil amended with LAB; this is attributed to denitrification. The proportion of mineralisable N (% organic N) at 50 % GWHC was greater for LAB (72 %) and AS (64 %) in comparison with DBC (32 %) and LABs (26 %). These results are consistent with previous findings and demonstrate that the organic matter content of LAB and AS is of a lower stability than DBC and LABs.

40|$|Soot {{particles}} are {{a product of}} the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. They influence our climate directly and indirectly, which makes them an important constituent of the atmospheric aerosol. Model calculations imply that soot aerosol may {{have a significant impact on}} the oxidation capacity of the troposphere and on the nitrogen oxides and ozone chemistry of the stratosphere. One goal of this work was the investigation of the decomposition/reduction rates of the trace gases O_ 3, NO_ 2, N_ 2 O_ 5 /NO_ 3 and HOONO_ 2 /HO_ 2 on airborne soot particles at atmospherically relevant temperatures and trace gas concentrations in the aerosol chamber AIDA. After a rapid initial loss of about one monolayer equivalent of ozone the reaction probability drops to #gamma# #approx# 10 "-" 6. This value of #gamma# is at least three orders of magnitude lower than had been assumed in the model calculations. Therefore, the decomposition of ozone on soot aerosol is negligible both in the troposphere and in the stratosphere. It also turned out that the reaction probabilities of the other investigated trace gases fall several orders of magnitude short of the lower limits above which model calculations predicted a significant influence of soot aerosol on the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere. Volatilisation by oxidative trace gases can be used to remove soot deposits from catalytic converters. Therefore, another goal of this work was the determination of reaction probabilities for the oxidation of soot by O_ 3 and NO_ 2. The <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> of soot particles exposed to 1 % of ozone in air can already be measured at room temperature. However, the process is completely negligible in the atmosphere because oxidation times of several thousand years would result, depending on temperature and particle size, at a mixing ratio of 100 ppb ozone. Under the conditions of a Diesel catalytic converter (350 C, 500 ppm NO_ 2) soot {{particles are}} volatilised by NO_ 2 within 3 hours. To interpret these results ESR spectra of loosely deposited spark generator soot and Diesel soot particles were investigated. Partial oxidation of spark generator soot results in a reduction of the ESR line intensity at g 2. 003, in parallel with the soot mass reduction, while the intensity of a weak shoulder at g = 2. 0015 changes insignificantly. As a consequence the ESR spectrum of spark generator soot becomes more and more similar to that of Diesel soot, which consists of two lines at g = 2. 0039 and g = 2. 0020 of comparable intensities. We conclude from a comparison of high resolution TEM micrographs that the two lines can be assigned to different domains of the soot particles, one domain being significantly less reactive than the other.

40|$|Urine and dung from {{ruminants}} {{contributes to}} emissions of both nitrous oxide (N₂O) and ammonia (NH 3). These {{are important for}} a variety of agronomic and environmental reasons. Urine contributes a much larger fraction than dung to the total NH 3 and N₂O emissions. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas and its emission from grazing animal excreta is considered a major loss pathway for N₂O emitted from agricultural soils. Ammonia can be volatilised from the soil surface shortly after ruminant urination. In addition, a fraction of this NH 3 may be converted into N₂O after NH 3 is redeposited onto the soil. Biochar is produced as a by-product of the low temperature pyrolysis of biomass during bioenergy extraction. Incorporation of biochar into soil is of global interest as a potential carbon sequestration tool. Nitrogen (N) transformations in soil can be affected by the presence of biochar. This current research has been conducted {{to determine the effects of}} incorporating biochar into soil, on: ruminant urine-derived N₂O fluxes, NH 3 volatilisation, N uptake by pasture, and pasture yield. The first experiment examined the effects of biochar incorporation (0, 15 and 30 t ha- 1) on N 2 O emissions during an 86 -day spring-summer field study following 15 N-labelled ruminant urine application. The results showed that N 2 O fluxes were reduced by 70 %, after incorporating 30 t ha- 1 of biochar. The uptake of NH 3 by biochar was proposed as a possible mechanism for the reduced N 2 O emissions. No differences occurred, due to biochar addition, with respect to dry matter yields, herbage N content, or herbage recovery of 15 N. In the second experiment the capacity of four biochar types to take up NH 3 was determined in order to define a possible mechanism for reduced N₂O emissions observed under 30 t ha- 1 biochar in first experiment. The subsequent plant availability of biochar adsorbed NH 3 -N was then determined. The results showed that NH 3 -N adsorbed by biochar was stable, but readily plant available when placed in the soil. Plant dry matter yields were 2 to 3 times greater and N uptake by plants doubled when biochar containing adsorbed NH 3 was incorporated into soil over a 25 -day incubation study. The third experiment was conducted to measure NH 3 volatilisation in-situ using micrometeorological methods during a 6 -day summer field study. Soil temperature, pH, ammoniacal-N and moisture were measured in the top soil to provide input parameters for a volatilisation model. Cumulative NH 3 volatilisation was 25. 7 (± 0. 5) % of the N applied. The results from this experiment were used as a maximum and in-situ measure of the NH 3 <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rate</b> following urine application. The fourth experiment was conducted to determine if incorporating biochar (0, 15 and 30 t ha- 1) actually reduced NH 3 volatilisation from soil under ruminant urine application, and assessed the subsequent plant availability of this biochar adsorbed NH 3 -N. The NH 3 volatilisation from 15 N-labelled ruminant urine, applied to soil, was reduced by 45 % after incorporating either 15 or 30 t ha- 1 of biochar. When these urine-treated biochar particles were placed in fresh soil, subsequent plant growth was not affected but the uptake of 15 N in plant tissues increased, indicating that the adsorbed-N was plant available. This thesis demonstrates incorporating biochar into the soil can significantly decrease NH 3 and N 2 O emissions from ruminant urine with the captured N recycled to crops while simultaneously sequestering carbon in soils...|$|E

The impact can manifest itself for example in toxic, carcinogenic and/or endocrine effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents in aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the elimination of organic trace pollutants has not been taken into consideration yet, neither in design nor during the operation of municipal wastewater treatment plants.

This study examines around 500 organic trace pollutants which are continuously monitored by the federal environmental agencies. It shows that 52 compounds are relevant for the environment, because their concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface waters in Germany have exceeded the target values. Due to the impossibility of studying the behaviour of all 52 relevant trace pollutants during the wastewater treatment, the industrial chemicals nonylphenol and bisphenol A, natural hormone 17 b-estradiol and synthetic steroid 17 a-ethinylestradiol were appointed as model compounds. The criteria of choice were different biological degradation and <b>volatilisation</b> <b>rates,</b> as well as different affinity to sewage sludge. The behaviour of the model trace pollutants during the mechanic-biological treatment of wastewater and sewage sludge was studied in pilot wastewater treatment plants and in laboratory sorption and degradation experiments with radiolabelled compounds. In these experiments biodegradation was identified as the main elimination pathway. By the biodegradation of the model compounds carbon dioxide and some unidentified metabolites were generated. Further research is required to perform a risk assessment of the biodegradation products. The evaluation of elimination efficiency of various wastewater treatment plant configurations was performed using the experiment results and the mathematical model developed in this study. A conventional activated sludge plant with simultaneous aerobic sludge digestion showed the best elimination efficiency for the model compounds. It was followed by membrane activated sludge plants with simultaneous aerobic and separate anaerobic sludge digestion. The lowest elimination efficiency was observed in a conventional activated sludge plant with separate anaerobic sludge digestion. Sand filtration of the effluents of conventional treatment plants did not contribute significantly to the elimination of the model trace pollutants. Since, according to the mathematical model the studied wastewater treatment plant configurations do not retain some organic trace pollutants like 17 a-ethinylestradiol and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine sufficiently, 16 various measures of enhancing the elimination of trace pollutants were assessed with respect to their technical and economical efficiency. For the smaller wastewater treatment plants (up to 5, 000 PE) the addition of pulverised activated carbon into the aeration tank was especially suitable. Ozonation as a downstream treatment stage was the choice for the larger plants. In dependence of the plant capacity this measures would increase the treatment costs by 20 - 35 % (0. 07 - 0. 18 €/m³) ...|$|R
