40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis gives a lot of {{opportunities}} for research of qualitatively and quantitatively new microwave components. Its results are practically usable for efficient design of microwave circuits and systems. The fundamental research achievements can be divided into two parts. The first part deals with the methodology of a model development of new or well known 3 -D components like a 3 -D <b>vertical</b> <b>stub</b> and a microstrip Open calibration element. The 3 -D <b>vertical</b> <b>stub</b> on microstrip line is used as serial connected capacitors, DC blocks, matching circuits or filter element. Its simple equivalent circuit based on the transmission line model is valid only for the vertical dimension much smaller compared to the wavelength. Therefore the corresponding equivalent circuit including the influence of the discontinuities and radiation valid up to 26 GHz was developed. The second part deals with a design on new 3 -D microwave circuits. A novel wideband power divider with out of phase outputs was designed and experimentally verified. It is based on an inhomogeneous lossy coupled line formed by a parallel plate line placed into a rectangular metal box. With respect to its non-resonant structure the frequency band is not limited towards higher frequencies in principle. The phase difference error of 5 deg. and the amplitude difference of 0. 8 dB of output signals were achieved in the frequency band of 4 - 26 GHz.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, a {{new design}} of {{dual-band}} circularly polarized (CP) slot antenna is proposed. By embedding a <b>vertical</b> <b>stub,</b> a T-shaped strip and a slit {{to the ground}} plane, the CPW-fed slot antenna can radiate right-handed circularly polarized (RHCP) wave in two bands 3. 0 GHz and 5. 0 GHz. The designed antenna with a size of 33 × 27 × 1 mm 3 is fed by a 50 -Ohm SMA connector and fabricated on a low-cost FR- 4 substrate. Experimental {{results show that the}} measured 10 -dB return loss impedance bandwidths are 20. 4 % for the lower band and 23 % for the upper band, and the measured 3 -dB axial-ratio (AR) bandwidths are 14. 1 % and 15. 8 %, with respect to 3 GHz and 5 GHz, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{broadband}} {{monopole antenna}} with circular polarization (CP) is designed and fabricated. It {{consists of a}} C-shaped monopole, an open-loop on the backside of the monopole and a modified ground plane. By placing a rectangular open-loop coplanar with the ground plane and connecting a rectangular <b>vertical</b> <b>stub</b> to the ground plane, wide impedance bandwidth is achieved, and axial-ratio (AR) bandwidth of the antenna could be improved simultaneously. The measured results exhibit a 65. 2 % (4. 14 GHz, 4. 28 - 8. 42 GHz) CP bandwidth, and the 10 -dB impedance bandwidth is 87. 7 % (6. 66 GHz, 4. 26 - 10. 92 GHz). Finally, by placing a reflector underneath the antenna with its structural dimensions unchanged, one can obtain unidirectional radiation patterns with greatly improved gains. The advantages of the proposed antenna are the simple structure, a compact size, and a broad 3 -dB AR bandwidth. © 2015 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Empirical {{results are}} {{presented}} for a novel miniature planar antenna that operates over a wide bandwidth (500 MHz to 3. 05 G Hz). The antenna consists of dual-square radiating patches separated by two narrow <b>vertical</b> <b>stubs</b> to reject interferences from GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi bands. Radiating patches and stubs are surrounded by a ground-plane conductor, and the antenna is fed through a common coplanar waveguide transmission line (CPW-TL). The two <b>vertical</b> <b>stubs</b> generate pass-band resonances enabling wideband operation across the following communications standards: cellular, APMS, JCDMA, GSM, DCS, PCS, KPCS, IMT- 2000, WCDMA, UMTS and WiMAX. Embedded in the ground-plane conductor is an H-shaped dielectric slit, which has been rotated by 90 °, whose function is to reject interferences from GPS, Bluetooth and WiFi bands. Measurements results confirm the antenna exhibits notched characteristics at frequency bands of GPS (1574. 4 – 1576. 4 MHz), Bluetooth (2402 – 2480 MHz) and WiFi (2412 – 2483. 5 MHz). The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is 2. 55 G Hz for VSWR < 2, which corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 143. 66 %. Measured results also confirm that the antenna radiates omnidirectionally in the E-plane with appreciable gain performance over its operating frequency range. The antenna has dimensions of 15 mm × 15 mm × 0. 8 mm...|$|R
40|$|A 1 / 6 -scale {{model of}} the Republic XF- 12 <b>vertical</b> tail with <b>stub</b> {{fuselage}} and stub horizontal tail was tested in the Langley stability tunnel to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the model, The investigation included {{a study of the}} effects of boundarylayer thickness, rudder area, and cover-plate alinement on the aerodynamic characteristics. Tuft studies were made {{in the vicinity of the}} junction of the <b>vertical</b> and <b>stub</b> horizontal tails. The results of the investigation indicated that the flow in the vicinity of the junction of the <b>vertical</b> and <b>stub</b> horizontal tails was only slightly improved by the addition of a fillet. An increase in boundary-layer thickness produced a slight decrease in rudder effectiveness. The increase in lift of the combined rudders over that of the upper rudder alone was not proportional at low deflections and was approximately proportional at high deflections to the increase in rudder area. When the balance-chamber cover plates were bowed out, the change in rudder hinge moment with rudder angle was less negative. The variation of the lift coefficient with angle of attack and the variation, at small values of angle of attack, of rudder hinge-noment coefficient with angle of attack was approximately the same for all model configurations tested. The upper rudder used in conjunction with a tab was found to satisfy the Army specifications regarding asymmetric power on a multiengine airplane...|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} reviews most of {{the available}} literature on the fatigue properties of β annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and titanium alloys with similar microstructures. The focus is on β processed and β heat-treated alloys because β annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V has been selected for highly loaded and fatigue-critical structures, including the main wing-carry-through bulkheads and <b>vertical</b> tail <b>stubs,</b> of advanced high-performance military aircraft.   An {{important aspect of the}} review is a concise survey of fatigue life assessment methods and the required types of fatigue data. This survey provides the background to recommendations for further research, especially on the fatigue behaviour of β annealed Ti- 6 Al- 4 V under realistic fatigue load histories, including the essential topic of short/small fatigue crack growth. Such research is required for independent fatigue life assessments that conform to the aircraft manufacturer’s design requirements, and also for life reassessments that most probably will have to be made during the service life of the aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Origanum dictamnus is a {{seasonally}} dimorphic plant having different {{appearance in}} winter and summer. Shoots of winter plants are leaf-naked except for their apical region which bears a cluster of small leaves covered with a thick indumentum of non-glandular hairs. This indumentum highly contributes to the avoidance of cold penetration into the leaf mesophyll, allowing thus plants to endure winter low temperatures. Shoots of summer plants are vigorous with large green leaves. Non-glandular hairs are dendroid with a 5 -celled <b>vertical</b> <b>stub</b> and several lateral branches. Glandular hairs are of two types, large peltate hairs and small capitate hairs. Peltate hairs are numerous and consist of a 12 -celled head, a unicellular stalk, and a basal epidermal cell [...] They constitute the sites of essential oil secretion. Capitate hairs occur in a small number and are composed of a unicellular head, a unicellular stalk and a basal epidermal cell. They are not secreting essential oil, but a hydrophilic material. The oil secreted by the peltate hairs has antioxidant properties, opposes the oxidative stress resulted from low temperatures, and contributes to the adaptation of the plant to winter cold stress...|$|E
40|$|A 1 / 6 -scale {{model of}} the Republic XF- 12 <b>vertical</b> tail with <b>stub</b> fuselage, stub {{horizontal}} tail, and a de-icing air duct was tested in the Langley stability tunnel. The investigation consisted of {{a study of the}} effects of the duct, with and without air flow, on the aerodynamic characteristics of the model. The model tested was a revision of a model previously tested in the Langley stability tunnel. The revised model differed from the original model in that it incorporated a de-icing air duct, included a dorsal fin, and had a larger stub fuselage. A comparison of data obtained form tests of the original and revised models was made. The results of the investigation indicated that the air duct had very little effect on the aerodynamic characteristics of the model. A small change occurred in the variation of rudder hinge-moment coefficient with angle of attack but it is believed that this change can be corrected by a properly applied spring tab...|$|R
