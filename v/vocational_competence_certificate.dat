30|$|There are {{differences}} between the types of <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> gained from a PBVE and those indicated in course syllabuses. The specific project provides opportunities to gain <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> {{in areas that are}} closely connected to the phase of where the project is. The result is that the project is the steering part in PBVE, and the goals related to course syllabuses are overlooked. If that is the situation, the focus on producing these houses is greater than the students’ need to gain <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> according to the goals in course syllabuses. Another issue is the outsourcing of different tasks. If the students are not able to do a task, they cannot develop that competence within the frame of this PBVE. However, if other structures and/or construction solutions in the building process were used, the students might be able to develop competence in the areas that follow those tasks. The students’ <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> is thus adapted to the project, and the students are developing competence in areas that are related to the specific project.|$|R

30|$|As the {{findings}} of this study indicate, there seems to be an issue around decision making about how something should be done. This phenomenon seems to be grounded in the complexity of the houses, where constant problem-solving dilemmas arise along the production. With Vygotskij (1978) ideas about how ZPD is a part of students’ development of learning, these problem-solving dilemmas reduce the students zone of potential development. One issue that affects the ability to gain <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> follows the problem-solving dilemmas that result in redoing tasks and the slow progress in the building process. This affect the opportunity to try new tasks and thereby the potential development of <b>vocational</b> <b>competence.</b> The students’ ability to expand their ZPD is reduced. It can be discussed whether the frequency of redoing tasks and the ability to participate in more tasks is coherent with each other in this PBVE. Following Ellström’s (1992) notion that competence is related to the ability to perform a job that is successfully performed, it could be questioned whether a redoing task that is redone because of changes from the site manager or architect can be interpreted as a successful job that enhances the development of <b>vocational</b> <b>competences.</b>|$|R
30|$|Despite the <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> that is {{gained from}} the {{specific}} project or related to course syllabuses, the slow progress of building these houses seems to affect the students’ learning outcome. The students are not learning what they might, {{if they had the}} opportunity to make better progress in their learning environment. According to Engeström (1987), object-oriented activities affect the result; consequently, this project will affect the development of <b>vocational</b> <b>competence.</b> These factors raise questions such as whether this kind of project is suitable for the student’s vocational education. Or, is it better than the alternative? Maybe the potential of the project is more suited to providing the building industry with competent workers than to fulfilling goals in course syllabuses. If that is the case, then the course syllabuses do not fit the needs. If so, does this mean that the goals in the related course syllabuses have partly played out their role? If the potential <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> generated from this project is meeting the demands of the building industry, it has to be considered whether the course syllabuses are suitable for the demands of the work life.|$|R

30|$|As a {{model for}} {{initiating}} the interviews, the field notes were organised into six themes (see a further explanation in the constitution of <b>vocational</b> <b>competence),</b> each of which characterised something that had been observed, sometimes for several weeks, and that the students had experienced. These field note–based interviews were structured into sections within each theme, where the students after each section got the opportunity to discuss what I had just read for them. In themes 1 – 5 {{there was always something}} that overturned their first argument, and they thereby had to reconsider their standpoint and discuss in what way their <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> was constituted. Theme 6 refers to one phenomenon that was displayed during one day of the observations. These semistructured interviews were influenced by a stimulated recall approach to engage the students in the discussions of the themes. A central part in stimulated recall is that the researcher stimulates the informant by displaying something that triggers the informant to discuss an occurrence (Alexandersson 1994). According to Haglund (2003), stimulated recall can be structured in many ways, as long its intention is to trigger the informant to participate in the discussion.

30|$|Finally, in Finland, {{the dual}} professionalism of {{vocational}} teachers, particularly {{as it relates}} to teachers’ work-life experience and <b>vocational</b> <b>competence,</b> is a concern. The Finnish National Board of Education has created two continuing training programmes for vocational teachers, one of which involves studies aimed at increasing <b>vocational</b> teachers’ <b>competence</b> in the world of work (Frisk 2014; Opetushallitus 2014). An investigation of vocational teachers’ participation in so-called working periods showed that the teachers developed up-to-date knowledge about working life and initiated various changes in vocational education, such as developing teaching and learning materials (Eerola 2007). Furthermore, the participating workplaces learned more about vocational education. All of the actors involved believed that vocational teachers’ working periods could strengthen the cooperation between school and working life and improve the quality of vocational education and training in the long term. Several vocational teachers participated in more than one working period. However, some vocational teachers did not wish to participate in working periods {{because of a lack of}} knowledge of contemporary working life, concerns about their own <b>vocational</b> <b>competence,</b> difficulties finding replacement teachers, and restrictions in school schedules and teachers’ working hours, among other factors.|$|R
30|$|Together, these {{competence}} levels refer to successfully completed, occupation-specific tasks.

30|$|The {{process of}} redoing tasks {{indicates}} insecurity or poor {{communication between the}} teacher and the site manager about how something should be done. That also affects the student’s motivation in a negative direction. Despite many similarities, compared to an ordinary house the complexity of building these projects seems to affect the production time and thereby the possibility to develop <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> that follows the construction phase of the project. Assuming that this is probably the future way of building houses, it can be questioned whether there are any alternatives. What would happen if they were building ordinary houses that follow common solutions and building regulations? Could this result in <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> that no one will want in the future, and consequently, the student will not meet the upcoming demands from the building industry? The primary question might be whether it is better to educate for the present demands rather than upcoming ones.|$|R

30|$|In summary, our {{literature}} review identified several predictors of vocational and workplace identity: (1) a dual versus school-based VET, (2) workplace integration, and (3) a free career choice, {{as well as}} two effects: (4) willingness to perform and (5) <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> as prerequisites for vocational performance. Our theoretical design further predicts that associations between the characteristics of occupational environments and vocational performance are mediated by the more fundamental motivational qualities of learners’ vocational and workplace identities (see Figure  3).|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} study is to investigate how teachers and students perceive vocational orientation in the English subject in upper secondary school. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with nine vocational students, three teachers who teach English at vocational education programs and observations of three English classes. The study examines the needs of, and the challenges teachers and students face {{in the implementation of}} vocational orientation in the teaching. The starting point of the study is the FYR-project and its objective to improve vocational orientation and the relevance of the common core subjects in vocational education programs. The findings show that both students and teachers are positive towards vocational orientation, but that they experience a number of problems in its implementation. For students, the problem is primarily that the vocational orientation is not perceived as authentic. They find that the vocational orientation they have had in English does not always match the expectations they have for their future jobs. The vocational orientation is therefore of little relevance to the students. For the teachers, there are two main problems with vocational orientation. First, the teachers find {{that they do not have}} sufficient competence in the students’ specializations to make their teaching authentic, a finding that matches the students’ experiences. In addition, their school made no attempts to improve the <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> of the teachers through courses, or by letting them build experience by teaching the same program over several years. Next, conflicting goals in the vocational education undermine the implementation of vocational orientation. Central parts of the English subject, such as the written exam, do not include vocational orientation. In this way, teaching must focus on a more general <b>vocational</b> <b>competence,</b> instead of being tailored to each profession. To sum up, the teachers' lack of <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> and the contradictory goals they are expected to follow results in a vocational orientation that has little relevance for the students. This study ends by discussing issues important for the successful implementation of vocational orientation and the FYR initiative...|$|R
30|$|However, {{this is not}} {{a problem}} or {{solution}} exclusive to the specific school. Government documents show that as early as the 1970 s schools were encouraged to perform different projects to conduct their vocational education {{as a part of the}} construction programme (SOU 1970 : 58). Despite this being a common way to deliver vocational education in a construction programme, few studies in Sweden have been conducted that consider the development of students’ <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> (Berglund 2009). On the other hand, research in other countries has shown that <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> is a complex phenomenon that is very specific to national demands (Winther and Achtenhagen 2009). The conduct and practices of PBVE are thereby ongoing processes in Sweden that have not yet been studied enough by researchers to determine what the students can learn from the structure of a project-based learning environment (PBLE). On the basis of the little research available and the fact that PBVE is a common way of conducting vocational education in the Swedish national construction programmes, it is important to shine some light on how this educational design can affect learning outcomes. To understand the relationship between PBVE and learning outcomes, this study highlights the views of students who are participating in this kind of learning environment.|$|R
30|$|The <b>vocational</b> <b>competence</b> {{gained by}} {{students}} within this PBLE {{depends on what}} they are enabled to do {{within the framework of}} the project. This highlights the problems that emerge in practice, when complex coordination is needed between the architectural plans for the construction, the site manager, the teachers, and the students. Both the complex nature of the task, and the multiple viewpoints that are expressed by participants with different expertise, can produce confusion and lack of clarity for the students as well as a lower level of involvement by students in some of the activities.|$|R
