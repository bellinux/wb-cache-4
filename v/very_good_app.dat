40|$|In the Google Play store, an {{introduction}} page {{is associated with}} every mobile application (app) for users to acquire its details, including screenshots, description, reviews, etc. However, it remains a challenge to identify what items influence users most when downloading an app. To explore users' perspective, we conduct a survey to inquire about this question. The results of survey suggest that the participants pay most attention to the app description which gives users a quick overview of the app. Although there exist some guidelines about {{how to write a}} <b>good</b> <b>app</b> description to attract more downloads, it is hard to define a high quality app description. Meanwhile, there is no tool to evaluate the quality of app description. In this paper, we employ the method of crowdsourcing to extract the attributes that affect the app descriptions' quality. First, we download some app descriptions from Google Play, then invite some participants to rate their quality with the score from one (very poor) to five (<b>very</b> <b>good).</b> The participants are also requested to explain every score's reasons. By analyzing the reasons, we extract the attributes that the participants consider important during evaluating the quality of app descriptions. Finally, we train the supervised learning models on a sample of 100 app descriptions. In our experiments, the support vector machine model obtains up to 62 % accuracy. In addition, we find that the permission, the number of paragraphs and the average number of words in one feature play key roles in defining a <b>good</b> <b>app</b> description.

40|$|Abstract—Smartphone {{privacy and}} {{security}} work has focused mostly on malicious apps. We {{take a different}} angle by ques-tioning whether <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> suffer {{from a lack of}} judgment and interact with “bad ” websites. We use the term bad websites to refer to entities that engage in dangerous or annoying activities that range from distributing malware, to phishing and overly aggressive ad spamming. The focus of our work is this relatively neglected aspect of security: “Whom does an app talk to? ” In this paper, we design and implement AURA, a framework for identifying the hosts that an app talks to and evaluating the risks this communication entails. AURA makes use of both static and dynamic analysis. We studied 13, 500 popular free Android apps that connect to 254, 022 URLs and 1, 260 malicious Android apps that connect to 19, 510 URLs. Our main contribution is showing that <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> pose security risks as they contact at least one website that: (a) distributes malware (8. 8 % of apps), (b) are in a blacklist (15 % of apps) based on the classification by VirusTotal and Web of Trust. Our work can raise awareness that even <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> need to be carefully evaluated, especially as people become more concerned about smartphone security and privacy. I...|$|R
