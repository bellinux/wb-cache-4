On the second occasion in which Bittaker raped Hall, Norris saw what he believed to be <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> approaching. Upon informing Bittaker, he (Bittaker) clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle he had seen. When {{he returned to the}} van, the pair drove to {{a location}} deeper in the San Gabriel Mountains, where Bittaker forced Hall to walk, naked, up a hill alongside the road, then perform fellatio upon him.

500|$|Light and {{darkness}} feature prominently in Psycho. The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters {{the office to}} steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also [...] "the ironic equivalent of darkness" [...] in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, [...] "the glaring white" [...] of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.|$|E

50|$|Most {{road signs}} and {{pavement}} marking materials are retro-reflective, incorporating small glass spheres or prisms to more efficiently reflect light from <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> {{back to the}} driver's eyes.|$|E
50|$|The {{spotting}} {{and shooting}} often take place from the moving vehicle. Experienced drivers on familiar territory (such as farmers {{in their own}} paddocks) may turn off the <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> to minimize the distractions.|$|E
50|$|This common species {{frequently}} {{rests on}} roads during the night, sometimes capturing insects under street lights.

50|$|An {{automotive}} {{night vision}} system uses a thermographic camera to increase a driver's perception and seeing distance in darkness or poor weather {{beyond the reach}} of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>headlights.</b> Such systems are offered as optional equipment on certain premium vehicles.

5000|$|At present {{there is}} no {{national}} statute which governs the use of headlight covers.

50|$|Nocturnal insects, such as moths, are its food. Unlike the Indian {{nightjar}} (C. asiaticus), {{this species}} rarely rests on roads during the night, preferring to alight on bushes.

50|$|The {{main task}} {{of this work}} is, however, {{in the area of}} logistics, on {{coordination}} to assemble vehicle parts. These are suspensions, shock absorbers, <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights,</b> radio receivers and motors, which are produced by local manufacturers, and then here in the factory for delivery to other works on the so-called semi-knocked-down kits are packaged parts.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of the research performed at tge Human Factors Division of The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute between 1977 and 1986. The focus of the research has been on human factors (ergonomics) aspects of road safety. Specifically, the research has dealt with the following issues: <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlighting,</b> <b>vehicle</b> rear lighting and signalling, vehicle displays and controls, vehicle components, conspicuity of vehicles, legibility of traffic signs and licence plates, driver reaction time, driver performance, stopping sight distance, driver seated position, individual differences (drivers with disabilities, older drivers), methods for measuring blood alcohol concentration, societal violence and traffic accidents, cross-cultural comparison of driver risk-perception, and theoretical issues...|$|R

50|$|The villagers {{had formed}} a 'peace committee' which was holding a meeting in a mosque when the blast occurred. The roof of the mosque caved in {{but none of the}} people {{attending}} the meeting were seriously injured. More than twenty surrounding houses were destroyed. People became trapped in collapsed buildings. In the darkness, <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> were used to search for victims. The blast was felt from 11 miles (18 kilometers) away.|$|E
50|$|Night time drivers should reduce {{speed and}} use high beam {{headlights}} when possible, to give themselves maximum time {{to avoid a}} collision. However, when headlights approach a nocturnal animal, {{it is hard for}} the creature to see the approaching car (nocturnal animals see better in low than in bright light). Furthermore, the glare of oncoming <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> can dazzle some species, such as rabbits; they will freeze in the road rather than flee. It may be better to flash the headlights on and off, rather than leaving them on continuously while approaching an animal.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the bottles}} used in {{construction}} of the house came from a tavern located on the property known as the [...] "Jungle." [...] <b>Vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> shining on the bottles at night create a sparkle look. The house contain other features as well. The bottles are embedded in the stone, brick and mortar around the house. Ceramic tile can be seen around the window edges. Two wooden windows make up part of {{the exterior of the}} home. These windows are false and can not be seen from the inside of the house.|$|E

The review identifies the key relationships between headlamp design characteristics and driver and environmental factors. The major safety problems associated with headlighting are discussed, and issues needing the attention of the research community are identified.

5000|$|They suggest {{mounting}} the PIRs {{in such a}} {{way that}} the PIR cannot [...] "see" [...] out of a window. Although the wavelength of infrared radiation to which the chips are sensitive does not penetrate glass very well, a strong infrared source (such as from a <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlight</b> or sunlight) can overload the sensor and cause a false alarm.

50|$|Blackout {{regulations}} were imposed on 1 September 1939, before {{the declaration of}} war. These required that all windows and doors should be covered at night with suitable material such as heavy curtains, cardboard or paint, to prevent the escape of any glimmer of light that might aid enemy aircraft. The Government ensured that the necessary materials were available. External lights such as street lights were switched off, or dimmed and shielded to deflect light downward. Essential lights such as traffic lights and <b>vehicle</b> <b>headlights</b> were fitted with slotted covers to deflect their beams downwards to the ground.|$|E

5000|$|The 2011 Porsche Cayenne {{is larger}} than its predecessors, but {{features}} a more slanted rear window, less upright windshield, a more sloping roofline, door-mounted mirrors, smaller windows {{at the rear of}} the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>headlights</b> inspired by the Carrera GT, taillights that extend onto the car's tailgate, LED daytime running lights and a vastly redesigned interior modeled after the Panamera. The 2011 Cayenne is almost 250 kg lighter than the previous models due to extensive use of aluminum and magnesium, making it more fuel efficient than the previous lineup. Despite its lower stance, the new vehicle's off-road capabilities have been retained without compromising the street performance-oriented layout and design[...] In addition to a diesel offering, a hybrid version is available. Also, model year 2013 - 2016 diesel Porsche Cayennes are included in the Volkswagen emissions scandal.|$|E
50|$|Sylvanshine is {{an optical}} {{phenomenon}} in which dew-covered plant species whose leaves are wax-covered retroreflect beams of light, {{as from a}} <b>vehicle's</b> <b>headlights,</b> sometimes causing trees {{to appear to be}} snow-covered at night during the summer. The phenomenon was named and explained in 1994 by Professor Alistair Fraser of Pennsylvania State University, an expert in meteorological optics. According to his explanation, the wax on the leaves causes water to form beads, which become, in effect, lenses. These lenses focus the light to a spot {{on the surface of the}} leaf, and the image of this spot is directed as rays in the opposite direction.|$|R

Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage. In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls.
