5|$|The low-key {{lighting}} schemes of many classic film noirs {{are associated with}} stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography {{is considered by many}} to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Niagara (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while Slightly Scarlet (1956), Party Girl (1958), and Vertigo (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.|$|E

With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open the shutters to produce louder and louder sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E

25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison.

Huston and Edeson crafted each scene to make sure the images, action and dialog blended effectively, sometimes shooting closeups of characters with other cast members acting with them off camera.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} double murder, some parents warned their {{children}} about being out late. The second double murder shocked {{the city and}} curfews were set for businesses. The height of the town's hysteria snowballed after the murder of Virgil Starks. The Texarkana Gazette stated on Sunday, May 5, that the killer might strike again at any moment, at any place and at any one. Before, it was normal to leave your house unlocked, but soon residents started locking doors, pulling down shades, blocking windows, and arming themselves with guns. Some people would nail sheets over their windows or nail the window down. Some used screened-door braces as window guards. The next day after Starks' death, several residents bought firearms and locks. Stores sold out of locks, guns, ammunition, and window shades and <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds.</b> Other items that sold well included window sash locks, screen door hooks, night latches, and other protective devices.|$|E

The architect for the refurbishment was Geoffrey Clough of Peter Hunt and Daryl Jackson Architects. The building was [...] "stripped back to bare bones" [...] and the tiny tiles coating the building's distinctive [...] "T"-shaped fins were removed, repaired, and re-glued to the surface. The refurbishment also involved {{the construction of a}} new [...] "Lord Mayoral space and reception area" [...] on the eleventh floor (formerly a plant level), the full enclosure of the ground floor (which had previously been partially open to the elements) and the replacement of gold <b>Venetian</b> <b>blinds</b> which had been a feature of the building in the past.|$|E

Two side-by-side full-scale offices in Oakland, California were built to further develop and test this concept. An automated <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> was operated in synchronization with a dimmable electric lighting system to block direct sun, provide the design workplane illuminance, and maximize view.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{two-stage}} energy saving control algorithm {{to resolve the}} visual comfort control problem of building energy management systems (BEMS). The first stage control method consists of a fuzzy controller to control the <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> so as to exploit the outdoor luminance {{as much as possible}} while avoiding the sun glare. To remedy the possible imperfection caused by the fuzzy controller, a follow up fine tuning step is designed to adjust the outputs of the <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> resulted from the fuzzy controller. The second stage control is to determine whether to turn on the light based on the luminance measured by the sensor after the first stage control so as to save electricity. We have simulated the proposed two-stage control algorithm and demonstrate that the electricity saving can be up to 61 % in the tested room...|$|R
40|$|Calorimetric {{measurements}} of dynamic net heat flow through a complex fenestration system {{consisting of a}} buff <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> inside clear double glazing are used to derive the direction-dependent beam SHGC (solar heat gain coefficient) of the fenestration. The data are compared with calculations according to a proposed general method for deriving complex fenestration system SHGC`s from bidirectional layer optical properties and generic calorimetric properties. Previously published optical data for the same <b>venetian</b> <b>blind</b> and generic inward-flowing fraction measurements {{are used in the}} calculation. Satisfactory agreement is found between SHGC measurements and calculation. Significant dependence on incident angle was found in the measured SHGC`s. Profile angle was not found to be a useful variable in characterizing the system performance. Predicted SHGC was found to be inherently dependent on two angles, although only the incident angle variations were observable under test conditions...|$|R
