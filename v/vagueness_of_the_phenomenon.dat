40|$|This work {{presents}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Partial Possibilistic Path Model in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> subjective measurement, where ordinal {{data are}} collected from rating surveys to measure latent concepts.

Possibilistic regression defines {{the relation between}} variables through possibilistic linear functions and considers the error due to <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human perception {{as reflected in the}} model via interval-valued parameters. A case study on the the motivational and emotional aspects of teaching is used to illustrate the method...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we make a}} hermeneutical {{analysis}} <b>of</b> internalism, <b>the</b> dominant {{tradition in}} <b>the</b> philosophy <b>of</b> sports. In order to accomplish this, we identify the prejudices that guide <b>the</b> internalist view <b>of</b> sports, namely <b>the</b> Platonic-Analytic prejudice introduced by Suits, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forefathers <b>of</b> internalism. Then, we critically analyze four consequences of following such a prejudice: a) its reductive nature, b) <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> a unrealistic view <b>of</b> sports, c) <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> excellence; and d) the leap from <b>the</b> descriptive analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sporting <b>phenomenon</b> to <b>the</b> setting <b>of</b> normative requirements for <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> sports...|$|R
50|$|Ham’s {{actions in}} Genesis 9:20-25, are debated upon because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script, but some {{interpret}} it as Ham doing something sexual {{with his father}} Noah, while Noah was passed out drunk in his tent.|$|R
50|$|Before 2009/10, <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law did {{not seem}} to matter because HMRC {{published}} relatively clear guidelines in document IR20. That document has been withdrawn from 2009/10 and replaced with the much vaguer guidance in HMRC 6.|$|R
5000|$|On August 16, the Seattle Times criticized <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{major party}} candidates' {{positions}} on the war and demanded more clarity.

5000|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pencil test, {{combined}} with <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Population Registration Act, communities were split apart on interpreted racial lines.

40|$|In this genetic-fuzzy based Generalized Dimension Exchange (GDE) {{method is}} {{proposed}} to uniformly distribute the unprecedented Web cluster workload.

Fuzzy set theory is used to capture <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workload during redistribution period. According to the experts’ subjective evaluations, a fuzzy inference system is established to aggregate the fuzzy web performance metrics into a so-called load-weight index which indicates the servers workload intensity. Based on the load-weight index, the genetic-fuzzy algorithm is applied to equally redistribute the workload among in the servers. Finally, a simulation of 20 load-weight indices in a topology of 3 -cube form Web cluster is implemented to illustrate <b>the</b> functionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "gross indecency," [...] this law allowed juries, judges and lawyers to prosecute {{virtually}} any male homosexual behaviour where actual sodomy {{could not be}} proven. The sentence was relatively light compared to sodomy, which remained a separate crime.|$|R
50|$|Another secrecy {{issue is}} the {{intelligence}} budget. The Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, paragraph 7, requires accounts of all public money be published “from time to time.” Many Administrations have argued using <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statement, that disclosing intelligence budget figures would harm National Security.|$|R
25|$|Like Tristan <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> Pelléas {{is a love}} {{triangle}} set in {{a vaguely}} Medieval world.

30|$|Moreover, “concrete definitions” will {{contribute}} to “overcome <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> social entrepreneurship” (Certo and Miller 2008 : 267).

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{jurisdiction}} caused inconvenience.

5000|$|The law was, however, more declaratory than practical: [...] "The <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{legislation}} made {{it extremely}} difficult to implement. Consequently, it ... remained idle until its later inclusion in the companion resolution to the 1987 Meech Lake Accord". The so-called [...] "companion resolution" [...] was enacted in 1993 as section 16.1 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Charter <b>of</b> Rights and Freedoms.|$|R
50|$|One {{objection}} {{that can}} be offered against Van Inwagen’s view is <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> category <b>of</b> life and <b>the</b> ambiguity <b>of</b> when something gets “caught up” in a life. For example, if a cat takes a breath and inhales a carbon atom, it is unclear at what point that atom becomes officially incorporated into the cat’s body.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Agility metrics are {{difficult}} to define in general, mainly due to <b>the</b> multidimensionality and <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> agility itself. In this paper, a knowledge-based framework is proposed for the measurement and assessment of public sector agility using the A. T. Kearney model. Fuzzy logic provides {{a useful tool for}} dealing with decisions in which <b>the</b> <b>phenomena</b> are imprecise and vague. In the paper, we use the absolute agility index together with fuzzy logic to address the ambiguity in agility evaluation in public sector in a case study. 1...|$|R

More generally, any term of tax law has a vague penumbra, and is a potential source of tax avoidance.|$|R

40|$|Query {{processing}} on partly inaccessible databases generally {{does not}} yield exact, but vague result sets. A good notion of vague sets fulfills two aims: It keeps <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> query result {{as small as}} possible, and it clarifies <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> and <b>the</b> reasons for the vagueness to the end user. The first goal requires a good internal representation, while the second goal requires a good external representation of a vague set. In this paper, we present a novel calculus for expressive vague sets that meets both requirements. This is the first approach that is well suited for {{both internal and external}} representation <b>of</b> <b>vagueness</b> induced by partial inaccessibility. It consists of a data representation that is capable <b>of</b> holding all <b>the</b> necessary information. Complementary, we have accordingly adapted the usual query language operations. These adaptations are independent of a concrete query language, to make them applicable to most existing query languages. The adapted operations minimize <b>the</b> <b>vagueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> result, propagate <b>the</b> reasons <b>of</b> uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual vague candidates, and compute an expressive description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing elements...|$|R
