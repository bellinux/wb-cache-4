Another series of experiments was performed, concerning the possibility to reduce the broadening and the multipath effects in the backscattered echoes, and to increase the bandwidth capability of a radiocommunication system by backscatter; it was shown that the echo pattern strongly depends on the antenna vertical beamwidth, and that the ionospheric irregularities producing multipath effects are of the focusing type: their occurrence notably increases with the latitude. 1.

40|$|Based on the {{description}} of a laboratory-built flow cytometer, the necessary modifications of this instrument for the measurement of fluorescence polarization are described. At a maximum rate exceeding 1, 000 cells/s, the instrument is capable of measuring simultaneously the horizontally and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>component</b> of the fluorescence emitted from stained cells excited with vertically polarized light. By mathematical analysis of the accumulated data, the distribution of polarization values in the population is obtained. Various sources of instrumental error have been investigated. The large aperture of the detector optics leads to systematic underestimation of the polarization values. Other errors are negligible, and the instrument is shown to give results consistent with the theory of fluorescence polarization. Application of the instrument is illustrated by experiments with mammalian cells exposed to the fluorogenic substrate fluorescein diacetate (FDA). The polarization of the fluorescence from intracellular fluorescein produced by hydrolysis of FDA is measured, giving information on the cytoplasmic microviscosity. It appears that this microviscosity is constant over the cell cycle. On the other hand, it is significantly affected by the osmolarity of the medium...|$|E

40|$|Microwave thermal {{emission}} from a {{layer of}} cloud or rain consisting of spherical particles has been investigated. Scattering effects are studied in great detail with both numerical and analytical approaches. In the absence of ground emission, {{it is found that}} scattering induces brightening for optically thin layers and vice versa for optically thick layers. As a function of observation angle, brightening occurs near nadir, while darkening occurs at large angles in the case of small optical thickness. For large optical thickness, darkening occurs at all angles because of backscattering effects. When the layer of cloud or rain is above an air layer and an ocean surface at a higher temperature, it is found that the darkening effect at large optical thickness is much more pronounced. The darkening effect is also larger for vertical polarizations because the ocean emits more <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>components.</b> The effect of thermal emission and molecular absorption by atmospheric gases is also taken into account.

40|$|The {{ability to}} excite new wave types, {{such as the}} {{horizontally}} polarized shear (SH) waves, enables EMAT 2 ̆ 7 s to perform functions not easily realized with conventional piezoelectric transducers. This paper describes two examples. An ultrasonic ellipsometer is presented which can excite, and detect, shear waves of arbitrary elliptical polarization. It therefore becomes possible to make precision measurements of elastic properties by making direct comparison of the propagation properties of the SH and SV (<b>vertically</b> <b>polarized)</b> <b>components</b> of the wave. The principles of operation are demonstrated by measuring fluid level, a surface property which. produces differential attenuation of the two components of the wave and thus a change in its elliptical polarization, and texture, a bulk property which produces differential velocity shifts. Preliminary data directed towards the measurement of adhesive bond strength is also included. A second technique presented is {{a new approach to}} the problem of detecting cracks under fasteners in wing lap joints. It has be. en found that SH waves, excited on the outer surface of the wing, can be injected into the lower surface of the joint by a wave guiding effect.

The motivation for this work stems from the need for accurate estimates of open water and thin ice within the Arctic ice pack. The technique utilizes the microwave polarization and spectral characteristics of these three ice types through two microwave radiance ratios: the 19. 4 GHz polarization and the spectral gradient ratio, which {{is a measure of}} the spectral difference between the 19. 4 -GHz and the 37. 0 -GHz <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> radiance <b>components.</b> The combined use of the spectral gradient ratio and polarization reduces the low ice concentration bias generally associated with the presence of thin ice types.

40|$|A polarimetric {{radiometer}} {{that operates}} at a frequency of 40 GHz {{has been designed}} and built as a prototype of multiple identical units that could be arranged in a planar array for scientific measurements. Such an array is planned for use in studying {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB). All of the subsystems and components of this polarimetric radiometer are integrated into a single multi-chip module (MCM) of substantially planar geometry. In comparison with traditional designs of polarimetric radiometers, the MCM design is expected to greatly reduce the cost per unit in an array of many such units. The design of the unit is dictated partly by a requirement, in the planned CMB application, to measure the Stokes parameters I, Q, and U of the CMB radiation with high sensitivity. (A complete definition of the Stokes parameters would exceed the scope of this article. In necessarily oversimplified terms, I is a measure of total intensity of radiation, while Q and U are measures of the relationships between the horizontally and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>components</b> of radiation.) Because the sensitivity of a single polarimeter cannot be increased significantly, the only way to satisfy the high-sensitivity requirement is to make a large array of polarimeters that operate in parallel. The MCM includes contact pins that can be plugged into receptacles on a standard printed-circuit board (PCB). All of the required microwave functionality is implemented within the MCM; any required supporting non-microwave ("back-end") electronic functionality, including the provision of DC bias and control signals, can be implemented by standard PCB techniques. On the way from a microwave antenna to the MCM, the incoming microwave signal passes through an orthomode transducer (OMT), which splits the radiation into an h + i(nu) beam and an h - i(nu) beam (where, using complex-number notation, h denotes the horizontal component, nu denotes the vertical component, and +/-i denotes a +/- 90 deg phase shift). Each of these beams enters the MCM through one of two WR- 22 waveguide input terminals in the lid of the MCM. The h + i(nu 0 and h - i(nu) signals are amplified, then fed to a phase-discriminator hybrid designed specifically to fit the predominantly planar character of the MCM geometry and to enable determination of Q and U. The phase-discriminator hybrid generates four outputs, which are detected and used to calculate I, Q, and U...|$|R

40|$|The TerraSAR-X {{satellite}} is a {{high resolution}} synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system launched in June 2007 which provides the option to split the antenna in along-track direction and sample two physical channels separately. Modern SARs are equipped with active phased array antennas and multiple channels. In order to keep costs low TerraSAR-X uses the redundant receiver unit for the second channel such that fore and aft channel signals are combined by a hybrid coupler to form sum and difference channel data. The dual receive antenna mode can either be used to acquire along-track interferometric data or to acquire signals with different polarizations {{at the same time}} (Quad pol). Fore and aft channel reconstruction is necessary if ground moving target indication algorithms such as the displaced phase center antenna technique or along-track interferometry shall be applied, and in order to separate the horizontally and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> received signal <b>components.</b> The proposed approach uses internal calibration pulses from different calibration beams in order to estimate and compensate the hardware impact.

40|$|Abstract—This letter proposes an annular {{cylindrical}} dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) with two-port diversity realizing simul-taneously omnidirectional horizontally and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> radiation {{patterns with}} low cross coupling. The horizontally and <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> radiation patterns are achieved by exciting the orthogonal TE and TM modes {{in a single}} cylindrical dielectric resonator (DR). Due to the high-factor of the TE mode, an air gap and multiple feeding lines are introduced to in-crease the impedance bandwidth. The proposed antenna provides an impedance bandwidth of 19. 1 % in the <b>vertically</b> <b>polarized</b> mode and an overlapping bandwidth of 7. 4 % in the horizontally polarized mode, with the overlapping band ranging from 3. 78 to 4. 07 GHz.
