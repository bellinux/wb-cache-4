5|$|During their stellar evolution, some stars {{pass through}} phases {{where they can}} become {{pulsating}} variables. Pulsating variable stars vary in radius and luminosity over time, expanding and contracting with periods ranging from minutes to years, {{depending on the size}} of the star. This category includes Cepheid and Cepheid-like stars, and long-period <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> as Mira.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{generalization of}} the derivative concerns complex functions of complex <b>variables,</b> <b>such</b> as functions from (a domain in) the complex numbers C to C. The {{notion of the}} derivative of such a function is obtained by replacing real variables with complex variables in the definition. If C is identified with R2 by writing a complex number z as , then a differentiable function from C to C is certainly differentiable as a function from R2 to R2 (in the sense that its partial derivatives all exist), but the converse is not true in general: the complex derivative only exists if the real derivative is complex linear and this imposes relations between the partial derivatives called the Cauchy–Riemann equations – see holomorphic functions.|$|E

5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period <b>variables,</b> <b>such</b> as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} mean and variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of time}} ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.|$|E
5|$|The online {{multiplayer}} mode for Grand Theft Auto IV allows up to 32 {{players to}} freely roam across a recreation of the single-player world. Players decide which game mode that {{they wish to}} play, including deathmatches and street races. Both cooperative and competitive game modes are available. These game modes are split into ranked and unranked matches. For players to level up through ranks, in-game money must be earned. The game also features a Free Mode, in which players have the entire map open to explore, with no end goal or mission to complete. Hosts of the game can control many <b>variables,</b> <b>such</b> as police presence, traffic, and weapons. LAN support {{is available in the}} Windows version of the game.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player {{to let them know}} that they have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player a significant amount of funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, at the end of the fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E
5|$|Luminosity {{has been}} {{reported}} in the past and is probably due to misidentification of external light sources such as lightning, city lights, and power flashes from broken lines, as internal sources are now uncommonly reported and are not known to ever have been recorded. In addition to winds, tornadoes also exhibit changes in atmospheric <b>variables</b> <b>such</b> as temperature, moisture, and pressure. For example, on June 24, 2003 near Manchester, South Dakota, a probe measured a 100 mbar (hPa) (2.95 inHg) pressure decrease. The pressure dropped gradually as the vortex approached then dropped extremely rapidly to 850 mbar (hPa) (25.10 inHg) in the core of the violent tornado before rising rapidly as the vortex moved away, resulting in a V-shape pressure trace. Temperature tends to decrease and moisture content to increase in the immediate vicinity of a tornado.|$|E

50|$|In electronics, {{the linear}} {{operating}} region of a device, for example a transistor, {{is where a}} dependent <b>variable</b> (<b>such</b> as the transistor collector current) is directly proportional to an independent <b>variable</b> (<b>such</b> as the base current). This ensures that an analog output is an accurate representation of an input, typically with higher amplitude (amplified). A typical example of linear equipment is a high fidelity audio amplifier, which must amplify a signal without changing its waveform. Others are linear filters, linear regulators, and linear amplifiers in general.|$|R
