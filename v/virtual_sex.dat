500|$|Observers {{contend that}} Gibson's {{influence}} {{on the development of}} the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream. Gibson introduced, in Neuromancer, the notion of the [...] "meatpuppet", and is credited with inventing—conceptually rather than participatorally—the phenomenon of <b>virtual</b> <b>sex.</b> His influence on early pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged, and he holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design. Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the [...] "conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of Neuromancer in 1984, asking [...] "what if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?" ...|$|E

25|$|In 2002 the United States Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition that the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) was {{facially}} invalid in prohibiting virtual or cartoon child pornography. The {{basis for the}} ruling was that the CPPA made unlawful some forms of protected First Amendment speech, banning depictions of sex between children even if not obscene and not involving real child victims. Under New York v. Ferber, if the depiction is of real child abuse or a real child victim, {{as a result of}} photographing a live performance, for instance, then it is not protected speech. Under Miller v. California, obscene speech is likewise excluded from First Amendment protection. The CPPA made all <b>virtual</b> child <b>sex</b> depictions illegal without regard to whether the speech was protected or not, so that part of the statute was struck down as facially invalid.|$|R

40|$|Whether {{or not we}} {{directly}} {{suffer from}} stress, the question arises how much the stress inevitably unfolding around us {{has the potential to}} infiltrate and negatively affect us. We investigated whether such empathic stress, defined as a stress response that arises solely by observing a target undergo a stressful situation, would permeate to the core of the stress system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Additionally, we investigated whether empathic stress responses may be modulated by the familiarity between observer and target (partners vs. strangers), the modality of observation (real-life vs. <b>virtual)</b> and observer <b>sex</b> (female vs. male). Participants were tested in dyads, paired with a loved one or a stranger of the opposite sex. While the target of the dyad (n = 151) was exposed to a psychosocial stressor, the observer (n = 211) watched through a one-way mirror or via live video transmission. Overall, 26 % of the observers displayed physiologically signiﬁcant cortisol increases. This empathic stress was more pronounced in intimate observer-target dyads and during the real-life representation of the stressor. Importantly, signiﬁcant cortisol responses also emerged in strangers and the virtual observation modality. Empathic cortisol stress responses did not differ between men and women. When looking at the subjective-psychological component of stress, however, women exhibited empathic stress responses significantly more frequently than men. The occurrence of empathic stress down to the level of HPA axis activation, in some cases even in total strangers and when only virtually witnessing another’s distress, may have important implications for the development of stress-related diseases...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. The United States is {{the second}} leading {{destination}} country for sex trafficking in the world. Increased effort to understand patterns of sex trafficking within the U. S. is imperative to combatting this issue. Covert networks are increasingly using {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) to extend their operations. Due to the increase in sex trafficking network activity online, {{there is a need for}} systematic research and methods especially in terms of technology facilitated sex trafficking. This study examined how publicly available information can be used to uncover covert networks and sex trafficking patterns in the United States through the study of dark networks from a sociotechnical perspective. The intent was to observe the types of data available in online escort advertisements and to identify ways to exploit data into meaningful information that can be used to disrupt this activity. Network analysis methods were applied to sex trafficking activity in online environments to identify sex trafficking trends within the U. S. Content analysis was used to identify important data fields in online escort advertisement that presented <b>virtual</b> indicators of <b>sex</b> trafficking. This data was further exploited using social network analysis (SNA) methods to identify provider networks and movement trends. Methods are presented to identify potential victims, provider networks, and domestic movement trends. Covert networks are continuously balancing security risk with operational necessity to communicate to external audiences. By using the Internet as a communication channel it becomes a lens to observe this activity. Consistency of findings with known trafficking trends demonstrated the effectiveness of the method to uncover covert networks and circuits within the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{disorders}} {{are among the}} most commonly occurring of all mental disorders. In this context, the question arises whether the stress inevitably unfolding around us has the potential to “contaminate” and compromise us. In the current multi-center study, we investigate the existence of such empathic stress (defined as a full-blown physiological stress response that arises solely by observing a target undergo a stressful situation), and whether empathic stress permeates to the core of the stress system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Additionally, we investigate whether empathic stress responses may be modulated by the familiarity between observer and target (partners vs. strangers), the modality of observation (real-life vs. <b>virtual)</b> and observer <b>sex</b> (female vs. male). Participants were tested in dyads, paired with a loved one or a stranger of the opposite sex. While the target of the dyad (n = 151) was exposed to a psychosocial stressor, the observer (n = 211) watched through a one-way mirror or via live video transmission. Overall, 26 % of the observers displayed physiologically significant cortisol increases. This empathic stress was more pronounced in intimate observer-target dyads (40 %) and during the real-life representation of the stressor (30 %). Empathic stress was further modulated by interindividual differences in empathy measures. Despite the higher prevalence of empathic stress in the partner and real-life observation conditions, significant cortisol responses also emerged in strangers (10 %) and the virtual observation modality (24 %). The occurrence of empathic stress down to the level of HPA-axis activation, in some cases even in total strangers and when only virtually witnessing another's distress, may have important implications for the development of stress-related diseases...|$|R
