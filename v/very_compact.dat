5|$|The city of Providence is {{geographically}} <b>very</b> <b>compact,</b> {{characteristic of}} eastern seaboard cities that developed prior {{to use of}} the automobile. It {{is among the most}} densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane King struck Miami {{around midnight}} local {{time with a}} <b>very</b> <b>compact</b> area of strong winds. Its eye was about 5.2miles (8.4km) in diameter; {{the western edge of}} the eye moved across Miami International Airport, which {{reported}} wind gusts of 125mph (202km/h), and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office, which recorded sustained winds of 122mph (197km/h). The principal damage zone was sharply-defined in an area 14miles (23km) in diameter; the boundaries of the damage resembled the path of a tornado, although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority of the damage was not tornadic in nature. There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie. As it made landfall, Hurricane King produced lightning near its center, which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida. The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane since the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane to hit the area.|$|E

5|$|Such mergers were theorized {{to produce}} kilonovae, and {{evidence}} for a kilonova associated with GRB 130603B was seen. The mean duration of these events of 0.2 seconds suggests (because of causality) a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms; less than 0.2 light-seconds (about 60,000km or 37,000 miles—four times the Earth's diameter). This further suggests a <b>very</b> <b>compact</b> object as the source. The observation of minutes to hours of X-ray flashes after a short gamma-ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole {{in less than two}} seconds, followed by some hours of lesser energy events, as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material (no longer neutronium) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole, {{over a longer period of}} time. A small fraction of short gamma-ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Mireille {{were from a}} poorly-organized area of convection, or thunderstorms, {{associated}} with the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands on September13. That day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began tracking {{the system as a}} tropical depression. The system moved westward, developing a large increase in thunderstorms over the center on September15. That day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert, and issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 21W at 00:00UTC, estimating 1‑minute sustained winds of 55km/h (35mph). About six hours later, the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Mireille, after satellite imagery indicated the storm was <b>very</b> <b>compact</b> and intensifying quickly. The JTWC later determined in a post-storm analysis that Mireille had attained tropical storm status 12hours earlier on the previous day. Also at the time of it attaining tropical storm status, Mireille was one of three storms in the basin, along with Tropical Storm Luke to the northwest and Typhoon Nat to the west in the South China Sea.|$|E

The study of the dynamical properties shows that simulated self-diffusion coefficients of water are in agreement with short time coefficients measured by neutron scattering. For the ions, the experimental values are related to macroscopic long-time motion and are not directly comparable to simulations. However, the introduction of simulated values in macroscopic models gives results in agreement with tracer experiments...|$|R

The development of man-portable, shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket launchers began in 1941; most could be reloaded, but a few such as the German Panzerfaust were fired from disposable tubes. Unlike anti-tank guns, their light weight made them easily portable by individual infantrymen on the battlefield, and they offered similar degrees of firepower whilst being quicker and cheaper to produce.|$|E
