Consequently power is {{continually}} dissipated and its design {{is dominated by the}} need to remove excess heat from the semiconductor device. Power amplifier devices can often be recognized by the heat sink used to mount the devices. Multiple types of power semiconductor amplifier device exist, such as the bipolar junction transistor, the <b>vertical</b> <b>MOS</b> field effect transistor, and others. Power levels for individual amplifier devices range up to hundreds of watts, and frequency limits range up to the lower microwave bands. A complete audio power amplifier, with two channels and a power rating on the order of tens of watts, can be put into a small integrated circuit package, needing only a few external passive components to function. Another important application for active-mode amplifiers is in linear regulated power supplies, when an amplifier device is used as a voltage regulator to maintain load voltage at a desired setting. While such a power supply may be less energy efficient than a switched mode power supply, the simplicity of application makes them popular, especially in current ranges up to about one amp.|$|E

However, device scaling is {{getting more and more}} complicated due to physical limitations. Novel device architectures are needed to overcome these problems. Vertical transistors could be one potential solution since the channel length is independent from the device layout. In this thesis, novel concepts to reduce parasitic behaviour in vertical single and surround gate MOSFETs are presented. This includes a novel fillet local oxidation (FILOX) process, optimisations of the pillar, a pillar top insulator and the incorporation of polySiGe into the source of a <b>vertical</b> <b>MOS</b> transistor. Calculations based on industry layout rules at the l 00 nm technology node for vertical and lateral devices are presented. For the optimised minimum geometry single gate vertical MOSFET incorporating FILOX with optimised pillar structure, the gate/drain capacitance is 40 % and the gate/source overlap capacitance 60 % of that of a minimum dimension lateral MOS device. For optimised surround gate transistors the overlap capacitance is 20 % and 5 % of that of a lateral transistor. These calculations demonstrate the potential of optimised <b>vertical</b> <b>MOS</b> transistors. Pillar capacitors incorporating the FILOX process have been fabricated and a reduction in the measured capacitance is obtained by a factor of 1. 4 and 5. 6 for structures with nitride top and nitride top and FILOX, respectively. Device simulations confirm the measured reduction in capacitance. The extracted oxide thickness on the pillar sidewall is 9. 3 nm for the fabricated structures, which agrees within a factor of 1. 18 with the simulated oxide thickness on the sidewall. Kinks in CV measurements have been investigated and explained by the formation of an inversion layer underneath the field oxide. A low overlap capacitance, surround gate, vertical MOSFET technology is presented, which uses FILOX to reduce the overlap capacitance between the gate and the drain {{on the bottom of the}} pillar.

40|$|Since the {{isolation}} of graphene in 2004, interest regarding two-dimensional materials properties and their synthesis has exploded. Group VIb transition metal dichalcogenides (MX 2 : M=Mo, W; X = S, Se) are a class of layered semiconductors that show unique layer-number dependent electronic and optical properties. For example, bulk three-dimensional MoS 2 is an indirect band gap semiconductor with a 1. 2 eV band gap, while monolayer MoS 2 nanohseet is a direct band gap semiconductor with a 1. 8 eV energy gap. This exciting change in electronic structure opens several possibilities towards implementing these materials in novel device assemblies such as field effect transistors, electroluminescent devices, and flexible optoelectronic devices. While these materials offer great promise, isolating transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers requires tedious mechanical exfoliations using scotch tape, which is neither practical nor scalable for production. In {{the first part of}} my dissertation, we investigated the synthesis of MoS 2 and WS 2 monolayers using chemical vapor deposition. The isolated nanosheets were single crystal, triangular, and had edge lengths up to 100 μm. In the next chapter, by utilizing H 2 gas in a chemical vapor deposition apparatus, MoSe 2 monolayers and few-layers were also synthesized. The MoSe 2 nanosheets exhibited thickness-dependent vibrational and optical properties, and a notable intense photoluminescence emission from the direct band gap monolayer region. In the following chapter, we describe an alternative method to produce WSe 2 nanosheets by physically vaporizing of WSe 2 powder at a high temperature. Using WSe 2 powder directly is advantageous since under optimal conditions we can selectively grow single-layer WSe 2 domains or single-layer films up to several square centimeters. Lastly, we combine the synthesis of the transition metal chalcogenides previously described into lateral and vertical heterostructures grown in situ by chemical vapor deposition.

40|$|The {{emerging}} nanowire {{technology in}} recent years has attracted an increasing interest for high-speed, low-power electronics due to the possibility of a gate-all-around (GAA) geometry enabling aggressive gate length scaling, together with the ease in incorporating high-mobility narrow band gap III-V semiconductors such as InAs on Si substrates. These benefits make vertical nanowire transistors an attractive alternative to the planar devices. However, huge challenges are also encountered. Apart from the large parasitics associated with the device layout, vertical III-V/high-k nanowire MOSFETs so far are also suffering from a less efficient gate control partially due to the defect states existing in the MOS gate stack. Besides the narrow band gap InAs may result in impact-ionization and band-to-band tunneling at high drain voltages, influencing both the power efficiency and speed of modern integrated circuits (ICs). In this thesis, results on planar InAs/high-k MOS gate stacks investigated in detail using both the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques are first presented (Paper I and II). The origin of the specific trap state energy distribution is clarified and compared to the well studied InGaAs and GaAs materials. The results highlight the benefit of using InAs, with optimized high-k deposition strategies, as the n-MOSFET channel. The second focus of the thesis is the improvement of <b>vertical</b> GAA nanowire <b>MOS</b> gate stacks (Paper III and IV). By developing the fabrication scheme and design, conventional C-V technique is successfully applied to extract detailed trap state distributions. A low interface trap state density (Dit) below 10 E 12 eV- 1 cm- 2 near the MOS semiconductor conduction band edge is achieved. Furthermore, RF C-V measurements, together with the development of a complete small signal equivalent circuit model, for <b>vertical</b> GAA nanowire <b>MOS</b> systems are also presented for the first time, which enables characterizations of border trap density, interface trap density, channel resistivity and quality factor of the nanowire MOSFETs simultaneously.

An asymmetric InAs/InGaAs vertical nanowire MOSFET with a large band gap drain region is proposed, taking advantage of the efficient strain relaxation of nanowire epitaxial growth. Control of the InGaAs nanowire composition has been successfully demonstrated.

40|$|Silicon carbide {{has been}} the focus of intense {{research}} in recent years. Its higher breakdown field and higher thermal conductivity than silicon gives it the potential for high power applications with superior performance. To exploit these advantages, a vertical MOS-based power device is developed. The vertical orientation of the device takes advantage of the higher bulk electron mobility in that direction. This device structure has been optimally designed to potentially block 7. 5 kV in the off-state, while maintaining a high drive current in the on-state. To accomplish both design constraints, two technological innovations were implemented. First, the device design was improved through the incorporation of an extended p-bottom region. This design feature protects the gate oxide from high fields without significant loss of the drive current. Finally, the processing technique was improved with the invention of a self aligned implant mask to avoid degradation of the on-state from the p-bottom implant. The fabricated devices exhibit blocking voltages of 5. 0 kV with specific on-resistance of 105 mΩcm 2. These devices currently demonstrate the highest blocking voltage for a UMOSFET structure in SiC. The drive current of these devices exceeds those reported in literature having similar blocking voltages but different design structures. ^ The advancement of MOS-based power devices in SiC are profoundly repressed by the low inversion channel mobility. Ongoing studies on SiC MOS structures have shown improvement of the inversion channel mobility on lateral devices, but there is no corresponding data for vertical devices. Part of this thesis, describes experiments performed in an attempt to bridge the information gap between lateral and <b>vertical</b> SiC <b>MOS</b> structures. The results of the experiments indicate that similar improvements are attainable on the sidewall of a vertical MOSFET (UMOS). ^ Currently in the silicon community, the device dimensions are being scaled down aggressively, resulting in very thin thermal gate oxides. The resulting excessive gate leakage current has propelled the investigation of alternative insulators with high dielectric constants (k) as a replacement of thermal oxide. The final aspect of this thesis presents some of the exploratory work done on evaluating these high-k dielectrics as a supplant to thermal oxide for the gate insulator in SiC MOS power devices. The higher k-value can induce greater inversion channel charge for similar insulator electric fields, and so diminish the impact of low inversion channel mobility. Successful capacitors were formed with higher k values (about 10) but their high gate leakage did not provide a significant advantage over thermal oxides. ...|$|R

As shown by Fig.  3 c, the charge transfer resistance of h-rGO@MoS 2 is about 15  Ω, which is smaller than its counterpart MoS 2 (28  Ω). This smaller internal resistance stems from the increased conductivity and shortened electron transfer pathways [33], which favor ion permeation and electron transfer, thus improving the HER catalytic performance. Besides the internal resistance, the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is another significant factor that {{has an impact on}} the HER performance. The corresponding electrochemical double-layer capacitances of h-rGO@MoS 2 and MoS 2 were measured by CV (ranging from 0.1 to 0.3  V) at different scan rates, as shown in Figs.  3 d and S 8. Moreover, a linear relationship between the scan rate and current density is observed, as shown in Fig.  3 e. Based on the calculation, h-rGO@MoS 2 has a capacitance of 5.5  mF cm− 2, which is 3.5 times higher than that of pristine MoS 2. In other words, the electrochemically active sites are boosted after the <b>vertical</b> growth of <b>MoS</b> 2 on h-rGO, and this increase in electrochemically active sites no doubt enhanced the intrinsic HER activity of MoS 2.
