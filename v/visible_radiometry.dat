40|$|Technical {{advances}} and recent applications of active and passive satellite remote sensing techniques {{to the study}} of oceanic processes are summarized. The general themes include infrared and <b>visible</b> <b>radiometry,</b> active and passive microwave sensors, and buoy location systems. The surface parameters of sea surface temperature, windstream, sea state, altimetry, color, and ice are treated as applicable under each of the general methods...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} goal {{in early}} missions of satellite-borne <b>visible</b> spectral <b>radiometry</b> (ocean colour) {{was to create}} synoptic fields of phytoplankton biomass indexed as concentration of chlorophyll-a. In the context of climate change, a major application of the results {{has been in the}} modelling of primary production and the ocean carbon cycle. It is now recognised that a partition of the marine autotrophic pool into a suite of phytoplankton functional types, each type having a characteristic role in the biogeochemical cycle of the ocean, would increase our understanding of the role of phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle. At the same time, new methods have been emerging that use <b>visible</b> spectral <b>radiometry</b> to map some of the phytoplankton functional types. Here, we assess the state of the art, and suggest paths for future work. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Visible</b> Spectral <b>Radiometry</b> (VSR, often {{referred}} to as ocean colour) is a highly quantitative methodology that yields accurate and precise fields of an important marine geophysical variable (chlorophyll concentration) of high significance for understanding the planetary carbon cycle. It is a quantity in ocean biogeochemistry and has many other applications including management of marine resources. It provides our only window into the marine ecosystem on synoptic scales. Of particular importance is the application to climate research: chlorophyll resides in phytoplankton, which use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis leading to a potential reduction in the atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas. In the climate context, it is vital that a seamless time series be constructed using data from all available missions. The merged data set protects the temporal continuity of the data stream and optimises the spatial coverage. JRC. H. 3 -Global environement monitorin...|$|R
40|$|The book {{focuses on}} optical (<b>visible</b> and thermal) <b>radiometry</b> with {{emphasis}} on the integration of in situ measurements into satellite observations. The objective is to streamline technologies and methodologies necessary to meet the accuracy requirements for climate change investigations. This includes detailing design requirements and calibration techniques for space instruments. However, emphasis is also placed {{in the design of}} in situ instruments, absolute calibration, field deployment, measurement protocols, data processing and quality assurance, and finally inter-comparisons as a viable solution to achieve community consensus.

40|$|Current and pending oceanographic {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} allows {{the conceptualization of}} a programme designed to investigate ocean island interactions that could induce short-term nearshore fluxes of particulate organic carbon and biogenic calcium carbonate from pelagic island archipelagoes. These events will influence the geochemistry of adjacent waters, particularly the marine carbon system. Justification and design are provided for a study that would combine oceanographic satellite remote sensing (<b>visible</b> and infrared <b>radiometry,</b> altimetry and scatterometry) with shore-based facilities. A programme incorporating the methodology outlined here would seek to identify the mechanisms that cause such events, assess their geochemical significance, and provide both analytical and predictive capabilities for observations on greater temporal and spatial scales...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} by means of {{radiosonde}} data from the Joint Air-Sea Interaction (JASIN) experiment that the Seasat Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) atmospheric water vapor distributions, taken over 600 -km wide swaths with a resolution of 54 km, {{can be used to}} detect the position of atmospheric fronts in the lower troposphere. In addition to the fact that, unlike <b>visible</b> and IR <b>radiometry,</b> the SMMR determinations are not hampered by extensive cirrus or by a lack of frontal clouds, they use more channels, allowing better discrimination between the effects of liquid water, water vapor and sea state, and show improved spatial resolution. Data analysis results show that the SMMR atmospheric water vapor distributions have an accuracy comparable to that of in situ radiosonde measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of phytoplankton on the spectral {{structure of the}} submarine irradiance field is reviewed. The implications for the ocean system of the spectral response by phytoplankton to the ambient light field are discussed. For example, it provides the basis for retrieval of phytoplankton biomass by <b>visible</b> spectral <b>radiometry</b> (ocean-colour remote sensing). In the computation of primary production, the results of spectral models differ in a known and systematic manner from those of non-spectral ones. The bias can be corrected without risk of incurring additional random errors. The models in use for phytoplankton growth, whether based on available light or absorbed light, whether {{expressed in terms of}} chlorophyll or carbon, are shown all to conform to the same basic formalism with the same parameters. Residual uncertainty lies less with the models than with the parameters required for their implementation. The submarine light field and the spectral characteristics of phytoplankton carry latent information on phytoplankton community structure. Differences in spectral response by different functional types of phytoplankton are small but significant. Optical considerations limit the maximum phytoplankton biomass that can be sustained in a given surface mixed layer. Moreover, the upper bound on the biomass depends on the spectral response of the dominant phytoplankton taxa. As a result, an optical control exists in the mixed layer that tends to resist extreme excursions of the biomass and also to maintain biodiversity in the phytoplankton...|$|R
