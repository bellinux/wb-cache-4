40|$|High {{resolution}} {{estimates of}} trawling effort {{are needed to}} underpin studies of trawling impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystem processes, and to monitor responses to area closure and other management actions. Satellite-based vessel monitoring systems (VMS) were designed for fishery control and enforcement, but they provide potentially valuable source information on spatial and temporal patterns of trawling activity at multiple scales. Based on an analysis of <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> for UK beam trawlers in the North Sea, a method is described for identifying trawling activity and estimating fishing intensity based on the minimum and maximum potential spatial extent of trawling effort from <b>VMS</b> <b>data.</b> The optimal method for identifying trawling and steaming behaviour combined speed and directionality rules and correctly identified trawling and steaming in 99 % and 95 % of cases, respectively. Using speed- and directionality-filtered <b>VMS</b> <b>data,</b> trawling effort can be reported as area impacted per unit time per unit area at a range of grid scales from 1 km to 100 km (10 000 km 2).

40|$|For {{control and}} {{enforcement}} purposes, all fishing vessels operating in European waters are equipped with satellite-based Vessel Monitoring by Satellite systems (VMS) recording their position at regular time intervals. <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> are increasingly used by scientists to study spatial and temporal patterns of fishing activity and thus fishing impact (e. g. surface of sea bed trawled during a fishing trip). However, due to their low resolution (2 h basis), these data may provide a biased perception of fishing impact. We present here a method aiming at interpolating vessel trajectories from <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> points to obtain higher-resolution data on vessel trajectories which in turn should provide improved estimates of the spatial and temporal patterns of fishing activity and hence fishing impact. This method {{is based on a}} spline interpolation technique, the cubic Hermite spline (cHs), using position, heading and speed to interpolate the trawl track of a vessel between two succeeding <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> points. To take uncertainty of the interpolated track into account, the method also determines a confidence interval, which represents the spatial distribution of vessel presence probability between two successive VMS positions. The cHs method was compared to the straight line interpolation technique using a reference data set with intervals of 6 min which was assumed to represent the real trawl tracks. The results showed that the cHs method approximates the real trawl track markedly better than a straight line interpolation. The cHs method should therefore be preferred to the conventional straight line approach to interpolate vessel tracks in studies aiming at estimating fishing impact from <b>VMS</b> <b>data...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Working Group on Spatial Fisheries Data (WGSFD) met at ICES Headquarters, Copenhagen, 10 – 13 June 2014. ICES {{had issued}} two data calls for {{aggregated}} <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> {{for the years}} 2009 – 2012 : one covering the OSPAR region and one covering the HELCOM region. The group evaluated the data, and used them to answer the ToRs. ICES have produced a document describing ICES Conditions for <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> use, which {{all members of the}} group signed. The <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> that ICES received is only to be used for ICES work and after answering the ToRs, the data are to be deleted. The submitted <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> were aggregated to DCF métier level 6, giving more than 900 unique codes; however some countries only submitted data aggregated to level 4 gear codes. To overcome this discrepancy, it was decided to group the métiers into broader gear categories. For the OSPAR region: Bottom trawls, Dredges, Demersal seines and Beam trawls. For the HELCOM region: Gillnets, Longlines, Bottom trawls and Midwater trawls. As part of the evaluation of the data quality, the aggregated VMS effort data submitted was compared to effort data from the STECF database. These two independent datasets showed similar overall patterns, indicating that the submitted VMS dataset could be used to show the distribution of fishing effort. WGSFD produced a cleaned VMS dataset, aggregated by year and gear groupings, which other ICES EG’s can use. Caveats applying to all the <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> products and maps in the report were listed. Based on the evaluation of the submitted data, a revised exchange format for aggregated <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> was suggested. To answer ToR a, DCF indicators 5, 6 and 7 were computed byyear, ICES area (sub-division in the Baltic) and both by gear group and total for all gears. DCF indicator 5 relates to the total area covered by fishing activity, DCF indicator 6 has been calculated as the extent to which fishing activities are aggregated, and DCF indicator 7, the total area not impacted by fishing activities, was calculated by subtracting DCF indicator 5 fishing area from the area of the ICES area/subdivision. All the DCF indicators have been expressed both as area and proportions of the total area. In ToR a, WGSFD was also requested to contribute to ICES work on MSFD descriptor 6. The group produced a cleaned dataset, aggregated by year and gear group, which other ICES EG’s can use to relate fishing pressure to potential impact on underlying habitats. The following example outputs were produced: 1. Map of mean fishing effort in number of hours per km 2. 2. Map of increase/decrease in fishing effort over the years analysed. 3. Map of number of years a c-square has been impacted, with different thresholds. For ToR b, WGSFD responded to requests from other ICES EG’s: Requests from WGBFAS and WGNSSK related to fishing effort, a request from WGMPCZM and a request from ADGVME regarding use of AIS data. For ToR c on reviewing ongoing work for analysing <b>VMS</b> <b>data,</b> WGSFD were updated on: • the ongoing work in the BENTHIS project; • a method developed by JNCC for estimating benthic abrasion caused by human activities; • a nested grids method for calculating the area of the seabed impacted by fishing gear; • the bias and variance of estimates of fishing effort from VMS data; • production of an Atlas of Commercial Fisheries around Ireland. ToR d was a request from OSPAR to propose and apply a method to map mobile bottom contact fishing intensity and to prepare a first OSPAR-wide map of the spatial and temporal intensity of mobile bottom-contact fishing activities. The co-lead of the ICG-COBAM benthic expert group was present at the meeting to provide information both on the purpose of the data call and how the products were to be analysed. The group performed an initial evaluation of whether the data submitted served the purpose of the OSPAR request, and based on this work, WGSFD proposed a revised exchange format for future data calls for aggregated <b>VMS</b> <b>data.</b> Maps for the OSPAR region showing VMS effort by year and gear group were produced as well as a map showing the gear composition in the area and an example map applying the abrasion methodology giving maps of surface and sub-surface bottom contact...|$|E

Although China has applied the Beidou fishing vessel position monitoring system (VMS) to manage trawlers since 2006, little is known regarding the impacts of trawling on the sea bottom environments. In this study, continuous <b>VMS</b> <b>data</b> of the 1403 single-rig otter trawlers registered in the Xiangshan Port, 3. 9 % of the total trawlers in China, were used to map the trawling effort in 2013.

Our results show that all three indexes had similar patterns in the YS and ECS, and indicated a higher fishing effort of fishing grounds that were near the port.
