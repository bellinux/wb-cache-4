40|$|The {{role of the}} {{antigen-presenting cell}} in the {{generation}} of the T helper lymphocyte-mediated immune response {{has been the subject}} of intensive investigation. To date it has been well established that accessory cells take up, sequester in intracellular compartments, and re-express antigen at the cell surface membrane in an energy-requiring, dynamic process that requires cell <b>viability</b> (<b>reviewed</b> in references 1 - 3). Various investigators have shown that T cells recognize antigen in association with I-A and I-E molecules present on the surface of the accessory cell (4, 5) and that different antigen determinants may be recognized in association with distinct Ia epitopes (6 - 9). There is considerable circumstantial evidence that for most soluble protein antigens the re-expressed surface antigen that is recognized by T cells is not in native form. Several studies have shown that T cells recognize chemically denatured forms of antigen just as well as native, globular protein (10, 11) and that small peptide antigen fragments can be as effective as the whole protein in generating T cell responses (12 - 14). Furthermore, kinetic studies have show...|$|R

As major insights in signal peptidase function and structure have been obtained from studies on the signal peptidase LepB of Escherichia coli, similarities and differences between this enzyme and known Gram-positive signal peptidases are highlighted. Notably, while the incentive for previous research on Gram-positive signal peptidases was largely based on their role in the biotechnologically important process of protein secretion, present-day interest in these essential enzymes is primarily derived from the idea that they may serve as targets for novel anti-microbials. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} debates {{in the study of}} the {{psychology}} of emotion concerns the conception of emotions as unified psychological constructs (categorical/discrete) versus the dimensional approach to emotional episodes. In this context, the dimensional model of Russell (2003) stands out as an inclusive framework that takes into account a set of historical problems in this field of study. We analysed the model, discussed its <b>viability,</b> and <b>reviewed</b> the empirical evidence in favour of four hypotheses that underlie Russell’s dimensional model: (1) There is a temporary primacy of basic affects versus more cognitive components in the development of an emotion; (2) perceived affective changes facilitate access to hedonically congruent material; (3) the human mind can mistakenly attribute the experience of a specific core affect to the incorrect stimulus; and (4) the experience of the dimensional components facilitates the occurrence of congruent cognitive responses. The combination of nonspecific dimensional components, both purely affective as well as those with more "cognitive" characteristics, can act as prototypical emotions. We conclude that Russell’s dimensional model is an integrated alternative to other models with great potential for studying the nature of emotion...|$|R
40|$|While the {{toxicity}} of metals and metalloids, like arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead and chromium, is undisputed, the underlying molecular mechanisms {{are not entirely}} clear. General consensus holds that proteins are the prime targets; heavy metals interfere with the physiological activity of specific, particularly susceptible proteins, either by forming a complex with functional side chain groups or by displacing essential metal ions in metalloproteins. Recent studies have revealed an additional mode of metal action targeted at proteins in a non-native state; certain heavy metals and metalloids {{have been found to}} inhibit the in vitro refolding of chemically denatured proteins, to interfere with protein folding in vivo and to cause aggregation of nascent proteins in living cells. Apparently, unfolded proteins with motile backbone and side chains are considerably more prone to engage in stable, pluridentate metal complexes than native proteins with their well-defined 3 D structure. By interfering with the folding process, heavy metal ions and metalloids profoundly affect protein homeostasis and cell <b>viability.</b> This <b>review</b> describes how heavy metals impede protein folding and promote protein aggregation, how cells regulate quality control systems to protect themselves from metal toxicity and how metals might contribute to protein misfolding disorders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. What caused {{the financial crisis}} of 2007 - 10 ? Many, including the British Chancellor Alistair Darling, have blamed the 'irresponsibility' of investment bank managers. Such an accusation of poor performance of managers is plausible {{given the fact that}} financial institutions have been in the forefront of adopting various change programmes to enhance their <b>viability.</b> A <b>review</b> of existing evidence reveals that the managers reacted 'irresponsibly' to 'contextual forces', such as the perception of risk, decline in bank capital, regulatory burden and supervisory overreaction. But why did they do so? We need to understand how different contextual forces were understood by the managers, and why they reacted to them as they did. Unfortunately, the literature shows little insights into a playing out of managers' orientations and contextual forces. This project argues that depending on the nature and specific peculiarities of each contextual force and condition, managers adopt and apply different assumptions and orientations at different times in the process of planning change and managing their organisations. Contingent upon these factors, managers could not act completely rational in their orientations and follow-up decisions and actions. This project will rectify this by undertaking a longitudinal tracer study on investment bank managers...|$|R

Accumulated biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that CK 2 has {{a vast array of}} candidate physiological targets and participates in a complex series of cellular functions, including the maintenance of cell <b>viability.</b> This <b>review</b> summarizes current knowledge of the structural and enzymic features of CK 2, and discusses advances that challenge traditional views of this enzyme.

This review also discusses a number of the mechanisms that contribute to the regulation of CK 2 in cells, and will highlight emerging insights into the role of CK 2 in cellular decisions of life and death. In this latter respect, recent evidence suggests that CK 2 can exert an anti-apoptotic role by protecting regulatory proteins from caspase-mediated degradation. The mechanistic basis of the observation that CK 2 is essential for viability may reside in part in this ability to protect cellular proteins from caspase action. Furthermore, this anti-apoptotic function of CK 2 may contribute to its ability to participate in transformation and tumorigenesis...|$|R

Both DNA and RNA have been analysed using molecular amplification methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA).

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 33 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 7 - 10 July 2014 "Leading Transport into the Future", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. A combination of apartheid policies and market forces have resulted in expansive and inefficient urban forms in South African cities. Current spatial development plans attempt to curb this expansion and manipulate land use characteristics to achieve socially beneficial goals. An increasingly important goal, recognised in contemporary South African urban policy and legislation, is the improvement of public transport quality, efficiency and viability. The links between urban form and public transport networks are, however, not well understood, and little empirical research of this relationship has been undertaken. A review of the available literature suggests that the land use characteristics of urban density, land use mix and polycentrism have the most significant effect on public transport efficiency and <b>viability.</b> A <b>review</b> of the South African transport policy environment reveals five land use-related public transport objectives (relating to coverage, quality-of-service, modal split, subsidisation and household expenditure). Increased urban density is argued to be a pre-condition for attaining all of these policy objectives. South African city-wide densification targets (typically around 80 persons/ha) are compared to the densities of international cities that have achieved the policy objectives identified in South African policy. This comparison suggests that South African densification targets may be lower than required, and that targets {{in the region of}} 140 - 190 persons/ha might be more appropriate. Poor availability of data on urban form-public transport relationships is identified as a problem, and it is argued that simulation research is needed to gain greater insight, particularly in relation to the impacts of articulated density, land use mix and polycentrism.
