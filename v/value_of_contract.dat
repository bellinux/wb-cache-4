The model is informed by a capability-based view of public sector tendering that includes relational and procedural dimensions. To test the model a survey was carried out on firms competing for contracts with Irish public sector organizations (n = 3010). The survey was repeated one year later to demonstrate reliability (n = 3092). Overall, the results {{lend support to the}} model. Procedural capability is associated with frequency of tendering and typical <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> sought. Relational capability is not. Procedural and relational capabilities are each significant in accounting for success rates in contract competitions and commercial orientation towards the public sector.

40|$|Barriers to SME {{participation}} in public procurement {{have been the}} focus of research for many years. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the predictors of SME success. This paper examines the role that tendering capabilities - relational and procedural - play in explaining SME activity and performance in public contract competitions. Analysis of primary survey data from 3010 SMEs supports a capability-based perspective. Procedural capability has a significant effect on number of tenders submitted and <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> sought. Relational capability does not. However, procedural and relational capability each has a significant and positive effect on contract win-ratio and percentage of total revenue derived from public contracts. For SMEs, these findings underline the importance of investing in tendering skills and devising buyer engagement strategies. Enterprise support agencies and public sector organisations can play their part through the provision of targeted training programmes and better communication with SME suppliers respectively...|$|E

So, the government issued rules regarding price adjustments through Presidential Decree No. 70 / 2012 Article 92 that completes the previous rules. Rules {{about the price}} adjustment are {{described in more detail}} in the contract documents. This situation has led to the price adjustment calculations between different projects. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the value of an escalation in the ongoing work items in Jatigede DamProject and Jatibarang Dam Project. Hopefully, through this research, regulation application number 70 / 2012 on contract documents related to price adjustment. The research was conducted by interview, field observation and simulation calculations based of Jatigede Dam Project and Jatibarang Dam Project contract documents in data processing.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the subprime mortgage crisis, the contract rights of numerous hedge funds and venture capital funds were breached. These contracts were complex and sophisticated and had been negotiated at great time and expense. Yet despite all of the assumptions of neo-classical contracts theory, nothing happened. Practically none of these injured parties sued to enforce their rights. Professor Illig uses this dearth of litigation to conduct a form of natural experiment as to the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law. Discrete market participants contracted before the crash and then pursued their rights in court afterwards, while relational market participants contracted but refrained from suing. Given this bifurcated response to the identical stimulus, Professor Illig queries: why did the relational parties bother to contract in the first place? If they could have predicted the likelihood of their ex post inertia, then as rational economic actors they must have valued contracting for something other than as insurer of their reasonable expectations. For them, a contract must provide significant symbolic and ceremonial value. Based on this finding—as well as on complementary research from the field of behavioral economics—Professor Illig concludes by arguing against a universalist approach to contract law. Instead, he recommends that contract doctrine be evolved to reflect its dual nature—as insurer of expectations in the context of discrete exchanges and as a source of imagery and ritual in the context of relational affiliations. Doing so would enhance the impact of social norms as a mechanism for avoiding and resolving disputes...|$|E
40|$|All {{participants}} seem {{to agree}} that this debate cannot be resolved on an all- or-nothing basis. Plain meaning will sometimes minimize total contracting costs, as will the incorporation strategy some of the time. It is less clear whether the cases in which one strategy dominates are so pervasive as to warrant its applicability to all cases, lest the costs of discovering exceptions prove too great. What is missing from the debate, however, is a taxonomy of {{the conditions under which}} trade usages would be sufficiently precise, observable, and verifiable as to warrant their incorporation. In this Article, I begin that process. In Section I, I describe the circumstances under which customs might materialize to demonstrate that there are cases in which customs would enhance the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and thus should be granted legal recognition. In Section II, I indicate the conditions that would have to exist in order for a trade or industry to adopt a custom entitled to legal recognition. These largely replicate the conditions for the evolution of efficient norms. Section III then addresses administrative and error costs that might make legal incorporation of a custom inappropriate, even if the conditions for the evolution of a legally cognizable custom otherwise existed. In Section IV, I apply the conclusions from the prior sections to an area that doctrinal law counterintuitively implies is appropriate for the application of the incorporation strategy-international sales transactions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (2 ̆ 2 CISG 2 ̆ 2) explicitly incorporates trade usages into contracts that it governs, permits usages to trump conflicting CISG provisions, and authorizes courts to interpret and complete contracts by reference to usages. The complexity of international sales and diversity of transactors suggests that this is a peculiar arena for the incorporation strategy. Nevertheless, I conclude that the conditions for adoption of trade usages under the CISG are surprisingly ripe, and, as currently applied by courts, the incorporation strategy does not generate the substantial costs attributed to it. I suggest that this occurs, in large part, because adjudicators have tended to entertain claims of custom only where the alleged trade usage conditions on variables that are both observable and verifiable. This may leave a relatively small arena for the kinds of usages subject to incorporation. Nevertheless, it reveals that, consciously or not, institutions involved in the use of international trade usages, both to fill contractual gaps and to define ambiguous contractual terms, act within the limits of their competence, and avoid customs where reliance on the incorporation strategy would risk high adjudication and error costs...|$|E
