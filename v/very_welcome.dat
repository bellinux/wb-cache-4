5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make them feel <b>very</b> <b>welcome.</b> They interpreted a letter sent to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E

Once located at the present intersection of County Roads 38 and 11, Whiteville was settled by the three White sisters and their families. Clotho was settled where it is because, it seems, settlers couldn't go any further given that the forests and swamps to the west were impenetrable.|$|E

25|$|Such a {{tower was}} {{certainly}} an effective protection against surprise attacks by smaller marauding gangs {{and the local}} population. Often a castle was vulnerable just through {{the absence of a}} few able-bodied men whilst they were out hunting or working in the fields. Even without supplies the remaining castle residents could hold out in the bergfried until the return of their menfolk and were protected from abuse and rape. The safe refuge of the bergfried was certainly <b>very</b> <b>welcome</b> at a time when state and social structures were just beginning to take shape.|$|E
25|$|Haig's {{skills at}} {{administration}} and organising training and inspections were better employed {{in setting up}} an Expeditionary Force of 120,000 men (6 infantry divisions and 1 cavalry – the force which would be deployed to France in 1914) in 1907. As an intimate of Haldane Haig was able to ensure high priority for cavalry, less for artillery, contrary to the advice of Lord Roberts (now retired as Commander-in-Chief) whose views were no longer <b>very</b> <b>welcome</b> because his campaign for conscription had made life hard for Haldane. Haig's records of his time supervising artillery exercises show little interest in technical matters (aim, range, accuracy etc.).|$|E
25|$|The series {{begins with}} the mirror {{appearing}} in the attic of {{a house in the}} country and Daniel traveling to meet his father, and new step-siblings for the first time. When he arrives at the house, he is not made to feel <b>very</b> <b>welcome.</b> His stepsister Mandy is very upset and runs off to the attic. Daniel tries to resolve the upset and goes after her.

Trapped in 1867 they spend the night in the de Lutrelle's barn. They finally get back home when the mirror is put back into alignment.|$|E
50|$|Young Salvadoran rockers and hip hop/rappers usually reject, stigmatize and are hostile towards bachata and reggae {{music and}} {{listeners}} because those Caribbean genres {{are seen as}} queer and non-Salvadoran.

This can only be a good thing, as everything Becky touches turns to gold." [...] Francine Cohen of the Daily Mirror commented on Becky's storylines stating: [...] "Becky’s plots have ranged from drug busts to drunken rampages, but the most poignant yet has been her recent pregnancy, miscarriage and subsequent infertility."

500|$|The poor {{steaming}} {{characteristics of}} the class had {{been the result of}} rushed production, which was another factor that led to the bad reputation of the Clan Class. [...] Furthermore, they suffered from complaints regarding a lack of pulling power, although this can be attributed to indifferent handling and firing techniques, which certainly did not help the situation. [...] However, had the Modernisation Plan been delayed, and the correct amount of investment made for undertaking the relevant modifications, such as streamlining of the steam passages and increased diameter blastpipe in a double-chimney layout, the Clans would have been free-steaming workhorses worthy of complementing the 'Britannias'. [...] Without modification, they were still capable machines when handled properly, as various feats testifying this included regular ascents of Shap and Beattock with 14carriages without the assistance of a banking locomotive. [...] Other arduous duties that the class frequently undertook were the regular turns on the Settle to Carlisle route, which has some of the steepest gradients and harshest working conditions of any British mainline. [...] The Midland region was always short of top-link motive power and the Clan Class proved to be a <b>very</b> <b>welcome</b> addition to the fleet.|$|E
500|$|The Etonians {{took the}} lead in the final when Harry Goodhart scored during the first half, however Arthur Matthews {{equalised}} for Olympic in the second half. [...] Soon afterwards, Arthur Dunn was injured and forced to leave the field, reducing the Etonians to ten men {{for the rest of the}} match. The scores remained level at the end of the regulation ninety minutes. Under the regulations of the FA Cup, thirty minutes of extra time could be played in the event of a draw, at the referee's discretion, and in response to the fervent mood of the crowd the captains asked to play on to try to secure a result. [...] During the extra period, Olympic's superior stamina began to show. [...] Around twenty minutes into extra time, Jimmy Costley received a pass from John Yates and kicked the ball past Etonian goalkeeper John Rawlinson to score the winning goal. [...] Upon the team's return to Blackburn, the players took part in a celebratory parade and received a civic reception at which team captain Albert Warburton reportedly proclaimed [...] "The Cup is <b>very</b> <b>welcome</b> to Lancashire. [...] It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London." ...|$|E
500|$|Marc Buxton at Den of Geek {{scored the}} episode 3.5 out of 5, calling the Age of Ultron tie-in [...] "anti-climactic ... {{it felt like}} a bit of a cheat", criticizing what he saw as too much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own storyline being left for the film to resolve, but said that [...] "all in all, it was a rather good episode". Buxton said that Skye [...] "really shined this episode", and called her {{one-shot}} fight [...] "worthy of a rewind or two", while highlighting [...] "one of the biggest character moments" [...] in the episode with Simmons' decision to kill Ward. Rob Leane, also at Den of Geek, was more positive of the Age of Ultron tie-in, calling it [...] "the next best allusion to the movies we’ve ever had" [...] following the series' connections to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and praising the use of List and Hill. He positively compared Skye's one-shot fight sequence to the well known single-take sequences in The Avengers and Daredevil, calling it [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>welcome</b> TV equivalent" [...] of the [...] "air-punching fan-pleasing moments" [...] often found in Marvel's films. Leane also compared Coulson's [...] "real mission-within-a-mission" [...] reveal to a similar moment in The Winter Soldier, and summarized [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] as [...] "a thoroughly entertaining episode, thanks in equal part to the tie-in stuff, some solid action and several strong character moments. Ward’s return was handled well, too, although {{something needs to be done}} about Simmons’ growing unlikeable-ness." ...|$|E
