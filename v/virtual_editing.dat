With this software, a paper document will first be input as an optical image, which may be a mixture of graphics and text and may be skewed. The image will then be analyzed and decomposed into a series of component blocks, and encoded and stored in a structured and compact format.

40|$|Video is an {{effective}} medium for capturing {{the events in the}} real world around us. There exist a vast amount of video materials covering a wide range of applications. However, wide spread use of video in computer applications is often impeded by the lack of effective tools to manage video information systematically. This paper discusses the design and implementation of a frame-based video retrieval and sequencing system (VRSS). The system is designed to support the entire process of video information management: segmenting, indexing, retrieving and sequencing of video data. A semi-automatic tool is developed to divide video sequence into meaningful shots. Each video shot is logged using text descriptions, audio dialogue and cinematic attributes. A twolayered concept-based model is used as the basis to accurately retrieve relevant video shots based on users' free-text query. A cinematic rule-based <b>virtual</b> <b>editing</b> tool is also developed to sequence the video shots retrieved for presentation within a specified time constraint. The system has been tested on a video documentary on the NUS engineering faculty. The results of video retrieval experiments are encouraging...|$|E

Its challenges are due to the variability and ambiguity of possible image descriptions. In recent years significant {{progress has been made in}} image captioning, using Recurrent Neural Networks powered by long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units. Despite mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, and despite their compelling ability to memorize dependencies, LSTM units are complex and inherently sequential across time. To address this issue, recent work has shown benefits of convolutional networks for machine translation and conditional image generation. Inspired by their success, in this paper, we develop a convolutional image captioning technique. We demonstrate its efficacy on the challenging MSCOCO dataset and demonstrate performance on par with the baseline, while having a faster training time per number of parameters. We also perform a detailed analysis, providing compelling reasons in favor of convolutional language generation approaches. Comment: 11 pages, 9 Figure...|$|R

40|$|Until {{few years}} ago, 3 D {{modelling}} was a topic confined into a professional environment. Nowadays technological innovations, the 3 D printer among all, have attracted novice users to this application field. This sudden breakthrough {{was not supported}} by adequate software solutions. The 3 D editing tools currently available do not assist the non-expert user during the various stages of generation, interaction and manipulation of 3 D virtual models. This is mainly due to the current paradigm that is largely supported by two-dimensional input/output devices and strongly affected by obvious geometrical constraints. We have identified three main phases that characterize the creation and management of 3 D virtual models. We investigated these directions evaluating and simplifying the classic editing techniques in order to propose more natural and intuitive tools in a pure 3 D modelling environment. In particular, we focused on freehand sketch-based modelling to create 3 D virtual models, interaction and navigation in a 3 D modelling environment and advanced editing tools for free-form deformation and objects composition. To pursuing these goals we wondered how new gesture-based interaction technologies can be successfully employed in a 3 D modelling environments, how we could improve the depth perception and the interaction in 3 D environments and which operations could be developed to simplify the classical <b>virtual</b> models <b>editing</b> paradigm. Our main aims were to propose a set of solutions with which a common user can realize an idea in a 3 D virtual model, drawing in the air just as he would on paper. Moreover, we tried to use gestures and mid-air movements to explore and interact in 3 D virtual environment, and we studied simple and effective 3 D form transformations.

Its playful intimacy fosters an environment of shared agency in which expression through a common language yields a creative product.

These virtual characters are both real in that they have formvisual, aural, mechanical and make us feel things, and unrealtheyre fleshless, bloodless ink on paper, data in chips, scanlines on a screen, collections of logical constructs. This thesis presents the un/real duet as a useful form for structuring an interaction between a human participant and a virtual character. Theoretical and practical contexts explored are: Use of personal portraiture and immersion to establish intimacy Crafting character by modeling consciousness Gestural language as communication during the duet Recombinant poetics as the creative product of the duet Presented and critiqued is the installation, Sashay/Sleep Depraved, in which a participant uses emotionally evocative gestures to interact with a larger-thanlife -sized virtual character, the Sleeper, by constructing an animated dream.

40|$|This {{short series}} of {{research}} notes brings together {{some of the}} case {{studies that have been}} researched by members of the project ‘International Comparative Research on the Spreading and Reception of Culture through Contents Tourism’. This research has been funded since April 2014 by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science grant (Kiban A, grant number 26243007). However, the project had its roots in a small group research project started in the Research Faculty of Media and Communication in 2010. The initial focus was sustainable tourism in Hokkaido, but as the international potential of the concept of ‘contents tourism’ emerged, the project switched focus. In the summer of 2011, three members of the group, Philip Seaton, Takayoshi Yamamura and Takeshi Okamoto, presented initial research results at the European Association for Japanese Studies Conference in Tallinn, Estonia. This panel presentation formed the basis of a special edition of the journal Japan Forum (Vol. 27 No. 1) published in 2015. As the project gained momentum, other researchers joined, too. Three of those researchers have contributed research notes to this essay collection. Akiko Sugawa-Shimada (Yokohama National University) took part in the British Association for Japanese Studies (Japan Branch) symposium ‘Rethinking Cool Japan’ in May 2012 along with Takeshi Okamoto and Philip Seaton. Thereafter, she also published her research on rekijo (history fan girls) as part of the Japan Forum special edition. Clothilde Sabre joined the project after the EAJS conference in Tallinn, and then took up a JSPS postdoctoral fellowship at the Center for Advanced Tourism Studies in 2013 - 4. Kyungjae Jang completed his PhD at the Graduate School of International Media, Communication, and Tourism Studies before joining the project as a full-time researcher in October 2014. The first half of this essay collection was in Japanese. Katsuyuki Nishikawa, who has provided the introductory essay in Japanese, has been a project member from the beginning. His introduction discusses how contents tourism references the world of ‘the idea’ and draws a parallel with European tourism in the eighteenth century. However, the centrepiece of this essay collection is a Japanese translation of the research group’s first major publication, the paper ‘The mediatisation of culture: Japanese contents tourism and popular culture’ published in Mediating the Tourist Experience: from brochures to <b>virtual</b> encounters <b>edited</b> by Jo-Anne Lester and Caroline Scarles. This chapter was co-authored by Sue Beeton, Takayoshi Yamamura and Philip Seaton. Sue Beeton, whose 2005 book Film-Induced Tourism is considered the pioneering work in the field, joined the project in October 2012 when she came to Hokkaido to be keynote speaker at the symposium ‘Film/contents tourism and local communities’. Publishing our research in both English and Japanese (and in time, other languages too) is a vital step toward achieving our aim of crossfertilising the literatures in various languages to create a truly international research project into the global phenomenon of travel induced by engagement with media.

40|$|The central {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} is visual perception of dynamic events. The topic is worth of interest, as witnessed by its long {{tradition in the}} history of Experimental Psychology, starting with the seminal work of Albert Michotte (1881 - 1965) on phenomenal causality. Thus, the topic I chose is not original in itself. However, a distinctive element of novelty in my dissertation is the use of Computer Graphics techniques as a means for creating realistic experimental stimuli in psychological experiments. Besides the advantage of reducing the gap between laboratory experiments and everyday experience, this may reveal the importance of experimental variables which traditionally have been ignored in research on visual perception of dynamic events. The reader should be informed that this dissertation is characterized by various lines of research, which are intrinsically connected with the central topic of visual perception of dynamic events. In some of the experiments, I investigate visual perception of dynamic events, whereas in others I investigate cognition of the same events. Two distinct dynamic events will be especially studied: horizontal collisions and throws. Moreover, the results of the experiments will be discussed not only in relation to their theoretical implications for psychological models, but also in relation to their potential applications to Physics education and Computer Graphics. As a result, the content of the dissertation is quite heterogeneous, but I hope to provide the reader with a broad and multidisciplinary perspective on the subject at hand. The dissertation is composed of five chapters, which may be divided into three groups. (i) In Chapters 1 - 3, after a presentation of the theoretical background of visual perception of dynamic events, I investigate the influence of dynamic properties of virtual objects on visual perception of horizontal collisions. The results of this research are important for the old and still active debate on phenomenal causality. (ii) In Chapter 4 I present a research on Naïve Physics of horizontal collisions between virtual spheres differing in simulated mass and velocity. In this chapter I take a more cognitive (rather than perceptual) perspective on dynamic events, investigating how people reason about the proposed physical event. (iii) In Chapter 5, I present a research on visual perception of virtual throwing animations, which are complex and rarely studied dynamic events. This chapter stands out for its multidisciplinary nature, as in it I discuss how the results can be applied to Computer Graphics. The research presented in this last chapter has been conducted as a part of my doctorate studies when I was a visiting PhD student at the Graphics, Vision, and Visualisation Group at Trinity College Dublin, where I collaborated with Professor Carol O’Sullivan and Doctor Ludovic Hoyet, who are computer scientists working on applications of visual perception to Computer Graphics. 	In more detail, in Chapter 1 I discuss the theoretical background of visual perception of dynamic events and phenomenal causality. Firstly, I focus on Michotte’s classical work. Secondly, I discuss some prominent issues which have been debated {{for a long time in}} this field of research. Lastly, I present White’s schema-matching model of visual perception of dynamic events, discussing its differences and similarities as compared with Michotte’s model. This chapter is intended to serve as a theoretical point of reference for the entire dissertation. 	In Chapter 2 I discuss the hypothesis that visually perceived dynamic properties of objects involved in dynamic events do influence visual perception of the dynamic events themselves. Firstly, I try to confute two popular arguments against this hypothesis. Then, I highlight the evolutionary advantage of visual perception of dynamic properties, discussing their possible influence on visual perception of dynamic events. Lastly, I discuss Runeson’s KSD model in relation to the presented hypothesis. 	In Chapter 3 I present three experiments which confirm the hypothesis discussed in Chapter 2. In particular, I show that simulated material (Experiment 1) and size (Experiments 2 and 3) of virtual objects involved in horizontal collisions strongly influence how observers perceive the event. I also discuss the theoretical implications of these findings by referring to Michotte’s and White’s models. 	In Chapter 4 I present a research on Naïve Physics of horizontal collisions. Firstly, I discuss the general importance of studying Naïve Physics for improving basic education in Physics. Secondly, I present Information Integration Theory and Functional Measurement methodology as suitable tools for the assessment of students’ intuitive knowledge of physical events, evidencing their advantages over multiple-choice surveys. Lastly, I present two experiments (conducted using Information Integration Theory and Functional Measurement) on Naïve Physics of horizontal collisions between simulated spheres differing in size, velocity, and material. The importance of the results for Physics instruction will also be discussed. Finally, in Chapter 5 I present a research on visual perception of <b>edited</b> <b>virtual</b> throwing animations. First I discuss the relations between visual perception of dynamic events (human motion in particular) and Computer Graphics. Then, I present two experiments on observers’ sensitivity to anomalies in realistic virtual throwing animations, discussing the importance of the results for videogames and movies industry. ...|$|R
