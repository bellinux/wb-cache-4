2500|$|The initial story {{arc of the}} Superman/Batman ongoing series {{depicts the}} fall of Luthor's reign as U.S. President. In [...] "The World's Finest" [...] (more {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "Public Enemies"), a cadre of superheroes eventually break ranks from the Justice League to oppose Luthor. Superman and Batman, who had previously forbidden any attempt to unseat Luthor from office by force, led the storming of the White House. This was predicated by an attempt on Luthor's part to link Superman to a kryptonite asteroid that is hurtling toward Earth, claiming that he had 'evidence'—which he declined to share while claiming that it would make the public laud his actions if they knew it—that the asteroid was being drawn to Earth by Superman, offering a billion dollar reward for Superman's capture that pitted Superman and Batman against an army of villains, all of whom they defeated. Luthor even attempted to send a team of heroes after them under the leadership of Captain Atom—the team consisting of Major Force, Black Lightning, Power Girl, Starfire, Katana and Green Lantern, but this plan failed when Katana and Power Girl quickly sided with Superman and Batman and Major Force was apparently killed, Power Girl noting that Luthor had assumed in his arrogance that the heroes would obey him simply because he was President. When the Justice Society's forced attempt to stop them by sending Hawkman and Captain Marvel against them met with failure and resulted in Superman and Batman briefly infiltrating the White House, Luthor, in an enraged and desperate gambit after Superman's rapid defeats of his plans, used a <b>variant</b> <b>combination</b> of the [...] "super-steroid" [...] Venom (a chemical associated with the Batman villain Bane), liquid synthetic kryptonite, and an Apokoliptian battlesuit to fight Superman directly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{formulation}} for the multi-objective optimal power flow (MOOPF) problem for meshed power networks considering distributed generation. An efficacious multi-objective fuzzy linear programming optimization (MFLP) {{algorithm is proposed}} to solve the aforementioned problem with and without considering the distributed generation (DG) effect. A <b>variant</b> <b>combination</b> of objectives is considered for simultaneous optimization, including power loss, voltage stability, and shunt capacitors MVAR reserve. Fuzzy membership functions for these objectives are designed with extreme targets, whereas the inequality constraints are treated as hard constraints. The multi-objective fuzzy optimal power flow (OPF) formulation was converted into a crisp OPF in a successive linear programming (SLP) framework and solved using an efficient interior point method (IPM). To test {{the efficacy of the}} proposed approach, simulations are performed on the IEEE 30 -busand IEEE 118 -bus test systems. The MFLP optimization is solved for several optimization cases. The obtained results are compared with those presented in the literature. A unique solution with a high satisfaction for the assigned targets is gained. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MFLP technique in terms of solution optimality and rapid convergence. Moreover, the results indicate that using the optimal DG location with the MFLP algorithm provides the solution with the highest quality...|$|E

30|$|The Piper trilinear plot (Fig.  4 b) {{demonstrates}} significant {{variation in}} water types over the year. From winter towards pre-monsoon data points cluster more towards the salinity apex (Na-SO 4 type), while Na+ and Cl− remain {{more or less}} same for the both cases but SO 42 − increases in the pre-monsoon compared to the winter samples. In the cations trilinear plot, data points move more towards the Na apex from winter to pre-monsoon suggesting additional Na+ discharge to the dissolved load. In the anion plot, while data points cluster around high HCO 3 − and low SO 42 − in winter, pre-monsoon is marked with SO 42 − enrichment replacing HCO 3 −. This exhibits the effect of lack of rainfall in winter followed by pre-monsoon, consequently increasing the pollution effect, as HCO 3 − concentration does not change much (med. value 394  mg/L in winter and 312  mg/L in pre-monsoon) but SO 42 − concentration increases from 20.22  mg/L in winter (median value) to 287.78  mg/L in pre-monsoon (median value). In monsoon and post-monsoon, in contrast to that of winter and pre-monsoon, data points float widely {{in the middle of}} the diamond plot. However, in monsoon, a reduction of Na+ and enrichment of Ca 2 + is noticed, indicating a dilution effect. Post-monsoon data points show wide and <b>variant</b> <b>combination</b> of Na+, Ca 2 + and SO 42 − suggesting infrequent freshwater mixing with pollution caused by irregular and but intense rainfall.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} the results from an interlaboratory sequencing study for which we developed a novel high-resolution method for comparing data from different sequencing platforms for a multi-copy, paralogous gene. The combination of PCR amplification and 16 S ribosomal RNA gene (16 S rRNA) sequencing has revolutionized bacteriology by enabling rapid identification, frequently {{without the need for}} culture. To assess variability between laboratories in sequencing 16 S rRNA, six laboratories sequenced the gene encoding the 16 S rRNA from Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 strain EDL 933 and Listeria monocytogenes serovar 4 b strain NCTC 11994. Participants performed sequencing methods and protocols available in their laboratories: Sanger sequencing, Roche 454 pyrosequencing®, or Ion Torrent PGM®. The sequencing data were evaluated on three levels: (1) identity of biologically conserved position, (2) ratio of 16 S rRNA gene copies featuring identified variants, and (3) the collection of variant combinations in a set of 16 S rRNA gene copies. The same set of biologically conserved positions was identified for each sequencing method. Analytical methods using Bayesian and maximum likelihood statistics were developed to estimate variant copy ratios, which describe the ratio of nucleotides at each identified biologically variable position, as well as the likely set of variant combinations present in 16 S rRNA gene copies. Our results indicate that estimated variant copy ratios at biologically variable positions were only reproducible for high throughput sequencing methods. Furthermore, the likely <b>variant</b> <b>combination</b> set was only reproducible with increased sequencing depth and longer read lengths. We also demonstrate novel methods for evaluating variable positions when comparing multi-copy gene sequence data from multiple laboratories generated using multiple sequencing technologies...|$|E
40|$|Context: Although genetic factors play {{a pivotal}} role in male pubertal timing, {{genome-wide}} association studies have identified only a few loci. Genetic variation of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) action affects adult reproductive parameters and female pubertal timing. Objective: To investigate whether genetic variation affecting FSH action is associated with onset of puberty in boys. Design: Cross-sectional and longitudinal study of two cohorts of healthy boys. Setting: This was a population-based study. Patients or Other Participants: Danish (n = 1130) and Chilean (n = 424) boys were followed through puberty and genotyped for FSHB c. - 211 G. T, FSHR c. - 29 A. G, and FSHR c. 2039 G. A. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical pubertal staging including orchidometry, anthropometry, and serum gonadotropin levels. Results: Although the cohorts differed markedly (e. g., body composition and genotype frequencies), genetic variation affecting FSH production (FSHB c. - 211 G. T) was associated with age at pubertal onset, as assessed by testicular enlargement, in both cohorts. The effect appeared further modified by coexistence of genetic variation affecting FSH sensitivity (FSHR c. - 29 G. A) : After correcting for body mass index (BMI), boys with a ligand-receptor <b>variant</b> <b>combination</b> resulting in weak FSH action (i. e., FSHB c. - 211 GT/TT and FSHR c. - 29 AA) entered puberty 0. 64 years [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0. 12 to 1. 17 years; Denmark] and 0. 94 years (95 % CI, 0. 00 to 1. 88 years; Chile) later than boys with the most effective FSH action. Effects explained 1. 7 % (Denmark) and 1. 5 % (Chile) of the variance. In addition, BMI z score was negatively associated with pubertal timing (b = 20. 35 years in both cohorts), explaining 17. 2 % (Denmark) and 7. 2 % (Chile) of the variance. Conclusion: In two ethnically distinct populations, we independently identified an association of two genetic loci with male pubertal timing...|$|E

The combined analysis of these polymorphisms could produce clinically meaningful complementary information. Methods A subgroup of the ICARIA study comprising 1825 Spanish subjects (80 % men, mean age 36 years) was genotyped for the LPL -HindIII (rs 320), S 447 X (rs 328), D 9 N (rs 1801177) and N 291 S (rs 268) polymorphisms, the APOA 5 -S 19 W (rs 3135506) and - 1131 T/C (rs 662799) variants, and the APOE polymorphism (rs 429358; rs 7412) using PCR and restriction analysis and TaqMan assays. We used regression analyses to examine their combined effects on TG levels (with the log-transformed variable) and the association of <b>variant</b> <b>combinations</b> with TG levels and hypertriglyceridemia (TG ≥ 1. 69 mmol/L), including the covariates: gender, age, waist circumference, blood glucose, blood pressure, smoking and alcohol consumption.

40|$|The {{bacterium}} Neisseria meningitidis is a {{major cause}} of meningitis and septicemia worldwide. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are candidates in the search for comprehensive meningococcal vaccines; however, the formulation of OMP vaccines is complicated by antigenic diversity, which is generated by high levels of genetic reassortment and strong positive selection in the meningococcal antigen genes. The genetic and antigenic diversity of three OMPs (FetA, PorA, and PorB) among a global collection of meningococcal isolates representative of the major hyperinvasive clonal complexes was determined. There was evidence for antigenic structuring among the three OMPs that could not be explained purely by descent. These observations violated the predictions of the clonal and epidemic clonal models of population structure but were in concordance with models of strain structure which propose that host immunity selects for nonoverlapping antigen combinations. The patterns of antigenic <b>variant</b> <b>combinations</b> suggested that an OMP-based vaccine with as few as six PorA and five FetA variant sequences could generate homologous immune responses against all 78 isolates examined...|$|R
