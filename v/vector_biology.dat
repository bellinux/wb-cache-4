40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the epidemiological characteristics of tularemia outbreak and the effect of climate variability on this outbreak in Kayseri. MethodsThe outbreak places, infection dates, source of infection, and the number of cases were recorded and analyzed. This information was obtained from the Regional Public Health Department. Climate data were supplied by the Regional Meteorological Service. ResultsThe first case in Sariz was recorded in 2005. Thereafter, 2 cases were reported in 2006 and 1 case in 2007. During 2010, 21 cases were recorded in 7 towns, 62 cases in 2011 and 27 cases in 2012. A total number of 110 cases were recorded in 12 out of 16 towns in Kayseri Province between 2010 and 2012. The majority of cases were seen in the north-eastern, east and south-eastern parts of Kayseri Province; located in higher altitudes (over 1000 m from sea level). It was accepted that the outbreak was originated from water sources and was confirmed by few number of water samples collected from outbreak areas. Considering climate variations, the outbreak occurred between 1988 and 2009 during a dry, low humid, high temperature period after rainy season. ConclusionA tularemia outbreak was observed between 2010 and 2012 with the initiation of rainy years.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Commensal and {{symbiotic}} microbes have {{a considerable}} {{impact on the}} behavior of many arthropod hosts, including hematophagous species that transmit pathogens causing infectious diseases to human and animals. Little is known about the bacteria associated with mosquitoes other than the vectorized pathogens. This study investigated Wolbachia and cultivable bacteria that persist through generations in Ae. albopictus organs known to host transmitted arboviruses, such as dengue and chikungunya. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:We used culturing, diagnostic and quantitative PCR, as well as in situ hybridization, to detect and locate bacteria in whole individual mosquitoes and in dissected tissues. Wolbachia, cultivable bacteria of the genera Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Delftia and Pseudomonas co-occurred and persisted in the bodies of both males and females of Ae. albopictus initially collected in La Réunion during the chikungunya outbreak, and maintained as colonies in insectaries. In dissected tissues, Wolbachia and the cultivable Acinetobacter can be detected in the salivary glands. The other bacteria are commonly found in the gut. Quantitative PCR estimates suggest that Wolbachia densities are highest in ovaries, lower than those of Acinetobacter in the gut, and approximately equal to those of Acinetobacter in the salivary glands. Hybridization using specific fluorescent probes successfully localized Wolbachia in all germ cells, including the oocytes, and in the salivary glands, whereas the Acinetobacter hybridizing signal was mostly located in the foregut and in the anterior midgut. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Our results show that Proteobacteria are distributed in the somatic and reproductive tissues of mosquito where transmissible pathogens reside and replicate. This location may portend the coexistence of symbionts and pathogens, and thus the possibility that competition or cooperation phenomena may occur in the mosquito vector Ae. albopictus. Improved understanding of the vectorial system, including the role of bacteria in the <b>vector's</b> <b>biology</b> and competence, could have major implications for understanding viral emergences and for disease control...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} vector {{of malaria}} in eastern Venezuela, Anopheles aquasalis, is exophagic and exophilic. Control using indoor insecticide house sprays {{has failed to}} lower the number of malaria cases. Therefore, studies were initiated in two villages of the eastern coastal state of Sucre to better understand this <b>vector's</b> <b>biology</b> and develop a more integrated control program. An. aquasalis {{was found to have}} a crepuscular biting behavior with a major peak at dusk and a minor peak at dawn. Mosquitos were collected more outdoors than indoors. Forty-seven percent of the biting took place before people went to bed (22 : 30 hr) and 69 % of the mosquitos biting during this time period bite outdoors. Outdoor biting could be the reason why indoor spraying alone did not lower malaria cases. Seasonal abundance was greater in the rainy season compared to the dry season. Seasonal parous rates were high (78. 3 %- 100 %) and similar indoors and outdoors and between dry and wet season in Santa F e. In Guayana, the seasonal parity was lower (34. 6 %- 42. 2 %) than Santa F e with indoor parity slightly higher than outdoors. Malaria cases were higher in Santa F e, but adult mosquito density was much lower than in Guayana. This difference could have been due to higher parity in Santa F e compared to Guayana. The greater distance to the nearest breeding site and presence of alternative hosts in Guayana can not be discounted as factors which contributed to the difference in malaria transmission between locations. We concluded that knowledge on seasonal occurrence, biting activity, resting behavior and breeding site location can be used to design a new control strategy for this vector...|$|R

40|$|We {{discovered}} a surprising law governing the spatial join selectivity across {{two sets of}} points. An {{example of such a}} spatial join is "find the libraries that are within 10 miles of schools". Our law dictates that the number of such qualifying pairs follows a power law, whose exponent we call "pair-count exponent " (PC). We show that this law also holds for self-spatial-joins ("find schools within 5 miles of other schools") in addition to the general case that the two point-sets are distinct. Our law holds for many real datasets, including diverse environments (geographic datasets, feature <b>vectors</b> from <b>biology</b> data, galaxy data from astronomy). In addition, we introduce the concept of the Box-Occupancy-Product-Sum (BOPS) plot, and we show that it can compute the pair-count exponent in a timely manner, reducing the run time by orders of magnitude, from quadratic to linear. Due to the pair-count exponent and our analysis (Law 1), we can achieve accurate selectivity estimates in constant time (O(1)) without the need for sampling or other expensive operations. The relative error in selectivity is about 30 % with our fast BOPS method, and even better (about 10 %), if we use the slower, quadratic method. ...|$|R

Flower phenology, the nectar production, pollen/ovule ratio, and identification of the flower visitors, {{as well as their}} behavior, were studied. Tabebuia pulcherrima displays typical melitophilous flowers, due to its morphology, diurnal anthesis and day-long nectar secretion. In the morning, the nectar volume is smaller, which is associated with a higher frequency of visitors. The pollen/ovule ratio indicates facultative xenogamy. We collected 88 insects on the flowers, 52 % of which were bees; the rest were wasps, flies, ants end beetles. The most abundant species were Niltonia virgilii (42 %), Bombus morio (20 %) and Xylocopa brasilianorum (18 %).

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{was one of}} {{the first}} inherited disorders for which gene therapy was seriously considered as a realistic option for treatment, and as such, it has long provided a paradigm for gene therapy of inherited diseases. However, despite the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene in 1989, over 15 years later a practical gene therapy for CF has not eventuated. There are a number of reasons for this, and analysis of the specific issues that have delayed the successful development of gene therapy for CF also provides general insights into the practical complexities involved in the development of gene therapy for inherited disorders.
