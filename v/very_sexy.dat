They weren't <b>very</b> <b>sexy.</b> It just felt very repressed. I wanted Underoos so bad." [...] For the sculpture class, Munro decided to bring in a pair of underwear that he had stolen from a high school friend on whom he had a crush.

In 1997, his first show involving underwear was held in a gallery supported by his college. The show received publicity after conservative columnist Michael Coren, in the Toronto Sun and on the radio, criticized Munro and his show, in particular for having said that it involved [...] "boys' underwear" [...] (although Munro had simply meant guys' underwear). Coren asked the public to bring dirty diapers to the exhibit, but no one did.

It's so 1970s. I have no doubt former Another World master scribe and Paul Rauch BFF/frenemy, Harding Lemay, is freaking if he's watching this gothic, macabre and super-creepy mystery. Moreover, camp-ilicious Chris Engen (Adam) is stealing the story with his <b>very</b> bitchy, and <b>sexy</b> performance of a deranged son scorned." [...] Soaps In Depth also commended Adam's storyline. The magazine awarded Engen a gold star for portraying Adam as a gray character with [...] "sardonic humor". Soap Opera Digest named Engen [...] "performer of the week" [...] for his final scenes as Adam, saying the actor [...] "gave a performance that elevated Adam from an average villain to a complex mastermind".|$|R

One {{topic of conversation}} among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such.

Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and 's mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." [...] The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her [...] "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a <b>very</b> playful and <b>sexy</b> way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought [...] "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this? ...|$|R
