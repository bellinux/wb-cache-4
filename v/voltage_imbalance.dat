40|$|The {{technology}} around multilevel converters {{has emerged}} in the past decades and many new topologies have been introduced. Many multilevel converter topologies are equipped with floating capacitors which, if not controlled properly, face serious <b>voltage</b> <b>imbalance</b> issues.

By proper choice of modulation technique, the harmonic performance of a multilevel converter can be significantly improved.
