40|$|This paper {{considers}} Thelonious Monk's early- and mid- 1960 s performance {{style in}} light of the pianist's contemporary critical reception in France. By the early part of that decade, several Jazz Hot and Jazz Magazine writers had published articles expressing concern that Monk's music had ceased to 'evolve'; this critical trend reached something of an apotheosis in a 1964 Jazz Magazine article, in which Michel-Claude Jalard condemned Monk as having presented, in his February 1964 Paris concerts, the mere 'simulacrum' of former improvisations. Taking Jalard's nuanced argument as its cue, the article examines contemporary French critical definitions and <b>valorizations</b> of Monk's (and jazz's) improvisational practice with respect to ideas of performance and composition, art and entertainment, creation and routine, authorial presence and absence; the paper goes on to situate these critical oppositions within a history of Western Art Music aesthetics, arguing that in constructing value for jazz, some European jazz critics had essentially inverted art music's ideal of the Werktreue, and its relationship between speaking work and silent interpreter...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare public health discourses on the {{importance}} of motherhood with organizational attitudes towards childbearing. It shows how pregnancy and the nurturing of infant children are valorized within public health discourses, which treat pregnancy and new maternity as a miraculous “project”, encouraging mothers to position maternity as central to their lives. By contrast, the paper shows how employers treat pregnancy and new motherhood as inconvenient and messy: as monstrous, at work. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon a database of qualitative netnographic (or internet-based) research. It analyses netnographic interactions between pregnant and newly maternal women. These virtual data are afforded the same validity as face-to-face research. Findings – The paper demonstrates how maternal responsibilities for nurturing pregnancy and infant children, and the bio-medical properties of the maternal body, are central to public health discourses. By contrast, the maternal body is treated within organizations as alien, or monstrous. Originality/value – The paper compares and contrasts public health <b>valorizations</b> of motherhood, with organizational tendencies to treat pregnancy/newly maternal bodies as monstrous. It highlights dichotomies faced by employed mothers.

Therefore, a metabolomics approach was used to obtain a comprehensive screening of the collection of violets from the French Violet Conservatory hosted by the Toulouse Municipal Greenhouses. Focussed on the non-volatile compounds of leaves, this approach involved multivariate analysis of LC-MSE high resolution profiles of total extracts along a parallel screening of their antioxidant activities. Then, the dereplication of putative active compounds was obtained by correlation analysis presenting two main benefits: {{a limited amount of}} crude material and restricted time consuming manipulations. The relevance of this approach was established by TLC-DPPH assays of extracts and subsequent identification of DPPH active spots using a TLC-MS interface. The first results on Viola alba subsp. dehnhardtii aka Violet of Toulouse, highlighted the presence of antioxidant polyphenols never characterized in this genus. The results obtained will permit the assessment of the chemodiversity of the violet collection based on metabolite analysis and future identifications of potentially biologically active extracts or molecules for further dermocosmetic <b>valorizations.</b> Combined with future analysis of native volatile compounds emitted by fresh flowers by SPME-GC-O-MS, this holistic approach should provide a comprehensive chemotaxonomy of violets...|$|R

By drawing from Folk Linguistics/Perceptual Dialectology and Sociocultural Linguistics, my dissertation examines how educators’ explicit metapragmatic talk enacts recurrent characterizations and <b>valorizations</b> of four salient linguistic variables of Buenos Aires (BA) Spanish. The variables {{included in this study}} are: (1) the pronominal system of deference, (2) yeísmo, (3) syllable-final /s/ production, and (4) the use of English. Explicit metapragmatic comments about these variables were elicited by a perceptual task, and obtained through semi-structured interviews with thirty-two educators from public, private and semi-private schools in the northern metropolitan area of Buenos Aires. My discourse analysis of these interviews shows how the variables are linked to different social categories, and participate in local social registers. My findings extend sociolinguistic knowledge about the stereotypical meanings of these linguistic variables in BA Spanish, and provide discursive evidence of how uses and users of different linguistic features are perceived and valued differently by educators in Buenos Aires. Given the decisive role of educators’ attitudes towards language varieties on students’ school performance and interrelationships, my dissertation offers a foundation for developing much-needed sociolinguistic training among educators in Buenos Aires...|$|R
40|$|Human perceptual {{capabilities}} {{related to}} the laparoscopic interaction paradigm are not well known. Its study {{is important for the}} design of virtual reality simulators, and for the specification of augmented reality applications that overcome current limitations and provide a supersensing to the surgeon. As part of this work, this article addresses the study of laparoscopic pulling forces. Two definitions are proposed to focalize the problem: the perceptual fidelity boundary, limit of human perceptual capabilities, and the Utile fidelity boundary, that encapsulates the perceived aspects actually used by surgeons to guide an operation. The study is then aimed to define the perceptual fidelity boundary of laparoscopic pulling forces. This is approached with an experimental design in which surgeons assess the resistance against pulling of four different tissues, which are characterized with both in vivo interaction forces and ex vivo tissue biomechanical properties. A logarithmic law of tissue consistency perception is found comparing subjective <b>valorizations</b> with objective parameters. A model of this perception is developed identifying what the main parameters are: the grade of fixation of the organ, the tissue stiffness, the amount of tissue bitten, and the organ mass being pulled. These results are a clear requirement analysis for the force feedback algorithm of a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator. Finally, some discussion is raised about the suitability of augmented reality applications around this surgical gesture...|$|R

This {{dissertation}} {{tells the story}} of Islamist Conscientious Objectors (COs) in Turkey who resist the obligatory duty of conscription and cultural <b>valorizations</b> of martyrdom through a nonviolent civil resistance based on anti-authoritarian interpretations of Islam. Blending political theory with political ethnography and comparative politics of the Middle East, I approach this civil dissent as a potent demonstration of the uses and abuses of religious principles in democratic politics and war - both by the sovereign state and its contestants. Weaving together their anti-authoritarian interpretations of Islamic doctrines with theories and tactics of nonviolent resistance developed internationally, the COs challenge both the institution of conscription and the Turkish state's invocations of jihad and martyrdom in its military - an institution historically associated with staunch secularism in Turkey. Theoretically, I relate the issues raised by my fieldwork to debates about democratic citizenship, sovereignty, and secularism. Contrary to conventional interpretations, I find that in foundational theories of liberal democracy, military obligations of citizens are legitimized through appeals to the dominant religious values and principles in a community.
