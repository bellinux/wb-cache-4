40|$|Decision-making {{efficiency}} {{depends upon}} timely availability of appropriate <b>data.</b> On-demand <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> from web based data sources provides an attractive solution to data gathering. The two major challenges associate with on-demand <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> are selection of appropriate data services and efficient {{implementation of the}} <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> process. In this paper, it is proposed to use service’s business value as a service selection criterion and to elaborate a lightweight method for XML based definition of the integration processes. The business value driven approach implies that services are selected according to their impact on quality of decisions made rather than solely according to their QoS characteristics. The <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> process definition methods partitions the <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> process into atomic <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> tasks, thus allowing for high level of data retrieval parallelization, accommodating data interdependencies and enabling error recoverability without delaying the whole <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> process.

40|$|Global {{information}} systems provide its users with a centralized and transparent {{view of many}} heterogeneous and distributed sources of data. The requests to access data at a central site are decomposed and processed at the remote sites {{and the results are}} returned back to a central site. A <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> component of the system processes data retrieved and transmitted from the remote sites accordingly to the earlier prepared <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> plans. This work addresses a problem of static optimization of <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> plans in a global information system. Static optimization means that a <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> plan is transformed into more optimal form before it is used for <b>data</b> <b>integration.</b> We adopt an online approach to <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> where the packets of data transmitted over a wide area network are integrated into the final result as soon as they arrive at a central site. We show how <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> expression obtained from a user request can be transformed into a collection of <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> plans, one for each argument of <b>data</b> <b>integration</b> expression.
