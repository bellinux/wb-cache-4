The early promoters of the road were George M. Dewey and E.H. Hazelton of Flint, with Dewey serving as the first president of the F&PM. Construction started in 1859 in East Saginaw. A more energetic management took charge in 1860 when Captain Eber Brock Ward of Detroit, a prominent lumberman, <b>vessel</b> <b>owner,</b> and steel manufacturer, was elected to the presidency of the F&PM. Service began on January 20, 1862, on the 26.1 mi section from East Saginaw south to Mount Morris.

40|$|Most {{fisheries}} worldwide remunerate their crew with a share system, where crew {{receive a}} part of the revenues or {{a part of}} the revenues less costs, rather than a fixed wage. Although labor {{is one of the main}} costs in fisheries and the share remuneration system has a strong influence on firm behavior and its economic performance, little attention has been paid it. In a share remuneration system, crew salaries can significantly increase when the economic performance of a vessel improves. This allows the crew to capture part of the fisheries rent. Bioeconomic analyses are performed for the Bay of Biscay nephrops fishery on main management targets. Results confirm the importance of considering a share system compared to a fixed remuneration system in <b>vessel</b> <b>owner</b> (capital) and crew (labor) rent distribution and fishing decisions...|$|E

50|$|President Bush also {{predicted}} that {{the enactment of the}} OPA could lead to larger oil shipping companies being replaced by the smaller shipping companies to avoid liability. In particular, smaller companies with limited resources would lack the finances to remediate oil spills disasters. Not just the oil industry, but also the <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> and operators would be held liable for an oil spill, facing a significant increase in financial responsibility. The OPA's liability increase for <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> raised fears and concerns from {{the vast majority of the}} shipping industry. <b>Vessel</b> <b>owners</b> objected that additional oil spill penalties imposed by the states are free from OPA limitations of the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851. Ultimately, the threat of unlimited liability under the OPA and other state statutes has led countless oil shipping companies to reduce oil trade to and from the ports of the United States.|$|R

40|$|Management of the Texas {{penaeid shrimp}} fishery {{is aimed at}} {{increasing}} revenue from brown shrimp, Penaeus aztecus, landings and decreasing the level of discards. Since 1960 Texas has closed its territorial sea for 45 - 60 days during peak migration of brown shrimp to the Gulf of Mexico. In 1981 the closure was extended to 200 miles to include the U. S. Exclusive Economic Zone. Simulation modeling is used in this paper to estimate the changes in landings, revenue, costs, and economic rent attributable to the Texas closure. Four additional {{analyses were conducted to}} estimate the effects of closing the Gulf 1 - to 4 -fathom zone for 45 and 60 days, with and without effort redirected to inshore waters.

40|$|The model {{developed}} {{in this paper}} attempts to provide {{an explanation of the}} fact that Icelandic vessel owners and Icelandic skippers do not share costs of operation of a vessel. In the model a skipper is contracted to take a fishing vessel to the fishing ground. The skipper is remunerated with a share of the catch, subject to an agreed minimum. Skippers and vessel owners are modelled as if risk neutral. Skippers develop a fishing strategy which is more costly, the higher the value of the potential catch associated with that strategy. Costs that accrue are partly pecuniary (and shareable) and partly skipper-specific (and non- shareable). The conclusions of the paper demonstrate that given the assumptions of our model, a <b>vessel</b> <b>owner</b> should prefer a remuneration contract with a positive revenue share and zero cost share.

We develop a basic model to analyze optimal decisions with a collective fishing rights system. With this model as a conceptual framework, using a Theil index as a distributive measure, and employing optimization techniques we calculate  assignment and distribution rules within the organization: centralized efficient quota assigment, decentralized quota assignment with and without transferability, individual quotas, and initial allocation based on historical assignments (with no transferability). The model is based on the common sardine and anchovies artisanal fisheries of central – southern Chile and it is used to analyze an actual experience of quota re-distribution between artisanal fishers. The analysis of the results allows discussing and comparing the equity implications of these different assignment and distributional rules...|$|E

According to OPA, <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> need evidence of financial liability that covers complete responsibility of a disaster if their vessel weighs more than 300 gross tons. <b>Vessel</b> <b>owners</b> are required by OPA to apply to the Coast Guard to acquire a “Certificate of Financial Responsibility” that serves as proof of their ability to financially responsible for cleanup and damages of an oil spill. In the case of an uncertified vessel entering the waters of the United States, the vessel will have be forfeited to the United States. This is not a new protocol because <b>vessel</b> <b>owners</b> were always mandated to acquire certificates under the FWPCA 74 and Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA).

40|$|A {{behavioral}} {{study on}} the entry, stay and exit decisions of the fishers in Hawaii’s longline fishery was undertaken in a random utility framework by applying the multinomial logit (unordered) model. Pooled annual cross-sectional and time-series (1991 – 1998) data were used. The empirical results confirm that the entry, stay, and exit decisions are significantly associated with the earning potential of fishers, crowding externality, resource abundance and some managerial factors. The probability of a vessel to stay (or exit) in the fishery increased (or decreased) {{for an increase in}} the earning potential of a fisher. A larger fleet size shows vessels were more inclined to exit from the fishery than stay in the fishery. The probability of vessel entry (or exit) was also positively (or negatively) associated with an increase in stock levels of major target species. Further, a vessel was more likely to stay in the fishery when the <b>vessel</b> <b>owner</b> was a Hawaii resident or a vessel captain.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the economic rationale of input use by small trawlers in Kerala Coast. In order to estimate the production elasticities of different inputs, a Cobb- Douglas type of production function was fitted to the pooled data on coast and earnings of 50 trawlers for a period of 10 years from 1971 - 72 to 1980 - 81, obtained from Kozhikode Regional Fish Marketing Co-operative Society. For functional analysis, vessel-wise gross returns (in rupees) was taken as dependent variable and number of days fished, fuel expenditure (in rupees) and repairing and maintenance charges (in rupees) as independent variables. Marginality analysis was also done to evaluate the eflSciency of input use. The production function as well as the marginality analysis indicated that the increase in the number of days fished would lead to higher gross income. So also increase in oil expenditure from mean level would yield a more than proportionate increase in gross income. However, repairing and maintenance cost had a negative impact on fishing income which indicated that the <b>vessel</b> <b>owner</b> in his own interest should be cautious in the operation to avoid frequent repairs and to reduce the delay in getting the vessels repaired...|$|E
