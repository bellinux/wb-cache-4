50|$|A <b>valve</b> <b>shim</b> is a disc of {{hardened}} metal of precisely calibrated height, used {{to adjust}} the clearance (US: lash) between {{the back side of}} the cam-lobe and the valve on which it operates, where the cam-lobe operates directly on the valve without an intermediate rocker arm. The shim sits atop a shim bucket which itself sits atop the valve-stem, and moves up and down within a machined bore. While hydraulically self-adjusting valves are sometimes preferred, because they require no adjustment, they do not work well in engines capable of high RPMs. In those, shims are most often used. As an example, most motorcycle engines capable of 8000RPM+ use shim-adjustable valves.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of predetermining the characteristic diagram {{of a shock}} absorber is analysed by means of numerical simulation and evaluating the influence of some structural parameters on damping force. An iterative process is applied to determine {{the opening of the}} <b>shim</b> <b>valve</b> built into the piston. Characteristic diagram shows different parts, the slopes of which and the points of their changes are analysed by adjusting some structural features, to establish how to operate for obtaining predetermined shapes. The thickness of the <b>shim</b> <b>valves</b> and the preload on the extension valve have greater influence on damping force than other structural parameters...|$|R
40|$|In the work, a {{mathematical}} model of a <b>shim</b> <b>valve,</b> used in monotube shock absorbers, designed to determine the deformations of the shims which form during the exploitation of the shock absorbers, is presented. The characteristic of the damping force formed by the shock absorber depends on the deformations. In the designed model, the amount, geometric dimensions, arrangement and the material properties of the shims are evaluated, and the contact forces, which form between the shims, are determined. The described model of the <b>shim</b> <b>valve</b> {{is presented in the}} environment of the software package MATLAB/Simulink, the analysis of the designed model is done using the software package ANSYS 15. 0...|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} {{with the first}} GSX engines was the move from direct overhead cam actuation of the <b>valve</b> by <b>shim</b> and bucket of the GS engines, to valve actuation via short forked rocker arms in the GSX -the valves stems and springs being located inboard from the camshafts due to the reduced included angle between inlet and exhaust valves. Apart from the heads the GS/GSX engines were of a common design.|$|R
50|$|The FW 38 hp 1020 cc straight-four SOHC was {{designed}} by Hassan and Mundy as the motive unit for a portable service firepump which was supplied to the government under three contracts totaling over 150,000 units. This engine was revolutionary in its lightness, with a bare weight of 180 pounds, combined with the maintenance-free <b>valve</b> adjustment using <b>shims</b> under an overhead camshaft.|$|R
50|$|Harry Mundy {{designed}} the Lotus TwinCam engine for Colin Chapman, who needed the {{replacement for the}} Coventry Climax FWE engine used in Lotus Elite. As Keith Duckworth and Mike Costin, the co-founders of Cosworth, used to be Lotus Development Ltd employees, the initial racing adaptation of Lotus TwinCam {{was carried out by}} Cosworth, and the Kent block Cosworth SCA was designed using the basic SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head configuration of the FWE. Due to Mundy being also the co-designer of the FWE, the Kent block Lotus TwinCam initially used the cam profile of the FWE, and shared the same <b>valve</b> clearance adjustment <b>shims</b> with Coventry Climax FWA, FWB, and FWE in production.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} to pre-establish {{the features of}} a shockabsorber is analyzed in this work. Numerical simulations were {{used to evaluate the}} influence of a few geometrical parameters on the force given under excitation. Since the oil flowing inside a shock-absorber can follow several directions, an iterative procedure was applied to determine the opening of the valves incorporated in the piston, and the formulas of the elastic strain for the circular plate were used for this purpose. The damping coefficients were obtained from the characterristic and work diagrams; they were then analyzed as function of a few geometrical features of the shock absorber. The results show that the thickness of the <b>shim</b> <b>valves</b> and the preload on the extension valve have more influence than the other parameters on the damping force...|$|R
