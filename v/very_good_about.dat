McIlvaine said of the situation, [...] "Basically, he lied to us. We had no idea. That's why half the time, you don't know who he represents. [...] very good at that. His clients are <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> keeping their mouths shut." [...] McIlvaine retracted his comments about Hamilton and Boras after Boras threatened to sue McIlvaine.|$|E

She said of Ford, [...] "When I was 15, {{one of the few}} people who said, 'Well done', was my drama teacher, and she was really brilliant. She was a powerful woman. Those women change your life. You always remember them. There was something about her. She basically made me feel <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> myself as a 15-year-old girl." [...] Abandoning her childhood ambition to become a nurse, Ripley decided to go into acting.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Susan became {{involved}} with Tom Scully (Andrew Larkins), a Priest. Susan and Tom caused a scandal when they began a relationship. Television critic Andrew Mercado said that 2004 went down as [...] "a watershed year for controversy" [...] after Susan had sex with Tom. Woodburne told Jackie Brygel from TV Week {{that it was a}} [...] "very hot affair". Tom left the priesthood for Susan and she confessed her love for him. However, the relationship soon ended. Woodburne commented [...] "It becomes apparent to both of them that it is just not meant to be. They both reach a period in their life when they are feeling low and lonely and aren't feeling <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> themselves. They just realise that there is no future." [...] Tom returned in 2007 and he became Principal of Erinsborough High. He told Susan that he never stopped loving her and wanted her back. However, by then she was back with Karl.|$|E

500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt it ended {{the beginning of}} the season on a [...] "high note", while Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "You couldn’t have asked for a better cliffhanger of a fall finale". IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure I expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what we got from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee {{found that}} in {{contrast}} to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a [...] "very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed {{like a human being}} and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie." [...] Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an [...] "over-the-top" [...] performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is [...] "a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing... and not [...] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now." [...] For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant had been unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, [...] "'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> it". Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{thought that}} the first Next Generation film, Star Trek Generations, was too much like a {{television}} episode but thought that his character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, was redefined as a [...] "movie hero" [...] in [...] He was concerned that in the new film, the character would return to that seen in the television series. Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows our crew having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Schrider wrote, [...] "While {{neither the}} strongest nor the second-strongest {{show of the}} first season, The Stock Tip proves that the show {{has come a long}} way, even after only five episodes. With this first season, the show's main issue is that it didn't equally utilize all four of its main characters... Jerry and Larry are {{the first to admit that}} they went into Seinfeld with little to no writing experience, but they were always <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>about</b> {{recognizing}} weaknesses and addressing them as needed." ...|$|E
