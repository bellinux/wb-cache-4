40|$|Patient's active {{cooperation}} {{is essential to}} achieve good outcome in pediatric rehabilitation. Therefore, virtual environments were developed to enhance robotic assisted gait training. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate <b>virtual</b> <b>realities</b> as motivational tools during robotic assisted gait training with children in the pediatric Lokomat®. Nine children with different gait disorders and eight healthy children participated in the study. Muscular effort of the lower leg was assessed by surface electromyography during a randomly designed training protocol with <b>virtual</b> <b>realities.</b> Self reported motivation was investigated with two questionnaires. Comparisons were drawn through repeated measurement Analysis of Variance and paired-t-tests. The logarithmic transformed data showed that the electromyographic activity output in both groups was significantly higher during tasks with <b>virtual</b> <b>realities</b> than during normal walking conditions. These results support that <b>virtual</b> <b>realities</b> seem to be efficient motivational tools to increase children's muscular effort in the pediatric Lokomat®. The gaming aspect of <b>virtual</b> <b>realities</b> keeps children highly engaged during repetitive tasks...|$|R
