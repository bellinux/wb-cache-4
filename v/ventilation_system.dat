5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> {{composed}} of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building.

The station's construction was expedited in order to both connect with and compete with the Bergen Street and Smith Street streetcar lines of the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT). Construction was slightly stalled due to delays in the delivery of steel flues for the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed the musicians to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below.

5|$|Finally {{the project}} moved to Columbia Point, near the University of Massachusetts Boston. The new site {{was less than}} ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's {{architectural}} team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{establishing}} exterior shots, {{and those}} of Tooms' house, were filmed around Hastings Street in Vancouver. When filming the first shot of Tooms' eyes glowing from a storm drain, the production crew arrived too late to secure the street for filming, and a nearby construction crew were temporarily drafted to guard the area. The <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> through which the first victim is attacked at night {{was meant to be}} of a multistory car park. However, to avoid a costly tenting operation to simulate night-time, a replica of the necessary parts of the <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was built in a lower level of the car park. Exterior shots of Scully's apartment were also filmed in Vancouver, at the same location used in the pilot episode. However, this location's use was later discontinued owing to the limited range of shots it afforded; most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street.|$|E

The paper reviews and analyzes the main Russian and foreign designs of <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> with heat recovery that are mostly used in practice. Three types of such systems: UVRK- 50, Prana- 150, ТеFо are chosen for consideration. The sequence of field tests of selected autonomous <b>ventilation</b> <b>systems</b> have been carried out in order to determine the actual air exchange and efficiency of heat recovery.

The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire was burning, transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E

5|$|Although Amanda gains {{access to}} a revolver, a shotgun, a bolt gun, and a {{flamethrower}} {{over the course of}} the game, Alien: Isolation emphasizes evasion over direct combat by providing the player with limited ammunition. Fortunately, the player can also craft several items by collecting schematics and different kind of materials throughout the game. Items range from EMP mines to noisemakers, molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, among others. These items help the player deal with enemies and the alien. For example, the noisemaker can be used to attract enemies in one particular direction. The alien is afraid of fire, so using the flamethrower or a molotov cocktail will force it to retreat into the station's <b>ventilation</b> <b>system.</b> The player has a limited amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. Nevertheless, the player can restore lost health using medkits, which can be crafted with materials in Amanda's inventory.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air <b>ventilation</b> <b>system</b> was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
