40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master’s thesis is to examine and analyse how a {{transfer}} pricing adjustment is made and how related parties should handle price adjustments from a customs perspective in Sweden. The examination includes describing the valuation methods available for transfer pricing and customs valuation with regards to related parties. In addition, the differences in connection to the valuation are described and analysed. Goods imported to Sweden must be cleared through customs: the importer presents a customs declaration to the Swedish Customs and pays customs duty. The customs duty is calculated using a customs value and customs valuation is the system that enables the importer to establish correct customs values on imported goods. Transfer pricing is the determination of prices on transactions taken place between companies belonging to the same group and has a direct effect on the income tax payable. There are six customs valuation methods that are hierarchically applied and six transfer pricing methods that are applied somewhat differently. There are similarities between the methods {{and most of the}} customs valuation methods have a corresponding transfer pricing method, or vice versa. Even if there are similarities, many factors make reconciliation of the methods difficult. Such factors are the different time for assessing the value and that the customs valuation methods are applied in a strictly hierarchical way with no possibility to choose the most suitable method. Customs duties and transfer pricing both share the same valuation concept, although interpreted differently, being that the value shall be based on the price that the parties would arrive at under open market conditions. However, relevant values on the same transaction differ significantly due to trying to be in accordance with respective rules. The differences in expectations and the conflicting interests on the outcome of the valuation lead to problems in the tax field. As a conclusion, customs valuation and transfer pricing can undeniably be described as “the two opposing and necessary sides of the same ‘coin’, whose respective values unavoidably affect the whole balance of a system of closely connected valuation”. In order for related parties to use the transaction value method, which is the superior customs valuation method, the price must not have been influenced due to their relationship. If one of two tests prescribed by law can prove that the relationship has not influenced the price, the related parties can use the transaction value method to establish the customs value. If the transaction value, for some reason cannot be used, the importer has to address other options on to how to establish the customs value. The conclusion of this master’s thesis is that related parties should include a price review clause in their contract or pricing policy. The company should notify the Swedish Customs about the provisional price and make an incomplete customs declaration. When information enabling the calculation of the customs value is available, the importer should file a complementary declaration. As an alternative, the importer should declare an open claim to the Swedish Customs arguing that the transaction value cannot be applied and, as a consequence thereof, explain in the customs <b>value</b> <b>declaration</b> why the applied customs value is correct. This thesis provides three recommendations concerning {{how to deal with the}} complications of customs valuation and transfer pricing. The first recommendation is that rules and recommendations surrounding transfer pricing and customs valuation should, to the extent possible, be harmonised. The second recommendation is that co-operation between the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Customs must improve, for example through advance pricing arrangements for both transfer pricing and customs purposes, documentation requirements, and joint audits. The third recommendation is that related parties should take the same care and documentation approach for customs purposes as it does for transfer pricing. Importing companies should make a price review clause in their contract before the importation and present an incomplete customs declaration. This way, in case of adjustments, the related party is able to uphold an arm’s length standard on the price and has the possibility to use the preferred transaction value for customs purposes, if that is desirable...|$|E

These dimensions were not found in any literature. They will allow future researchers to evaluate the different perceptions concerning organizational values. The study showed that the workers, whatever their hierarchical level might be, were not {{aware of the importance of}} the organizational values and most of them didn’t even know what those values are and what functions they play in the organization.   Keywords: organizational values; espoused organizational values; organizational culture; perceptions; hierarchical levels...|$|R

The forthcoming open operating system will focus not on desktops system, but will also be on devices that we use every day (E. g. Mobile). The main objective of the project is to design and develop an effective algorithm to detect malicious applications that possess a threat to hand held devices (in Android platform). This mainly focuses on the Vulnerability of Android applications and its Permissions. For example critical data may be manipulated using hand held devices for Banking etc. Since Android is an open source platform a lot of third party applications are developed and uploaded on Android market and Third party application stores. Users download it via their devices and usually applications are downloaded in bulk from the Play store. The main problem is that users are unaware of the third party applications which work as a simple application but may contain malicious application in it. The proposed algorithm realizes a malware detection system that continuously monitors various features and events obtained from the device. In case the application is declared as a malware by the algorithm then it is prevented. The proposed approach simply detects malware based on the patterns of already known malwares. The new environment will lead to new applications in their markets to enable greater integration.

50|$|A subtle {{issue is}} exactly when a scope begins and ends. In some languages, {{such as in}} C, a scope starts at declaration, and thus {{different}} names declared within a given block can have different scopes. This requires declaring functions before use, though not necessarily defining them, and requires forward declaration in some cases, notably for mutual recursion. In other languages, such as JavaScript or Python, a name's scope begins {{at the start of}} the relevant block (such as the start of a function), regardless of where it is defined, and all names within a given block have the same scope; in JavaScript this is known as variable hoisting. However, when the name is bound to a value varies, and behavior of in-context names that have undefined value differs: in Python use of undefined variables yields a runtime error, while in JavaScript undefined variables are usable (with undefined <b>value),</b> but function <b>declarations</b> are also hoisted to the top of the containing function and usable throughout the function.|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{electricity}} and the behavior of electricity prices differ from that of other commodity markets. One reason for this difference is that electricity is a non-storable good {{so it must be}} consumed almost at the instant it is generated. In most countries where electricity is deregulated, the demand for electricity is highly inelastic and varies rapidly yet supply can not increase {{at the same rate as}} demand. This results into rapidly rising prices, know as price spikes which stand out from the base price. The aim of this work is to identify and analyze the most important features of electricity spot prices, and propose a simulation algorithm that synthetically reconstructs the behavior of the real spot prices. In order to achieve this, we are suggesting a stochastic mean reverting jump-diffusion model with multiple mean reversion rates to cater for low and high spot prices. The results show that with the use of theoretical and empirical distributions it is possible to simulate a jumping mean reverting process with parameters close to real data <b>values.</b> CERTIFICATION <b>DECLARATION</b> AND COPYRIGHT I, HASIFA NAMPALA, declare that this dissertation is my own original work and has not been presented and will not be presented to any other university for a similar or any other degree award.

40|$|We {{present a}} new formal {{system for the}} {{specification}} and verification of abstract data types, one which allows subtypes and polymorphism. The new system {{is based on a}} modified notion of algebra, namely that of classified algebra. A classified algebra (our terminology) is essentially a single sorted algebra together with a classification (family of subsets) of its universe. The classification, which is not necessarily a partition, is labelled by sort (type) symbols; the subset of the universe labelled by a sort symbol s are the objects of ‘type’ s. An assertion in the new system is either an equation, which asserts that two expressions always have the same <b>value,</b> or a <b>declaration,</b> which asserts that the value of a particular expression is always of a particular type. Equations and declarations have equal status and the rules of inference (substitution and replacement) can be applied to both. We show that any specification (set of assertions) has an initial model, unique up to isomorphism, which we can take to be the family of data types and operations specified. The declarations in a specification act as the ‘generators’ of the types, and this principle forms the basis for an inductlon rule of inference for proving assertions about initial models. ...|$|R

In 1950, in order to limit the extent that the Arabs and the Israelis could engage in an arms race, the three nations which dominated the arms trade in the non-Communist world, namely the United States, the United Kingdom and France had signed the Tripartite Declaration, where they had committed themselves to limiting how much arms they could sell in the Near East, and also to ensuring that any arms sales to one side was matched by arms sales of equal quantity and quality to the other. Eisenhower viewed the Tripartite Declaration, which sharply restricted how many arms Egypt could buy in the West, as one of the key elements in keeping the peace between Israel and the Arabs, and believed that setting off an arms race would inevitably lead to a new war.|$|R
