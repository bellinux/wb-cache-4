50|$|The {{system of}} voting used was, as in {{previous}} elections, proportional representation through modified {{single transferable vote}} with five MPs to be returned from each of thirteen districts, i.e. 65 constituency seats in total, with a variable number of at-large seats added {{to ensure that the}} overall first-preference votes are reflected in the composition of the House of Representatives.

5000|$|Following {{the court}} ruling on the state's {{use of this}} system, the plaintiffs {{expanded}} their dilution claims in Dillard in an omnibus application to [...] "include the at-large election systems to include other county commissions, county school boards, and municipal councils across the state." [...] The amended complaint covered nearly [...] "200 units of local government", challenging at-large systems in local jurisdictions in which African Americans were at least 10 percent of the population. Most of the affected jurisdictions settled these cases by adopting single-member district systems (SMDs), which {{has resulted in the}} election of more African Americans to local offices, generally in proportion to their part of the jurisdiction's population; this has resulted in more Democrats being elected to office. Limited voting schemes were adopted by 21 municipalities in negotiation with the plaintiffs, and another six jurisdictions adopted cumulative <b>voting</b> <b>arrangements.</b> As a result, total representation by African-American candidates has increased in local elections for municipal and county government, as well as county school boards. Elections have been held since 1988 under these alternative systems.|$|E

50|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the court was the entire country, as opposed the contemporary Quarter Courts, whose jurisdiction extended only their relevant quarter of the country. The goal in establishing the court was probably unifying the judging of court cases throughout the whole country. The Fifth Court accepted appeals in cases already judged {{in one of the}} Quarter Court. The Fifth Court consisted of 48 men. 36 of them judged in cases, while both plaintiff and defender could bump up to 6 judges. Verdicts were decided by majority <b>votes.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> lasted throughout the period of the Icelandic Commonwealth.|$|R

Publicly, all parties expressed satisfaction with the outcome.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to quantifying the effects of corporate governance reforms, by focusing on the dynamics of the voting premiums, a measure of the private benefits of control in a corporation. The results indicate that the reforms have been successful in reducing the voting premiums EU-wide. Moreover, more intense and broad reform efforts (such as introducing national reforms beyond and above the EU-wide initiatives) bring higher and longer lasting benefits. Our findings also suggest that the market for corporate control in Europe has become more integrated, as illustrated by the lower dispersion in voting premiums across countries and over time.

40|$|Success {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} previously {{in the use of}} Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for autonomous faulthandling in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices, yet the completeness of a given repair can be improved. This research explores extensions to voting systems to work in parallel with imperfect GA solutions for Local Permanent Damage faults in the FPGA fabric. The benefits are evaluated by comparing performance with a GA that does not utilize voting, for triplex and 5 -plex <b>voting</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Results indicate that recovery capability is significantly improved achieving complete repair by a process of synthesis from the incomplete repairs obtained by the GAs. Votingenhanced systems are shown to increase the likelihood of finding a complete repair, with increases in speed and efficiency.

40|$|Monetary policy {{decisions}} are typically taken after a committee has deliberated and voted on a proposal. However, there are well-known {{risks associated with}} committee-based decisions. In this paper we examine {{the record of the}} shadow Monetary Policy Council in Canada. Given the structure of the committee, how decision-making takes place, as well as the <b>voting</b> <b>arrangements,</b> the MPC does not face the same information cascades and group polarization risks faced by actual decision-makers in central bank monetary policy councils. We find a considerable diversity of opinion about the recommended future path of interest rates inside the MPC. Beginning with the explicit forward guidance provided by the Bank of Canada market determined forward rates diverge considerably from the recommendations implied by the MPC. There is little evidence that the Bank and the MPC coordinate their future views about the interest rate path. However, it is difficult to explain the basis on which median voter inside the MPC, as well as doves and hawks on the committee, change their views about future changes in policy rates. This implies that there remain challenges in understanding the evolution of future interest rate paths over time...|$|E
