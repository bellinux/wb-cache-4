40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to study the importance of regional preferences in financing agri-environmental programs. The analysis is based on results of a case study conducted in South-eastern Poland. As environmental protection in agriculture is complex and often considered in political strategies, it is worth analyzing the differences in perception of the respective environmental objectives from a regional perspective. Taking into account natural conditions and the economic situation in agriculture in the <b>voivodship</b> <b>Podkarpackie,</b> the question is, how regional objectives could be achieved effectively with a given budget. Using linear programming, we discuss in this paper, how regional preferences would guide budget allocation. agri-environmental programs, environmental objectives, linear programming, budget allocation, Poland, Environmental Economics and Policy, Q 14, Q 57, C 6,...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{concentrates}} on intraregional disparities {{in health and}} spatial distribution of socio-economic factors that may affect health outcomes. The example of <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>voivodship</b> rural and urban areas provides viable evidence {{for at least the}} partial importance of socio-economic variables in explaining intraregional health disparities. A total of eight factors that influence hospitalization rate were distinguished for urban and rural areas. Global regression models were created using the socio-economic factors, which succeeded in explaining a considerable amount of variation in hospitalization rates both in urban and rural areas. Unfortunately, these models failed to explain local health determinants and so more sophisticated statistical models are necessary in order to fully understand intraregional health disparities.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the determinants of the choice of organic foods in the opinion of consumers of the <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>Voivodship.</b> The study was conducted in the second quarter of 2015 by the means of a questionnaire. The subjects of the research were 308 consumers of organic food in <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>Voivodship.</b> It was discovered that the consumers perceive organic food as an element of the food category that guarantees health security and excellent taste. Despite the desire to buy such food, the consumers who are supplying themselves with organic products think that the range of products available on the market is insufficient. A very high percentage of the respondents indicated a preference for purchasing food produced in their own country, preferably in their own region, and buying directly from a manufacturer. More than a third of the respondents, especially under 35 years old, is supplying themselves with organic products in specialist stores and supermarkets. The primary barrier in buying organic foods is its too high price.  ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of {{analysis}} of the wind potential in selected locations in the southern Poland (placed in the Małopolskie, Świętokrzyskie and <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>Voivodships).</b> The measurements {{and analysis of the}} wind resources in potential locations of the wind turbines are important part of the investment process. The statistical analysis involves the creation of histograms (e. g. histogram of the wind speed and direction) and fitting those histograms to theoretical distributions (e. g. Weilbull distributions of wind speed). Such analysis has been described and conducted using measurement data for four selected locations. Basis on the conducted analysis, the economy efficiency and environmental impact of wind turbine operation has been estimated. Three market available wind turbines have been included to calculate NPV, IRR and SPBT indicators. Then, the avoided emissions of CO 2, NOx, SO 2 and dust have been calculated. There were also conducted some calculation using TRNSYS simulation software. The results of simulations have been compared with measurement data and the level of convergence have been found...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{includes}} {{an analysis of}} the results of the research conducted among 600 consumers from six communes of <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>voivodship.</b> The research proved, that customers buying natural regional products prefer, to a large extent, their quality, wholesomeness, price, producer’s brand and packaging. It should be stressed, that price, which was previously in the first place, in the opinion of the surveyed population takes the third position, and the first one is taken by quality. The research showed the differences between men and women in preference of features of regional products. The majority of women paid attention to quality, price and brand, men, on the other hand, to wholesomeness and product’s packaging. High quality and price were in the scope of interest of the youngest and retired people. Older people were more interested in brand and packaging than younger ones. Quality of regional goods was preferred regardless of the number of family members Brand and packaging were the most important features representing one-person households. The richest consumers preferred quality, price, brand, packaging, while the poorest ones paid attention to wholesomeness, quality and price...|$|R

50|$|Iwonicz-Zdroj {{is one of}} Poland’s oldest health {{resorts and}} spas, dating back to 1578, which was famous outside Poland already in the 18th century. The town lies in the {{south-eastern}} part of <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>voivodship,</b> Krosno province. The town is surrounded on all sides by high mixed forest. It lies at 400 m above sea level. This unusual location among hills of Beskid Niski, in the valley of Iwonicki Potok (Iwonicz Stream), undeniably rates Iwonicz highly among those places, which charm guests with their beauty and still immaculately clean air. The resort is {{at a distance of}} 80 km to the south from the voivodship capital - Rzeszów, and 16 km from Krosno. It is about 180 km away from Kraków. The Iwonicz climate is described as foothills climate with properties of sub-alpine climate, what is important and advantageous in health resort treatment. The Iwonicz forests create a microclimate around the resort, regulating humidity and temperature of the air, protecting it from winds and are a source of ozone. The resort is situated {{in the area of the}} greatest insolation and lowest cloudiness in Poland, which, all-in-all makes it a perfect spot for soothing, refreshing and regenerating the body.|$|R
40|$|Regional {{development}} policy aims {{to cope with}} the challenge of spatial disparities. It is based on a smart combination of various critical capital assets in a region which functionally and spatially interact and which yield synergetic economic opportunities and promising challenges for innovation and progress. The present study regards sustainable territorial performance – as a manifestation of regional development – as the overarching principle for competitive advantages and economic growth in a system of regions, which is particularly induced by territorial capital, comprising human capital, infrastructural capital and social capital. In the long-standing tradition of regional {{development policy}} a wide variety of effective facilitators or drivers of accelerated spatial growth has been distinguished, for instance, industrial districts, growth poles, growth centers, industrial complexes, special economic zones, communication axes, and so forth. In the past decades, a new concept has been introduced, viz. economic-technological clusters. An avalanche of literature has been published on the conceptual, operational and policy foundation and relevance of this concept, especially in relation to previously developed regional growth concepts. In this paper, clusters will be regarded as the spatial foci of sustainable territorial performance strategies and synergetic actions by both public and private actors. The present paper aims to address the relevance of cluster concepts for an effective regional development policy, based on the above notion of territorial capital. It does so by introducing a new concept, viz. effective cluster, in which spatial-economic synergy, local/regional concentration of industry, and the supporting role of territorial capital are regarded as the main determinants of a highly performing cluster in a given territory. The effective cluster concept will be tested {{on the basis of a}} field study on the aviation and aerospace cluster ‘Dolina Lotnicza’ in the Podkarpackie region in South-East Poland. This is one of the most vibrant high-tech clusters in the country. A new approach based on a triple-layer architecture will be adopted here, viz. : a quantitative comparative analysis of the 16 Polish ‘voivodships’ (main administrative regions in the country, at a NUTS- 2 level), a benchmark analysis of the 25 counties (‘powiats’) within the <b>Podkarpackie</b> <b>voivodship</b> (at a NUTS- 4 level), and an effective industrial cluster analysis on the basis of the individual aviation firms located in the Podkarpackie region. In each step an extended Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), characterised by a merger of a Slack-Based Measure (SMB) and a super-efficiency (SE) DEA, will be used in order to achieve an unambiguous ranking of the various regions or Decision Making Units (DMUs). The study will employ an extensive database on individual actors in the cluster, in combination with a broadly composed territorial-capital database for the areas under study. The paper will be concluded with some strategic policy lessons...|$|R
