5|$|During {{this period}} of time in her efforts on behalf of the OSA agents, Christman felt {{conflicted}} in her activities, because she supported freedom of speech and she felt her activities constituted censorship. The operator of Xenu.net, Andreas Heldal-Lund, saw Christman's posts on ARS and reached out to her <b>via</b> <b>email</b> on July 14, 2000. The two engaged in communication, and Heldal-Lund explained to Christman his motivation for managing the Operation Clambake site. Christman identified with Heldal-Lund's ideals of free speech, and on July 20, 2000, she announced her intention to leave Scientology in a public post to ARS. She realized she would face repercussions from the organization for her actions, and asked Heldal-Lund for help; he recommended she contact a group of protesters against Scientology called the Lisa McPherson Trust (LMT) who were based in Clearwater, Florida. The LMT was started by Robert Minton and former Scientologists to highlight the controversial death of Scientology member, Lisa McPherson.|$|E
5|$|Boys Don't Cry {{aired in}} Canada at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 1999.

It was {{shown at the}} Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October, where it won further praise and appeared at the Venice International Film Festival. Boys Don't Cry was given a special screening in snippets at the Sundance Film Festival. At that time, the film was still called Take It Like a Man. The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22, 1999, in the U.S., where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox that specializes in independent films. Initially, many viewers complained <b>via</b> <b>email</b> to Peirce that the film was not being shown near them, as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country. However, this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000. The film grossed $73,720 in its opening week. By December 5, the film had grossed in excess of $2 million. By May 2000, it had a U.S. total gross of $11,540,607—more than three times its production budget. Internationally, the film was released on March 2, 2000 in Australia and on April 9, 2000, in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} popularity of emails, {{it is very}} common nowadays that people discuss specific issues, events or tasks {{among a group of}} people by emails. Those discussions can be viewed as conversations <b>via</b> <b>emails</b> and are valuable for the user as a personal information repository. For instance, in 10 minutes before a meeting, a user may want to quickly go through a previous discussion <b>via</b> <b>emails</b> {{that is going to be}} discussed in the meeting soon. In this case, rather than reading each individual email one by one, it is preferable to read a concise summary of the previous discussion with major information summarized. In this thesis, we study the problem of discovering and summarizing email conversations. We believe that our work can greatly support users with their email folders. However, the characteristics of email conversations, e. g., lack of synchronization, conversational structure and informal writing style, make this task particularly challenging. In this thesis, we tackle this task by considering th...|$|R
