5|$|The Swiss {{historian}} Jacob Burckhardt (1818–1897) in his The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860), by contrast, {{defined the}} Renaissance as {{the period between}} Giotto and Michelangelo in Italy, that is, the 14th to mid-16th centuries. He saw in the Renaissance {{the emergence of the}} modern spirit of individuality, which the Middle Ages had stifled. His book was widely read and became influential {{in the development of the}} modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. However, Buckhardt has been accused of setting forth a linear Whiggish <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> in seeing the Renaissance as the origin of the modern world.|$|E

This, {{combined}} with cultural liberalization and the increasing remoteness {{of the possibility of}} retaking mainland China, led to a cultural and political movement which emphasized a Taiwan-centered <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and culture rather than one which was China-centered or even, as before 1946, Japan-centered. Taiwanization was strongly supported by President Lee Teng-hui.|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{responses}} to Sinocentric concepts {{have not always}} been so straightforward. The Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 evoked a national consciousness {{of the role of the}} kamikaze (神風) in defeating the enemy. Less than fifty years later (1339–43), Kitabatake Chikafusa wrote the Jinnō Shōtōki (神皇正統記, 'Chronicle of the Direct Descent of the Divine Sovereigns') emphasizing the divine descent of the imperial line. The Jinnō Shōtōki provided a Shinto <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> stressing the divine nature of Japan and its spiritual supremacy over China and India.|$|E
25|$|Afrocentrism {{can be seen}} as an African-American-inspired {{ideology}} that manifests an affirmation of themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by conceptualizing a glorified heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign origins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to the African continent). It often denies or minimizes European, Near Eastern and Asian cultural influences while accenting historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of Africa. It involves an African diaspora version of an African-centered <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who have been marginalized.|$|E
25|$|One theory {{holds that}} the battle of Lochaber was a {{defining}} moment in {{the early history of}} the Clan Cameron, at that time it was more a confederation than a homogenous clan and the MacMartins' defection reflected this. In this <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> the MacMartins were punished for their treachery by the Camerons of Lochiel, such that the MacMartin chiefs were driven into exile and the Lochiel faction took control of the clan. Donald Dubh appears to have supported James in his defeat at the Battle of Inverlochy in 1431 and the Cameron lands were ravaged afterwards. When Alexander was released, he took further vengeance on the clan he viewed as traitors, driving Donald Dubh into exile and giving the Cameron lands in Lochiel to John Garve Maclean of Coll.|$|E

40|$|Thesis: The Central Event <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> is {{the only}} {{sufficient}} <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> 	The Central Event (CE) <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> is a <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> that holds that a single, Central event within human history possessed certain aspects and characteristics at such a level that, when it occurred, all <b>of</b> human <b>history,</b> both before, during, and after, were forever impacted. The impact of the Central Event was so great and complete, that it defined how humankind is to view and understand all <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> The event that the CE view declares is the Central event of all <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> is the Christ Event. The Christ Event encompasses the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Working with the CE <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> as its foundation, this study has developed the Central Event Teaching Model (CEM) for Christian apologists. The objectives of the CEM include 1) creating an awareness within the Christian apologetic community {{of the importance of}} identifying the types <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> that are prevalent in our world today, 2) equipping Christian apologists with a tool to help them share the Central Event view in a concise and effective way, and 3) meeting a deep spiritual need that is present in our world today. 	The first chapter is a literature review of the key contributing voices that the CEM model has used for its foundation and support. The most impactful of all these voices is that of Wolfhart Pannenberg. However, other significant voices include David Bebbington, Arnold Toynbee, G. Ernest Wright, and Rolf Rendtorff. 	The second chapter examines three alternative <b>views</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> These include the Cyclical (CY), Human Progress (HP), and Relativistic (RL) <b>views</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> The goal <b>of</b> this examination will be to demonstrate the various reasons why this study has found these <b>views</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history</b> to be insufficient. 	The third chapter will examine the Central Event (CE) <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> The task <b>of</b> this chapter will be to examine what this study has labelled God Events, and what it is about these God Events that enable them to be worthy foundational elements for the CE <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> 	The fourth chapter will continue the examination <b>of</b> the CE <b>view</b> <b>of</b> human <b>history,</b> and God Events, but it will focus on the one Event that the CE view holds to be the Central Event <b>of</b> human <b>history.</b> This Central Event, again, encompasses the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. 	The final chapter of this study includes the Central Event Teaching Model (CEM) for Christian apologists. This model will include 17 specially created diagrams that will serve to help explain and teach the CEM to Christian apologists, while also providing for them illustrative tools then can use to employ the CEM in their own apologetic efforts...|$|R
25|$|The Book of Revelation is at {{the core}} of Christian eschatology. The study of Revelation is usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or hermeneutics. In the Futurist approach, Revelation is treated mostly as {{unfulfilled}} prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies. In the Preterist approach, Revelation is chiefly interpreted as having prophetic fulfillment in the past, principally, the events of the first century CE, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and the desecration of the Temple in the same year. In the Historicist approach, Revelation provides a broad <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> and passages in Revelation are identified with major historical people and events. In the Idealist (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.|$|E

500|$|The <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> propounded in {{this text}} is very {{strongly}} influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola {{are important to the}} interplay of the [...] "characters." [...] Vico propounded a cyclical <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history {{is to be found in}} the opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words [...] "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs." [...] ("vicus" [...] is a pun on Vico) and ends [...] "A way a lone a last a loved a long the." [...] In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from [...] "ideal insomnia" [...] and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.|$|E
500|$|Tanaka, {{one of the}} translators of the book, praised Townsend in Shokun! {{magazine}} for his [...] "penetrating insight" [...] in reporting [...] "starkly and vividly on {{the true nature of}} the Chinese that he had witnessed firsthand". Sakita, the other translator, likewise lauded the book in an article written for Nobukatsu Fujioka's Association for Advancement of Unbiased <b>View</b> <b>of</b> <b>History.</b> Sakita called the book [...] "essential reading to understand what China really is" [...] and argued that Townsend's ideas continue to offer important lessons in conducting Sino-Japanese relations today. The book was also reviewed positively by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.|$|E
500|$|In April 1956, Childe {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Society of Antiquaries for his {{services}} to archaeology. He was invited to lecture in the U.S. on multiple occasions, by Robert Braidwood, William Duncan Strong, and Leslie White, but was barred from entering the country due to his socialist beliefs. Whilst working at the Institute, Childe continued writing and publishing books dealing with archaeology and prehistory. History (1947) continued his belief that prehistory and literate history must be viewed together, and adopted a Marxist <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> whilst Prehistoric Migrations (1950) displayed his views on moderate diffusionism. In 1946 he had also published a paper in the Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, titled [...] "Archaeology and Anthropology" [...] which argued that the two disciplines must be used in tandem, {{something that would be}} widely accepted in the decades following his death.|$|E

500|$|Marx's <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> {{which came}} to be called {{historical}} materialism (controversially adapted as the philosophy of dialectical materialism by Engels and Lenin), certainly shows the influence of Hegel's claim that one should view reality (and history) dialectically. However, Hegel had thought in idealist terms, putting ideas in the forefront, whereas Marx sought to rewrite dialectics in materialist terms, arguing for the primacy of matter over idea. Where Hegel saw the [...] "spirit" [...] as driving history, Marx saw this as an unnecessary mystification, obscuring the reality of humanity and its physical actions shaping the world. He wrote that Hegelianism stood the movement of reality on its head, and that one needed to set it upon its feet. Despite his dislike of mystical terms, Marx used Gothic language in several of his works and in The Capital he refers to capital as [...] "necromancy that surrounds the products of labour".|$|E
500|$|The book {{reflected}} Kenyatta's {{desire to}} use anthropology {{as a weapon}} against colonialism. In it, Kenyatta challenged the Eurocentric <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> by presenting {{an image of a}} golden African past by emphasising the perceived order, virtue, and self-sufficiency of Kikuyu society. Utilising a functionalist framework, he promoted the idea that traditional Kikuyu society had a cohesion and integrity that was better than anything offered by European colonialism. In this book, Kenyatta made clear his belief that the rights of the individual should be downgraded in favour of the interests of the group. The book also reflected his changing views on female genital mutilation; where once he opposed it, he now unequivocally supported the practice, downplaying the medical dangers that it posed to women. Murray-Brown later described it as [...] "a propaganda tour de force. No other African had made such an uncompromising stand for tribal integrity." [...] Bodil Folke Frederiksen, a scholar of development studies, referred to it as [...] "probably the most well-known and influential African scholarly work of its time", while for fellow scholar Simon Gikandi, it was [...] "one of the major texts in {{what has come to be}} known as the invention of tradition in colonial Africa".|$|E
500|$|In the mid-20th century, the {{originality}} of {{the approach}} of the architectural historian Colin Rowe had the effect of re-situating the assessment of modern architecture within history and acknowledged the Palladian architecture as an active influence. In the later 20th century, when Rowe's influence had spread worldwide, this approach had become a key element in the process of architectural and urban design. If [...] "the presence of the past" [...] was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from James Stirling to Aldo Rossi, Robert Venturi, Oswald Matthias Ungers, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay [...] "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa" [...] (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional [...] "rules" [...] in Palladio’s villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar [...] "rules" [...] in Le Corbusier’s villas at Poissy and Garches. This approach enabled Rowe to elaborate an astonishingly fresh and provocative trans-historical assessment of both Palladio and Le Corbusier, in which the architecture of both was assessed not in chronological time, but {{side by side in the}} present moment.|$|E

500|$|He is counted {{among the}} most famous Polish painters, {{described}} as [...] "Poland's greatest historical painter" [...] and [...] "a cult figure to the nation at large... {{by the time of}} his death.". His style was praised for being [...] "colourful, detailed and imaginative". He succeeded in propagating Polish history, and reminding the world about Poland, while his country remained partitioned and without any independent political representation. His works, disseminated in thousands of reproductions, have become almost standard illustrations of many key events in Polish history. His 1860 illustrated album Ubiory w Polsce (Clothing in Poland) is seen as a valuable historical reference. Critics of his work have pointed to his use of traditional painting style ("antiquarian realism", [...] "theatrical effects"). At exhibitions abroad the nuanced historical context of his works would be often lost on foreign audiences. Occasionally his paintings would cause controversy; for example Rejtan offended a number of prominent members of Polish nobility, who saw the painting as an indictment of their entire social class. His paintings were subject to censorship in the Russian Empire, and Nazi Germany planned to destroy Battle of Grunwald and the Prussian Homage, which the Nazi authorities considered offensive to the German <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> (those paintings were among many that the Germans planned to purposefully destroy in their war on Polish culture; both were however successfully hidden by the members of Poland resistance).|$|E
500|$|Compared to The Battle of Maldon, an Old English {{poem that}} commemorates {{a battle between}} English and Vikings half a century later, Brunanburh is notable for its {{nationalist}} overtones, whereas Maldon celebrates Christian over non-Christian values. Indeed, the poem is seen as celebrating a logical progression {{in the development of}} England as a unified nation ruled by the House of Wessex; the battle reports [...] "the dawning of a sense of nationality, ....a crisis in which a nation is involved". In this respect, Brunanburh is closer to the Anglo-Saxon poem The Taking of the Five Boroughs, also found in the Chronicle under the year 942, celebrating King Edmund's recapture of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. But while the poet claims veracity, Michael Swanton notes, [...] "it is ironic in view of his primarily historic concerns that he is in fact more successful than the Maldon-poet in transmitting the traditional poetic style." [...] Peter Clemoes argues in Interactions of Thought and Language in Old English Poetry that Brunanburh, as opposed to Maldon, relies on [...] "uncomplicated patriotic triumphalism". The poem does not treat [...] "personal responsibility" [...] as Maldon does, but leans on an expansive <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> which sees the battle, in line with the Chronicles view of contemporary history as the [...] "epitome of Anglo-Saxon, especially West Saxon, history with antecedents in the history of Britain", as [...] "straightforwardly traditional". According to Patrick Wormald, the poem builds on the [...] "sense of ideological identity that the English had been given by Bede." ...|$|E
