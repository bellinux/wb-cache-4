40|$|Introduction: Menorrhagia is {{a common}} problem among females. It has many causes. It is common among {{patients}} with bleeding disorders and can be a presenting symptom. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of bleeding disorders among women with menorrhagia Study design and procedure: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study, coducted in Khartoum Hospital (Dec 2007 -Feb 2008); 34 women aged between 13 and 43 years presenting with menorrhagia were studied, where the usual gynecological and endocrinal causes of bleeding were ruled out by a gynaecologist. These patients were investigated for haemostatic defects by doing; platelet count and finger prick platelet aggregation test, bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and when appropriate thrombin time and factor assay and factor XIII screening. Factor VIII level, vWf antigen, were done for all patients. Results and discussion: Of the 34 women investigated, 56 % (19 cases) had a bleeding disorder to account for their menorrhagia. Although a majority of patients with platelet disorders and <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (vWd), (47 %) and (32 %) respectively, other rare coagulation factor deficiencies such as factor V (10. 5 %), and factor X (10. 5 %) were also found. Platelet disorders included count and function defects. History of bleeding from other sites, appeared as a significant finding, which might {{be used as a}} predictor for such a disorder in patients with menorrhagia. Family history of bleeding tendencies was not a predictive finding. Conclusion and recommendations: Patients with menorrhagia without a discernable cause, therefore, need evaluation for haemostatic disorders. This necessitate collaborate work between gynaecologists and haematologists, to exclude haemostatic abnormality. Especially before surgical intervention. vWd needs special consideration, since it might be missed by routine investigations. There should be a reliable, specialized laboratory in coagulation to reduce the discrepancy of results...|$|E
40|$|Activated protein C (APC) acts as {{a potent}} {{anticoagulant}} enzyme by inactivating Factor V and Factor VIII. In this study, protein S was shown to increase the inactivation of purified Factor VIII by APC ninefold. The reaction rate was saturated {{with respect to the}} concentration of protein S when protein S was present in a 10 -fold molar excess over APC. The heavy chain of Factor VIII was cleaved by APC and protein S did not alter the degradation pattern. Factor VIII circulates in a complex with the adhesive protein <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. When purified Factor VIII was recombined with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, the inactivation of Factor VIII by APC proceeded at a 10 - 20 -fold slower rate as compared with Factor VIII in the absence of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. Protein <b>S</b> had no effect on the inactivation of the Factor VIII-von Willebrand factor complex by APC. After treatment of this complex with thrombin, however, the actions of APC and protein S towards Factor VIII were completely restored. In hemophilia A plasma, purified Factor VIII associated with endogenous <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, resulting in a complete protection against APC (4 nM). By mixing hemophilic plasma with plasma from a patient with severe <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease, we could vary the amount of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. 1 U of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was needed to provide protection of 1 U Factor VIII. Also in plasma from patients with the IIA-type variant of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease, Factor VIII was protected. In <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease plasma, which was depleted of protein S, APC did not inactivate Factor VIII. These results indicate that protein S serves as a cofactor in the inactivation of Factor VIII and Factor VIIIa by APC and that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor can regulate the action of these two anticoagulant protein...|$|R

40|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> {{disease is}} the most common {{inherited}} bleeding disorder and is characterised by mucocutaneous bleeding. <b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease is caused by reduced levels or reduced function of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis explored several pathogenic mechanisms underlying <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease that {{is characterized by a}} quantitative or functional deficiency of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, in particular with respect to intracellular storage in Weibel-Palade body and regulated secretion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. By using molecular biology, confocal and electron microscopic techniques, storage and secretion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor were analyzed for <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease variants identified in the patients. These studies advanced our understanding of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease at the molecular and cellular levels. HEK 293 cells and endothelial cells derived from patients’ peripheral blood were established as two useful model-systems for examining <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor structure-function relationships in the context of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease. Using these model-systems we have demonstrated that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor mutations may impair its storage and secretion and thus lead to a quantitative deficiency of this factor in the patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that alteration in the structure of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, by natural mutations that occur in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease patients, modulates <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor string formation and function.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Nucleotide {{variations}} {{not changing}} protein sequences are considered silent mutations; accumulating {{data suggest that}} they can, however, be important in human diseases. DESIGN AND METHODS: We report an altered splicing process induced by a silent substitution (c. 7056 C>T) in the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor gene {{in a case of}} type 1 <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease originally classified as lacking <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor mutations. RESULTS: The c. 7056 C>T synonymous substitution introduces a new donor splice site within exon 41, leading to messenger RNA lacking nucleotides 7055 - 7081 (c. 7055 _ 7081 del). The encoded <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor protein is predicted to lack amino acids 2352 - 2360 in the B 2 domain. The patient's <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease phenotype was characterized by reduced plasma and platelet <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, which was normal in function and multimer structure. In vitro expression studies demonstrated that co-transfection of equimolar c. 7055 _ 7081 del and wild-type <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor (mimicking the patient's heterozygous state) induced a 50 % lower <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor secretion than the wild type, while almost no <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor secretion was seen with the mutated <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor alone. The secreted <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was structurally and functionally normal, suggesting that the c. 7056 C>T substitution behaves like a loss-of-function allele. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a synonymous <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor substitution being responsible for <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease. Our findings suggest the need to reconsider the role of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor polymorphisms in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor might affect factor VIII immunogenicity by reducing factor VIII uptake by antigen presenting cells. Here we investigate the interaction of recombinant <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor with immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Surprisingly, <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was not internalized by immature dendritic cells, but remained bound to the cell surface. As <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor reduces the uptake of factor VIII, we investigated the repertoire of factor VIII presented peptides when in complex with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. Interestingly, factor VIII-derived peptides were still abundantly presented on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, even though a reduction of factor VIII uptake by immature dendritic cells was observed. Inspection of peptide profiles from 5 different donors showed that different core factor VIII peptide sequences were presented upon incubation with factor VIII/von Willebrand factor complex when compared to factor VIII alone. No <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor peptides were detected when immature dendritic cells were pulsed with different concentrations of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, confirming lack of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor endocytosis. Several <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor derived peptides were recovered when cells were pulsed with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor/factor VIII complex, suggesting that factor VIII promotes endocytosis of small amounts of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor by immature dendritic cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mutations of {{cysteine}} residues in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor {{are known}} to reduce the storage and secretion of this factor, thus leading to reduced antigen levels. However, one cysteine mutation, p. Cys 2773 Ser, {{has been found in}} patients with type 2 A(IID) <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease who have normal plasma levels of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. We hypothesize that disruption of either intra- or interchain disulfide bonds by cysteine mutations in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor has different effects on the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies. DESIGN AND METHODS: The effect of specific cysteine mutations that either disrupt intrachain (p. Cys 1130 Phe and p. Cys 2671 Tyr) or interchain (p. Cys 2773 Ser) disulfide bonds on storage and secretion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was studied by transient transfection of human embryonic kidney cell line 293. Upon expression of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor these cells formed endothelial Weibel-Palade body-like organelles called pseudo-Weibel-Palade bodies. Storage of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was analyzed with both confocal immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Regulated secretion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was induced by phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. RESULTS: p. Cys 1130 Phe and p. Cys 2671 Tyr reduced the storage of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor into pseudo-Weibel-Palade bodies with notable retention of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas p. Cys 2773 Ser-von Willebrand factor was stored normally. As expected, wild-type <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor formed proteinaceous tubules that were seen under electron microscopy as longitudinal striations in pseudo-Weibel-Palade bodies. p. Cys 2773 Ser caused severe defects in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor multimerization but the factor formed normal tubules. Furthermore, the basal and regulated secretion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was drastically impaired by p. Cys 1130 Phe and p. Cys 2671 Tyr, but not by p. Cys 2773 Ser. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that natural mutations of cysteines involved in the formation of interchain disulfide bonds do not affect either the storage in Weibel-Palade bodies or secretion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, whereas mutations of cysteines forming intrachain disulfide bonds lead to reduced <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor storage and secretion because the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum...|$|R

40|$|Aggregation {{of human}} {{platelets}} by bovine plasma was recently {{recognized as a}} marker {{for the study of}} the antihemophilic and <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factors. A similar marker in porcine plasma is shown to be specific for the platelet-active <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor of plasma, but not for the antihemophilic factor (factor VIII). A new quantitative assay for the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is based on the dose-response relationship observed between the concentration of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor and platelet aggregation times determined macroscopically. Bleeder swine, homozygous for <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> disease, had no detectable platelet aggregating activity, while heterozygotes, carriers of the disease, had reduced levels of approximately 50 % of normal. Exact detection of non-obligate carriers, hitherto impossible, becomes readily feasible because of the gene dosage relationship to the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor plasma levels. Transfusion of bleeder swine with normal plasma results in an immediate post-transfusion rise of the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor, followed by a rapid falloff.

50|$|The {{important}} role of depletion of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor in aortic stenosis was first proposed in 1992 by Warkentin et al.

They also noted that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease is known to cause bleeding from angiodysplasia. Based on these facts, they hypothesized that acquired <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease is the true culprit behind gastrointestinal bleeding in aortic stenosis. They also proposed a possible mechanism for the acquired <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease, noting that <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is most active in 'high shear' vessels (meaning small vessels in which blood flows rapidly).

CLB-RAg 201 does not inhibit the binding of 'SI-von Willebrand factor to extracellular matrices of endothelial cells, to smooth muscle cells, or to the subendothelium. CLB-RAg 201 partly inhibits platelet adhesion to these surfaces, but this directly affects the interaction between <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor and platelets and is not due to inhibition of binding of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor to these surfaces. Another MAb, CLB-RAg 38, does not inhibit the binding of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor to collagen. CLB-RAg 38 completely inhibits the binding of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor to extracellular matrices.

Reciprocal inhibition of platelet Fc receptors was produced by prior incubation of platelets with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor and ristocetin.

Endo F alone removed 69 % of total hexose and D-galactose, and 71 % of sialic acid. However, there was no discernible loss of large multimers and the ristocetin cofactor activity was decreased by only 11 %.

Further treatment of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase reduced the D-galactose to 15 % and ristocetin cofactor activity to 57 %. A similar decrease in ristocetin cofactor activity was seen if <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor was treated only with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase. In contrast, treating <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase {{in the presence of}} protease inhibitors (20 mM benzamidine, 20 U/ml aprotonin, 15 micrograms/ml leupeptin) resulted in a comparable removal of carbohydrate with no change in ristocetin cofactor activity. Moreover, the multimeric structure remained intact in spite of 80 % removal of D-galactose. This suggested that carbohydrate was protecting <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor against traces of one or more protease contaminants. Evidence in support of this hypothesis was obtained by exposing <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor to plasmin after pretreatment with neuraminidase alone or with neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase.

40|$|A {{modification}} of Salzman's method {{has been used}} in an attempt to provide an assay in vitro for the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. Platelet adhesiveness was increased in <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease by previously coating the beads with normal or haemophilic plasma or cryoprecipitate, whereas <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> plasma had no corrective effect.

40|$|A {{variant of}} <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease has been {{identified}} in which sodium dodecyl sulfate agarose electrophoresis provides evidence that the <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor present is structurally abnormal. Rather than the repeating triplet seen in normal subjects and in patients with the IIA and IIB variants, a repeating doublet was present in the propositus. None of the bands had the same mobility as bands in normal subjects or previously described <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease patients. The larger multimers of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor were lacking both from plasma and platelets, and did {{not appear in the}} circulation after infusion of 1 -deamino-[8 -D-arginine]-vasopressin. There was a marked increase in the concentration of the smallest multimer in the propositus and his phenotypically normal children, indicating that this abnormality of <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor is inherited in an autosomal-recessive manner...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion of {{erythrocytes}} to endothelial cells {{lining the}} vascular wall can cause vaso-occlusive events that impair blood flow {{which in turn}} may result in ischemia and tissue damage. Adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelial cells has been described in multiple hemolytic disorders, especially in sickle cell disease, but the adhesion of normal erythrocytes to endothelial cells has hardly been described. It was shown that calcium-loaded erythrocytes can adhere to endothelial cells. Because sickle erythrocyte adhesion to ECs can be enhanced by ultra-large <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor multimers, we investigated whether calcium loading of erythrocytes could promote binding to endothelial cells via ultra-large <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor multimers. We used (immunofluorescent) live-cell imaging of washed erythrocytes perfused over primary endothelial cells at venular flow rate. Using this approach, we show that calcium-loaded erythrocytes strongly adhere to histamine-stimulated primary human endothelial cells. This adhesion is mediated by ultra-large <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor multimers. <b>Von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor knockdown or ADAMTS 13 cleavage abolished the binding of erythrocytes to activated endothelial cells under flow. Platelet depletion did not interfere with erythrocyte binding to <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. Our results reveal platelet-independent adhesion of calcium-loaded erythrocytes to endothelium-derived <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor. Erythrocyte adhesion to <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor may be particularly relevant for venous thrombosis, which {{is characterized by the}} formation of erythrocyte-rich thromb...|$|R

40|$|Epinephrine {{infusion}} causes variable {{increases in}} {{the components of the}} Factor VIII (antihemophilic factor) complex in patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease. The increase in antihemophilic factor procoagulant activity was greater than that of Factor VIII-related antigen and <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor activity in two patients with <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease. Similar {{increases in the}} three individual factors were demonstrated in two other patients. A 4 - 10 -fold increase in Factor VIII-related properties was identified in each of these individuals after infusion. One patient has been studied with very severe <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand's</b> disease; none of the Factor VIII-related properties increased despite two infusions of epinephrine. Bleeding times were normalized or remained normal in the two patients whose <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor activity was greater than 25 U/ 100 ml. It remained prolonged in those three patients whose <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor activity levels remained below that concentration.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Cerebral {{vasospasm}} {{remains a}} major source of morbidity after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We demonstrate that simvastatin reduces serum markers of brain injury and attenuates vasospasm after SAH. Methods—Patients with angiographically documented aneurysmal SAH were randomized within 48 hours of symptom onset to receive either simvastatin (80 mg daily; n 19) or placebo (n 20) for 14 days. Plasma alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase were recorded weekly to evaluate laboratory evidence of hepatitis or myositis. Serum markers of brain injury were recorded daily. The primary end point of vasospasm was defined as clinical impression (delayed ischemic deficit not associated with rebleed, infection, or hydrocephalus) in the presence of 1 confirmatory radiographic test (angiography or transcranial Doppler demonstrating mean VMCA 160 m/sec). Results—There {{were no significant differences in}} laboratory-defined transaminitis or myositis between groups. No patients developed clinical symptoms of myopathy or hepatitis. Plasma <b>von</b> <b>Willebrand</b> factor and <b>S</b> 100 were decreased 3 to 10 days after SAH (P 0. 05) in patients receiving simvastatin versus placebo. Highest mean middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler velocities were significantly lower in the simvastatin-treated group (10341 versus 14947; P 0. 01). In addition, vasospasm was significantly reduced (P 0. 05) in the simvastatin-treated group (5 of 19...|$|R
