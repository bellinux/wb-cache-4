25|$|Plasma {{polymerization}} (or {{glow discharge}} polymerization) uses plasma sources {{to generate a}} gas discharge that provides energy to activate or fragment gaseous or liquid monomer, often containing a <b>vinyl</b> <b>group,</b> in order to initiate polymerization. Polymers formed from this technique are generally highly branched and highly cross-linked, and adhere to solid surfaces well. The biggest advantage to this process is that polymers can be directly attached to a desired surface while the chains are growing, which reduces steps necessary for other coating processes such as grafting. This is very useful for pinhole-free coatings of 100 picometers to 1 micrometre thickness with solvent insoluble polymers.|$|E
25|$|Transition metal catalyzed hydrovinylation {{is another}} {{important}} alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself. In general, it involves {{the addition of a}} hydrogen and a <b>vinyl</b> <b>group</b> (or an alkenyl group) across a double bond. The hydrovinylation reaction was first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey by using rhodium and ruthenium salts, other metal catalysts commonly employed nowadays included iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium. The addition can be done highly regio- and stereoselectively, the choices of metal centers, ligands, substrates and counterions often play very important role. Recent studies showed that the use of N-heterocyclic carbene with Ni can be useful for the selective preparations of functionalized geminal olefins or 1,1-disubstituted alkenes.|$|E

2500|$|Polystyrene {{results when}} styrene {{monomers}} interconnect.

25|$|It {{is worthy}} {{to note that}} due to the {{multiple}} reactive sites of the multivinyl monomers, plenty of unreacted pendent <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> are introduced to linear primary polymer chains. These pendent <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> {{have the potential to}} react with propagating active centres either from their own polymer chain or others. Therefore, both of the intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular crosslinking might occur in this process.|$|R
25|$|In {{a similar}} way to normal ATRP, the {{polymerization}} is started by initiation to produce a free radical, followed by chain propagation and reversible activation/deactivation equilibrium. Unlike the polymerization of single vinyl monomers, for the polymerization of multivinyl monomers, the chain propagation occurs between the active centres {{and one of the}} <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> from the free monomers. Therefore, multiple unreacted pendent <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> are introduced into the linear primary polymer chains, resulting in a high local/spatial vinyl concentration. As the chain grows, the propagating centre reacts with their own pendent <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> to form intramolecular cyclized rings (i.e. intramolecular cyclization). The unique alternating chain propagation/intramolecular cyclization process eventually leads to the single chain cyclized/knotted polymer architecture.|$|R
2500|$|In certain {{situations}} where strong electroosomotic flow toward the cathode is undesirable, the inner {{surface of the}} capillary can be coated with polymers, surfactants, or small molecules to reduce electroosmosis to very low levels, restoring the normal direction of migration (anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode). [...] CE instrumentation typically includes power supplies with reversible polarity, allowing the same instrument {{to be used in}} [...] "normal" [...] mode (with EOF and detection near the cathodic end of the capillary) and [...] "reverse" [...] mode (with EOF suppressed or reversed, and detection near the anodic end of the capillary). [...] One of the most common approaches to suppressing EOF, reported by Stellan Hjertén in 1985, is to create a covalently attached layer of linear polyacrylamide. [...] The silica surface of the capillary is first modified with a silane reagent bearing a polymerizable <b>vinyl</b> <b>group</b> (e.g. 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), followed by introduction of acrylamide monomer and a free radical initiator. [...] The acrylamide is polymerized in situ, forming long linear chains, some of which are covalently attached to the wall-bound silane reagent. [...] Numerous other strategies for covalent modification of capillary surfaces exist. [...] Dynamic or adsorbed coatings (which can include polymers or small molecules) are also common. [...] For example, in capillary sequencing of DNA, the sieving polymer (typically polydimethylacrylamide) suppresses electroosmotic flow to very low levels. [...] A variety of dynamic capillary coating agents are commercially available to modify, suppress, or reverse the direction of electroosmotic flow. [...] Besides modulating electroosmotic flow, capillary wall coatings can also serve the purpose of reducing interactions between [...] "sticky" [...] analytes (such as proteins) and the capillary wall. [...] Such wall-analyte interactions, if severe, manifest as reduced peak efficiency, asymmetric (tailing) peaks, or even complete loss of analyte to the capillary wall.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the morphological, thermal and mechanical changes with increasing crosslink density for two low density polyethylenes (LDPE). A reference LDPE was compared with an LDPE containing a higher number of <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> that was introduced via a copolymerisation with a diene. During crosslinking, two reactions simultaneously occur in the copolymer, i. e. a reaction of the <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> and combination crosslinking. After crosslinking with a low amount of peroxide, {{the majority of the}} crosslinks originate from reacted <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> in the LDPE containing the higher number of <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups,</b> whereas the crosslinks in the reference LDPE originate from combination crosslinking, thus leading to different crosslinked structures for the two polymers. The melt temperature, crystallisation temperature, and degree of crystallinity were measured using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter.

The Differential Scanning Calorimetry results show a decrease in those properties for both materials along with a concurrent change in the morphology when the crosslink density increased.

Conversion of monomer and pendant <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> was measured {{as a function}} of the reaction time up to the onset of macrogelation. Experimental results indicate that 80 % of pendant <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> are consumed by cyclization reactions.

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{synthesis}} routes {{have been}} implemented to prepare macroporous monoliths with <b>vinyl</b> pendant <b>groups</b> and micrometric skeletons and through-pore sizes. A standard process combining the synthesis of a widely used (methyl-trimethoxysilane/tetramethoxysilane) (MTMS/TMOS) hybrid silica monolith and the postsilanization with vinyltrimethoxysilane (VTMS) was used as reference material (Vgr-MTMS). An alternative "one-pot" procedure was used to obtain vinylized hybrid monoliths. Two VTMS/TMOS hybrid based monoliths were successfully prepared starting from 20 % (w) and 80 % (w/w) of VTMS, respectively, called 20 -VTMS and 80 -VTMS. Monoliths were characterized by SEM, nitrogen-adsorption isotherm, and Si- 29 MAS NMR spectroscopy. One-pot synthesis allowed to obtain higher vinyl contents (15. 9 and 61. 5 mol % of Si atoms bonded to <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> respectively for 20 -VTMS and 80 -VTMS) than for the postgrafted one (7. 1 %). Accessibility of <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> {{was determined by the}} extent of bromination reactions followed by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. Bromination with reaction yields were higher than 80 % for all materials (80 %, 85 %, and 100 % for 80 -VTMS, 20 -VTMS, and Vgr-MTMS respectively), with no diffusion issues The chemical reactivity of the pendant <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> was investigated through radical-mediated thiol-ene reaction and radical-initiated bisulfite addition. Reaction yields for the two VTMS hybrid monoliths were quite lower (4 - 6 %) than those obtained (about 50 %) for the Vgr-MTMS monolith. The difference in reactivity was attributed to the steric hindrance of the vinyl moieties at the surface of hybrid materials. However, the lower reactivity of <b>vinyl</b> <b>groups</b> is compensated by their considerably higher surface density. Thus, hybrid monoliths are advantageous over their grafted counterparts, due to their higher hydrolytic stability and to the greater simplicity of the one-pot process.
