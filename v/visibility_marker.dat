40|$|Optical {{tracking}} {{with its}} high accuracy {{is widely used}} to determine the position and orientation of a surgical instrument in image-guided surgery (IGS). During tracking, optical markers are detected and identified by the optical tracking system. Due to individual geometric arrangement of the markers and design of the tracker body, there may be unexpected visibility reduction within the required visible range. This is mostly caused by coverage or overlapping through tracker's own geometry. This paper is concerned with a generic modeling of the <b>visibility</b> of <b>markers</b> and simulation of tracker visibility in a defined angle range. The visibilities of two trackers are analyzed with simulation and experimental measurement. The results show {{that it is possible to}} predict the visibility range of an arbitrary tracker with arbitrary distribution of optical markers.

5000|$|In cave (and {{occasionally}} wreck) diving, line markers {{are used}} for orientation as a visual and tactile reference on a permanent guideline. Directional markers (commonly arrows), are also known as line arrows or Dorff arrows, and point the way to an exit. Line arrows may mark {{the location of a}} [...] "jump" [...] location in a cave when two are placed adjacent to each other. Two adjacent arrows facing away from each other, mark a point in the cave where the diver is equidistant from two exits. Arrow direction can be identified by feel in low <b>visibility.</b> Non-directional <b>markers</b> ("cookies") are purely personal markers that mark specific spots, or the direction of one's chosen exit at line intersections where there are options. Their shape does not provide a tactile indication of direction as this could cause confusion in low visibility. One important reason to be adequately trained before cave diving is that incorrect marking can confuse and fatally endanger not only oneself, but also other divers.|$|R
40|$|The system {{technology}} and process development for decreasing the achievable structure sizes (track geometry) for the micro laser cladding process with powder as additive material is presented. The main focus during the system technology development {{lies on the}} components powder feeder, powder distributor, transport tubes and powder nozzle including the shielding gas system. Aim is to allow the feeding of non flowable powders (powder particle sizes d 50 < 10 µm), to decrease the powder focus diameter of the powder nozzle, to achieve a good protection of the melting pool with shielding gas and to avoid powder agglomeration in the transport tubes. By integrating a brush feeder and using 316 L with d 50 = 4, 7 µm as additive material the realization of single tracks with a track geometry (hES x bES x t) of 25 x 6 x 1 µm 3 is shown. With a coaxial powder nozzle, an outer shielding gas nozzle and the adaptation of the gas flows powder focus diameters between 200 and 240 µm can be realized. During the process development of tracks with a width between 25 and 50 µm typical process deviations as overspray are discussed and a systematic approach concerning the topography and dilution of single tracks and layers in dependence of the process parameters is presented. Beside {{the results of the}} basic investigations performed with iron based alloys as additive material results with precious metals (gold and silver) for the manufacturing of contacts on bipolar plates for fuel cells and tantalum for the manufacturing of x-ray markers on stents are presented. By laser cladding of gold contacts with a contact geometry of 60 x 30 µm 2 on bipolar plates (d= 100 mm) of metallic fuel cells the degradation of an assembled fuel cell stack can be reduced by factor 2 and the output power increased by 30 % so that the output power is comparable to conventional bipolar plates made of carbon. For the selective laser cladding with gold as additive material only 1 / 100 of the amount of material is necessary compared with a conventional galvanic coating. By laser dispersing tantalum particles in an area of 1 x 1. 5 mm 2 on nitinol stents with a wall thickness of 200 µm the feasibility of this process is shown for the manufacturing of x-ray <b>visibility</b> <b>markers...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{radiation}} therapy of pancreatic cancer, tumor alignment prior to each treatment fraction is improved when intratumoral gold fiducial markers (from here onwards: markers), which are visible on computed tomography (CT) and cone beam CT, are used. <b>Visibility</b> of these <b>markers</b> on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) might improve image registration between CT and magnetic resonance (MR) images for tumor delineation purposes. However, concomitant image artifacts induced by markers are undesirable. The extent of visibility and artifact size depend on MRI-sequence parameters. The authors' goal was to determine for various markers their potential to be visible and to generate artifacts, using measures that are independent of the MRI-sequence parameters. The authors selected ten different markers suitable for endoscopic placement in the pancreas and placed them into a phantom. The markers varied in diameter (0. 28 - 0. 6 mm), shape, and iron content (0 %- 0. 5 %). For each marker, the authors calculated T 2 (∗) -maps and ΔB 0 -maps using MRI measurements. A decrease in relaxation time T 2 (∗) can cause signal voids, associated with visibility, while {{a change in the}} magnetic field B 0 can cause signal shifts, which are associated with artifacts. These shifts inhibit accurate tumor delineation. As a measure for potential visibility, the authors used the volume of low T 2 (∗), i. e., the volume for which T 2 (∗) differed from the background by > 15 ms. As a measure for potential artifacts, the authors used the volume for which |ΔB 0 | > 9. 4 × 10 (- 8) T (4 Hz). To test whether there is a correlation between visibility and artifact size, the authors calculated the Spearman's correlation coefficient (Rs) between the volume of low T 2 (∗) and the volume of high |ΔB 0 |. The authors compared the maps with images obtained using a clinical MR-sequence. Finally, for the best visible marker as well as the marker that showed the smallest artifact, the authors compared the phantom data with in vivo MR-images in four pancreatic cancer patients. The authors found a strong correlation (Rs = 1. 00, p < 0. 01) between the volume of low T 2 (∗) and the volume with high |ΔB 0 |. Visibility in clinical MR-images increased with lower T 2 (∗). Signal shift artifacts became worse for markers with high |ΔB 0 |. The marker that was best visible in the phantom, a folded marker with 0. 5 % iron content, was also visible in vivo, but showed artifacts on diffusion weighted images. The marker with the smallest artifact in the phantom, a small, stretched, ironless marker, was indiscernible on in vivo MR-images. Changes in T 2 (∗) and ΔB 0 are sequence-independent measures for potential visibility and artifact size, respectively. Improved <b>visibility</b> of <b>markers</b> correlates strongly to signal shift artifacts; therefore, marker choice will depend on the clinical purpose. When <b>visibility</b> of the <b>markers</b> is most important, markers that contain iron are optimal, preferably in a folded configuration. For artifact sensitive imaging, small ironless markers are best, preferably in a stretched configuratio...|$|R
40|$|Can a {{group of}} {{affluent}} whites be considered marginal? This ethnographic study seeks to explore that question through the thoughtful consideration {{of the position of}} {{a group of}} Irish Travelers in a mid-size southern town. If categorization is necessary, how do white-skinned people sparse out distinctions among themselves, especially in a region heavily defined by relations of color. We will explore the primary methods of identifying a Traveler from a non-Traveler in North Augusta, likening the process-and its ensuing creation of essential meaning-to racial classification. Underlying the firsthand processes of identification are important structures of extended kinship shared between members for the same category. For whites, an important kinship bond is invisible privilege. Travelers-though white, skinned and affluent, are nonetheless a marked and visible entity to non-Travelers and are therefore placed outside of the invisible privilege of unmarked whiteness. Traveler <b>visibility</b> (behavioral <b>markers)</b> is experienced by mainstream whites as a rejection of kinship, and that rejection is a basis for the production of difference between the two groups. The particulars of the difference are given distinct form and undeniable truth through storytelling and representation. The resulting certitude is used to legitimate past and present actions of discrimination. Therefore, less visible forms of marginality should be considered to include those that may have faded, been circumvented, or inhabit discursive environments. Honors thesi...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT | The aims of {{this study}} were to {{describe}} the method used for the kinematic analysis of kicking movements in infants and test its feasibility of use, us-ing the Dvideow system. To adjust the method, four in-fants were longitudinally videotaped at ages from one to six months in the supine position. The experiment lasted two minutes, divided into two conditions: train-ing and observation. The Dvideow system 6. 3 for image analysis was used. It was verified that the use of four video cameras was more appropriate for the <b>visibility</b> of two <b>markers</b> simultaneously, allowing 3 D reconstruc-tion of motion. Moreover, 6 plumb lines were used to calibrate the system and ensure an accuracy of 2 mm.

40|$|Purpose : In this study, {{we present}} the {{clinical}} {{implementation of a}} novel transoral balloon centering esophageal applicator (BCEA) and the initial clinical experience in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment of esophageal cancer, using this applicator. Material and methods: Acceptance testing and commissioning of the BCEA were performed prior to clinical use. Full performance testing was conducted including measurements of the dimensions and the catheter diameter, evaluation of the inflatable balloon consistency, visibility of the radio-opaque markers, congruence of the markers, absolute and relative accuracy of the HDR source in the applicator using the radiochromic film and source position simulator, visibility and digitization of the applicator on the computed tomography (CT) images under the clinical conditions, and reproducibility of the offset. Clinical placement of the applicator, treatment planning, treatment delivery, and patient’s response to the treatment were elaborated as well. Results : The experiments showed sub-millimeter accuracy in the source positioning with distal position at 1270 mm. The digitization (catheter reconstruction) was uncomplicated due to the good <b>visibility</b> of <b>markers.</b> The treatment planning resulted in a favorable dose distribution. This finding was pronounced {{for the treatment of}} the curvy anatomy of the lesion due to the improved repeatability and consistency of the delivered fractional dose to the patient, since the radioactive source was placed centrally within the lumen with respect to the clinical target due to the five inflatable balloons. Conclusions : The consistency of the BCEA positioning resulted in the possibility to deliver optimized non-uniform dose along the catheter, which resulted in an increase of the dose to the cancerous tissue and lower doses to healthy tissue. A larger number of patients and long-term follow-up will be required to investigate if the delivered optimized treatment can lead to improved clinical outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} feasibility of percutaneous transluminal aortic stenting and cava filter placement under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance exclusively using a polyetheretherketone (PEEK) -based MRI-compatible guidewire. Percutaneous transluminal aortic stenting and cava filter placement were performed in 3 domestic swine. Procedures were performed under MRI-guidance in an open-bore 1. 5 -T scanner. The applied 0. 035 -inch guidewire has a PEEK core reinforced by fibres, floppy tip, hydrophilic coating, and paramagnetic markings for passive visualization. Through an 11 F sheath, the guidewire was advanced into the abdominal (swine 1) or thoracic aorta (swine 2), and the stents were deployed. The guidewire was advanced into the inferior vena cava (swine 3), and the cava filter was deployed. Postmortem autopsy was performed. Procedural success, guidewire visibility, pushability, and stent support were qualitatively assessed by consensus. Procedure times were documented. Guidewire guidance into the abdominal and thoracic aortas and the inferior vena cava was successful. Stent deployments were successful in the abdominal (swine 1) and thoracic (swine 2) segments of the descending aorta. Cava filter positioning and deployment was successful.

40|$|AbstractPurposeIn high {{precision}} photon radiotherapy and in hadrontherapy, {{it is crucial}} to minimize the occurrence of geometrical deviations with respect to the treatment plan in each treatment session. To this end, point-based infrared (IR) optical tracking for patient set-up quality assessment is performed. Such tracking depends on external fiducial points placement. The main purpose of our work is to propose a new algorithm based on simulated annealing and augmented Lagrangian pattern search (SAPS), which is able to take into account prior knowledge, such as spatial constraints, during the optimization process. Material and methodsThe SAPS algorithm was tested on data related to head and neck and pelvic cancer patients, and that were fitted with external surface markers for IR optical tracking applied for patient set-up preliminary correction. The integrated algorithm was tested considering optimality measures obtained with Computed Tomography (CT) images (i. e. the ratio between the so-called target registration error and fiducial registration error, TRE/FRE) and assessing the marker spatial distribution. Comparison has been performed with randomly selected marker configuration and with the GETS algorithm (Genetic Evolutionary Taboo Search), also taking into account the presence of organs at risk. ResultsThe results obtained with SAPS highlight improvements with respect to the other approaches: (i) TRE/FRE ratio decreases; (ii) marker distribution satisfies both <b>marker</b> <b>visibility</b> and spatial constraints. We have also investigated how the TRE/FRE ratio is influenced by the number of markers, obtaining significant TRE/FRE reduction with respect to the random configurations, when a high number of markers is used. ConclusionsThe SAPS algorithm is a valuable strategy for fiducial configuration optimization in IR optical tracking applied for patient set-up error detection and correction in radiation therapy, showing that taking into account prior knowledge is valuable in this optimization process. Further work will be focused on the computational optimization of the SAPS algorithm toward fast point-of-care applications...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{of interest}} to visualize microscopic esophageal tumor extensions to improve tumor delineation for radiation therapy (RT) planning. Fiducial marker placement is a common method to ensure target localization during planning and treatment. Visualization of these fiducial markers on OCT permits integrating OCT and computed tomography (CT) images used for RT planning via image registration. We studied the visibility of 13 (eight types) commercially available solid and liquid fiducial markers in OCT images at different depths using dedicated esophageal phantoms and evaluated marker placement depth in clinical practice. We designed and fabricated dedicated esophageal phantoms, in which three layers mimic the anatomical wall structures of a healthy human esophagus. We successfully implanted 13 commercially available fiducial markers that varied in diameter and material property at depths between 0. 5 and 3. 0 mm. The resulting esophageal phantoms were imaged with OCT, and <b>marker</b> <b>visibility</b> was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using the contrast-to-background-noise ratio (CNR). The CNR {{was defined as the}} difference between the mean intensity of the fiducial markers and the mean intensity of the background divided by the standard deviation of the background intensity. To determine whether, in current clinical practice, the implanted fiducial markers are within the OCT visualization range (up to 3. 0 mm depth), we retrospectively measured the distance of 19 fiducial markers to the esophageal lumen on CT scans of 16 esophageal cancer patients. In the esophageal phantoms, all the included fiducial markers were visible on OCT at all investigated depths. Solid fiducial markers were better visible on OCT than liquid fiducial markers with a 1. 74 -fold higher CNR. Although fiducial marker identification per type and size was slightly easier for superficially implanted fiducial markers, we observed no difference in the ability of OCT to visualize the markers over the investigated depth range. Retrospective distance measurements of 19 fiducial markers on the CT scan of esophageal cancer patients showed that 84 % (distance from the closest border of the marker to the lumen) and 53 % (distance {{from the center of the}} marker to the lumen) of the fiducial markers were located within the OCT visualization range of up to 3. 0 mm. We studied the visibility of eight types of commercially available fiducial markers at different depths on OCT using dedicated esophageal phantoms. All tested fiducial markers were visible at depths ≤ 3. 0 mm and most, but not all, clinically implanted markers were at a depth accessible to OCT. Consequently, the use of fiducial markers as a reference for OCT to CT registration is feasibl...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the use of an experimental complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensor (APS) for tracking of moving fiducial markers during radiotherapy. Methods: The APS has an active area of 5. 4 5. 4 cm and maximum full frame read-out rate of 20 frame s - 1, with the option to read out a region-of-interest (ROI) at an increased rate. It was coupled to a 4 mm thick ZnWO 4 scintillator which provided a quantum efficiency (QE) of 8 for a 6 MV x-ray treatment beam. The APS was compared with a standard iViewGT flat panel amorphous Silicon (a-Si) electronic portal imaging device (EPID), with a QE of 0. 34 and a frame-rate of 2. 5 frame s - 1. To investigate the ability of the two systems to image markers, four gold cylinders of length 8 mm and diameter 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 6, and 2 mm were placed on a motion-platform. Images of the stationary markers were acquired using the APS at a frame-rate of 20 frame s - 1, and a dose-rate of 143 MU min - 1 to avoid saturation. EPID images were acquired at the maximum frame-rate of 2. 5 frame s - 1, and a reduced dose-rate of 19 MU min - 1 to provide a similar dose per frame to the APS. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the background signal and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the marker signal relative to the background were evaluated for both imagers at doses of 0. 125 to 2 MU. Results: Image quality and <b>marker</b> <b>visibility</b> was found to be greater in the APS with SNR â�¼ 5 times greater than in the EPID and CNR up to an order of magnitude greater for all four markers. To investigate the ability to image and track moving markers the motion-platform was moved to simulate a breathing cycle with period 6 s, amplitude 20 mm and maximum speed 13. 2 mm s - 1. At the minimum integration time of 50 ms a tracking algorithm applied to the APS data found all four markers with a success rate of 92 and positional error 90 m. At an integration time of 400 ms the smallest marker became difficult to detect when moving. The detection of moving markers using the a-Si EPID was difficult even at the maximum dose-rate of 592 MU min - 1 due to the lower QE and longer integration time of 400 ms. Conclusions: This work demonstrates that a fast read-out, high QE APS may be useful in the tracking of moving fiducial markers during radiotherapy. Further study is required to investigate the tracking of markers moving in 3 D in a treatment beam attenuated by moving patient anatomy. This will require a larger sensor with ROI read-out to maintain speed and a manageable data-rate. Â© 2011 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
