5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the <b>visualisation</b> of a white light.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter {{examines}} the community's {{conceptions of the}} otherworld, explaining how they approach it through acts of <b>visualisation</b> and altered states of consciousness and their understandings {{of it as a}} realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination. Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic, Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens, instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world.|$|E
40|$|Scientific <b>visualisations</b> such as {{computer-based}} animations and simulations {{are increasingly}} {{a feature of}} high school science instruction. <b>Visualisations</b> are adopted enthusiastically by teachers and embraced by students, and there is good evidence that they are popular and well received. There is limited evidence, however, of how effective they are in enabling students to learn key scientific concepts. This paper reports {{the results of a}} quantitative study conducted in Australian chemistry classrooms. The <b>visualisations</b> chosen were from free online sources, intended to model the ways in which classroom teachers use <b>visualisations,</b> but were found to have serious flaws for conceptual learning. There were also challenges in the degree of interactivity available to students using the <b>visualisations.</b> Within these limitations, no significant difference was found for teaching with and without these <b>visualisations.</b> Further study using better designed <b>visualisations</b> and with explicit attention to the pedagogy surrounding the <b>visualisations</b> will be required to gather high quality evidence of the effectiveness of <b>visualisations</b> for conceptual development...|$|R

Interactive computer-based animations and simulations offer new visual resources for chemistry education. Many {{studies have shown that}} students enjoy learning with <b>visualisations</b> but few have explored how learning outcomes compare when teaching with or without <b>visualisations.</b> This study employs a quasi-experimental crossover research design and quantitative methods to measure the educational effectiveness - defined as level of conceptual development on the part of students - of using computer-based scientific <b>visualisations</b> versus teaching without <b>visualisations</b> in teaching chemistry. In addition to finding that teaching with <b>visualisations</b> offered outcomes that were not significantly different from teaching without <b>visualisations,</b> the study also explored differences in outcomes for male and female students, students with different learning styles (visual, aural, kinesthetic) and students of differing levels of academic ability.

5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and <b>visualisation,</b> nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} popularity, dynamic <b>visualisations</b> (e. g. video, animation) seem {{attractive}} educational resources. However, {{in the design}} of any instructional material, not only must the appealing factor be acknowledged, but also the cognitive limitations. To consider the limitations of human cognitive architecture when designing instructional resources has been the leitmotif of cognitive load theory (CLT). CLT research has shown that the transitory nature of dynamic <b>visualisations</b> imposes such a high working memory load that, in many cases, these depictions are no more effective for learning than static <b>visualisations.</b> However, dynamic <b>visualisations</b> {{have been shown to be}} superior to static <b>visualisations</b> when the depiction involves human motor skills, a special case which might be explained by the mirror neuron system (MNS) aiding working memory to cope with transitory information. We will begin this chapter by presenting instructional properties of dynamic <b>visualisations.</b> Next, we will discuss the main differences between dynamic and static <b>visualisations</b> and how each can affect learning. Then, we will describe briefly CLT to give a more detailed account on instructional strategies to improve learning from dynamic <b>visualisations.</b> Next, we will summarise video modelling of motor skills. To end this chapter, we will focus on the MNS and how it aids humans to learn motor skills through observation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} cognitive <b>visualisations</b> as {{a design}} approach {{in which the}} affordances of currently available learning technologies are used to reify or make explicit mental representations about conceptually challenging knowledge. Conceptual <b>visualisations</b> are intended to help learners develop understandings of a domain through dynamic visual representations {{that are based on}} cognitive research into the nature of cognitive frameworks or mental models, in particular, models with the main characteristic of naïve or intuitive ideas and of expert understandings. A rationale for cognitive <b>visualisations</b> is presented, followed by a discussion of two examples of cognitive <b>visualisations</b> in contrasting domains that were developed using different implementing technologies. A set of issues for future research in this area is also considered...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{participants}} {{performed a}} novel spatial inference task, which {{required them to}} imagine and draw the cross section of a three-dimensional (3 -D) object. While performing the task, participants could interactively control two computer <b>visualisations</b> (animations) of the object. There were large individual differences in how frequently participants used the computer <b>visualisations,</b> which were related to spatial ability. Use of the interactive <b>visualisations</b> was highly predictive of performance on the cross-section task and mediated the correlation between spatial ability and performance. These findings suggest that interactive computer <b>visualisations</b> can aid performance on spatial inference tasks, but that they do so only for a subset of individuals who can discover how to best use the additional information that they provide...|$|R

We report our theoretical analysis of the design of our <b>visualisations</b> in the framework defined by the “Big 5 ” theory of team work as well as a qualitative study of the visualizations in relation to the student’s reflective reports. We conclude that these visualizations provide a powerful and valuable mirroring role which has the potential, when well used, to help groups learn how to improve their effectiveness. ...|$|R
