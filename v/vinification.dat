2500|$|Before the 1950s, the {{traditional}} European wine {{was made in}} small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough {{to interfere with the}} fermentation but this method of <b>vinification</b> gave wine structure and roundness but was not aromatic. In California and Australia the need to cool the grapes and wine during fermentation led winemakers to equip their cellars with adequate equipment: refrigeration units, circuits of pipes to carry the liquid refrigerant, and vats temperature-regulated by coils in the walls of the vessel or flag (a thin welded coil shaped like a flat plate with a high heat exchange capability).

Results showed that cover cropping decreased the concentration of flavonoids, whereas bilateral cordon training led to an increase of flavonoids and total polyphenols. Among technologies applied, the cryomaceration led to enrichment in anthocyanins and to impoverishment in total polyphenols, whereas ultrasound treatment improved the extraction of all phenol classes.

Isolated yeasts were grouped using PCR-DGGE and identified by partial sequencing of 26 S rRNA gene.
