5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon.

5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular <b>venous</b> <b>pressure.</b> Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular <b>venous</b> <b>pressure,</b> a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E

A correct estimation of volume status and so-called dry weight in dialysis patients remains a difficult clinical problem. Clinical status and chest X-ray are not sensitive enough, while invasively meas-ured central <b>venous</b> <b>pressures</b> are not routinely avail-able. Recently, the sonographic {{determination of the}} diameter and collapse of the inferior vena cava (IVC) has been proposed as a noninvasive method for estim-ating intravascular volume.

Seventy-three patients had elevated <b>venous</b> dialysis <b>pressures</b> and 58 agreed to undergo elective venography (fistulogram). Fifty of 58 patients studied (86 %) had significant venous stenoses. A combination of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and surgical revision were used to electively treat these stenoses. Early detection and treatment of these stenoses decreased fistula thrombosis and fistula replacement threefold compared with our earlier experiences. Patients with elevated <b>venous</b> dialysis <b>pressure</b> who were venogramed and treated had an occurrence of fistula thrombosis similar to patients with normal dialysis pressure (0. 15 and 0. 13 episodes per patient year of dialysis respectively, P = NS). In contrast patients with elevated <b>venous</b> dialysis <b>pressure</b> who refused elective fistulogram and treatment averaged 1. 4 episodes of thrombosis per patient year of dialysis (P < 0. 001 compared to both other groups).

The thrombus accretion above the knee, the <b>venous</b> <b>pressures</b> of the affected leg, the clinical symptomatology, and some laboratory coagulative tests were monitored throughout the administration period. Local tolerability of the two treatments was also evaluated. The two applied treatments evidenced a net antithrombotic activity, preventing thrombus accretion above the knee, improving with the same efficacy the <b>venous</b> <b>pressures</b> in the affected legs, and similarly reducing clinical symptoms, with a quick and statistically significant trend toward normalization. Blood fibrinogen was significantly lowered by both drugs, while only Ca-heparin yielded a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time.

25|$|Other {{advantages}} are {{that because it}} empties near the heart, medications can also be quickly distributed {{to the rest of}} the body. As there is room for multiple parallel compartments (lumen) within the catheter, so that multiple medications can be delivered at once even if they would not be chemically compatible within a single tube. Caregivers can also measure central <b>venous</b> <b>pressure</b> and other physiological variables through the line. It is commonly believed that fluid can be pushed faster through a central venous catheter but as they are often divided into multiple lumens then the internal diameter is less than that of a large-bore peripheral cannula. They are also longer, which as reflected in Poiseuille's law, requires higher pressure to achieve the same flow, all other variables being equal.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central <b>venous</b> <b>pressure,</b> pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
40|$|Next to {{severely}} decreased pump flow, hypovolemia in extracorporeal {{life support}} (ELS) {{can result in}} subatmospheric <b>venous</b> line <b>pressure.</b> Such pressure may lead to degassing and resultant gaseous microemboli (GME), with potential changes in neurological clinical outcome. CME activity resulting from degassing was investigated in relation to subatmospheric <b>venous</b> line <b>pressure,</b> partial oxygen pressure (pO), and hematocrit in {{a model of a}} centrifugal pump-based circuit for long-term ELS. Additionally, a device that provides instantaneous volume buffer capacity during hypovolemia was evaluated in relation to GME appearance. An exponential relationship was found between decreasing <b>venous</b> line <b>pressure</b> and GME downstream of the centrifugal pump (P = 0. 001). Arterial bubble activity appeared at subatmospheric <b>venous</b> line <b>pressures</b> of - 200 mm Hg and less. A rising (pO) increased formation of GME (P = 0. 05). A rise in hematocrit, in contrast, did not affect embolic activity (P = 0. 22). With simulated hypovolemia, volume buffer capacity added to the venous line dampened fluctuations of <b>venous</b> line <b>pressure</b> by approximately 40 %, but a significant reduction in GME formation could not be found (P = 0. 22). Moreover, the device enabled a 14 % higher support flow. With ELS flow being related to patient volume status, hypovolemia can diminish support. A coherent decrease of <b>venous</b> line <b>pressure</b> triggers degassing of blood-dissolved gases and causes arterial GME, which can become massive during persistent conditions of limited venous return.

We hypothesized that, for each limb segment, an optimal (range of) <b>venous</b> cuff <b>pressure</b> can be determined.

Arterial inflows were similar at cuff pressures between 30 and 60 mmHg for the forearm, leg, and calf. Arterial inflow in the forearm was significantly lower at 10 mmHg compared with the other cuff pressures. In addition, arterial inflows at 20 mmHg tended to be lower in each limb segment than flow at higher cuff pressures. In conclusion, no single optimum <b>venous</b> cuff <b>pressure,</b> at which a highest arterial inflow is achieved, exists, but rather a range of optimum cuff pressures leading to a similar arterial inflow. <b>Venous</b> cuff <b>pressures</b> ranging from 30 mmHg up to diastolic blood pressure are recommended to measure arterial inflow by VOP...|$|R
