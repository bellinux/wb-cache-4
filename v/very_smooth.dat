5|$|Many {{plants have}} {{external}} structural defenses that discourage herbivory. Depending on the herbivore’s physical characteristics (i.e. size and defensive armor), plant structural defenses on stems and leaves can deter, injure, or kill the grazer. Some defensive compounds are produced internally but are released onto the plant’s surface; for example, resins, lignins, silica, and wax cover the epidermis of terrestrial plants and alter {{the texture of}} the plant tissue. The leaves of holly plants, for instance, are <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> and slippery making feeding difficult. Some plants produce gummosis or sap that traps insects.|$|E

The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance.

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E
25|$|Materials of {{the smooth}} plains and <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains are also {{concentrated}} {{mainly in the}} eastern part of the map area. The smooth plains unit has a lower density of small craters than does intermediate plains material and a somewhat hummocky surface with scattered small hills and knobs. The hummocks within fresh c5 craters may be mantled floor materials or incipient peak rings (see, for example, crater Callicrates at lat 66° S., long 32°; FDS 27402). The <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains unit has virtually no visible small craters and displays smoother planar surfaces than those of the smooth plains unit. It occurs in the lowest areas within smooth plains material (including areas within buried crater depressions) and commonly within older craters. The areas of greatest concentration of smooth and <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains materials also contain the most ridges, which suggests that ridges and the younger plains units are genetically related. <b>Very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains material for instance, commonly lies at the base of ridges or scarps. It occurs as small patches within the smooth plains unit that fills the crater Pushkin. Smooth plains material embays the ejecta blanket of a c3 crater on Pushkin’s rim at lat 66° S, long 28° (FDS 27402) and fills the interior and part of the outer-ring area of Bach. The distribution of these two youngest plains units may indicate that the smooth plains material as mapped is nothing more than a thin, discontinuous layer of <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains material that mantles the older units. In this respect, it is similar to the lunar Cayley Formation, which is probably basin ejecta. However, unlike plains material of the lunar uplands, no source basin is evident for the mercurian smooth and <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains units within the imaged part of the Bach region. Although such a source basin may lie within the part not imaged, intervening areas do not contain smooth or <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains materials. For these reasons we tentatively ascribe a volcanic origin to most of the smooth and <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains material. The ridges appear to be of volcano-tectonic origin; the fracturing may have provided the means by which lavas reached the surface to form these younger plains units. Some <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> and smooth plains materials that form the floors of c5 and c4 craters may be impact melt.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the time}} of {{formation}} of c5 craters and <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains material has, for the most part, been tectonically quiescent. During this period, {{with the exception of}} a scattering of extremely fresh craters and some minor mass wasting (Malin and Dzurisin, 1977), almost no geologic activity has occurred near the mercurian south pole. The youngest smooth plains and the <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> plains materials that occur within c5 craters may be impact melts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let C be a <b>very</b> generic <b>smooth</b> {{curve of}} degree d {{in the complex}} {{projective}} plane. In this paper, we show that for any curve D in the projective plane that does not contain C, the set C D contains at least d 2 distinct points. Moreover, this bound is sharp when d 3. Our motivation {{for the study of}} this problem comes from the problem of hyperbolicity of the complement of a plane curve. As an application of our result, we give another proof of the following fact: if C is a <b>very</b> generic <b>smooth</b> curve of degree d 5 in the complex projective plane, then the intersection of the complement of C in the projective plane with any plane curve D which does not contain C is hyperbolic. Let C be a generic smooth curve of degree d in the complex projective plane P 2. We are interested in the following question: if D P 2 is a curve with C 6 D, what is the least number of points that D C must contain? In this paper, we give a complete answer to this problem. THEOREM 1. If C is a <b>very</b> generic <b>smooth</b> curve of degree d in the complex projective plane P 2, then for any curve D P 2 with C 6 D, the set C contains at least d 2 distinct points. Moreover, this bound is sharp when d 3. Her...|$|R

25|$|Contrary to {{the theory}} of {{programmed}} death by ageing, individuals from a single species usually live much longer in a protected (laboratory, domestic, civilized) environment than in their wild (natural) environment, reaching ages that would be otherwise practically impossible. Also, in majority of species, there doesn't exist any critical age after which death rates change dramatically, as intended by the programmed death by ageing, but the age-dependence of death rates is <b>very</b> <b>smooth</b> and monotonic. However, as mentioned above, V.P. Skulachev explained that a process of gradual ageing has the advantage of facilitating selection for useful traits by allowing old individuals with a useful trait to live longer. It is also easy to imagine that animals with gradual ageing will live longer in a protected environment.|$|E

For very affine varieties satisfying a genericity condition at infinity, the result is further strengthened to relate the variety of critical points to the Chern– Schwartz–MacPherson class.
