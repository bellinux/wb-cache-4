5|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{recording}} at his house. I'd come by in the morning and Stuart would answer the door in his stocking feet– as he'd been up all night. I'd bring him {{a cup of coffee and}} say, 'Stuart, your house is a mess, there's no food in the cupboard.' Then I'd call someone from my house to bring food over for him. And then we'd work all day. We're <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> odd couple.|$|E
5|$|A further £8,000, {{raised with}} the help of the society's members, was set aside for the {{construction}} and stocking of the park. Initially the zoo occupied only the southernmost , while the land to the north was used as a golf course. The park was designed by town planner Patrick Geddes and his son-in-law Frank Mears. Following Gillespie's vision, they modeled the park after the open designs of zoos like the New York Zoological Park and Hagenbeck's zoo in Hamburg. These modern zoological parks promoted a more spacious and natural environment for the animals, and stood in stark contrast to the steel cages typical of the menageries built during the Victorian era. The Scottish National Zoological Park, as it was initially called, opened to the public with a large collection of donated and borrowed animals on 22 July 1913, after only 15 weeks of work. The zoo still occupies <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same area of land today, though the park is being extensively redeveloped.|$|E

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> exception.|$|E
5|$|As {{few other}} {{persons in the}} Confederate {{government}} were interested in naval matters, Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department, {{as well as the}} navy it controlled, according to his own views. The result was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> product of his prior experience. The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices, equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy; whereas the U.S. Navy had five bureaus, the Confederate Navy had only four: Orders and Detail (dealing with personnel), Provisions and Clothing, Medicine and Surgery, and Ordnance and Hydrography. Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair, its function was met by John L. Porter. Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor, without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863, and thereafter with title {{until the end of the}} war. A few other functions lay outside the bureau system: a small Marine Corps, a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory, and a Torpedo Bureau.|$|E

The music was also remastered but {{the rhythm of}} the main theme remained <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same, and the lyrics were given only minor alterations due to the introduction of new characters.|$|E
25|$|Labour ran a slick campaign, which {{emphasised}} the splits {{within the}} Conservative government, {{and argued that}} the country needed a more centrist administration. Labour ran a centrist campaign that was good at picking up dissatisfied Tory voters, particularly moderate and suburban ones. Tony Blair, highly popular, was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> centrepiece of the campaign, and proved a highly effective campaigner.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, 1,000 leading American {{scientists}} were randomly chosen from American Men of Science and 41.8% believed God existed, 41.5% disbelieved, and 16.7% had doubts/did not know; however when {{the study was}} replicated 80 years later using American Men and Women of Science in 1996, results were <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same with 39.3% believing God exists, 45.3% disbelieved, and 14.5% had doubts/did not know.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{the kingdom}} of Judah, the tribe of Judah survived the {{destruction}} of Israel by the Assyrians, and instead was subjected to the Babylonian captivity; when the captivity ended, the distinction between the tribes were lost in favour of a common identity. Since Simeon and Benjamin had been <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> junior partners in the Kingdom of Judah, it was Judah that gave its name to the identity—that of the Jews.|$|E

25|$|While the German {{policy towards}} Jews was {{ruthless}} and criminal, their policy towards Christian Poles who helped Jews was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same. The Germans would often murder non-Jewish Poles for small misdemeanors. Execution for help rendered to Jews, {{even the most}} basic kinds, was automatic. In any apartment block or area where Jews were found to be harboured, everybody in the house would be immediately shot by the Germans. For this thousands of non-Jewish Poles were executed.|$|E

25|$|The Glazert burn, {{previously}} Glazart or Glassert has otters and {{the rare}} freshwater mussel (source of freshwater pearls). The name {{may come from}} the celtic, glas in Gaelic meaning grey or green and dur meaning water. It is recorded by Dobie in 1876 as being a favourite resort of fishermen and this is still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> case today (2006). Another River Glazert, runs through a considerable part of the parish of Campsie, emptying itself into the Kelvin, opposite the town of Kirkintilloch.|$|E
25|$|Cheng Yu {{researched}} the old Tang Dynasty five-stringed pipa {{in the early}} 2000s and developed a modern version of it for contemporary use. It is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> same as the modern pipa in construction save for being a bit wider {{to allow for the}} extra string and the reintroduction of the soundholes at the front. It has not caught on in China but in Korea (where she also did some of her research at) the bipa was revived since then and the current versions are based on Chinese pipa, including one with five-strings.|$|E
25|$|As {{the first}} High Court, the court under Chief Justice Sir Samuel Griffith had to {{establish}} its {{position as a}} new court of appeal {{for the whole of}} Australia and had to develop a new body of principle for interpreting the Constitution of Australia and federal legislation. Griffith himself was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> dominant influence on the court in its early years, but after the appointment of Sir Isaac Isaacs and H. B. Higgins in 1906, and the death of foundation Justice Richard O'Connor, Griffith's influence began to decline.|$|E
