40|$|International audienceObjective. Mental {{workload}} {{is frequently}} estimated by EEG-based mental state monitoring systems. Usually, these systems use spectral markers and event-related potentials (ERPs). To our knowledge, no study has directly compared their performance for mental workload assessment, nor evaluated the {{stability in time}} of these markers and {{of the performance of}} the associated mental workload estimators. This study proposes a comparison of two processing chains, one based on the power in five frequency bands, and one based on ERPs, both including a spatial filtering step (respectively CSP and CCA), an FLDA classification and a 10 -fold cross-validation. Approach. To get closer to a real life implementation, spectral markers were extracted from a short window (i. e. towards reactive systems) that did not include any motor activity and the analyzed ERPs were elicited by a task-independent probe that required a reflex-like answer (i. e. close to the ones required by dead man's <b>vigilance</b> <b>devices).</b> The data were acquired from 20 participants who performed a Sternberg memory task for 90 min (i. e. 2 / 6 digits to memorize) inside which a simple detection task was inserted.

Both chains performed significantly better than random; however the one based on the spectral markers had a low performance (60 %) and was not stable in time. Conversely, the ERP-based chain gave very high results (91 %) and was stable in time. Significance.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the impact of: (1) four Levels Of Automation (LOAs) on driver vigilance, (2) two <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> types on driver mental workload, at two LOAs, and (3) two <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> types on driver vigilance, at two LOAs. In experiment 1, student participants drove a train simulator with one of four levels of automation: manual (nil), in-cab signalling (low), ATP (medium), and an autopilot (high). Results revealed that driver vigilance was negatively impacted by train automation, but only {{at a high level}} (i. e., an autopilot). This finding was interpreted as relating to driver mental workload. That is, a high LOA may have resulted in drivers being mentally underloaded. This interpretation required empirical validation in the following two experiments. In experiment 2, the task demands of participants in two high LOA groups (suspected of being mentally underloaded) were increased to one of two levels by means of a secondary task. Participants in two low LOA groups had the same treatments, and served as comparison groups. The secondary task was either a sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> (low additional task demands) or a cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> (high additional task demands). Results revealed that autopilot supervisor (high LOA) participants were indeed underloaded, even with the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> secondary task. However, autopilot supervisor participants with the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> secondary task were not underloaded. On the other hand, the in-cab signalling (low LOA) group of participants appeared to be overloaded when concurrently operating the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device,</b> but not when operating the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device.</b> In experiment 3, the negative impact of a high LOA on driver vigilance was predicted to be counteracted by the additional (high) task demands of the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device,</b> but not the additional (low) task demands of the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device.</b> This prediction was supported by the results in terms of the cognitive <b>vigilance</b> <b>device.</b> However, the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device</b> also counteracted the negative impact of a high LOA. An explanation for this was in terms of a startling effect of the sensory <b>vigilance</b> <b>device,</b> rather than it being due to increased task demands.

In this paper, the designs of two follow-up experiments are described. The aim of experiment 2 {{is to determine the}} effects of increasing task demands for train autopilot supervisors, beyond that of the same group in experiment 1, on mental workload. The aim of experiment 3 is to compare two strategies that attempt to counteract the negative effects of high LOAs on driver vigilance.

A DMVD monitors the activity of the operator driving a train to detect his/her possible incapacitation while the vehicle is traveling. The system relies on a redundant and diverse FPGA-based architecture (without using micro-controllers, soft-cores or other software programmable components) to assure good flexibility and to avoid complex and expensive validation and verification activities of software modules, as typically required in safety-oriented applications. The first tests conducted on a prototype confirm that the system behaves correctly both in normal operating conditions and in the presence of single faults.

40|$|Objective. Covert {{aspects of}} ongoing user mental states provide key context {{information}} for user-aware human computer interactions. In this paper, {{we focus on}} the problem of estimating the vigilance of users using EEG and EOG signals. Approach. To improve the feasibility and wearability of <b>vigilance</b> estimation <b>devices</b> for real-world applications, we adopt a novel electrode placement for forehead EOG and extract various eye movement features, which contain the principal information of traditional EOG. We explore the effects of EEG from different brain areas and combine EEG and forehead EOG to leverage their complementary characteristics for vigilance estimation. Considering that the vigilance of users is a dynamic changing process because the intrinsic mental states of users involve temporal evolution, we introduce continuous conditional neural field and continuous conditional random field models to capture dynamic temporal dependency. Main results. We propose a multimodal approach to estimating vigilance by combining EEG and forehead EOG and incorporating the temporal dependency of vigilance into model training. The experimental results demonstrate that modality fusion can improve the performance compared with a single modality, EOG and EEG contain complementary information for vigilance estimation, and the temporal dependency-based models can enhance the performance of vigilance estimation. From the experimental results, we observe that theta and alpha frequency activities are increased, while gamma frequency activities are decreased in drowsy states in contrast to awake states. Significance. The forehead setup allows for the simultaneous collection of EEG and EOG and achieves comparative performance using only four shared electrodes in comparison with the temporal and posterior sites.

40|$|Abstract—Modern mobile devices {{come with}} an array of sen-sors that support many {{interesting}} applications. However, sensors have different sampling costs (e. g., battery drain) and benefits (e. g., accuracy) under different circumstances. In this work we investigate the trade-off between the cost of using a sensor and the benefit gained from its use, with application to data-driven authentication on mobile devices. Current authentication practice, where user behaviour is first learned from the sensor data and then used to detect anomalies, typically assumes a fixed sampling rate and does not consider the battery consumption and usefulness of sensors. In this work we study how battery consumption and sensor effectiveness (e. g., for detecting attacks) vary when using different sensors and different sensor sampling rates. We use data from both controlled lab studies, as well as field trials, for our experiments. We also propose an adaptive sampling technique that adjusts the sampling rate based on an expected <b>device</b> <b>vigilance</b> level.

40|$|Introduction The {{lack of a}} {{terminology}} {{to compare}} medical devices together with the arbitrary and opaque nature of product registration systems are major obstacles to a more informed decision process regarding the use and acquisition of new medical devices. This paper describes the systematization of information {{to help in the}} identification of similar cardiovascular implantable devices. Methods The systematization was developed in four stages: definition of the technical attributes of each device group; classification of a sample of devices; implementation of the proposed systematization in Prot&# 233;g&# 233;; and evaluation of the application. The systematization dealt with a set of common attributes &# 8211; indication of use, anatomic location, manufacturer, device model and lifetime; and a set of attributes specific for each type of device. Results The systematization was performed by means of a hierarchy of classes with the respective properties in Prot&# 233;g&# 233;, which support three basic functions: data entry, query, and maintenance. 38 queries were designed to allow the identification of similar devices according to their technical characteristics. The users&# 8217; evaluation showed that the application fulfilled the requirements to monitor the price of these devices on the market. Conclusions Prot&# 233;g&# 233; was a useful tool for the systematization of cardiovascular implantable devices {{that can be used for}} the post-market <b>vigilance</b> of medical <b>device</b> safety.

40|$|Human implant {{technologies}} {{are subject to}} continual innovation and proliferation, raising important issues for technology testing, healthcare sciences, clinical performance and risk assessment, and regulation. The regulatory environment of medical devices is being shaped by harmonisation of standards in the European Union. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the histories and current regulatory environment of two technologies, breast implants and artificial hips, and to consider the implications of this comparison for a sociological healthcare research agenda to investigate the issues raised. The main focus is upon developments in the United Kingdom. Major points of contrast between the two technologies include the institutional contexts in which clinical evidence has been marshalled for government attention; the relative importance of strategic alliances between clinicians and manufacturers in the innovation process; the degree of public controversy evident; the varying definitions of an ‘adverse incident’ within medical <b>device</b> <b>vigilance</b> systems; and in the UK the presence of a national register for breast implants but not for hip implants. Inter-national contrasts in these dimensions are noted. The analysis suggests that improved understanding is required of the institutional, organisational and professional processes involved in implant technology innovation and regulation. A comparative research agenda is proposed, focusing upon: innovativeness and proliferation; safety and technological standards; clinical and social outcomes; and consumer/user information and choice. It is concluded that research in these areas will enhance the ‘evidence-base’ for the evaluation of human implant technologies in the context of their innovatory and regulatory environments...|$|R

To achieve uniformity among the national medical device regulatory systems and increase the access to safe, effective, and clinically beneficial medical technologies, the Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) was conceived in 1992 by five members: European Union, United States, Australia, Japan, and Canada. All regulated countries have clearly defined medical devices, as has the GHTF. Although GHTF has tried to achieve harmonization with respect to medical devices, some differences still exist in the national laws of the countries of GHTF. Further, regulated countries have classified medical devices {{on the basis of}} their associated risk. In the Indian regulatory system, medical devices are still considered as drugs. In 2006, the Medical Device Regulation Bill was recommended to consolidate laws for medical devices and to establish the Medical Device Regulatory Authority of India. In addition, medical devices are not classified by any Indian regulatory authority. Although India has moved towards harmonizing its medical device regulations with those of regulated countries, this study aims to identify whether India should have a vigilance system in harmony with those of GHTF or develop its own system for medical devices.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} system for medicinal products includes {{the existence of}} a legislative framework and a medicines agency as the regulatory body. The legislative framework for medicinal products has been amended several times so as to align it with the EU acquis communautaire, where medicinal products represent one of the best regulated and aligned areas. For the purpose of regulating the Croatian medicines market, the Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices was established in 2003 to implement the procedure of granting marketing authorisation for medicinal products, to supervise the adverse reactions of medicinal products, to conduct laboratory tests of the quality of medicines and vaccines sampled from the market, to issue licences for the manufacture and distribution of medicinal products, to monitor medicine consumption, and to inform about medicines and promote their rational use. Medical devices are regulated under a special act, and the Agency conducts entries into the register in that field and carries out <b>vigilance</b> over medical <b>devices.</b> In this way, products intended for health care on the Croatian market are of the appropriate quality, safety and efficacy, and are under the constant supervision of the competent body that assesses their risk-to-benefit ratio.

Although combined multiple causes of intractable pruritus in these patients have been identified, no existing treatments are proven to be sufficiently effective. We conducted a post-marketing surveillance to follow-up and assess the safety and efficacy of nalfurafine, a selective κ-opioid receptor agonist, for the treatment of intractable pruritus in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients and methods: Hemodialysis patients with intractable pruritus from institutions in Japan who received oral nalfurafine hydrochloride between January 2010 and December 2013 were enrolled in the surveillance. Surveillance was completed in July 2015. Safety data during 1 year after nalfurafine treatment onset, and efficacy data of nalfurafine evaluating the first 12 -week treatment period and the following period until 1 year after the initial dose of nalfurafine (using global assessment of the itch improvement by the physician, Visual Analog Scale, and the Shiratori’s severity scores) were collected and analyzed. Results: In total, 3, 762 patients were analyzed for safety. Adverse drug reactions were experienced by 402 / 3, 762 (10. 69 %) patients. The most frequent adverse drug reactions were insomnia (127 / 3, 762 [3. 38 %] patients), constipation (34 [0. 90 %]), somnolence (32 [0. 85 %]), dizziness (23 [0. 61 %]), nausea (13 [0. 35 %]), and malaise (9 [0. 24 %]). No patients developed dependence on nalfurafine. Nalfurafine was effective in 82. 50 % (2, 880 / 3, 491) of patients during the first 12 weeks and in 84. 95 % (2, 167 / 2, 551) on treatment during the subsequent period until 1 year after nalfurafine treatment initiation. Statistically significant decreases were reported in the Visual Analog Scale and the Shiratori’s severity scores (p< 0. 001).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between technology and caring in technologically intense environments. The overall aim was to uncover the meaning of care in those environments as experienced by patients and caregivers. Moreover, the study aimed at finding a deeper understanding for the almost total dominance of technology in care in intensive care. The thesis includes three empirical studies and one theoretical, philosophical study. The research was guided by a phenomenological and lifeworld theoretical approach. Research data consist of quantitative parameters and qualitative interviews with caregivers and patients. Data was analysed and synthesised with aim of seeking meaning through openness, sensitivity and a reflective attitude. The goal was to reach the general structure of the phenomenon and its meaning constituents. The result shows that an intensive care unit is a cognitive and emotionally complex environment where caregivers are juggling a precarious handful of cards. Despite being constantly monitored and observed, intensive care patients express that they feel invisible. The patient and the apparatus easily meld into a unit, one item to be regulated and read. From the patients’ perspective, caregivers demonstrate keen <b>vigilance</b> over technological <b>devices</b> and measured parameters, but pay scant attention to their stories and experiences. Technology, with its exciting captive lure and challenging character, seduces the caregivers and lulls them into a fictive sense of security and safety. Technical tasks take precedence or have more urgency than caring behaviour. A malaise settles on caregivers as they strive for garnering the security that technology promises. Yet simultaneously, insecurity creeps in as they read the patient’s biological data. Technical tasks take precedence over and seemingly are more urgent than showing care. Listening, inspiring trust, and promoting confidence no longer have high priority. Trying to communicate ‘through’ technology is so complex, that it is a difficult challenge to keep in perspective what or who is the focus; ‘seeing’ or caring. Technology should be like a catalyst; do its ‘thing’ and withdraw ‘unnoticed’. This thesis has contributed in gaining deeper knowledge about care in technologically intense environments and the impact of technology. The main contribution is that caregivers need to be aware that the roar of technology silences the subtle attempts of the critically ill or injured person to give voice to his or her needs. In conclusion, the challenges for caregivers are to distinguish when to heighten the importance of the objective and measurable dimensions provided by technology and when to reduce their importance. In order to magnify the patients’ lived experiences. It is a question of balancing state-of-the-art technology with integrative and comprehensive care, of harmonizing the demands of subjectivity with objective signs...|$|R
