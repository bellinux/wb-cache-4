50|$|In 1935 Volvo updated the taxicabs once more. The cars got {{the larger}} {{capacity}} 3670cc EC engine and a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiator</b> grille.The TR670 Series was superseded by the Volvo PV800 Series in 1937.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 the PV650 Series design looked {{quite old}} fashioned. The body was {{basically}} {{the same as in}} 1929. Still, Volvo updated the cars once more. The new PV658/PV659 got the larger capacity 3670 cc EC engine and a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiator</b> grille.|$|E
50|$|The 30-98s {{used the}} Prince Henry chassis, they were {{distinguished}} by having more-or-less flat rather than <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiators.</b> Laurence Pomeroy took the Prince Henry L-head side-valve engine, bored it out 3 mm, then cold-stretched the crankshaft throws 5 mm using a steam power hammer to lengthen the stroke. The camshaft {{was given a}} new chain drive {{at the front of}} the engine, high lift cams and new tappet clearances. The Prince Henry chassis was slightly modified and the whole given a narrow alloy four-seater body, a pair of alloy wings (front mudguards) and no doors.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in October 1915 and presented finished automobiles at the Philadelphia Auto Show in January 1916.It was namesake of the Biddle family, although R. Ralston Biddle {{did not seem}} to have a major role beyond lending the name.Car was an assembled car manufactured in Philadelphia. The first bodies were believed to be from the Fleetwood body company in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. The first cars were equipped with Buda four-cylinder engines, 3 Bore by 5 stroke and Warner 3-speed transmissions. Some models featured Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels. The bodies were styled in the European tradition. Biddle stood out with <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiators,</b> angular or cycle fenders, step plates instead of the usual running boards, and dual side-mounted wire wheels when that concept was still strictly European.|$|R
50|$|In 1922 {{the highly}} {{sophisticated}} 30/40 Super Sports was launched, with a 4,400cc six cylinder engine, using twin overhead camshafts (dohc) operating four valves per cylinder. The aluminium alloy cylinders had steel liners and aluminium pistons, plus dual carburettors and dual-ignition. The car was also equipped with front-wheel brakes and a <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1912 {{the company}} {{introduced}} {{one of the}} first cyclecars which was priced at £185 and was mostly French built. It had a 1130 cc four-cylinder, water-cooled engine, a sharp <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiator</b> and shaft drive to the rear wheels. Its sporting potential was demonstrated when it was driven in the Cyclecar Grand Prix by Sir Francis Samuelson. The electrically equipped version with a 1.2-litre engine was priced at £275. This model was marketed again after World War I, although the specification also included rounded radiator, increased engine capacity (100cc) and four-speed gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The car had a 2155 cc four-cylinder, water-cooled, side-valve, engine This was {{directly}} {{attached to a}} four-speed gearbox and then by shaft to the rear axle. A compressed air starter was fitted. The steel section chassis had half elliptic leaf springs all round. The brakes followed the convention of the time, with the hand lever operating the rear drums and the foot pedal a transmission brake. Even though the cars were right hand drive, the gear change lever was on the driver's right side, as was the custom at the time. The car was distinguished by a sharply <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiator.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In overall terms 1963 Cadillac was {{essentially}} the same as last year. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625 in further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly <b>V-shaped</b> <b>radiator</b> grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. Cadillac's extra-long nine-passenger cars were the only pillared four-door sedans in the line. Standard equipment again essentially remained unchanged. Trimmings included a full-length lower beltline molding of a simple yet elegant design. Convertible top like rooflines and windshields with forward [...] "dog-leg" [...] pillars were 1962 carryovers seen exclusively on this series. The engine was entirely changed for 1963, though the displacement and output remained the same.|$|E
