50|$|Suction {{vortices}} (or suction spots) {{are really}} substructures of many, perhaps all, tornadoes {{but are not}} always easily visible. These occur, usually, {{at the base of}} the tornado vortex where the tornado makes contact with the surface. Subvortices tend to form after <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown</b> reaches the surface and are resultant from the ratio of cyclonically incoming and rising air motions.

50|$|The {{degree of}} {{the mixing of}} polar and {{mid-latitude}} air depends on the evolution and position of the polar night jet. In general, the mixing is less inside the vortex than outside. Mixing occurs with unstable planetary waves that are characteristic of {{the middle and upper}} stratosphere in winter. Prior to <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown,</b> there is little transport of air out of the Arctic Polar Vortex due to strong barriers above 420 km (261 miles). The polar night jet which exists below this, is weak in the early winter. As a result, it does not deviate any descending polar air, which then mixes with air in the mid-latitudes. In the late winter, air parcels do not descend as much, reducing mixing. After the vortex is broken up, the ex-vortex air is dispersed into the middle latitudes within a month.|$|E
40|$|Rotating {{waves are}} a generic {{instability}} mode of flows that possess a rotation symmetry, such as Taylorâ€“ Couette flow. In the enclosed swirling flow that is gener-ated {{in a closed}} cylindrical container by a rotating end-wall, the initial bifurcation to unsteadiness produced by increasing the endwall rotation rate can be either to ro-tating waves or unsteady axisymmetric flow, depending on the aspect ratio of the cylinder. We examine {{a case where the}} initial bifurcation is to a periodic axisymmetric state, and follow subsequent bifurcations to other states where the flow breaks axisymmetry as well. These result-ing states possess rotating waves that are modulated by the underlying axisymmetric behaviour.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of the onset {{and the location of}} <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in concentrated <b>vortex</b> cores, and the pronounced tendency of the breakdowns to migrate upstream have been characteristic observations of experimental investigations; they have also been features of numerical simulations and led to questions about the validity of these simulations. This behavior seems to be inconsistent with the strong time-like axial evolution of the flow, as expressed explicitly, for example, by the quasi-cylindrical approximate equations for this flow. An order-of-magnitude analysis of the equations of motion near breakdown leads to a modified set of governing equations, analysis of which demonstrates that the interplay between radial inertial, pressure, and viscous forces gives an elliptic character to these concentrated swirling flows. Analytical, asymptotic, and numerical solutions of a simplified non-linear equation are presented; these qualitatively exhibit the features of vortex onset and location noted above...|$|R

Here we examine modulations of vertically propagating planetary waves, a major feature of the climate response to Arctic sea ice reduction by comparing the corresponding results of an atmospheric general circulation model with reanalysis data for periods {{of high and low}} sea ice conditions. Under low sea ice condition we find enhanced coupling between troposphere and stratosphere starting in November with preferred polar stratospheric <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in February, which then feeds back to the troposphere. The model experiment and ERA-Interim reanalysis data agree well with respect to temporal and spatial characteristics associated with vertical planetary wave propagation including its precursors. The upward propagating planetary wave anomalies resemble a wave number 1 and 2 pattern depending on region and timing. Since our experimental design only allows influences from sea ice changes and there is a high degree of resemblance between model results and observations, we conclude that sea ice is a main driver of observed winter circulation changes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} detailed numerical {{calculations of}} the Unsteady, Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations to simulate isothermal, single-phase {{flow in the}} geometries of realistic swirl burners at large Reynolds numbers. Simulations are run with two different turbulence closures, viz., the standard k-epsilon and Reynolds stresses (RSM) models. The numerical method is validated concerning convergence, grid density and far-field influence. Results describe a flow that is in any case periodic or pseudo-periodic, and exhibits quite convincing time-dependent features: bubble- and spiral-type <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and <b>vortex</b> core precession. Some simulations are validated by comparison with corresponding experiments. Good agreement with the experiments has been obtained for mean flow, and frequency peaks of the power spectral density of pressure fluctuations. In order to asses the reliability of URANS methods within this context, calculated time-averaged flow and coherent structures are documented via 2 D graphs, spectral analysis, 3 D isosurfaces and advanced, vortex-related visualization methods and 2 D snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition (S-POD). Differences arising from {{the nature of the}} turbulence model (k-epsilon vs. RSM) are very relevant indeed, given the cost factor involved and the apparent verisimilitude of the predicted flow; they are thoroughly analyzed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{efficient}} parallelized multidomain algorithm for solving the 3 D Navierâ€“Stokes equations in cylindrical geometries. The numerical method {{is based on}} fourth-order compact schemes in the two non-homogeneous directions and Fourier series expansion in the azimuthal direction. The temporal scheme is a second-order semi-implicit projection scheme leading to the solution of five Helmholtz/Poisson equations. To handle the singularity appearing at the axis in cylindrical coordinates, while being {{able to have a}} thinner or conversely a coarser mesh in this zone, parity conditions are imposed at r= 0 r= 0 for each flow variable and azimuthal Fourier mode. To simulate flows in irregularly shaped cylindrical geometries and benefit from a hybrid OpenMP/MPI parallelization, an accurate perfectly free-divergence multidomain method based on the influence matrix technique is proposed. First, the accuracy of the present solver is checked by comparison with analytical solutions and the scalability is then evaluated. Simulations using the present code are then compared to reliable experimental and numerical results of the literature showing good quantitative agreements in the cases of the axisymmetric and 3 D unsteady <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in a cylinder and turbulent pipe flow.

40|$|The head-one {{interaction}} of a supersonic streamwise vortex with a circular cylinder reveals a <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown</b> similar {{in many ways}} to that of incompressible <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown.</b> In particular, the dramatic flow reorganization observed during the interaction resembles the conical <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown</b> reported by Sarpkaya (1995) at high Reynolds number. In the present study, <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown</b> is brought about when moderate and strong streamwise vortices encounter the bow shock {{in front of a}} circular cylinder at Mach 2. 49. The main features of the vortex/cylinder interaction are the formation of a blunt-nosed conical shock with apex far upstream of the undisturbed shock stand-off distance, and a vortex core which responds to passage through the apex of the conical shock by expanding into a turbulent conical flow structure. The geometry of the expanding vortex core as well as the location of the conical shock apex are seen to be strong functions of the incoming vortex strength and the cylinder diameter. A salient feature of the supersonic <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown</b> is the formation of an entropy-shear layer, which separates an interior subsonic zone containing the burst vortex from the surrounding supersonic flow. In keeping with the well-established characteristics of the low-speed <b>vortex</b> <b>breakdown,</b> a region of reversed flow is observed inside the turbulent subsonic zone. The steady vortex/cylinder interaction flow fields generated in the current study exhibit many characteristics of the unsteady vortex distortion patterns previously observed during normal shock wave/vortex interactions.
