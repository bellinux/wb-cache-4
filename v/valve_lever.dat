Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle <b>valve</b> <b>lever.</b> No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.|$|E

Commercial soda siphons came pre-charged with water and gas, and were returned to the retailer for exchange when empty. A deposit scheme ensured they were not otherwise thrown away.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{procedure}} {{was to leave}} the main air induction valve open until the engines {{had a chance to}} come to a full stop, this operation being so timed as to occur just prior to complete submergence. In the case of S-5, however, the chief of the boat, Gunner's Mate Percy Fox, the man responsible for operating this valve, was momentarily distracted. Noticing the mistake, he grabbed the <b>valve</b> <b>lever</b> and jerked hard, causing the valve to jam open.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} the emergency dive at about 13:40, Waddle invited {{two of the}} civilian guests, John Hall, CEO of a Texas oil company, and Jack Clary, a free-lance sports writer from Massachusetts, to operate the controls for the emergency main ballast blow. Clary sat in the helmsman's chair and Hall stood at the high-pressure air <b>valve</b> <b>levers,</b> under close supervision by Greeneville crewmen. [...] After the two civilians had taken their positions, at 13:42:25 Waddle ordered the maneuver executed, and they threw the control levers as instructed.

50|$|This was a vessel, B, {{capable of}} being tightly closed by a screw, D, and a lid, C, in which food could be cooked in water raised by a furnace, A, to the {{temperature}} due to any desired safe pressure of steam. The pressure was determined and limited by a weight, W; on the safety <b>valve</b> <b>lever,</b> G. It is probable that this essential attachment to the steam boiler had previously been used for other purposes; but Papin is given the credit of having first made use of it to control the pressure of steam.|$|E

50|$|If {{the valve}} body {{is filled with}} water, the float moves upwards and closes the valve. If air {{collects}} in the valve body, the waterline lowers, as does the float, and the valve opens to release it. To give more sealing force on the valve, the float generally works the <b>valve</b> through a <b>lever.</b> A greater movement of the float gives a shorter, but more forceful, movement of the <b>valve.</b> This <b>lever</b> mechanism may be simply, almost crudely, made of a pressed steel strip which acts as a bending hinge.|$|R

50|$|The M1A1 had a {{backpack}} configuration with a fuel tank {{that consisted of}} two upright bottles. A third, smaller upright bottle, the propellant tank, was located between the fuel tanks. The backpack had a high-pressure valve. The nozzle of the weapon was located {{at the end of}} a long, thin pipe, which was connected to the backpack via a hose. The pipe was slightly bent at the nozzle end. The nozzle had a hydrogen-powered ignitor. The long and thin cylindrical hydrogen tank was attached parallel to the pipe. A battery provided the spark needed to ignite the hydrogen. The hydrogen flame then ignited the fuel, which was forced out of the fuel tank through the hose and out of the nozzle by the propellant pressure when a valve was opened. The <b>valve</b> <b>lever</b> was located at the other end of the pipe, at the junction of the hose and the pipe.|$|E

The teapot was mainly composed of storage device, holder, check <b>valve,</b> <b>lever</b> mechanism etc. Check valve was under Spherical surface contact. Check valve would be closed when the valve core {{got in touch with}} seal ring. Water outflow from the check valve when Valve core moved from down to up. The lever mechanism was designed in the base of teapot. Cup holder was designed on one side, tie rod which was welded a steel ball was designed on the other side. The design of pure mechanical automatic teapot had the energy conservation, environmental protection, easy operation and strong practicability. The teapot shows good performance...|$|E
25|$|Drive {{was taken}} from the rocking arm of an exhaust <b>valve,</b> a <b>lever</b> fixed to the valve housing {{transmitting}} impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by Leutnant Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the decisive}} {{importance}} of a disturbance-free environment on the Space Station, and on other orbital systems, for materials processing experiments, a theoretical and semi-experimental analysis of the acceleration environment to be expected on large orbiting spacecraft was undertaken. A unified model of such spacecraft cannot be established; therefore, a number of sub-models representing major components of typical large spacecraft must be investigated. In order to obtain experimental data of forces, a typical spacecraft - an engineering model of the Spacelab - was suspended on long ropes in a high-bay hangar, and equipped {{with a number of}} accelerometers. Active components on the Spacelab (fans, pumps, air conditioners, <b>valves,</b> <b>levers)</b> were operated, and astronautics moved boxes, drawers, sleds, and their own bodies. Generally speaking, the response of the Spacelab structure was very similar to the environment measured on Spacelabs SL- 1, SL- 2, and D- 1. At frequencies in the broad range between 1 and about 100 Hz, acceleration peaks reached values of 10 (exp - 3) and 10 (exp - 2) g sub o, and even higher...|$|R
50|$|R.B. {{introduced}} cornets soon afterward. The Super Olds line of trombones, trumpets and cornets {{was introduced}} in about 1932 and soon became legendary. Other models introduced in the 1930s include the Special, Military, Symphony and French models. All but the Super models could be ordered with a distinctive hammered finish on the bell. This was the standard finish for the Military line. The Super bass trombone could be had with two valves, both actuated by levers. This is likely the first production bass trombone with two <b>valve</b> <b>levers.</b> There were also some french horns made in the late 1930s, although they didn't appear in the catalogues at that time. The Recording model trumpet and cornet were probably designed shortly before the war halted production. During World War II, the government had Olds produce saxophones along with the more standard strategic production. Today these are very rare as they were not generally {{available to the public}} and a large number of them went down with a supply ship in the Mediterranean. By 1941 Olds held al least six patents for trumpet and trombone design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the dimensioning and 3 D modeling of a swing check <b>valve</b> with <b>lever</b> and weight in welded design, {{based on the}} existing 2 D workshop documentation in cast design and reverse engineering. Based on analytical calculations, pipe wall thickness of a swing check valve housing was selected for the nominal pipe diameter DN 300 and water test pressure p = 2. 4 MPa. All 3 D models of components, {{as well as the}} assembly, were made in the program tool SolidWorks. The 3 D model of the swing check valve with flanges was subjected to stress analysis (Finite Element Analysis) for the purpose of checking the accuracy of the analytical calculations. Fluid flow analysis (Flow Simulation) was used for presenting fluid flow process and rate through the swing check valve assembly. A low-budget 3 D MakerBot Replicator 2 X printer was used for constructing a reduced-scale 3 D assembly model of the swing check <b>valve</b> with <b>lever</b> and weight, by implementing the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology.

50|$|A {{steam brake}} can be {{operated}} directly by a <b>lever</b> (<b>valve)</b> and also indirectly {{together with the}} vacuum brake. In the latter case, a control valve linked to the vacuum system controls the admission of steam to the brake cylinder, so that the steam brake can be activated automatically in an emergency or if the train separates (the so-called 'automatic steam brake').|$|R
50|$|Various {{forms of}} Ramsbottom valve were produced. Some were {{separate}} fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations. Others were {{contained in a}} U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the boiler shell. As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the boiler shell, with the springs housed in a recess inside and only the <b>valves</b> and balance <b>lever</b> protruding outside. These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.|$|R
50|$|The Vienna horn uses {{a unique}} form of double-cylinder valve {{associated}} with the Viennese firm Uhlmann of the 1840s known as a pumpenvalve. A pumpenvalve {{is similar to the}} standard piston valve, but it is not pushed directly inward. Instead, long push-rods reach across to each lever key (as with rotary valves), allowing either a fast or slow change in the <b>valve,</b> by <b>lever</b> speed. The pumpenvalve allows the air to flow straight when the valves are not actuated. When a valve is engaged, each cylinder redirects the air stream 90 degrees in one bend, lessening the resistance felt by the player. This type of valve {{is one of the many}} contributing factors to the liquid legato that is one of the trademarks of the Viennese school. However, the indirect linkage between the fingers and the valves via can make the action slow and therefore make quick technical passages more difficult for the player.|$|R
60|$|The pace grew even faster. We were racing down an incline, and now, ice, station, and prairie alike were blotted {{out by a}} {{blinding}} whiteness; while presently I was flung backward off my feet, and would have fallen but that I clutched a guard-rail. The whole cab rattled, the great locomotive lurched, and a white smother hurtled under the lamp glare, until once more the motion grew even, and we could feel the well-braced frame of iron and steel leap forward beneath us. Engineer Robertson swayed easily to the oscillation as, with {{one side of his}} intent face toward me, he clutched the throttle lever, until he called hoarsely as his fingers moved along it. Then, even while the steam roared in blown-down wreaths from the lifting <b>valve,</b> the <b>lever</b> was straight at wide-open again, and I caught my breath as I made out another yellow halo with something that moved behind it in the snow ahead.|$|R
2500|$|Until recently, {{the use of}} siphon-type cisterns was {{mandatory}} in the UK to avoid the potential waste of water by millions of leaking toilets with flapper valves but due to EU harmonisation the regulations have changed. These valves can sometimes {{be more difficult to}} operate than a [...] "flapper"-based flush <b>valve</b> because the <b>lever</b> requires more torque than a flapper-flush-valve system. This additional torque required at the tank lever {{is due to the fact}} that a user must forcefully lift a certain amount of water up into the siphon passageway in order to initiate the siphon action in the tank.|$|R
50|$|The Monosoupape had no {{carburetor}} or throttle, {{and since}} most of its air supply was taken in through the exhaust valve, {{it could not be}} controlled by adjusting the air supply to the crankcase like other rotaries. Monosoupapes therefore had a single petrol regulating control used for a limited degree of speed regulation. In early examples, engine speed could be controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust <b>valves</b> using <b>levers</b> acting on the valve tappet rollers, but this was later abandoned due to causing burning of the valves.2 Instead, a blip switch was used, which cut out the ignition when pressed. This was used sparingly to avoid fouling the spark plugs, since it was only safe to be used when the fuel supply was also cut. Some later Monosoupapes were fitted with a selector switch which allowed the pilot to cut out three or six cylinders instead of all nine when hitting the blip switch, so that each cylinder fired only once per three engine revolutions but the engine remained in perfect balance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913 the Seguin {{brothers}} {{introduced the}} new Monosoupape ("single valve") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons {{by using a}} single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust <b>valves</b> using <b>levers</b> acting on the valve tappet rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. [...] The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rhône companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rhônes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase {{to the top of}} each cylinder to admit the intake charge.|$|R
50|$|Like the Adler, few {{original}} design documents existed {{at that time}} from which the replica could be built. The basis of the new design drew heavily on a blueprint of the original drawings from 1838. The dimensions and technical data were derived from the book published in 1839 by NNW Meissner. One problem that soon {{came to the fore}} was that building a replica using the original manufacturing techniques was, for various reasons, not possible. In building the boiler current regulations had to be followed. The steam engine was a major headache. Originally the Saxonia only had a simple <b>lever</b> <b>valve</b> gear which did not enable any kind of steam admission control. For the replica Saxonia a Stephenson valve gear with open rods was planned.|$|R
50|$|The {{throttle}} lever assembly is often designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the {{throttle lever}}s actuate the switches to shut the <b>valves</b> when the <b>levers</b> are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The throttle lever must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|R

50|$|Water and gas taps have {{adjustable}} flow: {{gate valves}} are more progressive; ball valves more coarse, typically used in on-off applications. Turning a <b>valve</b> knob or <b>lever</b> sets adjusts flow by varying the aperture {{of the control}} device in the valve assembly. The result when opened in any degree is a choked flow. Its rate is independent of the viscosity or temperature of the fluid or gas in the pipe, and depends only weakly on the supply pressure, so that flow rate is stable at a given setting. At intermediate flow settings the pressure at the valve restriction drops nearly to zero from the Venturi effect; in water taps, this causes the water to boil momentarily at room temperature as it passes through the restriction. Bubbles of cool water vapor form and collapse at the restriction, causing the familiar hissing sound. At very low flow settings, the viscosity of the water becomes important and the pressure drop (and hissing noise) vanish; at full flow settings, parasitic drag in the pipes becomes important and the water again becomes quiet.|$|R

5000|$|Propulsion was by an inclined, three-cylinder {{steam engine}} below the main deck {{with only the}} main bearing tops, upper parts of the <b>valves</b> and {{handling}} <b>levers</b> above the main deck. The engine was unique in using a Walschaert gear, normally used on locomotives, to drive a Corliss gear for the two low-pressure cylinders and the poppet type valves on the high-pressure portion. The speed guarantee of 22 mph was met by the engine's indicated horsepower of [...] at 31 revolutions per minute. The high-pressure cylinder, 66 in in diameter, was centered between the two low-pressure cylinders of 96 in diameter with steam provided by six single ended and three double ended Scotch boilers forward of the engine room delivering steam at 165 pounds per square inch. The single ended boilers were 14 ft inside diameter by 10 ft length and the double ended boilers were 14 ft mean diameter by 20 ft length. The two 32 ft diameter paddle wheels each had eleven steel buckets 14 ft long by 5 ft wide. Due to the restricted channels at both Cleveland and Buffalo additional maneuvering capability was required and a bow rudder and steam steering engine were provided.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{enabling}} technologies required for successful commercialization of displacement controlled (DC) systems are the appropriate variable displacement pumps. This thesis aims to fill the current gap in literature {{with respect to the}} performance requirements of pumps used in DC systems as well as create a methodology to ensure a compact, low power, and low cost pump adjustment system design. This research looks both at the design considerations with respect to the individual components and the system as a whole. Also {{for the first time a}} measurement based approach is taken to specify the dynamic requirements of DC pumps. ^ Looking at the components a new sensor technology is presented including initial proof of concept measurements. The ideal valve configuration is presented as a slightly underlapped 3 position 4 port valve. Also a detailed qualitative analysis is presented about the swash plate centering mechanism showing which general configuration best meets the criteria for DC pumps considering compactness and performance. ^ With respect to the complete system a detailed hydraulic and kinematic model is presented. This model is used in a full factorial design of experiments to discover the system effects of sizing the control <b>valve,</b> control cylinder, <b>lever</b> arm and control pressure associated with the adjustment system. Additionally a methodology for sizing coupled components to satisfy pump response, pump power, and pump size requirements is detailed along with a general case study. ...|$|R
