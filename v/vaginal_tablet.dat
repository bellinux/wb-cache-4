50|$|A {{hemihydrate}} form of estradiol, estradiol hemihydrate, {{is widely}} used medically under {{a large number of}} brand names similarly to estradiol. In terms of activity and bioequivalence, estradiol and its hemihydrate are identical, with the only disparities being an approximate 1% difference in potency by weight (due to the presence of water molecules in the hemihydrate form of the substance) and a slower rate of release with certain formulations of the hemihydrate. This is because estradiol hemihydrate is more hydrated than anhydrous estradiol, and for this reason, is more insoluble in water in comparison, which results in slower absorption rates with specific formulations of the drug such as vaginal tablets. Estradiol hemihydrate has also been shown to result in less systemic absorption as a <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation relative to other topical estradiol formulations such as vaginal creams.|$|E
40|$|Vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} (VVC) is a bothersome {{disease in}} women. Poor {{compliance with the}} continuous use of antifungal vaginal drugs often results in treatment failure.

40|$|Background & Aim: Bacterial vaginosis is {{characterized}} by an imbalance in vaginal natural discharges due to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria {{as well as a}} concomitant {{decrease in the number of}} lactobacilli and increase in vaginal PH to more than 4. 5. Bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of pelvic inflamatory disease, postoperative infection following hysterectomy, cervix abnormal cytology and preterm birth. Microbial resistance and a growing tendency to move toward "natural therapies" have led to increase interests in non-antibiotic treatments for bacterial vaginosis. This study aimed to compare the effects of Lactobacillus acidophilus suppository and Metronidazol <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet</b> on treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Methods & Materials: In a double-blind, paralled randomized clinical trial, 40 out of 300 participants were included in the study from an out-patient private gynaecology clinic in Tabriz, Iran.

Though it can be administered orally, intramuscularly or even sublingually, a very effective route with fewer side effects can be achieved by an intravaginal route. The first vaginal preparations were not made commercially but were compounded by pharmacies. This had the disadvantage of lack of control by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ensuring efficacy of the preparations. Furthermore {{there was a lack of}} precise dosing leading to batch to batch variation. The first commercially approved vaginal progesterone preparation in the United States was a vaginal gel which has proven very effective. The main side effect was accumulation of a buildup of the vaginal gel sometimes leading to irritation.

Vaginally administered local estrogen therapy (LET) is the standard of care for symptoms of vaginal atrophy that {{do not respond to}} nonhormonal interventions. Several LET formulations are available, and choice of therapy is based largely on patient needs and preferences. This online survey of postmenopausal LET users was conducted to investigate reasons for switching to vaginal estradiol tablets from other formulations and to evaluate factors associated with patient preference for and compliance with use of LET. Data was analyzed from 73 respondents currently using estradiol vaginal tablets who have previously used the estradiol vaginal ring, estradiol vaginal cream, and/or conjugated estrogen vaginal cream. Patients in this survey rated vaginal symptoms of vaginal atrophy as being more bothersome than urinary symptoms. Respondents preferred their current treatment with the <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet</b> to their previous treatment with a cream or ring. The preference for tablets over creams was mainly related to formulation and application rather than to any perceived safety issues. Tablets were perceived as efficacious, convenient, and neat to apply.

Estrogen preparations {{provide the most}} effective treatment; local application is preferred to systemic drugs when treating only vaginal symptoms. As local estrogen therapies have comparable efficacy, this study aimed to understand treatment practices, assess experiences with different forms of local estrogen-delivering applicators, and evaluate satisfaction.

Data from 200 women (100 cream users and 100 tablet users; mean therapy duration 3. 48 months) showed that most stored medication in the room {{in which it was}} applied (88 %) and applied it at bedtime (71 %), a procedure for which cream users required, on average, more than twice the time of tablet users (5. 08 minutes versus 2. 48 minutes). Many cream users applied larger-than-prescribed amounts of cream, attempting to achieve greater efficacy (42 %), or lower-than-recommended doses (45 %), most frequently to avoid messiness (33 %) or leakage (30 %). More tablet users (69 %) than cream users (14 %) were "extremely satisfied" with their applicator. Postmenopausal women using local estrogen therapy were generally more satisfied with the application of <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> than cream. Patient satisfaction may help to facilitate accurate dosing. Positive perceptions of medication will help to optimize treatment, which, although not assessed in this study, is likely, in turn, to improve vaginal health.

Patients underwent an initial treatment for 4 weeks (1 <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablet</b> of Gynoflor(®) containing 0. 03 mg estriol daily), followed by maintenance therapy (3 vaginal Gynoflor(®) tablets weekly) for 8 weeks. Results: Vaginal dryness continuously improved from a median score 8 at entry to score 4 at the end of initial therapy, and median score 2 at the end of maintenance therapy. Normal sexual activity before BC diagnosis was reported by 14 women (88 %). At study entry only 3 women (19 %) were sexually active. At the end of the Gynoflor(®) regimen, 10 women (63 %) reported sexual activity, of which 7 (44 %) sexual intercourse. The FSSEI demonstrated a non-significant trend of improvement of parameters related to sexuality Conclusions: Local vaginal therapy with Gynoflor(®) in BC survivors on AIs reporting atrophic vaginitis could be considered as a useful treatment the quality of the sexual life. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Objective  To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of prostaglandin E 2 (dinoprostone) vaginal gel for the induction of labour at term {{from the perspective}} of the UK’s National Health Service. Design  Economic evaluation conducted as part of a randomised controlled trial. Setting  Maternity department at a major teaching hospital in London, UK. Population  A cohort of 165 pregnant women presenting as cephalic between 36 + 6 and 41 + 6 weeks of gestation, for whom induction of labour was deemed necessary. Methods  Either 3 -mg Prostin E 2 <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> or 1 - or 2 -mg Prostin E 2 vaginal gel were administered at 6 -hourly intervals. Main outcome measures  Incremental cost per hour prevented between induction and delivery. The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and estimate net benefits at alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds. Results  Women receiving the gel accrued nonsignificantly higher costs (incremental cost £ 630; bootstrap 95...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -day {{treatment}} with tioconazole <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> (Gyno-Trosid; Pfizer) {{was used in}} 30 patients with vaginal candidosis during a prospective, mycologically controlled study. Candida yeasts were identified by microscopy and culture before initiation of treatment and then on days 3, 6 and 28. On the 6 th day, all patients had responded to the treatment {{and there was a}} 100 % cure rate on microscopic and mycological examination. After 4 weeks, 83 % of the patients still had relief of symptoms, although a recurrence of Candida on culture and microscopy was detected in 14 patients (46 %). Seven of these were available for further assessment and, when given a second course of treatment, they were cured both clinically and microbiologically. There was no evidence of any adverse systemic reaction and local side effects were limited to a transient sensation of mild to moderate burning. Problems relating to recurrence of symptoms and reappearance of Candida are discussed. Articl...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{patients}} were equally randomized {{to receive a}} single dose of 6. 5 % tioconazole ointment or a 3 -day course of 100 -mg clotrimazole <b>vaginal</b> <b>tablets</b> {{for the treatment of}} vulvovaginal candidiasis. Of the 32 evaluable patients treated with tioconazole, 27 (84 %) remained asymptomatic 4 weeks posttreatment, compared with 28 of 33 patients (85 %) treated with clotrimazole. A total of 34 patients in each group could be evaluated for mycological response based on culture results 1 and 4 weeks after treatment. Twenty patients (59 %) who received tioconazole and twenty-one patients (62 %) who received clotrimazole remained culture negative 4 weeks after therapy. Of 40 patients who received tioconazole, 12 (30 %) experienced local irritation or itching, compared with 2 of 40 patients (5 %) treated with clotrimazole (P less than 0. 01). Single-dose tioconazole ointment was as effective as a 3 -day course of clotrimazole tablets, but significantly more patients in the tioconazole-treated group experienced local side effects...|$|R
