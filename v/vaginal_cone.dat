50|$|A <b>vaginal</b> <b>cone,</b> {{also known}} as a vaginal weight, is a medical device {{specifically}} designed and shaped to exercise pelvic floor muscles and help restore proper bladder functions in women with urinary stress incontinence. The device comes with a cone with a string on the outside. Varying weights are placed inside the cone. Starting with the lowest weight, women insert the cone into the vagina, like they would with a tampon. They then contract their pelvic floor muscles to keep the cone from falling out. As their muscles get stronger, the weights can be increased.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} was to analyse urodynamic data before and after conservative treatment with vaginal cones.; The design was an open clinical study and was carried out at the Urogynaecology Unit of the University women's hospital. Eighteen women with genuine urinary stress incontinence were treated with vaginal cones for 6 weeks. Cystometry was performed before and after conservative therapy. The patients' subjective improvement and the urodynamic data have been compared. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical analysis.; Of eighteen women with cone therapy, eight were continent after 6 weeks and showed a significant increase of the dynamic urethral closure pressure. Seven patients reported a subjective improvement, and in three women no change of stress incontinence was observed Colposuspension was performed {{at a later date}} in these three cases.; <b>Vaginal</b> <b>cone</b> therapy is a successful method to cure mild female stress incontinence and has the advantage of avoiding incontinence operation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>cone</b> {{therapy in}} two phases, passive and active, {{in women with}} stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, São Paulo University, Brazil. Twenty-four women with a clinical and urodynamic diagnosis of stress urinary incontinence were treated with vaginal cones in a passive phase (without voluntary contractions of the pelvic floor) and an active phase (with voluntary contractions), each of which lasted three months. Clinical complaints, a functional evaluation of the pelvic floor, a pad test, and bladder neck mobility were analyzed before and after each phase. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients completed the treatment. The reduction in absolute risk with the pad test was 0. 38 (p< 0. 034) {{at the end of}} the passive phase and 0. 67 (p< 0. 0001) {{at the end of the}} active phase. The reduction in absolute risk with the pelvic floor evaluation was 0. 62 (p< 0. 0001) at the end of the passive phase and 0. 77 (p< 0. 0001) at the end of the active phase. The reduction in absolute risk of bladder neck mobility was 0. 38 (p< 0. 0089) at the end of the passive phase and 0. 52 (p< 0. 0005) at the end of the active phase. Complete reversal of symptomatology was observed in 12 (57. 1 %) patients, and satisfaction was expressed by 19 (90. 4 %). CONCLUSION: Using vaginal cones in the passive phase, as other researchers did, was effective. Inclusion of the active phase led to additional improvement in all of the study parameters evaluated in women with stress urinary incontinence. Randomized studies are needed, however, to confirm these results...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: {{to compare}} the effects of {{functional}} electrostimulation of the pelvic floor and therapy with cones in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).

The effects of functional electrostimulation of the pelvic floor were evaluated in the SUI treatment of 24 women, {{with the use of}} clinical data (micturition diary, pad test and a questionnaire about quality of life - I-QoL). The patients were submitted to two 20 ' weekly sessions for four consecutive months, under the supervision of a physiotherapist. The electrode used had 10 cm length and 3. 5 cm width with a double metallic ring and a cylindrical shape, positioned in the medium third of the vagina. The electric parameters used were: intensity varying from 10 to 100 mA and 50 Hz of fixed frequency, with pulse duration of 1 ms. Also, we evaluated 21 patients who were submitted to <b>vaginal</b> <b>cone</b> treatment. The cone therapy was done with two 45 minute sessions per week. The cones' weight varied from 20 to 100 gr. RESULTS: {{there was no difference between}} the outcomes of electrostimulation of the pelvic floor and the vaginal cones for the treatment of SUI (p> 0. 05). After four months, there was a significant improvement in the I-QoL index of the patients treated both with electrostimulation (40. 3 versus 82. 9) or with the cones (47. 7 versus 84. 1). There was a significant decrease in pad weight in both groups, measured before and after the treatment (28. 5 and 32 g versus 2. 0 and 3. 0 g for the electrostimulation and cone group, respectively). Finally, there was a significant decrease in the number of urinary leakage evaluated by the micturition diary in both groups (p 0, 05).

The women in the behavioral intervention group were instructed on pelvic floor exercise and bladder control strategies. In the other group, pelvic floor exercises were performed using the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cones.</b> All participants were treated for 12 weeks and followed-up every 2 weeks. The subjective changes in severity of stress urinary incontinence were measured using a detection stress urinary incontinence severity questionnaire, leakage index, and a 3 -day urinary diary. The objective changes were measured by pad test. For better evaluation of the effects, two questionnaires were used: Incontinence Quality of Life and King’s Health Questionnaire. Results: Among the 51 women who completed the study, 25 subjects were in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cones</b> group and 26 participated in the behavioral intervention program. The changes in leakage rate on pad test and leakage index in the behavioral intervention program group were significantly higher than in the <b>vaginal</b> <b>cones</b> group (p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 008, respectively), but the severity of stress urinary incontinence was not significantly different between the two groups (p= 0. 2).

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND METHODS: We evaluated three women affected by UI and sexual dysfunction. The patients underwent combined pelvic floor rehabilitation (PFR), kept voiding diaries, and filled out the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI questionnaire) before and after the completion of PFR. We evaluated each domain score, including desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. RESULTS: After the combined rehabilitation program, none of them had UI requiring pad use or referred urine leakage during sexual activity, including intercourse. Before PFR, FSFI score ranged from 16 to 21; after treatment, the FSFI score ranged from 22. 1 to 29. 3. There was an improvement in patients regarding desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. CONCLUSIONS: A complete rehabilitation can provide a beneficial effect on sexual function. A larger trial, on a more extended female population, is currently in progress, in order to confirm our findings.

40|$|Summary Introduction: Strengthening {{exercises}} for pelvic floor muscles (SEPFM) {{are considered the}} first approach {{in the treatment of}} stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Nevertheless, there is no evidence about training parameters. Objective: To identify the protocol and/or most effective training parameters in the treatment of female SUI. Method: A literature research was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, Web of Science and Lilacs databases, with publishing dates ranging from January 1992 to March 2014. The articles included consisted of English-speaking experimental studies in which SEPFM were compared with placebo treatment (usual or untreated). The sample had a diagnosis of SUI and their age ranged between 18 and 65 years. The assessment of methodological quality was performed based on the PEDro scale. Results: Seven high methodological quality articles were included in this review. The sample consisted of 331 women, mean age 44. 4 ± 5. 51 years, average duration of urinary loss of 64 ± 5. 66 months and severity of SUI ranging from mild to severe. SEPFM programs included different training parameters concerning the PFM. Some studies have applied abdominal training and adjuvant techniques.

Current guidelines for exercise during pregnancy have no or limited focus on the evidence for the effect of pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) in the prevention and treatment of UI. Aims Systematic review to address the effect of PFMT during pregnancy and after delivery in the prevention and treatment of UI. Data sources PubMed, CENTRAL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PEDro databases and hand search of available reference lists and conference abstracts (June 2012). Methods Study eligibility criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiexperimental trials published in the English language. Participants: Primiparous or multiparous pregnant or postpartum women. Interventions: PFMT with or without biofeedback, <b>vaginal</b> <b>cones</b> or electrical stimulation. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Both authors independently reviewed, grouped and qualitatively synthesised the trials. Results 22 randomised or quasiexperimental trials were found. There is a very large heterogeneity in the populations studied, inclusion and exclusion criteria, outcome measures and content of PFMT interventions. Based on the studies with relevant sample size, high adherence to a strength-training protocol and close follow-up, we found that PFMT during pregnancy and after delivery can prevent and treat UI. A supervised training protocol following strength-training principles, emphasising close to maximum contractions and lasting at least 8  weeks is recommended. Conclusions PFMT is effective when supervised training is conducted. Further high-quality RCTs are needed especially after delivery. Given the prevalence of female UI and its impact on exercise participation, PFMT should be incorporated as a routine part of women's exercise programmes in general...|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} of this exercise method, which is performed at home, is to gradually strengthen the pelvic floor muscles by inserting a cone and retaining it in the vagina {{as long as possible}} throughout the exercise session (generally around 15 minutes, once or twice a day). Depending on the level of pelvic muscle weakness, the pelvic floor {{may not be able to}} retain the cone with only a passive contraction. Therefore, a voluntary or active contraction - more or less slight as the case may be, will be needed to retain the cone throughout the exercise session. This combination of active and passive contractions ensures a coordinated effort of the weakened pelvic floor muscles and increases the efficacy of the exercise, which should be performed in a standing position and walking around the house. As long as an active contraction effort is necessary to retain the cone, the exercise should be carried out with the same cone during several exercise sessions, to allow the pelvic muscles to progressively regain their tonus. Once the pelvic floor is able to retain the cone with no active contraction effort, the exercise should be pursued with the next heavier cone, and so on, until the pelvic muscles have regained their strength and are able to properly control the bladder functions. Improvement in pelvic floor muscle tone will be noticeable after six weeks of regular exercise with <b>vaginal</b> <b>cones.</b> Within approximately three months, stress incontinence episodes should become gradually less frequent and eventually stop. The pelvic floor muscles should have gained enough strength and tonus to allow adequate control of the bladder functions.|$|R

The action of passively/actively retaining the device internally is supposed to improve muscle tone. Barbells are made of smooth, polished solid stainless steel, cylindrical in shape, with a rounded bulge at each end. They typically weigh one pound (454 g) and measure approximately 6+3/4 in in length with a diameter of one inch (2.5 cm) at the widest part. Being made of stainless steel, vaginal barbells are nonporous and can be wiped clean with a cloth moistened with mild soap and water.|$|R
