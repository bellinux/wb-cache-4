25|$|A {{thermocouple}} is {{an electrical}} device {{consisting of two}} dissimilar electrical conductors forming electrical junctions at differing temperatures. A thermocouple produces a temperature-dependent voltage {{as a result of}} the thermoelectric effect, and this <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> interpreted to measure temperature. Thermocouples are a widely used type of temperature sensor.|$|E
50|$|When {{talking about}} {{alternating}} current (AC) {{there is a}} difference between instantaneous voltage and average <b>voltage.</b> Instantaneous <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added for direct current (DC) and AC, but average <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> meaningfully added only when they apply to signals that all have the same frequency and phase.|$|R

25|$|The {{breakdown}} <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{increased by}} using one-sided partially metallized films, or the breakdown voltage of the capacitor {{can be increased}} by using double-sided metallized films. Double-sided metallized films also can be combined with internal series-connected capacitors by partial metallization. These multiple technique designs are especially used for high-reliability applications with polypropylene films.|$|E
25|$|The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect {{transistor}} (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET) {{is a type}} of {{field-effect transistor}} (FET). It has an insulated gate, whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. A metal–insulator–semiconductor field-effect transistor or MISFET is a term almost synonymous with MOSFET. Another synonym is IGFET for insulated-gate field-effect transistor.|$|E
25|$|Using DC placed severe {{restrictions}} on the distance power could be transmitted due to power losses. With DC {{there was no way}} to transform power to high voltages, which would have reduced the current and lowered the transmission losses. Power can be safely generated to about 2000 volts, but this is a dangerous voltage for household use. With alternating current <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> changed up or down using a transformer. AC power began being widely introduced in the 1890s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{greater than}} 10,000 volts. Dust {{particles}} with high resistance are held too strongly to the plate, making them difficult to remove and causing rapping problems.|$|R
50|$|Carbon can act, at first, {{like a high}} {{resistivity}} dust in the precipitator. Higher <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{required in}} order for corona generation to begin. These higher <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> problematic for the TR-Set controls. The problem lies in onset of corona causing large amounts of current to surge through the (low resistivity) dust layer. The controls sense this surge as a spark. As precipitators are operated in spark-limiting mode, power is terminated and the corona generation cycle re-initiates. Thus, lower power (current) readings are noted with relatively high voltage readings.|$|R
30|$|The node <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{obtained}} by solving the power flow, and the self-impedance of each node <b>can</b> <b>be</b> acquired by computing the network impedance matrix, thereby calculating the nodal three-phase short circuit currents.|$|R
25|$|The burden <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{significant}} in very low-voltage circuit areas. To check for {{its effect on}} accuracy and on external circuit operation the meter can be switched to different ranges; the current reading {{should be the same}} and circuit operation should not be affected if burden voltage is not a problem. If this voltage is significant it can be reduced (also reducing the inherent accuracy and precision of the measurement) by using a higher current range.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{stepping}} stick-slip motor, all these motors {{work on the}} same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to produce a high vibration amplitude.|$|E
25|$|In the {{electric}} eel, some 5,000 to 6,000 stacked electroplaques {{can make a}} shock up to 860 volts and 1 ampere of current (860 watts) for two milliseconds. Such a shock is extremely unlikely to be deadly for an adult human, due to the very short duration of the discharge. Atrial fibrillation requires that roughly 700 mA be delivered across the heart muscle for 30 ms or more, far longer than the eel can produce. Still, this level of current is reportedly enough to produce a brief and painful numbing shock likened to a stun gun discharge, which due to the <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> felt for {{some distance from the}} fish; this is a common risk for aquarium caretakers and biologists attempting to handle or examine electric eels.|$|E
50|$|Even higher <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{measured}} with capacitor divider probes, though the larger physical size and other mechanical features (e.g., corona rings) {{of these devices}} often preclude their use as handheld probes.|$|R
30|$|The {{sequence}} PCC <b>voltages</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> calculated similarly, {{when the}} CBs {{of the first}} SCB act then in other phases. And it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found {{that there is no}} phase angle jump, and the sequence voltage magnitudes keep comparatively stable.|$|R
5000|$|An equal {{magnitude}} voltage {{will also}} be seen across the capacitor but in antiphase to the inductor.

25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as sample and hold circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic capacitors, polyester film capacitors or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|E

2500|$|Electronic {{amplifiers}} use one variable {{presented as}} either a current and voltage. Either current or <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used as input and either as output, leading to four types of amplifiers.

2500|$|To {{the extent}} that the input bias {{currents}} do not match, there will be an effective input offset voltage present, which can lead to problems in circuit performance. Many commercial op amp offerings provide a method for tuning the operational amplifier to balance the inputs (e.g., [...] "offset null" [...] or [...] "balance" [...] pins that can interact with an external voltage source attached to a potentiometer). Alternatively, a tunable external <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> added to one of the inputs in order to balance out the offset effect. In cases where a design calls for one input to be short-circuited to ground, that short circuit can be replaced with a variable resistance that can be tuned to mitigate the offset problem.|$|E
2500|$|High-voltage pulsed {{galvanic}} stimulation (HGVS) {{has been}} shown to be of prophylactic benefit, to reduce the incidence of attacks. [...] The patient is usually placed in the left lateral decubitus position and a sterile probe is inserted into the anus. [...] The negative electrode is used and the stimulator is set with a pulse frequency of 80 to 120 cycles per second. [...] The voltage (intensity) is started at 0, progressively raised to a threshold of patient discomfort, and then is decreased to a level that the patient finds comfortable. [...] As the patient's tolerance increases, the <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> gradually increased to 250 to 350 Volts. [...] Each treatment session usually lasts between 15 and 60 minutes. [...] Several studies have reported short-term success rates that ranged from 65 to 91%.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{capacitor}} is discharging, {{the strength}} of the electric field is decreasing and the common orientation of the molecular dipoles is returning to an undirected state in a process of relaxation. Due to the hysteresis, at the zero point of the electric field, a material-dependent number of molecular dipoles are still polarized along the field direction without a measurable voltage appearing at the terminals of the capacitor. This is like an electrical remanence. The oriented dipoles will be discharged spontaneously over time and the voltage at the electrodes of the capacitor will decay exponentially. The complete discharge time of all dipoles can be days to weeks depending on the material. This [...] "reloaded" [...] <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> retained for months, even in electrolytic capacitors, caused by the high insulation resistance in common modern capacitor dielectrics. The discharge of a capacitor and the subsequent reloading can be repeated several times.|$|E

A regulator output voltage less than the 7 V reference level can be obtained by using a voltage divider across the reference source.

2500|$|A {{problem with}} solar cells {{is that the}} high energy photons that hit the surface are {{converted}} to heat. [...] This is a loss for the cell because the incoming photons are not converted into usable energy. [...] The idea behind the hot carrier cell is to utilize some of that incoming energy which is converted to heat. [...] If the electrons and holes can be collected while hot, a higher <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> obtained from the cell. [...] The problem with doing {{this is that the}} contacts which collect the electrons and holes will cool the material. [...] Thus far, keeping the contacts from cooling the cell has been theoretical. [...] Another way of improving the efficiency of the solar cell using the heat generated is to have a cell which allows lower energy photons to excite electron and hole pairs. [...] This requires a small bandgap. [...] Using a selective contact, the lower energy electrons and holes can be collected while allowing the higher energy ones to continue moving through the cell. [...] The selective contacts are made using a double barrier resonant tunneling structure. [...] The carriers are cooled which they scatter with phonons. [...] If a material with a large bandgap of phonons then the carriers will carry more of the heat to the contact and it won't be lost in the lattice structure. [...] One material which has a large bandgap of phonons is indium nitride. [...] The hot carrier cells are in their infancy but are beginning to move toward the experimental stage.|$|E
