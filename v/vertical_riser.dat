In one type, a moving partition within a cylindrical chamber forces loose rounds into an exit slot, with the cartridges being stored {{parallel to the}} axis of rotation. After loading of the magazine, a wound spring or other mechanism forces the partition against the rounds. In all models a single staggered column is pushed by a follower through a curved path. From there the rounds enter the <b>vertical</b> <b>riser</b> either from a single or dual drums.Cylindrical designs such as rotary and drum magazines allow for larger capacity than box magazines, without growing to excessive length. The downside of a drum magazine's extra capacity is its added weight.

40|$|The rapid {{depletion}} of hydrocarbon fields {{around the world}} has led the industry to search for these resources in ever increasing water depths. In this context, the large diameter (D > 100 mm) <b>vertical</b> <b>riser</b> has become a subject of great interest. In this research work, a major investigation was undertaken to determine the two phase flow hydrodynamics in a 254 mm <b>vertical</b> <b>riser.</b> Two types of experiments were performed for range of air-water superficial velocities. The first experimental campaign addresses {{the issue of the}} two gas injector’s performances (conventional vs. novel design gas injector) in the large diameter <b>vertical</b> <b>riser.</b> The experimental results show that the novel design gas injector should be the preferential choice. The second set of the experimental work investigates the two phase flow hydrodynamics in the <b>vertical</b> <b>riser</b> in detail. The two phase flow patterns and their transitions were identified by combination of visual observations and statistical features. Based on the results, the experimental flow regime map was developed and compared with the existing vertical upflow regime maps/models. None of the flow regime transition models adequately predicted the flow regimes transitions in large diameter vertical risers as a whole. In this regard, the Taitel et al. (1980) bubble to slug flow transition model has been modified for large diameter vertical upflow conditions, based on the physical mechanism observed. The general trends of modified criteria agreed well with the current and other large diameter experimental results. The effect of upstream conditions on the <b>vertical</b> <b>riser</b> flow behaviour was also investigated in detail by two different inlet configurations (i) near riser base injection and (ii) upstream flowline injection. It was found that no significant differences exist in flow behaviour at low air-water superficial velocities for both the inlet configuration, at high air-water superficial velocities, the intermittent flow behavior in flowline influences the riser flow pattern characteristics and thereby controls the riser dynamics. It is found that liquid slugs from the flowline naturally dissipate to some extent in the riser as a consequence of compression of succeeding bubble that rapidly expands and break through the liquid slug preceding it when it enters the riser. The experimental work corroborates the general consensus that slug flow does not exist in large diameter vertical upflow condition. Experimental data has been further compared to increase the confidence on the existing two phase flow knowledge on large diameter vertical riser: (a) by comparing with other experimental studies on large diameter vertical upflow in which generally, a good agreement was found, (b) by assessing the predictive capability of void fraction correlations/pressure gradient methods. The important implication of this assessment is that the mechanistic approach based on specific flow regime in determining the void fraction and pressure gradient is more successful than conventional empirical based approaches. The assessment also proposes a proposed set a of flow regime specific correlations that recommends void fraction correlations based on their performances in the individual flow regimes. Finally, a numerical model to study the hydrodynamic behaviour in the large diameter horizontal flowline-vertical riser system is developed using multiphase flow simulator OLGA. The simulated results show satisfactory agreement for the stable flows while discrepancies were noted for highly intermittent flows. The real time boundary application was partially successful in qualitatively reproducing the trends. The discrepancies between the predicted results and experimental data are likely {{to be related to the}} incorrect closure relations used based on incorrect flow regimes predictions. The existence of the multiple roots in the OLGA code is also reported for the first time. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

It is found that the dominant mode numbers, the maximum root mean square amplitudes, the dominant frequencies and the fatigue damage indices increase with the flow velocity. A standing wave response is observed for the single-mode in-line (IL) and cross-flow (CF) vibrations. Dual resonance is found to occur at most of the locations along the riser.

40|$|A {{computer}} program is {{developed for the}} dynamic analysis of a spar platform coupled with mooring lines and risers in waves, winds, and currents. The new multi-contact analysis program is developed for the nonlinear multi-contact coupling between <b>vertical</b> <b>risers</b> and guide frames inside of the spar moon-pool. The program extends capability of the current coupled dynamic analysis program, WINPOST, by adding the capability of analyzing riser effects caused by the contact forces and moments from buoyancy-cans inside the spar moon-pool on the global spar motions. The gap between the buoyancy can and riser guide frames are modeled using three different types of nonlinear gap springs. The new riser model also considers the Coulomb damping between the buoyancy-cans and riser guide frames, and it also calculates the impact force on risers for use in fatigue analysis. The spar platform generally uses <b>vertical</b> <b>risers</b> with dry trees. However, as the water depth increases, {{the size of the}} buoyancy-can increases, and it makes installation more difficult. The pneumatic riser support system does not use buoyancy-cans and is an alternative solution to the buoyancy-can approach. The dynamic characteristics of pneumatic riser support system are studied by using the newly developed numerical analysis program. The damped Mathieu instability diagram for the damped Mathieu's equation is developed. Due to spar heave and pitch coupling, Mathieu's instability may become excited in long period waves. In the numerical analysis program, pitch and roll hydrostatic stiffness are recalculated for heave motion in every time step to check Mathieu's instability for the spar platform. Simplified vortex-induced vibration effects on the spar platform are considered in newly developed numerical analysis program, and the results are systematically compared with those of the original program WINPOST. The results in this paper show that the buoyancy-can effect significantly reduces the spar pitch motion, and the Coulomb damping effect also significantly reduces the spar heave motion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a weak structural nonlinearity on the dynamical behaviour of a vertical offshore riser subjected to vortex-induced vibration (VIV). Coupling of the riser dynamics with the flow of the surrounding fluid is achieved by attaching a wake oscillator to a reduced model of the structure, which is obtained through the application of the invariant manifold technique for the derivation of nonlinear normal modes. The structure is modeled as an Euler–Bernoulli beam excited at modal frequencies by vortices in the form of wake oscillators of Van der Pol type as shown in Figure 1. The rise may move only in the direction normal to flow (Fig. 1 (b)), an assumption that is quite valid when its flowwise displacement is relatively small.
