For the procedure according to Magdi Yacoub a graft is tailored to create 3 tongues that replace the aneurysmatic aortic wall in the root. The graft is then sutured to the cusp insertion lines. Some surgeons combine this procedure with an annuloplasty. For the procedure according to Tirone David the aortic valve is mobilized even further from the surrounding tissues. A <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> is then positioned around the valve, and the valve is fixed inside the graft with sutures.|$|E
50|$|A {{vascular}} bypass (or <b>vascular</b> <b>graft)</b> is {{a surgical}} procedure performed to redirect blood flow from one area to another by reconnecting blood vessels. Often, {{this is done}} to bypass around a diseased artery, from an area of normal blood flow to another relatively normal area. It is commonly performed due to inadequate blood flow (ischemia) caused by atherosclerosis, {{as a part of}} organ transplantation, or for vascular access in hemodialysis. In general, someone's own vein (autograft) is the preferred graft material (or conduit) for a vascular bypass, but other types of grafts such as polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon), polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron), or a different person's vein (allograft) are also commonly used. Arteries can also serve as vascular grafts. A surgeon sews the graft to the source and target vessels by hand using surgical suture, creating a surgical anastomosis.|$|E

Methods DAFPs were prepared by continuous enzymatic digestion. Canine vascular endothelial cells (ECs) were seeded onto DAFPs in vitro and then the <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> were cultured in a custom-designed vascular bioreactor system for 7  days of dynamic culture following 3  days of static culture. The grafts were then transplanted into the common carotid artery of the same seven dogs from which ECs had been derived (two grafts were prepared for each dog with one as a backup; therefore, a total of 14 tissue-engineered blood vessels were prepared). At 1, 3, and 6  months post-transplantation, ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) were used to check the patency of the <b>grafts.</b> Additionally, <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> were sampled for histological and electron microscopic examination. Results Tissue-engineered, small-diameter <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> can be successfully constructed using DAFPs and canine vascular ECs. Ultrasonographic and CT test results confirmed that implanted <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> displayed good patency with no obvious thrombi. Six months after implantation, the grafts had been remodeled and exhibited a similar structure to normal arteries. Immunohistochemical staining showed that cells had evenly infiltrated the tunica media and were identified as muscular fibroblasts. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the graft possessed a complete cell layer, and the internal cells of the graft were confirmed to be ECs by transmission electron microscopy. Conclusions Tissue-engineered, small-diameter <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> constructed using DAFPs and canine vascular ECs can be successfully transplanted to replace the canine common carotid artery.

5000|$|In the 1970s Garlock, Inc. {{allegedly}} infringed Gore's {{patents and}} was sued by Gore in the Federal District Court of Ohio. The District Court held Gore's product and process patents to be invalid after a [...] "bitterly contested case" [...] that [...] "involved {{over two years}} of discovery, five weeks of trial, the testimony of 35 witnesses (19 live, 16 by deposition), and over 300 exhibits" [...] (quoting the Federal Circuit). On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit disagreed in the famous case of Gore v. Garlock, reversing the lower court's decision on the ground, as well as others, that Cropper forfeited any superior claim to the invention by virtue of having concealed the process for making ePTFE from the public. As a public patent had not been filed, the new form of the material could not be legally recognised. Gore was thereby established as the legal inventor of ePTFE. Following the Gore v. Garlock decision, Gore sued Bard, Inc. for allegedly infringing its patent by making ePTFE vascular grafts. Bard promptly settled and agreed to exit the market. Gore next sued IMPRA, Inc., a smaller maker of ePTFE vascular grafts, in the federal district court in Arizona. IMPRA had a competing patent application for the ePTFE <b>vascular</b> <b>graft.</b> In a nearly decade-long patent/antitrust battle (1984-1993), IMPRA proved that Gore-Tex was identical to prior art disclosed in a Japanese process patent by duplicating the prior art process and through statistical analysis, and also proved that Gore had withheld the best mode for using its patent, and the main claim of Gore's product patent was declared invalid in 1990. (See W.L. Gore & Assoc., Inc. v. IMPRA, Inc., 975 F.2d 858 (Fed Cir 1992)). In 1996, IMPRA was purchased by Bard and Bard was thereby able to reenter the market.

5000|$|In 1972, Valiathan {{returned}} to India {{and had an}} uncertain beginning at the Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. Soon after he moved to Indian Institute of Technology Madras where his responsibility was teaching with low priority for research. Several friends and colleagues, including Dr. Hufnagel wondered whether {{he had made a}} foolish mistake in opting to leave the United States. However he received an invitation from the Government of Kerala where the Chief Minister, Shri Achutha Menon, asked him to develop a hospital for specialities in the new, unoccupied building of Sree Chitra Tirunal Center, Trivandrum, and gave him freedom and authority to accomplish the task.The hospital was set up in two years and patients with cardiovascular and neurologic diseases admitted for treatment. Simultaneously the development of cardiovascular devices was initiated {{with the support of the}} Science and Engineering Research Council of the Government of India. As Sree Chitra Institute grew, it received support from prime minister Morarji Desai and was notified as [...] "An Institution of National Importance" [...] by an Act of Parliament within five years of Dr.Valiathan's leadership [...] In 1975, the demand for prosthetic valves was high in the hospital, which could not be met by imported valves in view of prohibitive cost. The state of Kerala had but one licensed abattoir at that time in Koothattukulam, which slaughtered less than 200 pigs per month and made procine valve development unviable. As autopsies were much fewer, homograft valve development was even less viable. Under these circumstances, Dr. Valiathan and his team opted to develop a mechanical valve of tilting-disc design. The currently marketed Chitra-TTK valve is the fourth model in a series that was developed over a decade of effort. In the first model, the major and minor struts were electron beam welded and the valve was expected to withstand 360 million cycles of disc movement. Unfortunately, the major strut fractured at the weld after a mere 100,000 cycles due to weld embrittlement. In the second model, the disk was made of single crystal sapphire which was inert and blood compatible. The housing was carved out of a block of titanium. This model failed as well because of extensive wear of titanium struts and escape of the disc. The third model had a housing made of a highly wear- resistant superalloy, [...] "Haynes-25", a cobalt based alloy of chromium, nickel and tungsten. This model went through all the tests successfully and several sheep with the implanted valve were alive and well for months until the death of one animal at 3 months after valve implantation. Necropsy showed that the sapphire disc had fractured and caused the death of the animal. This was a major crisis as critics and media did not spare the Chitra team. However the fourth model was a success and more than 100,000 valves have been implanted in patients (till 2016).The multidisciplinary team at the Sree Chitra Institute led by Dr.Valiathan also developed a <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> and a series of disposable devices such as blood bag, oxygenator and cardiotomy reservoir, which are in commercial production in industrial units in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.|$|E

This in vitro study investigated the antimicrobial efficacy of a new, silver-triclosan collagen-coated polyester <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> compared with a silver collagen-coated polyester <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> alone during the first 24 hours. MethodsThe antimicrobial efficacy of the investigated vascular grafts was assessed by performing a time-kill kinetic assay following Clinical and Laboratory Institute Standards-approved guidelines M 26 -A. For {{the purpose of the}} experimental study, the ATCC 33591 strain of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va) was used. All assays were repeated sixfold. Bacterial survival numbers were obtained at 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours using a standard plate count procedure. Bactericidal activity was defined as a 3 log 10 reduction factor (logRF), according to the approved guideline M 26 -A. ResultsBoth antimicrobial vascular grafts achieved > 3 logRF and fulfilled the efficacy criterion for bactericidal activity but performed differently in their speed of antimicrobial action. The silver-triclosan <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> achieved 3. 37 logRF after 8 hours, and the silver <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> showed a 4. 19 logRF after 24 hours. The silver-triclosan graft yielded significantly lower colony-forming units/mL counts after 4 hours compared with the silver graft (4. 29 × 104 vs 1. 03 × 106; P =. 031). ConclusionsBoth antimicrobial collagen-coated polymer vascular grafts showed bactericidal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in vitro. Although the silver-triclosan <b>vascular</b> <b>graft</b> showed a faster antimicrobial efficacy, the silver graft exhibited its antimicrobial properties after 24 hours.

The attachment of endothelial cells (ECs) {{onto the}} inner lumen of synthetic small diameter <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> can improve graft patency; however, significant challenges remain that prevent wide clinical adoption. These issues include {{difficulties in the}} autologous sourcing of ECs, the lack of attachment, growth and retention of the layer of ECs to the graft lumen, {{and the maintenance of}} an anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory profile by the layer of ECs. This dissertation describes the isolation, characterization, and use of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) to improve the performance of small diameter <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts.</b> First, EPC isolation efficiency and expression of critical EC markers was compared between young healthy volunteers and patients with documented coronary artery disease (CAD). EPCs were isolated and expanded from patients with CAD and had a similar phenotype to EPCs isolated from healthy donors, and a control population of human aortic ECs. Second, we assessed the ability to enhance the anti-thrombotic activity of patient derived EPCs through the over expression of thrombomodulin (TM). In vitro testing showed TM-transfected EPCs had significantly increased production of key anti-thrombotic molecules, reduced platelet adhesion, and extended clotting times over untransfected EPCs. Finally, native and TM-transfected EPCs were seeded onto small diameter <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> and tested for their ability to improve graft performance. EPCs sodded onto the lumen of small diameter ePTFE <b>vascular</b> <b>grafts</b> had strong adhesion and remained adherent during graft clamping and exposure to flow. TM-transfected EPCs improved graft anti-thrombotic performance significantly over bare grafts and grafts seeded with native EPCs.
