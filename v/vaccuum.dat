40|$|Simply on CP arguments, {{we argue}} against a Standard Model {{explanation}} of baryogenesis via the charge transport mechanism. A CP-asymmetry {{is found in}} the reflection coefficients of quarks hitting the electroweak phase boundary created during a first order phase transition. The problem is analyzed both in an academic zero temperature case and in the realistic finite temperature one. At finite temperature, a crucial role is played by the damping rate of quasi-quarks in a hot plasma, which induces loss of spatial coherence and suppresses reflection on the boundary even at tree-level. The resulting baryon asymmetry is many orders of magnitude below what observation requires. We comment as well on related works. A first order phase transition can be described in terms of bubbles of “true” <b>vaccuum</b> (with an inner <b>vaccuum</b> expectation value of the Higgs field v = 0) appearing and expanding in the preexisting “false ” <b>vaccuum</b> (with v = 0 throughout). We can “zoom ” into the vicinity of one of the bubbles. There the curvature of its wall can be neglected and the world is divided in two zones: on the left hand side, say, v = 0; on the right v = 0. The actual bubble expands from the broken phase (v = 0) towards the unbroken one (v = 0). We work in the wall rest frame in which the plasma flows in the opposite direction.

40|$|In {{this paper}} three aproaehes to rural {{planning}} are analysed: as planning of non-urban areas, as planning {{of the villages}} and its environment, and finally rural planning integrated into the national economic structure. The first approach {{is based on the}} high degree of planibilitv of land because of its unlimited duration, its irreproducibility and divisibility. This is the approach mainly used in physical planning of rural areas, in planning of land use, in planning land reforms, in dealing with the use of water, and in forestry. In the second approach there is consideration of the village as a rural nucleus, of the rural area gravitating to it, and of inter-rural <b>vaccuums</b> with no settlements. Planning of this kind is found in the following cases: traditional three-field cultivation, the closed village community system, based an irrigation schemes or animal husbandry relying on open fields, common pastures and forests. It is also found in the transformation of villages from agricultural production units into service centers; in farm consolidation schemes; in the cooperative organization of villages following the principle »one village — one cooperative«; in the organization of kolkhozes; in community development planning etc. The third approach to rural planning is based on integrative planning of the socio-economic structure. Rural activities are a component part of social life, and this has to be remembered in rural planning. Rural activities need to be built into the general frame of society, {{in the form of the}} interdependent action of many centers of activity and social decision making. The basic underlying fact is that economic development leads to an ever greater specialization of production and diversification of consumption in such a way that the former is increasingly locally bound whereas the latter is more and more freed from locality. This disequilibrium is the main obstacle which rural planning has to overcome. The magnitude of the task arises from the immobility and indivisibility of the factors of production, the magnitude of the spatial units under consideration and of the level of their economic development. Increase in agricultural production changes the relation between auto-consumption and the local, regional, national and international markets. The absolute figures present a somewhat different picture. Auto-consumption does not change considerably in value, and increase of production is mainly due to access to ever greater markets. Nevertheless this tendency is neither radial nor symmetrical. The interdependence is measured with the aid of input output matrices. In spite of the integrative progress the author believes that rural planning ought to preserve its identity as a special kind of planning for the following reasons: the specific character of land; the fact that the location of activities in rural areas follows different rules from that in urban settlements; there is a difference in the degree of local determination of socio-economic activities which is greater in rural than in urban areas; disequilibrium is greater in the country than in town because of greater specialization of production and less diversification of consumption; there is a greater density of population, of traffic of goods and of capital outlay per area unit in urban than in rural areal. The aims, the actors and instrument of rural planning are analysed. Emphasis is laid on the problem of price parity, income parity and the equal opportunity of mobility, in both the horizontal and vertical sense. The idea that rural planning is an instrument of the urbanization of rural areas is rejected as both areas are subject to changes under the influence of the same forces. Rural planning has to deal with natural and economic risk. It acts as a socialized reductor of uncertainties, as a form of generalized market research, and a universal social insurance scheme. It is optimal when organized in a polycentric way. Finally the size of different social groups carrying out various social activities is discussed...|$|R

The particular analytic solution of the <b>vaccuum</b> Einstein equations proved quite adjustable to mimic the metric functions of all numerically constructed neutron-star models that we used as a testbed. The neutron-star models covered a wide range of stiffness, with regard to the equation of state of their interior, and all rotation rates up to the maximum possible rotation rate allowed for each such star. Apart of the metric functions themselves, we have compared the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit R_ISCO, the orbital frequency Ω≡dϕ/dt of circular geodesics, and their epicyclic frequencies Ω_ρ, Ω_z, as well as the change of the energy of circular orbits per logarithmic change of orbital frequency ΔẼ. All these quantities, calculated by means of the two-soliton analytic metric, fitted with good accuracy the corresponding numerical ones as in previous analogous comparisons (although previous attempts were restricted to neutron star models with either high or low rotation rates). We believe that this particular analytic solution could be considered as an analytic faithful representation of the gravitation field of any rotating neutron star with such accuracy, that one could explore the interior structure of a neutron star by using this space-time to interpret observations of astrophysical processes that take place around it.

40|$|An {{important}} {{issue in the}} use of thrusters on a satellite is the need to minimize the interaction of the plume with components of the satellite such as solar panels, antennas etc. Part of the danger in case of ion thrusters is the bombardment of the components with atomic particles of the neutralized beam which may, as a primary effect, cause material erosion by physical sputtering and, as a secondary effect, redeposition of the sputtered material on the components. Both may lead to malfunctions such as short-circuits or opaque contamination of solar panels etc. We have designed microstructured test chips for probing the effects of erosion in the plume of an ion thruster which may be used as add-ons in terrestrial lifetime testing in large <b>vaccuum</b> chambers at distances comparable with the dimensions of satellites.

Such depth profiles are easily obtained by AFM or stylus profilometer measurements and allow one to determine the etch depth into the silicon with great accuracy and with a high lateral spatial resolution and thus to assess the damage caused by the thruster plume.

40|$|Due to the non-perturbative {{properties}} of QCD at low energies, lattice gauge calculations represent {{the most direct}} approach to investigate the QCD phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. However, upto now lQCD alone {{does not seem to}} be able to completely disentangle the physics of the QCD phase transition and give an explanation of the phase diagram structure. Hence, effective lagrangians are studied, representing a complementary approach to gain understanding and intuition of the physics of the QCD phase transition (see e. g. [1, 2]). We use a relativistic field theoretical model of baryons and mesons built on chiral SU(3) L × SU(3) R symmetry and broken scale invariance, introduced in Ref. [3]. The model has been shown to describe successfully hadronic vacuum masses as well as {{properties of}} nuclear matter, finite nucleii and neutron stars [3, 4]. At high temperatures the model predicts a transition to a chirally restored hadronic phase. In Ref. [5] we have studied the parameter dependence of this chiral phase transition for the case that the gluon condensate χ, which represents the order parameter of the broken scale invariance [1, 6], does not couple to the baryons. In this case the T-dependence of the χ-field is small and no restoration of scale invariance occurs. Then keeping the gluon condensate to its vaccum value (χ ≡ χ 0) is a reasonable approximation. However, this situation changes substantially if the χ-field couples strongly to the baryons. We consider such a scenario by modelling the mass difference between nucleon and ∆ by exchange of instantons [7]. Then this mass difference (≈ 300 MeV for the <b>vaccuum</b> case) is generated by the coupling of the gluon condensate to the baryon decuplet.

The study prepared a low-pH soaking liquid composed of polyphosphate (U, Tarisan U) or a low water-activity liquid composed of glycerol, propylene glycol, and salt. The bean curd was soaked in this, reducing the pH to below 4. 6 and the water activity to below 0. 85. The product storage study results showed that reducing the pH and water activity and then using <b>vaccuum</b> packaging and sterilization allowed the bean curd to be preserved for at least four weeks at below 7 ℃. At below 25 ℃, it could be preserved for at least 10 days. During the storage period, the total plate count, aerobic quality, and number of anaerobic spores were not tested. The study showed that hurdles such as pH value, water activity, low-temperature sterilization, and cold storage could be combined to produce sanitary vacuum-packaged tou-kan curd products. 豆干具高水活性及營養的特色，是十分適合微生物生長的環境，其中肉毒桿菌的預防對真空包裝即食豆干的污染特別重要。為避免肉毒桿菌的危害，本試驗將豆干 (大豆干及小印干) pH 值降至 4. 60 以下，或降低其水活性至 0. 85 以下，並於豆干真空包裝後進行加熱殺菌，以開發防止微生物汙染之真空包裝即食豆干柵欄技術。本試驗利用多磷酸鹽 (特磷素 U，Tarisan U) 及乳酸調製低 pH 值浸漬液，或食用甘油、丙二醇 (propylene glycol) 及食鹽調製低水活性浸漬液，並將大豆干或小印干產品浸於其中，可降低產品 pH 值 (< 4. 6) 或水活性 (< 0. 85) 。由產品貯存試驗結果顯示，殺菌前將豆干的 pH 值降至 4. 6 以下，或降低水活性至 0. 85 以下，再進行真空包裝及殺菌，可讓豆干在 7 ℃ 下至少保存 4 週，在 25 ℃ 下至少保存 10 天；於貯存期間，其總生菌數、好氣性及嫌氣性孢子數均未被檢出。試驗結果顯示，組合 pH 值、水活性、低溫殺菌及冷藏等柵欄，可用以生產衛生安全之真空包裝即食豆干產品。中文摘要	I 英文摘要	II 目次	III 表次	V 圖次	VII 壹、前言	 1 貳、文獻整理	 4 一、大豆製品簡介	 4 二、pH質與微生物之關係	 9 三、水活性與微生物之關係	 12 四、溫度與微生物生長之關係	 15 五、真空包裝定義	 18 六、肉毒桿菌簡介	 18 七、柵欄技術	 24 參、研究架構	 29 肆、材料與方法	 30 一、實驗材料	 30 二、儀器設備	 30 三、實驗方法	 31 (一) 	利用潤濕劑降低大豆干或小印干產品之水活性	 31 (二) 	利用酸化浸漬液降低大豆干或小印干產品之 pH 值	 31 (三) 	真空包裝即食豆干製備	 31 (四) 	即食豆干真空包裝後殺菌試驗	 32 (五) 	樣品保存試驗	 32 (六) 	pH 值測定	 32 (七) 	水活性測定	 33 (八) 官能品評分析	 33 (九) 總生菌數分析	 33 (十) 好氣性細菌孢子數分析	 33 (十一) 嫌氣性細菌孢子數分析	 34 (十二) 黴菌、酵母菌菌數分析	 34 (十三) 統計分析	 34 伍、結果與討論	 35 一、真空包裝即食豆干及小印干產品柵欄組合探討	 35 二、官能品評分析	 35 三、pH值調整探討	 41 四、水活性調整探討	 41 五、殺菌條件探討	 46 六、包裝前殺菌及包裝後殺菌處理真空包裝即食豆干之微生物品質變化	. 47 七、真空包裝即食豆干及小印干產品保存試驗	 59 陸、結論	 63 柒、參考文獻	 6...|$|E
40|$|The ion-induced {{pressure}} instability {{is a hard}} limitation for {{the maximum}} intensity, and hence the ultimate luminosity achievable in a proton accelerator. This instability {{is due to the}} interaction of high intensity proton beams with the residual gas generating positive ions. These ions, accelerated by the beam space charge, impact on the <b>vaccuum</b> chamber wall and lead to the desorption of gaseous species like $H_{ 2 }, CH_{ 4 }, C_{ 2 }H_{ 4 }, C_{ 2 }H_{ 6 }, CO$ and $CO_{ 2 }$. These gases can in turn be ionized by the circulating beam, and initiate a pressure run-away process causing the loss of the stored beam. This phenomenon was first registered right at the beginning of operation of the Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) at CERN in 1970. Later on, a long term evolution of the pressure was recorded for a stable stored beam current where a change of the residual gas composition was measured. In order to adapt the pumping speed and the surface treatments to the desired circulating beam currents, mathematical tools (e. g. VASCO code) exist to calculate pressure profiles in accelerator vacuum systems. A key input for these programs is the desorption yield of the surface, i. e. the number of molecules released by incoming ions and one of the limitations of these programs results from the lack of data concerning the ion-induced desorption yields dependence on the nature and mass of the incident ions. To improve our knowledge of these desorption yields, the ion-induced desorption of Oxygen-Free High Conductivity (OFHC) copper samples has been studied at room temperature for various primary ions: noble gas ions and ions produced by the ionization of the common gases encountered in accelerator vacuum systems, i. e. $H^{+}_{ 2 }, CH^{+}_{ 4 }, CO^{+}$ and $CO^{+}_{ 2 }$. The measured dependence of the desorption yields on the mass, energy and nature of the incident ions is presented and discussed. In this context, the decrease of the ion-induced desorption yield {{as a function of the}} incident ion dose (so called "beam cleaning") has been studied for OFHC-copper and other materials. From these measurements, desorption cross-sections have been calculated and are compared with results from corresponding measurements found in the literature. A model, which relates the sputter yield with the nuclear and electronic energy loss of ions in matter, has been applied to the ion-induced desorption: Conclusions concerning the influence of the mass and energy on the mechanism of desorption are presented...|$|E
