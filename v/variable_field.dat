5|$|Prior to Ehlers' arrival, {{the main}} {{research}} of Jordan's group had been {{dedicated to a}} scalar-tensor modification of general relativity that later became known as Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory. This theory differs from general relativity in that the gravitational constant {{is replaced by a}} <b>variable</b> <b>field.</b> Ehlers was instrumental in changing the group's focus to the structure and interpretation of Einstein's original theory. Other members of the group included Wolfgang Kundt, Rainer K. Sachs and Manfred Trümper.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically <b>variable</b> <b>field</b> and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with soft iron return paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|E
2500|$|Speedball {{is played}} {{in an open}} field that could be {{compared}} to a soccer field, it is flat {{with a minimum of}} natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more <b>variable</b> <b>field</b> layout and some [...] "give" [...] to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric [...] "bunkers" [...] were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as [...] "snake" [...] and [...] "can" [...] bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more [...] "High Tech" [...] in a sense that they are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} levels of {{variable}} printing. The {{most basic level}} involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like mail merge. More complicated variable data printing uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All variable data printing begins with a basic design that defines static elements and <b>variable</b> <b>fields</b> for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the <b>variable</b> <b>fields</b> are filled in with text or images as dictated {{by a set of}} application and style rules and the information contained in the database.|$|R

50|$|A {{standard}} ATLAS program structure {{consists of}} two elements: preamble structure and procedural structure. The ATLAS programming language makes extensive use of variables and statement syntax. An ATLAS statement consists of a flag field, statement number field (STATNO), verb field, field separator, <b>variable</b> <b>field,</b> and statement terminator.

40|$|A {{method for}} extracting {{syntactic}} specifications from heapmanipulating code is described. The {{state of the}} heap is represented as an environment mapping each <b>variable</b> or <b>field</b> to a relational expression. A procedure is executed symbolically, obtaining an environment for the post-state that gives the value of each <b>variable</b> and <b>field</b> {{in terms of the}} values of <b>variables</b> and <b>fields</b> of the pre-state. Approximation is introduced by forming relational unions at merge points in the control flow graph, and by widening union-of-join expressions to transitive closures. The resulting analysis is linear in the length of the code and the number of fields, but capable of producing non-trivial specifications of surprising accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{diabetic}} ulcers affect approximately 15 % {{of patients}} with diabetes worldwide. Currently, applied electric fields are being investigated as a reliable and cost-effective treatment. This in vitro study aimed {{to determine the effects}} of a constant and spatially <b>variable</b> electric <b>field</b> on three factors: endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angiogenic gene expression. Results for a constant electric field of 0. 01 V demonstrated that migration at short time points increased 20 -fold and proliferation at long time points increased by a factor of 1. 40. Results for a spatially <b>variable</b> electric <b>field</b> did not increase directional migration, but increased proliferation by a factor of 1. 39 and by a factor of 1. 55 after application of 1. 00 V and 0. 01 V, respectively.

A very few lenses, such as the Konica M-Hexanon Dual or Leica Tri-Elmar, let the user select among two or three focal lengths; the viewfinder must be designed to work with all focal lengths of any lens used.

50|$|Leith Links is {{noteworthy}} for its {{high concentration of}} mature elms, despite losses to Dutch elm disease. Of some 270 mature trees in the park in 2013, just under half were elms. Most are wych elm, though there are also examples of Huntingdon Elm, of the <b>variable</b> <b>Field</b> Elm, of exotic species like European White Elm and Japanese Elm, and of rare cultivars. At {{the east end of}} Claremont Park there is a (now rare) mature English Elm. Losses to disease have to some extent been made good by planting of disease-resistant elm-cultivars such as Ulmus 'Regal'. Elms were originally preferred for planting because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds.|$|E

From 1 to 8 bytes (8 data bits and 1 parity bit per byte) could be read or written to processor storage in a single cycle.
