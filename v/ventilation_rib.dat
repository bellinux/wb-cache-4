40|$|Ribs are {{primarily}} made of cortical bone and {{are necessary for}} chest expansion and <b>ventilation.</b> <b>Rib</b> fractures represent {{the most common type}} of non-traumatic fractures in the elderly yet few studies have focused on the biology of rib fragility. Here, we show that deletion of bcatenin in Col 1 a 2 expressing osteoblasts of adult mice leads to aggressive osteoclastogenesis with increased serum levels of the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL, extensive rib resorption, multiple spontaneous rib fractures and chest wall deformities. Within days of osteoblast specific bcatenin deletion, animals die from respiratory failure with a vanishing rib cage that is unable to sustain ventilation. Increased bone resorption is also observed in the vertebrae and femur. Treatment with the bisphosphonate pamidronate delayed but did not prevent death o...|$|E
40|$|In Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), {{electrical}} energy is applied and {{measured at the}} boundary of a medium to produce an image of its internal conductivity distribution. When imaging pulmonary <b>ventilation,</b> <b>rib</b> cage expansion and body posture introduce severe image artefacts in the reconstructed images due to electrode position error. This thesis proposes a method to reduce such artefacts by determining the net displacement of electrodes between measurement frames, and effectively, adjusting the geometry of the reconstruction model. A novel regularization method is proposed and validated using data acquired from simulation, phantom, and human in vivo measurements. The proposed method reduces artefacts by more than 70 % in simulated reconstructions and phantom experiments. The in vivo images reveal the various breathing manoeuvres and thoracic movements recorded. Furthermore, the displacement of each electrode is calculated, indicating the deformed boundary shape. This thesis supports EIT for clinical diagnostics and monitoring of pulmonary ventilation...|$|E
5000|$|A bayonet {{could be}} {{attached}} to {{the front end of the}} barrel of the Military version of the Model 1200. The primary uses of the bayonet on the model 1200 are for close combat, guarding prisoners, and riot duty. [...] The most commonly used bayonet with the Model 1200 was the M1917 bayonet. After World War I ended, there was a large surplus of the M-1917 bayonets because the Army decided to keep the M1903 Springfield as the standard issued rifle. The M-1917 bayonet did not fit the Springfield rifles so instead of just getting rid of them, the Army decided to make newer shotguns compatible with the bayonets. [...] Model 1200 shotguns with bayonet lugs and <b>ventilation</b> <b>ribs</b> were still in U.S. Army inventories as late as the invasion of Iraq 2003. During the Iraq war the Model 1200 shotguns were phased out in favor of Mossberg 500 shotguns.|$|R
40|$|During {{increased}} <b>ventilation,</b> inspiratory <b>rib</b> cage muscles {{have been}} suggested to take over part of diaphragmatic work after the diaphragm fatigues. We investigated {{the extent to which}} this proposed change in muscle recruitment is associated with changes in the relative contribution of chest wall compartments to tidal volume (V(T)). Thirteen healthy subjects performed 1 h of fatiguing normocapnic hyperpnoea. Chest wall volumes were assessed by optoelectronic plethysmography. While breathing frequency increased (43 ± 3 to 56 ± 5 breaths min(- 1), p= 0. 006) and V(T) decreased during normocapnic hyperpnoea (2. 6 ± 0. 2 to 1. 9 ± 0. 1 l, p 0. 05). In conclusion, fatiguing respiratory work is not associated with a change in compartmental contribution to V(T), even {{in the presence of a}} change in breathing pattern...|$|R
30|$|Results One {{hundred and}} twelve {{patients}} with equivalent surgical indication of rib fixation were enrolled from January 2011 to August 2016. Fifty-seven patients were not fixed and 55 patients were fixed. Eighty-two (73 %) were men of 57 (20 – 86) years old. The mean ISS was 22 (4 – 66). The mean SAPS II was 25 (6 – 86). Eighty-five patients (80 %) were hospitalized in Intensive care. 72 patients (64 %) had an epidural analgesia. Fifty {{percent of the}} patients were operated on within the first 24  h. Thirty-three patients suffered from pneumonia that occurred on average on the fifth (2 – 10) day. Epidural analgesia significantly decreased the incidence of pneumonia (p <  0.001). Rib fixation had no impact on the incidence of pneumonia (p =  0.1). Both length of stay in hospital and in intensive care were neither reduced by epidural analgesia nor by rib fixation. Epidural analgesia reduced mechanical <b>ventilation</b> duration. <b>Rib</b> fixation didn’t reduce mechanical ventilation duration.|$|R
40|$|In {{tetraplegia}} {{there is}} often paradoxical inward motion of the rib cage during inspiration. The volume of this negative contribution is difficult to estimate but {{can be obtained by}} optical mapping. The partitioning of <b>ventilation</b> between the <b>rib</b> cage and abdomen in six normal subjects, 10 stable tetraplegic patients, and one tetraplegic patient at intervals during rehabilitation has been studied by this technique. In normal subjects the tidal volume and the vital capacity were the sum of positive contributions from the rib cage and abdomen. In stable tetraplegic subjects with similar neurological levels, the rib cage contribution varied widely but the total chest wall displacement could not be predicted from the vital capacity. In the patient studied sequentially rib cage paradox reversed with time after injury, and this was associated with an absolute increase in vital capacity and an improvement in the action of the diaphragm...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in shape}} of the equine thorax during {{locomotion}} are not well defined, {{although it has been}} shown recently that the transverse hemi-diameter changes its dimension by up to 80 mm {{on the side of the}} trailing forelimb during gallop, despite minimal change in thoracic circumference. The aim of this project was to analyse transverse and dorso-ventral changes in {{shape of the}} thorax simultaneously, and to determine if leading limb, treadmill slope and speed have an effect on these shape changes. Reflective markers were placed on the horse's hemi-thorax and movement of the markers was recorded using a motion capture system while the horse trotted and cantered on a treadmill. Treadmill speed and slope, and the lead the horse cantered on were varied to determine the effects these had on transverse hemi-diameter and dorso-ventral diameter. There was a negative correlation between transverse and dorso-ventral changes in thoracic dimension, the strength of which increased with speed on the trailing limb side. On the leading side, the relationship was either weakly negative or positive. The changes in dimension of the hemi-thorax were significantly greater on the trailing side compared to the leading side. Speed had small effects on thoracic shape changes, but inclined exercise caused an increase in transverse hemi-diameter on the trailing side of the thorax. The changes in thoracic shape are unlikely to contribute substantially to <b>ventilation</b> and <b>rib</b> motion is likely to be due to protraction and retraction of the forelimbs. However, it may reflect asynchronous ventilation of lung lobes and partially explain the prevalence of exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage. Chavaunne T. Thorpe, David J. Marlin, Samantha H.
