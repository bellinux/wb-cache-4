25|$|Cells produce GHB by {{reduction}} of succinic semialdehyde via succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSR). This enzyme appears to be induced by cAMP levels, meaning substances that elevate cAMP, such as forskolin and <b>vinpocetine,</b> may increase GHB synthesis and release. Conversely, endogeneous GHB production in those taking valproic acid will be inhibited via inhibition of the conversion from succinic acid semialdehyde to GHB. It is important to note, however, that direct administration of GHB or endogenous GHB already present in the body will not be affected by valproic acid.

We hereby investigated the effect of <b>vinpocetine</b> on vascular calcification using a beta-glycerophosphate-induced cell model.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} found {{additional}} roles for <b>vinpocetine,</b> a potent phosphodiesterase type I inhibitor, in anti-proliferation and anti-inflammation of vascular smooth muscle cells and cancer cells via different mechanisms. In this study, we attempted to investigate whether <b>vinpocetine</b> protected against atherosclerotic development in apoE(-/-) mice and explore the underlying anti-atherogenic mechanisms in macrophages. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: <b>Vinpocetine</b> markedly decreased atherosclerotic lesion size in apoE(-/-) mice measured by oil red O. Masson's trichrome staining and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that <b>vinpocetine</b> significantly increased the thickness of fibrous cap, reduced the size of lipid-rich necrotic core and attenuated inflammation. In vitro experiments exhibited {{a significant decrease in}} monocyte adhesion treated with <b>vinpocetine.</b> Further, active TNF-α, IL- 6, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 expression induced by ox-LDL were attenuated by <b>vinpocetine</b> in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, ox-LDL-induced reactive oxygen species were significantly repressed by <b>vinpocetine.</b> Both western blot and luciferase activity assay showed that <b>vinpocetine</b> inhibited the enhanced Akt, IKKα/β, IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activity induced by ox-LDL, and the inhibition of NF-κB activity was partly caused by Akt dephosphorylation. However, knockdown of PDE 1 B did not affect Akt, IKKα/β and IκBα phosphorylation.

40|$|Inflammation is a {{hallmark}} of many diseases, such as atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, infectious diseases, and cancer. Although steroids and cyclooxygenase inhibitors are effective antiinflammatory therapeutical agents, they may cause serious side effects. Therefore, developing unique antiinflammatory agents without significant adverse effects is urgently needed. <b>Vinpocetine,</b> a derivative of the alkaloid vincamine, has long been used for cerebrovascular disorders and cognitive impairment. Its role in inhibiting inflammation, however, remains unexplored. Here, we show that <b>vinpocetine</b> acts as an antiinflammatory agent in vitro and in vivo. In particular, <b>vinpocetine</b> inhibits TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation and the subsequent induction of proinflammatory mediators in multiple cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. We also show that <b>vinpocetine</b> inhibits monocyte adhesion and chemotaxis, which are critical processes during inflammation. Moreover, <b>vinpocetine</b> potently inhibits TNF-α- or LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and macrophage inflammatory protein- 2, and decreases interstitial infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in a mouse model of TNF-α- or LPS-induced lung inflammation. Interestingly, <b>vinpocetine</b> inhibits NF-κB–dependent inflammatory responses by directly targeting IKK, independent of its well-known inhibitory effects on phosphodiesterase and Ca 2 + regulation.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of <b>vinpocetine</b> on hyperglycemia-facilitated neointimal hyperplasia and explore its possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nondiabetic and diabetic rats were subjected to balloon injury of the carotid artery followed by 3 -week treatment with either <b>vinpocetine</b> (10 mg/kg/day) or saline. Morphological analysis and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining were performed on day 21. Rat VSMCs proliferation was determined with 5 -ethynyl- 20 -deoxyuridine cell proliferation assays. Chemokinesis was monitored with scratch assays, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed using a 2 ', 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H 2 DCFDA) flow cytometric assay. Apoptosis was detected by annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometric assay. Cell signaling was assessed by immunblotting. RESULTS: <b>Vinpocetine</b> prevented intimal hyperplasia in carotid arteries in both normal (I/M ratio: 93. 83 ± 26. 45 % versus 143. 2 ± 38. 18 %, P< 0. 05) and diabetic animals (I/M ratio: 120. 5 ± 42. 55 % versus 233. 46 ± 33. 98 %, P< 0. 05) when compared to saline. The in vitro study demonstrated that <b>vinpocetine</b> significantly inhibited VSMCs proliferation and chemokinesis as well as ROS generation and apoptotic resistance, which was induced by high glucose (HG) treatment. <b>Vinpocetine</b> significantly abolished HG-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK 1 / 2 without affecting their total levels.
