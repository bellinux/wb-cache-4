25|$|Julia is {{mentioned}} in Antony and Cleopatra by Colleen McCullough. She {{is described as}} <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> from a young age and intelligent. Augustus is not discouraged by the fact she is a girl and demands that she be educated {{in the manner of}} a man rather than a woman, describing her as a queen in waiting.|$|E

It {{has some of}} his <b>very</b> <b>prettiest</b> touches--those inimitable Dickens touches which make such a great man of him, and {{the reading of the}} book has done another author a great deal of good." ...|$|R
25|$|Karen Martinez: An overly {{critical}} English {{teacher who}} continually demands more from Mia's writing, though {{this may be}} an excuse to personally pick on Mia. Tina thinks she is <b>very</b> <b>pretty,</b> compares her to Maggie Gyllenhaal, and often comments on her clothes, but turns against her after her B in English. Mia and J.P. decide that it is simply because she didn't like their writing style.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was <b>very</b> <b>pretty,</b> and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E
25|$|As a rule, {{cabinets}} of the 15th {{century were}} rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria {{the lower part}} was often enclosed, {{as well as the}} upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the piece of furniture. A <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the lock plates and hinges, is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|E

"Yes, my dear Agatha, I have; a yacht and a {{ready-made}} crew, and the <b>very</b> <b>prettiest</b> saloon in the world, and sleeping-cabins {{that you}} will think it an honour to be sea-sick in, and a cook's galley with bright copper fittings, and a cook with a white cap, and steam-steering gear if you care to use it, and----" ...|$|R
25|$|Interior doorways {{were often}} {{decorated}} with a broken pediment more or less ornate, and a swag of foliage commonly depended from either side over a background of scroll work. The outside porches so often seen in Queen Anne houses were of a character peculiar to the 18th century. A small platform or curved roof was supported by two large and heavy brackets carved with acanthus scroll work. The staircases were as a rule exceedingly good. Carved and pierced brackets were fixed to the open strings (i.e. {{the sides of the}} steps), giving a <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> effect to the graceful balustrade of turned and twisted columns.|$|E
25|$|Their efforts {{resulted}} in great success. At {{the end of}} the 19th century and {{at the beginning of the}} 20th, M. Levoir in Picardy had attempted the re-establishment of the old Artois type without really succeeding. During that period and until the beginning of the First World War, it was another Picard breeder, Mr. Mallard, who dominated the raising of the breed. But if he produced <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> dogs, as witnessed by his numerous awards in canine shows, they were not always in the type conformed with the description given by contemporary authors. For all their efforts however the Second World War was very damaging for the breed and after the Second World War, it was believed that the Artois was all but extinct.|$|E
500|$|Lacrosse {{was first}} {{witnessed}} in England, Scotland, Ireland and France in 1867 {{when a team}} of Native Americans and Canadians traveled to Europe to showcase the sport. The year after, the English Lacrosse Association was established. In 1876, Queen Victoria attended an exhibition game and was impressed, saying, [...] "The game is <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> to watch." [...] Throughout Europe, lacrosse is played by numerous club teams and is overseen by the European Lacrosse Federation. Lacrosse was brought to Australia in 1876. The country sponsors various competitions among its states and territories that culminate in the annual Senior Lacrosse Championship tournament.|$|E

I shall be charmed {{to give you}} one, and I will pick out the <b>very</b> <b>prettiest</b> for you. As soon as it is old enough, I will bring it to you, already named, and with a ribbon on its neck. What color would you like the ribbon to be?" ...|$|R

I put on my big hat with the wreath of pink roses that Aunt Tommy had brought me from New York and took my spandy ruffled parasol.|$|R
500|$|The {{identity}} of the lists' authors is uncertain. [...] Some editions may {{have been written by}} Samuel Derrick, a Grub Street hack born in 1724 in Dublin, who had moved to London to become an actor. [...] With little success there, he had turned instead to writing, publishing works including The dramatic censor; being remarks upon the conduct, characters, and catastrophe of our most celebrated plays (1752), A Voyage to the Moon (1753) (a translation of Cyrano de Bergerac's L'Autre Monde: ou les États et Empires de la Lune), and The Battle of Lora (1762). [...] Derrick, who lived with the actress Jane Lessingham, was an acquaintance of Samuel Johnson and James Boswell. [...] The latter viewed him as [...] "but a poor writer", while Johnson admitted that [...] "if Derrick's letters had been written by one of a more established name, they would have been thought <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> letters." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerr's {{first film}} role {{was in the}} British {{production}} Contraband in 1940, but her scenes were left on the cutting room floor. With her next two British films—Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of Love on the Dole, [...] "is not {{within a mile of}} Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Futterman called [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] the [...] "best {{number of}} the night". She added that it [...] "mixes slick dance moves and spot-on singing with perhaps a touch too much sexual tension for a student/teacher pairing". Slezak said that [...] "the harmonies were sweet, and the dancing was sexy without {{crossing}} the line into disturbing April–October territory" [...] and gave it an [...] Votta wrote that [...] "the pair don't have any chemistry", but that [...] "they're both <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> {{to look at and}} listen to" [...] and [...] "their interpretation of Latin culture is modern and sexy". Both Chaney and Lynch noted what she called [...] "inexplicably high production values"; the fact that [...] "these two looked great together", danced the merengue [...] "beautifully" [...] and [...] "sounded smooth" [...] drew a [...] "B+" [...] grade from her, while his [...] "B" [...] was given because [...] "the dancing wowed but their voices just didn't connect for me on this empty club version".|$|E
60|$|Spring came, {{and then}} summer; and with summer, the annual visitation of garden parties. The Trenches at Malbury Manor {{were going to}} give a garden party, and Harry and Edie drove across to it. Edie took her husband over in the pony-carriage with the two little greys she loved so well to drive herself: the <b>very</b> <b>prettiest</b> and best-matched ponies, {{everybody}} said, in the whole county of Hereford.|$|R

5000|$|On August 4, 1888, The White Mountain Echo reported: [...] "Champney's {{studio is}} as much visited as ever this summer, {{and there are many}} new {{pictures}} to see. Of the landscapes, there is a view from the new carriage road up Humphrey's Ledge that is beautiful, and another a scene in Crawford Notch, and still another, a picture of Mount Chocorua from Tamworth; there are some lovely new flower pieces ... But perhaps the <b>very</b> <b>prettiest</b> is the old-fashioned pitcher in the kitchen window ..." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee, which would later form the base for the episode [...] "Dalek". It was always {{the intention of the}} production team for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role Langley was chosen, mostly because of his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. He had auditioned for the role on the same day as doing publicity for his leaving storyline in Coronation Street. Reacting to his casting Langley, remarked that [...] "I couldn't have asked for a better next role because Doctor Who is another great institution." [...] Langley describes Adam as [...] "a bit nerdy" [...] and states of his character's attraction to Rose that [...] "she's a <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl and Adam hasn't seen any girls for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Johar first wrote a story, {{which was}} a love {{triangle}} between a tomboy, a <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea {{because he was not}} very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: [...] "It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made." [...] The story also includes a [...] "personal desires vs. parental loyalties" [...] theme, and has some [...] "East meets West" [...] themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World {{were both}} neutral in their {{review of the}} film, giving neither {{specific}} praise nor criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was positive: [...] "This idea has been used quite recently in an Independent film, but not nearly so effectively as {{in the hands of}} the capable Thanhouser players. They give the farcical events an air of reality that goes far to strengthen the comical results. ... She insists on her lover rigging himself up in knightly costume and carrying her off on a horse to be married. The absurdity of this business in modern times is not made as much of as might have been, but it brings plenty of laughter. The actress who played the part of the girl marred her work by turning too often to face the camera. She is <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> and attractive but she should not permit it to appear that she is so well aware of her beauty." [...] Some advertisements by theaters heavily promoted the comedy aspect of the film with generic quips.|$|E
6000|$|... "She'll be a beauty," [...] {{reflected}} Miss Rosetta complacently. [...] "Jane was {{a handsome}} girl. She shall always be dressed as nice as I can manage it, and I'll get her an organ, and have her take painting and music lessons. Parties, too! I'll give her a real coming-out party when she's eighteen and the <b>very</b> <b>prettiest</b> dress that's to be had. Dear me, I can hardly {{wait for her to}} grow up, though she's sweet enough now to make one wish she could stay a baby forever." ...|$|R
50|$|As with Dr. Mallard, Todd and Sciuto {{got along}} <b>very</b> well <b>pretty</b> fast, {{ultimately}} becoming close friends. They would often make plans together, such as spending the weekend {{together at a}} spa.|$|R
60|$|On {{their way}} along the avenue the {{minister}} took occasion to reprove his daughter for the worldliness of her hat (it was a little trifle from New York that she had bought out of the Sunday School money--a temporary loan); and a little further on he spoke to her severely about the parasol she carried; and further yet about the strange fashion, specially condemned by the Old Testament, in which she wore her hair. So Catherine knew in her heart from this that she must be looking her <b>very</b> <b>prettiest,</b> {{and went into the}} rectory radiant.|$|R
500|$|Davenport is {{situated}} on the Iowa site of the river on a very extensive flat of land, gently rising from the River Mississippi for a mile back, when the bluff rises to considerable height affording most beautiful sites for improvements. This is a charming place; buildings good but in some part scattered; streets very wide and beautified with trees on each side; some <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> residences; {{a great deal of}} taste displayed. [...] We have a fine view of the river both up and down. The population is from 1,100 to 1,200. The town has the appearance of a more ancient town than any I have seen on the Mississippi... Davenport is the county seat of Scott county. Supports two lawyers, four doctors, has seven churches... No cholera here- a healthy place. ...Two large steam flouring mills that manufactures 620 barrels of flower per week, one steam saw mill. ...Eight or ten stores here, good ones, some groceries, 3 drug stores, one regular hotel- 2 doggeries... A very fine college [...] at Davenport {{under the direction of the}} Congregationalists; a very fine building, beautifully {{situated on the}} bluffs in rear of the town.|$|E
500|$|The 1974 {{documentary}} film Hearts and Minds, which {{was critical of}} the United States' role in the Vietnam War, featured Coker briefly. Coker, {{at the time of}} filming, had recently returned from {{six and a half years}} of internment in North Vietnamese camps for American prisoners of war– where he had endured torture and other mistreatment by his captors. The film shows a homecoming parade in his honor in his hometown of Linden, New Jersey, where he tells the assembled crowd on the steps of city hall that if the need arose, that they must be ready to send him back to war. Answering a student's question about what Vietnam looked like, he responded: [...] "Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was <b>very</b> <b>pretty.</b> The people over there are very backward and very primitive, and they just make a mess out of everything." [...] Time magazine's Stefan Kanfer criticized the lack of balance in the film's portrayal of Coker, noting that [...] "he camera, which amply records the agonies of South Vietnamese political prisoners, seems uninterested in the American lieutenant's experience of humiliation and torture." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the weekend}} of 8–9 July 1961 Keeler was among several guests of Ward at the Cliveden cottage. That same weekend, at the main house, John and Valerie Profumo were among the large {{gathering}} from the worlds of politics and the arts which Astor was hosting in honour of Ayub Khan, the president of Pakistan. On the Saturday evening, Ward's and Astor's parties mingled at the Cliveden swimming pool, which Ward and his guests had permission to use. Keeler, who had been swimming naked, was introduced to Profumo while trying to cover herself with a skimpy towel. She was, Profumo informed his son many years later, [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl and very sweet". Keeler did not know, initially, who Profumo was, but was impressed {{that he was the}} husband of a famous film star and was prepared to have [...] "a bit of fun" [...] with him. [...] William Shepherd, a MP trusted by MI5, insisted that over the years he often saw Profumo at louche nightspots, including Murray's Cabaret Club during the time that Keeler had worked there, which made it certain that Profumo knew Keeler before the Clivden party. Shepherd [...] suggested that Profumo was the original owner of the gun used in the shooting incident (see below).|$|E
