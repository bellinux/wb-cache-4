5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection {{was caused by a}} <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> their droppings.|$|E
5|$|American crows are common, widespread, and {{susceptible}} to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{infections are}} usually {{treated with a}} {{combination}} of antiviral drugs, each targeting a different stage in the virus's life-cycle. There are drugs that prevent the <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> attaching to cells, others that are nucleoside analogues and some poison the virus's enzymes that it needs to reproduce. The success of these drugs is proof of the importance of knowing how viruses reproduce.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} highly pathogenic {{avian influenza}} A(H 5 N 1) <b>viruses</b> isolated <b>from</b> humans infected in Egypt during 2007 - 2011. All analyzed <b>viruses</b> evolved <b>from</b> the lineage of subtype H 5 N 1 viruses introduced into Egypt in 2006; we found minimal evidence of reassortment and no exotic introductions. The hemagglutinin genes of the <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> 2011 formed a monophyletic group within clade 2. 2. 1 that also included human <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> 2009 and 2010 and contemporary <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> poultry; {{this finding is}} consistent with zoonotic transmission. Although molecular markers suggestive of decreased susceptibility to antiviral drugs were detected sporadically in the neuraminidase and matrix 2 proteins, functional neuraminidase inhibition assays did not identify resistant viruses. No other mutations suggesting a change in the threat to public health were detected in the viral proteomes. However, a comparison of representative subtype H 5 N 1 <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> 2011 with older subtype H 5 N 1 <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> Egypt revealed substantial antigenic drift...|$|R
50|$|Members of the Lipothrixviridae share {{structural}} and genomic characteristics with <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> the Rudiviridae family, which contains non-enveloped rod-shaped <b>viruses.</b> <b>Viruses</b> <b>from</b> {{the two families}} have linear dsDNA genomes and share up to nine genes.

5|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} by some that artificial gene synthesis {{could be used}} to recreate the <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> existing digital genomes, for use in biological warfare. Insertion of the synthesized smallpox DNA into existing related pox viruses could theoretically be used to recreate the virus. The first step to mitigating this risk, it has been suggested, should be to destroy the remaining virus stocks so as to enable unequivocal criminalization of any possession of the virus.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have been developed. In both diseases, the drugs stop the <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Hong Kong's {{transfer}} to China, the territory has suffered coincidentally an economic double-blow: Asian Financial Crisis and the H5N1 avian flu pandemic. The then-Financial Secretary, Sir Donald Tsang, adopted a radical measure {{to make use}} of British Hong Kong foreign currency reserves and restored Hong Kong's financial stability.

40|$|Objectives:We {{characterized}} pairwise {{and higher}} order patterns of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibi-tor (NNRTI) -selected mutations because multiple mutations are usually required for clinically significant resist-ance to second-generation NNRTIs.

40|$|The {{nucleic acid}} {{sequences}} of the pre-membrane/ membrane and envelope protein genes of 23 geographically and temporally distinct dengue (DEN) - 3 viruses were determined. This was accomplished by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of the structural genes followed by automated DNA sequence analysis. Comparison of {{nucleic acid sequences}} revealed that similarity among the viruses was greater than 90 %. The similarity among deduced amino acids was between 95 % and 200 %, {{and in many cases}} identical amino acid substitutions occurred among <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> similar geographical regions. Alignment of nucleic acid sequences followed by parsimony analysis allowed the generation of phylo-genetic trees, demonstrating that geographically independent evolution of DEN- 3 viruses had occurred. The DEN- 3 viruses were separated into four genetically distinct subtypes. Subtype I consists of <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and the South Pacific islands; subtype II consists of <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> Thailand; subtype III consists of <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> Sri Lanka, India, Africa and Samoa; subtype IV consists of <b>viruses</b> <b>from</b> Puerto Rico and the 1965 Tahiti virus.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout {{the population in the}} presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon <b>virus</b> <b>from</b> the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
