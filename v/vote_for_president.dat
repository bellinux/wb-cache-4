25|$|The Twelfth Amendment {{requires}} each elector to cast one <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> {{and another}} vote for vice president.

Two other faithless electors, David Bright in Maine and Muhammad Abdurrahman in Minnesota, attempted to cast their electoral votes for Sanders, but their votes were invalidated by their states' faithless elector laws; Bright subsequently switched his vote to Clinton as pledged, while Abdurrahman was replaced by another elector who voted for Clinton as pledged.|$|E
25|$|Technically {{the voters}} of Iowa cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. Iowa is {{allocated}} 7 electors because it has 5 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 7 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate {{and his or her}} running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 7 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the Electoral College see its {{negative}} effect on third parties as beneficial. They argue the two party system has provided stability because it encourages a delayed adjustment during times of rapid political and cultural change. They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of a {{national}} popular <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> dismiss such arguments, pointing out combined population of the 50 biggest cities (not including metropolitan areas) only amounts to 15% of the population, and that candidates in popular vote elections for governor and U.S. Senate, and for statewide allocation of electoral votes, do not ignore voters in less populated areas. In addition, it is already possible to win the required 270 electoral votes by winning only the 11 most populous states; what currently prevents such a result is the organic political diversity between those states (three reliably Republican states, four swing states, and four reliably Democratic states), not any inherent quality of the Electoral College itself. If all of those states came to lean reliably for one party, then the Electoral College itself would bring about an urban-centric victory.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, {{during which}} the slaves were liberated, Blanchard turned his {{attention}} to fighting secret societies like the Freemasons. He co-founded the National Christian Association (NCA) in 1868 and edited its newspaper, the Christian Cynosure, until his death. In 1872, the NCA reorganized the Anti-Masonic Party, which had been dormant since its merge with the Whig Party in 1840. The platform of the anti-Masonic Party was very brief, and espoused Christianity, temperance, the abolition of secret societies, and a direct <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> and Vice-President of the United States instead of an electoral college. In 1884, Blanchard unsuccessfully sought the candidacy of the American Prohibition Party, the successor of the Anti-Masonic Party, for President of the United States. Jonathan Blanchard's son, Charles A. Blanchard, succeeded him as college president in 1882 and served Wheaton in that capacity until his death in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Based on U.S. Census Bureau {{estimates}} of the voting age population (VAP), turnout of voters casting a <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> was 1% higher than 2012. Examining overall turnout in the 2016 election, University of Florida Prof. Michael McDonald estimated that 138.8 million Americans cast a ballot in 2016. 65.9 million of those ballots have been counted for Clinton and just under 63 million for Trump, representing 20.3% (Clinton) and 19.4% (Trump) of a census estimate of U.S. population that day of 324 million. Considering a VAP of 250.6 million people and voting eligible population (VEP) of 230.6 million people, this is a turnout rate of 55.4% VAP and 60.2% VEP. Based on this estimate, voter turnout was up compared to 2012 (54.1% VAP) but down compared to 2008 (57.4% VAP). A FEC report of the 2016 Presidential General Election recorded an official total of 136.7 million votes cast for President — more than any prior election.|$|E

However, the Jewish community still <b>voted</b> en masse <b>for</b> the Democratic party, and in the 2004 presidential election 74% <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> Democratic candidate John Kerry, in the 2008 election 78% <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> Barack Obama, and in the 2012 election 69% <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> Obama.|$|R
25|$|In 1988 Governor Michael Dukakis (Massachusetts) chose Bentsen to be {{his running}} mate in that year's presidential election, beating out Ohio Senator John Glenn, who was {{considered}} the early favorite. Bentsen was selected {{in large part to}} try to lure away the state of Texas and its electoral vote for the Democrats, even with fellow Texan George H. W. Bush {{at the top of the}} Republican ticket. Because of Bentsen's status as something of an elder statesman who was more experienced in electoral politics, many believed Dukakis's selection of Bentsen as his running mate was a mistake in that Bentsen, number two on the ticket, appeared more presidential than did Dukakis. During the vice presidential debate (see below), Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle spent most of his speaking time criticizing Dukakis as too liberal while avoiding a match up with the seasoned Bentsen. One elector in West Virginia even cast a ballot for him rather than Dukakis, giving Bentsen one electoral <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E
25|$|Of the faithless votes, Colin Powell and Elizabeth Warren {{were the}} only two to receive more than one; Powell {{received}} three electoral votes for President and Warren received two for Vice President. Receiving one valid electoral vote each were Sanders, John Kasich, Ron Paul and Faith Spotted Eagle for President, and Carly Fiorina, Susan Collins, Winona LaDuke and Maria Cantwell for Vice President. Sanders is the first Jewish American to receive an electoral <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>President.</b> LaDuke is the first Green Party member to receive an electoral vote, and Paul is the third member of the Libertarian Party to do so, following the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees each getting one vote in 1972. It is the first election with faithless electors from more than one political party. The seven people to receive electoral votes for president were the most in a single election since 1796, and more than any other election since the enactment of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804.|$|E
25|$|In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, {{supported}} banning {{slavery in}} all the U.S. territories. The Southern states viewed this {{as a violation of}} their constitutional rights and as {{the first step in a}} grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas' votes were distributed nationally and Constitutional Unionist John Bell's votes centered in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a plurality of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally, so Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before his inauguration, seven slave states with cotton-based economies declared secession and formed the Confederacy. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 49 percent. The first seven with state legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for unionists Douglas and Bell in Georgia with 51% and Louisiana with 55%. Alabama had voted 46% for those unionists, Mississippi with 40%, Florida with 38%, Texas with 25%, and South Carolina cast Electoral College votes without a popular <b>vote</b> <b>for</b> <b>president.</b> Of these, only Texas held a referendum on secession.|$|E
