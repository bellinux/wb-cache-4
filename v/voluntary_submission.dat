Each colony paid tribute to either Tyre or Sidon, but neither city had actual control of the colonies. This changed {{with the rise of}} Carthage, since the Carthaginians appointed their own magistrates to rule the towns and Carthage retained much direct control over the colonies.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Family {{is a term}} {{undergoing}} both deconstruction and construction. Both individual {{faculty and}} textbook publishers must address the ways {{that they want to}} approach issues in family sociology courses. Do they want students to problem-solve intimate relationships? Raise awareness of families and diversity? Deconstruct “the ” family? Or analyze the multiplicity of ways families are created and sustained? This paper explores how faculty members answer these questions in their family sociology syllabi. Our data for this paper was collected from <b>voluntary</b> <b>submissions</b> of syllabi from faculty members throughout the United States. We analyzed the data using techniques in the tradition of Wolcott (1994), locating the underlying concepts and themes. Through an exploration of sociology of the family syllabi, we identify overall course orientations, dimensions of variation, and contrasting themes that are used by instructors of family courses. Creating a course or revising a course is hard work. There are so many decisions to make, and, let’s be honest, rarely enough time to do it.

Contrary to the traditional view, Europe had a rich social psychological literature before the Second World War, and much of this early work still is of interest for contemporary social psychology. The Netherlands is used {{as an example of the}} ''colonization'' of Northwest European social psychology after 1945. It is shown that there has been an effort on the part of the older generation to integrate the European heritage and the newer American social psychology.

The colonization metaphor draws attention to the power aspects of knowledge transfer.

40|$|In an {{evaluation}} of current schemes for decision-making, several areas were identified for improvement. Firstly, regulatory requirements are often inconsistent (e. g., there is no human exposure data requirement {{for the assessment of}} agrochemicals). There should be a drive towards standardization so that substances or materials are assessed to a uniform and comparable standard. Secondly, decision-making could be improved by increasing the usage of reported data. Formal <b>voluntary</b> data <b>submission</b> processes should be set up, together with schemes for incorporating the data into the decision-making process. Pharmacovigilance schemes from the pharmaceutical industry may serve as models. Thirdly, the ways in which data are evaluated and integrated may be improved. Klimisch scores provide a good basis for assessing data quality, but additional information is required on the adequacy of studies with regard to specific questions (1). Despite the importance of improved standardization regarding data evaluation (e. g., by more elaborate standards or scoring systems), it is important to allow for a certain flexibility in the way data are interpreted. Fourthly, there is no current link between advances in scientific knowledge and the processes of decision-making. Processes, such as formalized decision analyses, are needed. Finally, uncertainty is not addressed explicitly in decision-making schemes, and uncertainty factors need to be less arbitrary and more evidence-based. There were specific recommendations regarding ecotoxicology. Ecosystem health is a growing concern, and decision-making is increasingly based on in situ diagnostics of low ecological levels of exposure using biomarkers of pollution. A strength of this approach is that biomarkers are measurable in individual organisms, providing early indications of ecotoxicity. Weaknesses include methods of extrapolating mechanistic evidence to the levels of populations and ecosystems. Current decision-making schemes such those of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the European Union Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation are science-based but do to a large extent depend on authority-led judgement. A comparison of the strengths and limitations of individual decision-making schemes may provide the basis for developing an evidence-based toxicological approach.

40|$|Background Understanding {{the ecology}} and {{evolution}} of influenza A viruses (IAV) in mammalian hosts is critical to reduce disease burden in production animals and lower zoonotic infection risk in humans. Recent advances in influenza surveillance in US swine populations allow for timely epidemiological, phylogenetic, and virological analyses that monitor emergence of novel viruses and assess changes in viral population dynamics. Methods To better understand IAV in the North American swine population, we undertook a phylogenetic analysis of 1075 HA, 1049 NA, and 1040 M sequences of IAV isolated from US swine during 2009 – 2012 through <b>voluntary</b> and anonymous <b>submissions</b> to the US Department of Agriculture IAV swine surveillance system. Results Analyses revealed changes in population dynamics among multiple clades of A/H 1 N 1, A/H 3 N 2, and A/H 1 N 2 cocirculating in US swine populations during 2009 – 2012. Viral isolates were categorized into one of seven genetically and antigenically distinct hemagglutinin lineages: H 1 a, H 1 b, H 1 c, H 1 d 1, H 1 d 2, H 1 pdm 09, and H 3 cluster IV. There {{was an increase in}} occurrence of H 1 d 1 in samples submitted, with a concurrent decrease in H 1 pdm 09. H 3 cluster IV exhibited increasing diversification, warranting a reevaluation of phylogenetic nomenclature criteria. Although H 3 N 2 represented 25 % of identified viruses, this subtype was reported in increasing proportion of sequenced isolates since late 2011. Conclusions Surveillance and reporting of IAV in US swine have increased since 2009, and we demonstrate a period of expanded viral diversity.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a genomics tool, ArrayTrack TM, which provides extensive functionalities to manage, analyze, and interpret genomic data for mammalian species. ArrayTrack TM has been widely adopted by the research community and used for pharmacogenomics data review in the FDA’s <b>Voluntary</b> Genomics Data <b>Submission</b> program. Results ArrayTrack TM has been extended to manage and analyze genomics data from bacterial pathogens of human, animal, and food origin. It was populated with bioinformatics data from public databases such as NCBI, Swiss-Prot, KEGG Pathway, and Gene Ontology to facilitate pathogen detection and characterization. ArrayTrack TM ’s data processing and visualization tools were enhanced with analysis capabilities designed specifically for microbial genomics including flag-based hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), flag concordance heat maps, and mixed scatter plots. These specific functionalities were evaluated on data generated from a custom Affymetrix array (FDA-ECSG) previously developed within the FDA. The FDA-ECSG array represents 32 complete genomes of Escherichia coli and Shigella. The new functions were also used to analyze microarray data focusing on antimicrobial resistance genes from Salmonella isolates in a poultry production environment using a universal antimicrobial resistance microarray developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Conclusion The application of ArrayTrack TM to different microarray platforms demonstrates its utility in microbial genomics research, and thus will improve {{the capabilities of the}} FDA to rapidly identify foodborne bacteria and their genetic traits (e. g., antimicrobial resistance, virulence, etc.) during outbreak investigations.

60|$|The {{half-breed}} buffalo-hunters of Red River {{were also}} gregarious. From {{the moment of}} their quitting the settlements they kept together for mutual help and protection. Although a free, wild, and lawless set, they found it absolutely necessary for hunting purposes to organise themselves, and thus by <b>voluntary</b> <b>submission</b> to restraint, unwittingly did homage to Law! On a level plain {{at a place called}} Pembina, three days out from Red River, the whole camp squatted down; the roll was called, and rules and regulations for the journey were agreed upon and settled. Then ten captains were named, the senior being Baptiste Warder, an English half-breed, a fine bold-looking and discreet man of resolute character, who was thus elected the great war chief of the little army. As commander-in-chief Baptiste had various duties to perform, among others to see that lost property picked up about the camp should be restored to its owner through the medium of a public crier, who went his rounds every evening. Each captain had ten stout fellows under him to act as soldiers or policemen. Ten guides were also appointed, each of whom led the camp day about and carried its flag or standard. The hoisting of the flag each morning was the signal for raising the camp. Half an hour was the time allowed to get ready, unless, any one being sick or animals having strayed, delay became necessary. All day the flag remained up; its being lowered each evening was the signal for encamping. Then the captains and their men arranged the order of the camp. The carts as they arrived moved to their appointed places, side by side, with the trains outwards, and formed a circle, inside of which, at one end, the tents were pitched in double and triple rows, the horses, etcetera, being tethered at the other end. Thus they were at all times ready to resist attack from Indians.|$|E
6000|$|It had now entered Dorothea's {{mind that}} Mr. Casaubon {{might wish to}} make her his wife, {{and the idea that}} he would do so touched her with a sort of reverential gratitude. How good of him--nay, it would be almost as if a winged {{messenger}} had suddenly stood beside her path and held out his hand towards her! For a long while she had been oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind, like a thick summer haze, over all her desire to make her life greatly effective. What could she do, what ought she to do?--she, hardly more than a budding woman, but yet with an active conscience and a great mental need, not to be satisfied by a girlish instruction comparable to the nibblings and judgments of a discursive mouse. With some endowment of stupidity and conceit, she might have thought that a Christian young lady of fortune should find her ideal of life in village charities, patronage of the humbler clergy, the perusal of [...] "Female Scripture Characters," [...] unfolding the private experience of Sara under the Old Dispensation, and Dorcas under the New, and the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own boudoir--with a background of prospective marriage to a man who, if less strict than herself, as being involved in affairs religiously inexplicable, might be prayed for and seasonably exhorted. From such contentment poor Dorothea was shut out. The intensity of her religious disposition, the coercion it exercised over her life, was but one aspect of a nature altogether ardent, theoretic, and intellectually consequent: and with such a nature struggling in the bands of a narrow teaching, hemmed in by a social life which seemed nothing but a labyrinth of petty courses, a walled-in maze of small paths that led no whither, the outcome was sure to strike others as at once exaggeration and inconsistency. The thing which seemed to her best, she wanted to justify by the completest knowledge; and not to live in a pretended admission of rules which were never acted on. Into this soul-hunger as yet all her youthful passion was poured; the union which attracted her was one that would deliver her from her girlish subjection to her own ignorance, and give her the freedom of <b>voluntary</b> <b>submission</b> to a guide who would take her along the grandest path.|$|E
6000|$|At {{first sight}} The Ring and the Book {{appears to be}} {{absolutely}} wanting in that grandeur which, in a composition of such enormous length, criticism must pronounce to be a fundamental and indispensable element. In an ordinary way this effect of grandeur is produced either by some heroic action surrounded by circumstances of worthy stateliness, as in the finest of the Greek plays; or as in Paradise Lost {{by the presence of}} personages of majestic sublimity of bearing and association; or as in Faust or Hamlet by the stupendous moral abysses which the poet discloses fitfully on this side and that. None of these things {{are to be found in}} The Ring and the Book The action of Caponsacchi, though noble and disinterested, is hardly heroic in the highest dramatic sense, for it is not much more than the lofty defiance of a conventionality, the contemplated penalty being only small; not, for example, as if life or ascertained happiness had been the fixed or even probable price of his magnanimous enterprise. There was no marching to the stake, no deliberate encountering of the mightier risks, no <b>voluntary</b> <b>submission</b> to a lifelong endurance. True, this came in the end, but it was an end unforeseen, and one, therefore, not to be associated with the first conception of the original act. Besides, Guido is so saturated with hateful and ignoble motive as to fill the surrounding air with influences that preclude heroic association. It has been said of the great men to whom the Byzantine Empire once or twice gave birth, that even their fame has a curiously tarnished air, as if that too had been touched by the evil breath of the times. And in like manner we may say of Guido Franceschini that even to have touched him in the way of resistance detracts from pure heroism. Perhaps the same consideration explains the comparative disappointment which most people seem to have felt with Pompilia in the third volume. Again, there is nothing which can be rightly called majesty of character visible in one personage or another. There is high devotion in Caponsacchi, a large-minded and free sagacity in Pope Innocent, and around Pompilia the tragic pathos of an incurable woe, which by its intensity might raise her to grandeur if it sprang from some more solemn source than the mere malignity and baseness of an unworthy oppressor. Lastly, there is nothing in The Ring and the Book of that [...] "certain incommensurableness" [...] which Goethe found in his own Faust.

But, since they have habits of diligence, and, as far as they are permitted, of enterprise, they seem to be in great part the stuff from which a prosperous State is to be rebuilt in Venice, if ever the fallen edifice rise again. They have sometimes a certain independence of character, which a better condition of things, and further education, would perhaps lift into honesty; though as yet they seem not to scruple to take any unfair advantage, and not to know that commercial success can never rest permanently on a system of bad faith. Below this class is the populace, between which and the patrician order a relation something like Roman clientage existed, contributing greatly to the maintenance of exclusively aristocratic power in the State. The greatest conspiracy (that of Marin Falier) which the commons ever moved against the oligarchy was revealed to one of the nobility by his plebeian creature, or client; and the government rewarded by every species of indulgence a class in which it had extinguished even the desire of popular liberty. The heirs of the servile baseness which such a system as this must create are not yet extinct. There is still a helplessness in many of the servant class, and a disposition to look for largess as well as wages, which are the traits naturally resulting from a state of <b>voluntary</b> <b>submission</b> to others. The nobles, as the government, enervated and debauched the character of the poor by public shows and countless holidays; as individuals, they taught them to depend upon patrician favor, and not upon their own plebeian industry, for support. The lesson was an evil one, hard to be unlearned, and it is yet to be forgotten in Venice. Certain traits of soft and familiar dependence give great charm to the populace; but their existence makes the student doubtful of a future to which the plebeians themselves look forward with perfect hope and confidence. It may be that they are right, and will really rise to the dignity of men, when free government shall have taught them that the laborer is worthy of his hire--after he has earned it. This has been the result, to some degree, in the kingdom of Italy, where the people have found that freedom, like happiness, means work.|$|E
