25|$|In {{the early}} 20th-century, there were mills {{spinning}} thread. As of 1920, {{there were two}} factories in Smyrna dyeing yarn, which were owned by British companies. These companies employed over 60,000 people. During this time, {{there was also a}} French owned cotton spinning mill. The city also produced soap made of refuse olive oil. An ironworks, also owned by the British, produced tools and equipment. Those tools were used to extract tannin from <b>valonia</b> <b>oak.</b> As of 1920, the ironwork was exporting 5,000 tons of product a year. The city also produced wooden boxes, which were used for fig and raisin storage. The wood for the boxes was imported from Austria and Romania.|$|E
50|$|The town is {{surrounded}} by gardens and olive groves. <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus macrolepis), the mass name for acorn cups obtained in the neighboring oak forests and (because of its chemical derivatives) used by tanners, derives its name from Valona, the ancient name of Vlorë.|$|E
50|$|A 31-acre {{nature reserve}} {{within which the}} Village is located was {{declared}} in 1969, mainly of old <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> trees (Quercus macrolepis), {{in close proximity to}} the youth village. Other flora in the oak forest includes Cyclamen persicum, Calicotome villosa, Ephedra, Sea Squill, and Asphodelus microcarpus.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968 a 68-dunam {{nature reserve}} was {{declared}} {{on the land}} south of the moshav. Flora includes Mt. Atlas mastic trees, <b>Valonia</b> <b>oaks,</b> Palestine Oaks, Buckthorns, and Styrax officinalis.|$|R
5000|$|A granite cairn {{marking the}} summit {{was built in}} 1876 {{and serves as a}} {{trigonometric}} station. Upon the relief of Mafeking the young men of the district erected and lit a bonfire on the summit, this was visible for a very great distance. [...] Also in 1900 the Lands Department cleared 20 acres at the foot of Mount Alexander at what was known as Picnic Gully and planted a variety of <b>oaks,</b> predominantly <b>valonia</b> <b>oaks,</b> to supply tanning material to local tanneries. [...] In 1910 the first plantation of pinus insignus (Pinus radiata) was established south of the Oak Forest and the strong demand by Harcourt Fruit Growers led to the subsequent expansion of the plantation to provide wood for packing cases. [...] These plantations were harvested for the final time following the leasing of the plantation areas to Hancock Victorian Plantations. The area occupied by the pine trees is being revegetated with native species.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, a 950-dunam {{nature reserve}} was {{declared}} close by, to the north. The reserve {{is home to}} <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> trees (Quercus macrolepis) and Palestine Oak (Quercus calliprinos). Other flora in the forest includes Pistacia palaestina, Styrax officinalis, Carob, Rhamnus palaestinus, and Judas trees. Most of the reserve is open for experimental grazing by cattle from the moshav.|$|E
50|$|Masad is {{surrounded}} by the Har Kotz Nature Reserve. Among the trees found there are carob, mastic, <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak,</b> Christ's Thorn, Palestine oak, and Jerusalem thorn. The nature reserve derives its name from Mount Qotz (292 m), named for a priestly family that migrated to the Galilee from Jerusalem after {{the destruction of the}} Second Temple.|$|E
50|$|Quercus macrolepis, the <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak,</b> is {{a tree in}} {{the family}} Fagaceae. It used to be {{considered}} a subspecies of Quercus ithaburensis or a hybrid of Quercus libani. It appears to be closely related to Quercus brantii but with cupscales less curved and the cup covering almost all the fruit with sunken apex and shorter petiole.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the nature}} park consists of the endangered sea daffodil (Pancratium maritimum), Syrian juniper (Juniperus drupacea), juniper, <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus macrolepis), laurel (Laurus nobilis), oak, hornbeam (Carpinus), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), cedar (Cedrus), cypress, willow, rose hip, buxus, European cornel (Cornus mas), spurge (Cornus mas), Cercis, pilewort, Crocus, trefoi (Trifolium), hemp and diverse algae species.|$|E
50|$|Smaller {{industrial}} enterprises {{are concentrated}} in Salihli self, where there are 32 brick works and tileries drawing on the region's rich reserves in raw materials for bricks, 2 flour mills, 2 <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> factories, 10 cotton gin factories, 2 grape operating works, 1 feed grain factory, 1 industrial tube factory, 1 tomato dressing factory, 2 olive oil mills, 2 beverage factories, 1 water bottling factory, 1 mineral water company and 1 emery rock factory.|$|E
50|$|The vilayet was {{not known}} for large {{agricultural}} production, despite being described as having fertile ground in 1920. Most agricultural production is kept within the vilayet, being consumed by the population. What was produced, included wheat, barley, maize, chickpeas, gall, and <b>valonia</b> <b>oak.</b> A small amount of opium and cotton was also produced in the region. Silk production {{was active in the}} southern area on a small scale, as was livestock. The area used to mine lead and nickel.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the common}} trees in the {{national}} park, which are found in mixed forests, are elm, ash, plane tree, grapewine, beech, oak, aspen, populus, willow, <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak,</b> Norway maple, black alder, birch, wild apple, wild pear, walnut, wild hazelnut and cedar. Birch is the characteristic tree {{in the region that}} grows on the banks of Munzur River about 1.5 km south of Ovacık town. Oak is the dominant tree of the park that covers the non-rocky hills and slopes.|$|E
50|$|The reserve was {{declared}} mainly {{to protect the}} 240 old <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> trees (Quercus macrolepis). These trees survived for many years {{as part of a}} local Muslim holy site. Some of the trees are 350 - 400 years old. Local folklore tells that 10 of Muhammad's cohorts stopped nearby to rest, but could not find trees to which to tie their horses. They stuck their sticks into the ground, which became the origin of the trees in the area. The story is reflected in the Arabic name for the site, Sejrat el-Asara ("Grove of the Ten").|$|E
5000|$|The British {{described}} Aidin Vilayet {{as having}} a [...] "remarkable variety of agriculture", as of 1920. They produced grains and cotton, specifically in Aydın and Nazilli. The region also produced opium, tobacco, and <b>valonia</b> <b>oak.</b> Fruit {{was one of the}} most popular exports, with figs and grapes being popular. Before World War I, fig production was up, with an expansive increase in production and exportation via railway. Grapes were used to produce raisins and licorice was also produced in the region. It was noted as growing wild along the Büyük Menderes River. It was exported to the United States and United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis (Kotschy) Hedge & Yalt.) is an east Mediterranean endemic, {{xerothermic}} and deciduous tree {{of particular}} interest in forestry. There has been a growing demand lately to include the species in reforestations in Greece which also increased the interest to investigate its response to climate change. The main purpose {{of this research is}} to study <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> from a dendrochronological – dendroclimatological point of view within its Mediterranean distribution range. Materials and Methods: Sampling took place in characteristic <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> stands where cross sections or tree-cores were taken from 40 trees. The cross sections and the tree-cores were prepared and cross-dated using standard dendrochronological methods and tree-ring widths were measured to the nearest 0. 001 mm using the Windendro software program. The ARSTAN program was used to standardize the tree-ring data and to calculate dendrochronological statistical parameters. The inter-annual variability of tree-ring width and the radial growth trend were examined. Finally, tree-ring widths to climate relationships were calculated by orthogonal regression in combination with the bootstrap procedure using master residual chronology and monthly precipitation, temperature data and scPDSI drought index, from October of the n- 1 year up to November of the n year. Results: The master chronology of <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> trees in Western Greece reaches 365 years, with an average ring width of 0. 89 mm and with mean sensitivity being 0. 21. The variation of the tree-ring widths indicates the influence of climate and human intervention in the past. Tree-ring to climate relationships show that <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> growth is positively affected by precipitations in January and March and by drought reduction during June and July. Conclusions: <b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> in Western Greece is a species of great interest for dendrochronological and dendroclimatological studies due to the old age of the trees and the species response to climate variation. The climate factors that mostly affect its growth are winter and spring precipitation and summer drought...|$|E
40|$|<b>Valonia</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis (Kotschy) Hedge and Yaltirik), a {{deciduous}} species {{grown in}} the xerothermic conditions of the east Mediterranean zone of Europe, forms woodlands of open canopy that permits adequate light to reach the ground thus sustaining an exceptionally rich flora. In Greece, these woodlands are mainly used for livestock grazing and considered important silvopastoral systems. Nowadays, {{most of them are}} abandoned and degraded as a result of inappropriate management. For the effective evaluation and sustainable management of these woodlands and the establishment of reliable monitoring systems, a detailed analysis of their plant diversity characteristics across Greece is needed. This paper aims at determining and comparing floristic diversity measures as well as at assessing the impact of human activities on vegetation and floristic diversity of the most characteristic <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> silvopastoral woodlands of Greece. It was found that the truncated log-normal model adequately predicts the species abundance data for eleven out of the twelve woodlands. From the statistical comparison of the diversity indices Q-statistic, Berger-Parker dominance index and Shannon-Wiener measure of equitability, three groups of these woodlands can be distinguished (a) the high-richness group of Pentalofos, Lesvos, Lakonia and Thesprotia, (b) the medium-richness group of Kriti Island, Alexandroupoli, Strofylia and Galaxidi, and (c) the low-richness group of Kea Island, Amfilohia, Almyros and Lilaia. However, the Rényi's diversity ordering diagram showed that, generally, in low levels of entropy inconsistency is the rule and no clear pattern of diversity is extracted reflecting the impact of complex factors. Among them, those related to management seem to mostly determine plant diversity of <b>valonia</b> <b>oak</b> silvopastoral woodlands, with abiotic factors having an occasionally supporting role. Changes of species richness and evenness due to livestock grazing as well as acorn and wood harvesting are further discussed. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|Iron (III) complex with {{a mixture}} of hydrolysable tannins from the fruits of <b>Valonia</b> <b>Oak</b> (Quercus ithaburensis sp. macrolepsis) known as Valex was {{synthesized}} and characterized using various techniques. Stoichiometry of the complex was determined to be M 2 L at pH 4. 4 with the stability constant (K) of 1. 5 ´ 108 L 2 mol- 2. The antioxidant, antimicrobial and antifungal activity of the Fe(III) -Valex complex was studied. The Fe(III) -Valex complex was found to have antioxidant activity but did not show any antimicrobial and antifungal activity against the tested microorganisms...|$|E
