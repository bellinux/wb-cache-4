5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> (1948) {{held that the}} government could not provide religious instruction in public schools.

Similarly, he authored the {{majority opinion}} in Engel v. Vitale (1962), which declared it unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional amendments, {{such as the}} 1868 Fourteenth Amendment, {{according}} to Scalia, were to be interpreted based on their meaning {{at the time of}} ratification.

Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education,</b> {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment, {{particularly}} {{its first}} section, {{is one of}} the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> (1954) regarding racial segregation, Roe v. Wade (1973) regarding abortion, Bush v. Gore (2000) regarding the 2000 presidential election, and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, including those acting on behalf of such an official.|$|E

5|$|Learned Hand {{remained}} in good {{physical and mental}} condition {{for most of the}} last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at Harvard Law School. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of judicial activism, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the Lochner ruling. They included a controversial attack on the Warren Court's 1954 decision in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education,</b> which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling Jim Crow segregation laws. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as The Bill of Rights, the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education,</b> declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71–11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, the ACLU {{prevailed in}} the McCollum <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> <b>Education</b> case, which {{challenged}} public school religious classes taught by clergy paid for from private funds. The ACLU also won cases challenging schools in New Mexico which were taught by clergy and had crucifixes hanging in the classrooms. In the 1960s, the ACLU, in response to member insistence, turned its attention to in-class promotion of religion. In 1960, 42 percent of American schools included Bible reading. In 1962, the ACLU published a policy statement condemning in-school prayers, observation of religious holidays, and Bible reading. The Supreme Court concurred with the ACLU's position, when it prohibited New York's in-school prayers in the 1962 Engel v. Vitale decision. Religious factions across the country rebelled against the anti-prayer decisions, leading them to propose the School Prayer Constitutional Amendment, which declared in-school prayer legal. The ACLU participated in a lobbying effort against the amendment, and the 1966 congressional vote on the amendment failed to obtain the required two-thirds majority.|$|E
