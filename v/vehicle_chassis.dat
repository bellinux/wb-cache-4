5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis.</b> Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E
25|$|When {{they first}} {{appeared}} in the 1920s, colectivos were small buses built out of smaller <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis</b> (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of truck chassis (19501990, by Mercedes-Benz Argentina), not specifically designed for the transportation of people, and were decorated with unique hand-painted drawings (fileteado) that gave each unit a distinct flavor.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the PL-01 is {{similar to those of}} modern {{standard}} main battle tanks. The driver is located {{at the front of the}} vehicle's hull, with the commander and gunner also located in the hull and the unmanned turret mounted in the rear. In addition, there is a rear compartment in the hull which can accommodate four soldiers. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis</b> is based on that of the Combat Vehicle 90.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} nearly 400 items (<b>vehicles,</b> <b>chassis</b> and engines) were acquired, and from 1964 as the woollen {{industry}} started to downturn, a {{wing of the}} former 200000 sq ft Mulhouse spinning mill was chosen to quietly restore and house the collection.|$|R
50|$|The first {{starting}} and charging systems {{were designed to}} be 6-volt and positive-ground systems, with the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis</b> directly connected to the positive battery terminal. Today, all road vehicles have a negative ground system. The negative battery terminal {{is connected to the}} car's chassis.|$|R
50|$|The {{key reason}} for lower {{unsprung}} weight {{relative to a}} live axle design is that, for driven wheels, the differential unit does not form part of the unsprung elements of the suspension system. Instead it is either bolted directly to the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis</b> or more commonly to a subframe.|$|R
25|$|Computers: The {{on-board}} equipment centered around a 2-of-3 computer system. The original LZB 80 design used 8085 microprocessors programmed in assembly language. The programs were interrupt driven, with interrupts {{generated by a}} 70 ms clock, the track receivers and transmitters, the serial interface, and also within the program itself. Interrupts triggered comparison and output programs. Peripheral equipment was arranged around the computers with all interfaces electrically separated and all grounds tied to the cabinet frame which was tied to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis.</b>|$|E
25|$|By April 2000, {{the first}} working {{prototype}} was rolled out, using a <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis</b> {{adapted from a}} United Defense armoured chassis (the Universal Combat Vehicle Platform; UCVP) which includes components from the US M109 Paladin howitzer, M2 Bradley IFV & M8-AGS. The next 2 years saw the system undergo a series of comprehensive tests {{to ensure that the}} Primus was able to withstand the rigours that were required of it. As land in Singapore is scarce, firing tests were first done at the Waiouru Army Camp live-firing range in New Zealand as part of Exercise Thunder Warrior in February 2004. The guns have also participated in Exercise Wallaby at the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland, Australia.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} contract of 25 February 1916 {{it had been}} stipulated that all four hundred units would be delivered that same year: the first hundred by 25 August and the last by 25 November, completing the full order in nine months. Because Schneider had no experience in tracked armoured fighting vehicle production and a true pilot model was lacking, this was highly optimistic. Also the Schneider company had expected {{to be able to}} employ the other major French arms producer, the Forges et Aciéries de la Marine et d'Homécourt, as a subcontractor but this rival proceeded to develop from the alternative prototype ordered by Mourret a heavier tank design, the Saint-Chamond. As a result, the first prototype could only be presented to the Ministry of Armament on 4 August. The Schneider subsidiary Société d'outillage mécanique et d'usinage d'artillerie or SOMUA at Saint Ouen near Paris was only on 5 September able to finish the first <b>vehicle</b> <b>chassis,</b> which would on 8 September be delivered at the training centre at Marly. The first Army tests were carried out on 12 September. On {{the original}} deadline of 25 November the total had risen to just eight vehicles; on 4 January 1917 thirty-two were present. To aggravate matters, these were training vehicles, not fitted with hardened armour but boiler plate.|$|E

2500|$|The Caterham 7 {{range was}} based {{exclusively}} on this Series 3 chassis until 2000, when the SV (Series V, or Special <b>Vehicle)</b> <b>chassis</b> was released, aimed at accommodating {{the increasing number}} of prospective buyers who could not fit comfortably in the Series 3 cockpit. The SV chassis offers an extra [...] of width across the cockpit, at a cost of [...] of extra weight, and both chassis sizes are available today in Roadsport and Superlight variants. The SV chassis subsequently provided the basic dimensions for the Caterham CSR. The suspension was completely redesigned, bringing the front suspension inboard, using pushrods, and replacing the De-Dion rear axle with a lighter, fully independent, double-wishbone layout with new coil/damper units. Additional chassis modifications resulted in a 25% increase in torsional stiffness. The CSR was released in October 2004, with a Cosworth Duratec engine and is currently available from the factory in either [...] or [...] form.|$|E

Some of the Impy Toys read: [...] "Lone Star Road-Master Impy Super Cars" [...] (Ragan 2000, p. 34). To add to the confusion, elsewhere on the base it would usually say DCMT.

5000|$|Rock sliders are {{typically}} made of heavy-duty box section steel, although {{they can also}} be made from tubular steel as well. They run along each side of the vehicle, from just behind the front wheel to just before the rear wheel, just below the level of the door sills. They are affixed to the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis,</b> and their function is to protect the door sills and door bottoms from damage when crossing large obstacles (such as rocks - hence the name).|$|R
50|$|This is {{a method}} that is only usable on body-on-frame design found in some pickup trucks and some SUVs. A body lift is {{performed}} by placed spacers in between the normal mounting points of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis</b> and body. These typically are between 1-4 inches. When a body lift is installed on a vehicle it is very common for linkages and other components on the vehicle to need drop brackets to function properly after the lift. Raising the body permits the fitting of over-sized tires.|$|R

50|$|In the example, {{the tire}} is {{generating}} {{a component of}} force in the x direction (Fx) which, when transferred to the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>chassis</b> via the suspension system in combination with similar forces from the other tires, will cause the vehicle {{to turn to the}} right. Note that there is also a small component of force in the negative y direction (Fy). This represents drag that will, if not countered by some other force, cause the vehicle to decelerate. Drag of this kind is an unavoidable consequence of the mechanism of slip, by which the tire generates lateral force.|$|R
