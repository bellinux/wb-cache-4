40|$|AbstractMucinous {{neoplasms}} of the {{urinary tract}} are very rare. We present a 63 -year-old-women {{who had a}} sessile papillary <b>villous</b> <b>tumor</b> in urinary bladder. Although transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) was performed, the <b>villous</b> <b>tumor</b> repetitively recurred and gradually spread to the entire surface of bladder lumen. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination showed that the lesion was very similar to low-grade mucinous neoplasm arising in appendix vermiformis. There are no reports on appendiceal metaplasia of urinary bladder mucosa. In this case, we describe this unprecedented neoplasm as “villous tumor of the urinary bladder resembling low-grade mucinous neoplasm of the appendix. ...|$|E
40|$|McKittrick-Wheelock {{syndrome}} is a disorder caused by fluid and electrolyte hypersecretion from a colorectal tumor. To present {{the case of}} a patient with a giant rectal <b>villous</b> <b>tumor</b> with McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome who was successfully treated with laparoscopic surgery. The case of a 59 -year-old man who came to the emergency department with syncope, prerenal azotemia, and electrolyte disturbances with a background of chronic diarrhea is reported. His condition was the result of fluid and electrolyte hypersecretion caused by rectal villotubular adenomas. Laparoscopic low anterior resection and subsequent volume and electrolyte replacement therapy resulted in complete recovery. A microscopic examination revealed multiple, well-differentiated adenocarcinomas arising in villotubular adenomas. Laparoscopic surgical resection is a feasible therapeutic modality for McKittrick-Wheelock syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Villous {{tumors of the}} {{duodenum}} are rare, but {{treatment may}} be problematic because of their association with invasive adenocarcinoma. Two cases of <b>villous</b> <b>tumor</b> of the duodenum are described and 39 other reported cases are reviewed. Presenting symptoms were bleeding 27 %; obstruction 24 %; jaundice 22 % and vague dyspepsia 20 %. Diagnosis may be made by radiographic barium contrast evaluation of the duodenum, especially {{with the addition of}} air contrast hypotonic studies and by fibro-optic endoscopy. Twenty-seven per cent of villous tumors of the duodenum are associated with adenocarcinoma. Invasive tumor is more common in patients over 50 years old (35 %), in tumors of the third and fourth portions of the duodenum (44 %) and in tumors over 4 cm in diameter (30 %). Local excision is the treatment of choice for benign lesions. Pancreatico-duodenectomy is recommended for tumors which include invasive carcinoma in patients without distal metastases...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{experience with}} 19 posterior {{approaches to the}} rectum including nine trans-sacral (Kraske) and ten trans-sphincteric (Mason) procedures. This study included 12 men and 7 women, {{ranging in age from}} 18 to 89 years. Surgical indications included <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> in nine patients, various benign problems in four patients, primary carcinomas in three patients, and recurrent cancer in three patients. Eight complications developed in the 19 patients including: four fecal fistulae, two wound dehiscences, one rectal stricture, and one sacrococcygeal hernia. Spontaneous closure of the fecal fistulae occurred in two patients, and two patients required proximal colostomies. Fecal continence was achieved in 18 of the 19 patients. No patient died as a complication of the procedure. No recurrent tumors have developed. The conclusion is that a posterior approach to the rectum is a safe and effective procedure for various benign and for selected malignant conditions. It is particularly suitable for <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> that are too high for transanal resection and too low for transabdominal resection. It is an effective procedure for small, exophytic, mobile carcinomas of the lower 10 cm of the rectum in selected patients...|$|R
40|$|A 67 -year-old woman, who had {{symptoms}} of epigastric pain and abdominal distension, was found, on endoscopy, {{to have a}} large sessile villous adenoma of the periampullary duodenum. Despite the lack of evidence of malignancy, a pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure was performed, {{mainly because of the}} tumor size and site, involving the ampulla of Vater. The presence of the carcinoma was diagnosed only in the resected specimen by definitive histology. Because there is no general consensus on the optimal surgical procedure for the treatment of <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> of the duodenum, especially for the early stages, the indications for the operative procedure are discussed, based on a review of the literature...|$|R
40|$|Five {{cases of}} <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> of the {{duodenum}} are reported, {{all of which}} involve the ampulla of Vater. Three of the five lesions contained either infiltrating carcinoma or carcinoma in situ. Although preoperative endoscopic biopsy was performed on all tumors no malignancy was identified. Frozen sections done {{at the time of}} operation on the three patients with carcinoma also failed to identify malignancy. One patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and four patients had local excision of the tumor. Three of the patients treated with local excision developed recurrence and two subsequently had pancreaticoduodenectomy. Because of the difficulty in making an accurate diagnosis and the chance of recurrence when local excision is employed, strong consideration should be given to pancreaticoduodenectomy as the initial form of treatment of these lesions...|$|R
40|$|We {{reviewed}} the charts of 4 patients with villous adenoma of the rectum {{seen at the}} First Dept. of Surg., Okayama Univ. Med. School between 1971 and 1990. This study included 2 men and 2 women, {{ranging in age from}} 52 to 83 years. Polypectomy was performed on 3 patients with villous adenoma and low anterior resection was performed on 1 patient. Recurrent tumors developed in one of the 3 patients who had undergone polypectomy. In addition, a series of 88 patients with villous adenoma of the rectum reported in Japan were also reviewed. The average age of the patients with villous adenoma was 62. 9. There were 47 men and 41 women. The presenting symptoms of the 69 patients with tumor were mainly bleeding and watery or mucinous diarrhea. The tumor size and invasiveness of malignancy were also examined. The likelihood of malignancy correlated with size of tumor, and none of the lesions smaller than 2 cm contained a malignant tumor site. Surgeons should consider the size, location and malignant change of the <b>villous</b> <b>tumor</b> with as much precise examination before and during operation so that unnecessary over surgery is avoided...|$|E
40|$|En-bloc {{resection}} {{is desirable}} for accurate histopathological assessment of tissue specimens obtained using endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). A new EMR method using sodium hyaluronate and a small-caliber-tip transparent hood has been developed. This is a peeling-off method using a needle-knife for mucosal and submucosal incisions. Long-lasting submucosal thickening resulting from an injection of sodium hyaluronate, and good visualization of the submucosal tissue {{with the aid}} of a small-caliber-tip transparent hood, make the cutting procedures easy and safe. A large superficial gastric cancer and a large <b>villous</b> <b>tumor</b> of the sigmoid colon were endoscopically resected using this method. En-bloc endoscopic resection was successful in both patients. The gastric lesion was an well-differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma, completely resected in a specimen measuring 97 × 50 mm. The colonic lesion was an intramucosal well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in adenoma, completely resected in a specimen measuring 70 × 55 mm in diameter. No significant complications were noted in either patient. The new method of EMR using sodium hyaluronate and the small-caliber-tip transparent hood is a promising method for endoscopic en-bloc resection of large superficial neoplastic lesions, both in the stomach and the colon...|$|E
40|$|Nineteen {{cases of}} <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> of the {{duodenum}} are reported. They have a predilection for the ampullary region, tend to present with obstructive jaundice, especially if malignancy is present, {{and have a}} high prevalence of cancer (12 of 19, or 63 %). Even when biopsies are available, the diagnosis of cancer is frequently missed (5 of 9 proven cancers, 56 % false-negative rate), {{and it may be}} impossible to assess the presence of carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma without complete excision of the lesion. The authors' experience suggests that some small benign ampullary villous adenomas or those with carcinoma in situ can be excised locally but that pancreaticoduodenectomy is preferable in the fit patient for better local control both of extensive benign lesions and cancers without distant metastases...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} more fully {{understand}} the morphological characteristics of <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> of the colorectum, the vascular patterns of six colorectal resection specimens were microangiographically studied. Grossly, villous adenomas were of two main types: pedunculated polyps and carpet-like lesions. Pedunculated villous adenomas had many large stalk vessels in a broad short pedicle, representing a large blood supply to the tumor. The carpet-like lesions were composed of continuous clusters of polyps with stalk vessels and the flat elevated lesions among polyps and at the periphery showed similar vascular patterns to the mucosa of normal colon. In lesions with cancer invasive to the proper muscle layer, scattered ulcerations due {{to the destruction of}} polyps were also observed, corresponding to at least a Dukes B lesion. The above findings could represent very important additional information for endoscopic treatment or local excision for the prevention of hemorrhagic complicatios or incomplete removal of tumor...|$|R
40|$|Carcinomas rarely {{arise from}} the {{urethral}} diverticulum. In this report, we present a case of clear cell adenocarcinoma arising from the urethral diverticulum. A 42 -year-old woman complained of bloody discharge and lower back pain. Imaging studies showed a tumor involving the region surrounding the urethra and cystourethroscopy showed papillary and <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> in the urethral diverticula. Cytology of the urine sediment showed papillary or spherical clusters of atypical cells, some of which had clear abundant cytoplasm and formed mirror ball-like clusters, suggesting adenocarcinoma. Although histological diagnosis was indeterminate by biopsy and transurethral resection (TUR) because of absence of stromal invasion, surgically resected specimen via cysturethrectomy revealed that the tumor was clear cell carcinoma. Urinary cytological findings and immunohistochemical analysis for CD 15, Ki- 67, and p 53 might be useful for accurate diagnosis of clear cell adenocarcinoma that arises from the urethral diverticulum when sufficient materials are not available by biopsy and TUR...|$|R
40|$|Six {{patients}} with seven small, nonampullary duodenal villous or tubulovillous adenomas, {{two of which}} showed mild dysplasia, were treated by laser photocoagulation. The mean size of the tumors was 19 +/- 16 mm. Both argon and Nd-YAG lasers were used. All tumors were destroyed in one to five sessions. Recurrences of the lesion in two cases were successfully retreated, and both patients remained free of recurrence after 33 and 48 months, respectively. After a median follow-up of 59 months, all patients remained in remission, and five {{of them are still}} alive. One died after six months from a bronchogenic carcinoma. After a total of 18 laser sessions, no serious side-effects were observed, two patients exhibiting a transient melena possibly related to the procedure. We conclude that laser therapy is a good alternative to surgery for nonampullary duodenal <b>villous</b> <b>tumors,</b> especially in high-risk patients. Endoscopic follow-up is mandatory to detect and treat recurrence...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} reliability of the endoscopic biopsies in the evaluation of colorectal <b>villous</b> <b>tumors</b> (CRVT). In 163 consecutive patients referred for surgical treatment of CRVT, preoperative evaluation had been routinely done by colonoscopy and multiple biopsies. Tumors were classified in 3 groups: low grade tumors, high grade tumors and adenocarcinomas. Infiltration in depth was staged on the postoperative specimens according to the Dukes-Aster-Coller's classification. All the tumors were completely resected by surgery and definitive pathological diagnosis was established. An exact correlation between the pre- and postoperative staging was observed in 48 % of the cases. Accuracy averaged 54 % in the group-by-group comparison, with an overstaging rate of 6. 7 %, and an understaging rate of 39 %. The incidence of adenocarcinomas was 22 % in the group with clearly benign preoperative biopsies and 50 % in the other cases. There were significantly more B 2 and C tumors among the patients referred after 3 or more endoscopic attempts (33 %) than after one or two sessions (10 %) (p < 0. 0003). We confirm that in spite of multiple endoscopic biopsies, only a complete resection permits an exact staging and an appropriate therapeutic choice...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-one tumors, {{lying in}} the lower two-thirds of the rectum and {{possibly}} suitable for local excision, were analyzed by endorectal ultrasonography (EUS) using the Aloka scanner SSD 520. There were 18 sessile villous adenomas (group I) and 13 invasive cancers 3 cm or less (group II). Preoperative endosonographic staging (uT, uN stages) was compared with the histologic analysis of the specimens (pT, pN) and the possible contribution to therapy was evaluated. In group I, the depth of tumor infiltration was accurately assessed in 89 % of cases. Malignant transformation was suspected in 4 cases (uT 2) and confirmed postoperatively in 3 cases. In group II, {{the extent of the}} tumor was correctly evaluated in 84 % of cases. With regard to the overall differentiation between T 1 and T 2 /T 3 tumors on one hand, and between T 1 /T 2 and T 3 lesions on the other hand, the positive predictive values were 93. 3 % and 100 %, respectively. The negative predictive values were 93. 7 % and 92. 8 %. In group II the search for regional lymph nodes was positive in 4 cases and negative in 9 cases. An accuracy rate of 82 % (sensitivity 75 %, specificity 85 %) was estimated by analysis of the specimens and postoperative follow-up. The exact performance could not be evaluated because a radical resection was not carried out in most cases. EUS was useful for planning the treatment of villous adenomas. A board full-thickness excision was carried out without delay for the four uT 2 <b>villous</b> <b>tumors,</b> allowing safe margins to be obtained in all cases. Using EUS the choice of local excision was questioned for six small invasive cancers (uT 3 and/or uN+), although radical resection was carried out for only two. As high sensitivity could not be achieved when detecting lymphatic metastasis, the choice of limited surgery based on EUS staging requires strict postoperative follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Esophageal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (ESCC) and colorectal neoplasms (CRNs) share risk factors. We aimed to investigate whether the CRN risk is increased in ESCC patients. Methods: ESCC patients who underwent a colonoscopy within 1 year of diagnosis were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were matched 1 : 3 by age, gender, and body mass index to asymptomatic controls. CRN {{was defined as the}} histological confirmation of adenoma or adenocarci-noma. Advanced CRN was defined as any of the following: ≥ 3 adenomas, high-grade dysplasia, <b>villous</b> features, <b>tumor</b> ≥ 1 cm, or adenocarcinoma. The risk factors for both CRN and advanced CRN were evaluated by univariate and multivari-ate analyses. Results: Sixty ESCC patients were compared with 180 controls. The ESCC group had significantly higher numbers of CRNs (odds ratio [OR], 2. 311; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 265 to 4. 220; p= 0. 006) and advanced CRNs (OR, 2. 317; 95 % CI, 1. 185 to 4. 530; p= 0. 013).

40|$|Cardiac myxomas are {{the most}} common benign cardiac tumors and can be {{associated}} with systemic embolization including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The probability of an arterial embolization is closely related to a <b>tumor's</b> <b>villous</b> morphology. In cases of AMI caused by cardiac myxoma, open heart surgery including excision of the coronary artery has been the one of the treatment options for removing the myxoma and embolus from the coronary artery to maintain distal coronary flow. However, preparing for emergent open heart surgery takes a considerable amount of time. Moreover, this time delay can deteriorate the coronary perfusion to the infarcted area and is associated with poor clinical prognosis. So intracoronary catheter aspiration can be an additional option to maintain the distal coronary flow. In this report we present a case with acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction caused by a left atrial myxoma. The embolus in the left anterior descending coronary artery was successfully removed with intracoronary catheter aspiration, and distal coronary flow was restored after the procedure...|$|R
40|$|An 81 -year-old female {{consulted}} a local physician due to diarrhea. Since general fatigue and body weight loss were observed, she was admitted for detailed examination and treatment. Colonoscopy revealed a circumferential giant tumor {{with a maximum}} diameter of 10 cm in the rectum, and biopsy findings indicated <b>villous</b> adenoma. The <b>tumor</b> secreted {{a large amount of}} mucus, and a diagnosis of electrolyte depletion syndrome causing electrolyte disorders was made. We performed endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) as a less invasive procedure. The tumor was so big that the procedure had to be completed in two separate steps and it took 1, 381 min in total. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in high-grade adenoma located in the lower to upper rectum, invading into the mucosa without lymphatic or venous invasion. The stump of the resected specimen was negative for adenocarcinoma, however the horizontal stump was positive for adenoma. We administered steroid suppositories to prevent stenosis. After ESD, general fatigue and diarrhea disappeared and electrolyte disorders resolved. The patient had good clinical outcome without recurrence or stenosis...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancer {{dissemination}} {{depends on}} extracellular matrix genes related to remodeling and {{degradation of the}} matrix structure. This investigation intended to evaluate the association between FN- 1, ITGA- 3, ITGB- 5, MMP- 2, and MMP- 9 gene and protein expression levels in tumor tissue with clinical and histopathological neoplastic parameters of cancer dissemination. The expression associations between ECM molecules and selected epithelial markers EGFR, VEGF, Bcl 2, P 53, and KI- 67 have also been examined in 114 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent primary tumor resection. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry tissue microarray methods were performed in samples from the primary tumors. The gene expression {{results showed that the}} ITGA- 3 and ITGB- 5 genes were overexpressed in tumors with lymph node and distant metastasis (III/IV-stage tumors compared with I/II tumors). The MMP- 2 gene showed significant overexpression in mucinous type tumors, and MMP- 9 was overexpressed in villous adenocarcinoma histologic type tumors. The ECM genes MMP 9 and ITGA- 3 have shown a significant expression correlation with EGFR epithelial marker. The overexpression of the matrix extracellular genes ITGA- 3 and ITGB- 5 is associated with advanced stage tumors, and the genes MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 are overexpressed in mucinous and <b>villous</b> adenocarcinoma type <b>tumors,</b> respectively. The epithelial marker EGFR overactivity {{has been shown to be}} associated with the ECM genes MMP- 9 and ITGA- 3 expression...|$|R

However, whether PCa patients are inherently at a higher risk of colorectal neoplasms (CRNs) is unknown. We aimed to investigate the risk of CRNs in PCa patients. Materials and methods: Patients who had been diagnosed with PCa at a tertiary medical center and had colonoscopy within 1 year of the PCa diagnosis were investigated. Patients were propensity-matched 1 : 2 by age and body mass index to asymptomatic control subjects who had undergone colonoscopy for routine health screening. CRN was defined as histological confirmation of an adenoma or adenocarcinoma component. Advanced CRN was defined as any of the following: 1) histological findings of high-grade dysplasia, 2) inclusion of <b>villous</b> features, 3) <b>tumor</b> ≥ 1 cm in size, or 4) presence of an adenocarcinoma. Risk factors for CRN and advanced CRN were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 191 patients diagnosed with PCa had colonoscopies within 1 year of PCa diagnosis. Of these, 23 patients with a history of previous malignancy and seven with incomplete colonoscopies were excluded, leaving 161 patients in the PCa group. Although presence of PCa was not a significant risk factor for CRN by multivariate analysis, PCa was a significant risk factor for advanced CRN (odds ratio [OR] 3. 300; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 766 – 6. 167; P< 0. 001). Other significant risk factors for advanced CRN were age (OR 1. 050; 95 % CI 1. 003 – 1. 009; P= 0. 036) and body mass index (OR 1. 205; 95 % CI 1. 067 – 1. 361; P= 0. 003), whereas aspirin use (OR 0. 414; 95 % CI 0. 173 – 0. 990; P= 0. 047) was a preventive factor. Conclusion: The risk of advanced CRN may be significantly increased in patients with PCa. Patients with PCa should have a colonoscopy at the time of PCa diagnosis.
