Natural <b>vegetable</b> <b>waxes</b> (esters of monocarboxylic {{fatty acid}} with primary monocarboxylic fatty alcohols, both {{saturated}} with linear hydrocarbonated chains) widespread in composition of horticultural products, {{with a major}} role in their physiology as a barrier to controlled transfer of water and other metabolites. Extruded products {{can be found on the}} foliar surface of fruits (pruine, suberine, cutine, etc.) where they exercise a protective function. The range constantly ascending to the large scale application as a film requires the diversification of the graded range by accessing the synthetic substitutes that requires toxicity demands and also, thermal or mass transfer performances. Polyoxyethylene chains with variable oligomerisation degree grefted with alcohols (phenols) with medium hydrocarbonate chain (C 8, C 9) can be esterified with fatty acids (C 16, C 18) saturated and / or polyunsaturated obtained through the ecological integrated recovery of seed material from tomatoes processing [C 14 (0 ∆) (6, 34 %); C 16 (0 ∆) (31, 6 %); C 18 (0 ∆) (21, 15 %); C 18 (1 ∆) (40, 81 %) ] grown in areas from west of Romania.

40|$|Canola has {{the lowest}} content of {{saturated}} fat amongst oils marketed in North America, and therefore is a valuable nutritional component for food industry and household use. Oils, extracted from vegetable tissues, contain a number of impurities which have to be removed {{in order to make}} the oil suitable for human consumption. One such impurity consists of waxes, which are high melting esters of fatty alcohols and fatty acids, having a low solubility in oils. These waxes make the oil cloudy at lower temperatures. The quantity of waxes in crude oils varies from several hundred ppm to several thousand ppm. If the refined vegetable oil is cooled or stored for prolonged periods of time, then any <b>vegetable</b> <b>waxes</b> present will crystallize and either impart a cloudy appearance to the oil or settle out as a crystalline precipitate. Without further processing (winterization) such vegetable oils are not suitable for market purposes, where the clarity of the oil at lower temperatures or subject to prolonged storage is important. Generally, the method for dewaxing oil consists of carefully cooling the oil followed by crystallization of the wax, which is then removed by centrifugation or filtration. However, winterization is an expensive and energy consuming process and should not be used indiscriminately, especially since the level and characteristics of waxes in canola oil may vary according to crop, variety, climate and soil type. Therefore the ability to recommend winterization to processors and monitor and efficiency of wax removal is an important marketing support tool. Methods currently used for wax determination are unreliable, time consuming and require substantial manual operation. Our objective in this study was to develop a reliable method for direct wax analysis in canola oil, based on high-performance liquid chromatography. We took advantage of new evaporative scattering laser light detector (ESLD) for quantitation of waxes, and combined this technique with Gas Liquid Chromatography (GLC) and mass spectrometry for identification of the waxes. This method allows the performance of automatic and quicker separations of wax esters and provides canola crushers with a valuable monitoring tool...|$|E

5000|$|Votive candles {{are made}} from {{different}} types of waxes including paraffin, soy wax or beeswax. There are different grades of wax with different melting points. Paraffin is often mixed {{with other types of}} waxes, such as beeswax or <b>vegetable</b> <b>wax.</b> This is done to obtain the rigidity necessary for the type of candle being made. The speed at which the candle burns depends on the composition of the wax. A taper candle that sits in a ring-shaped candle holder may have a low melting point and produce little to no oil, whereas a votive candle set in a glass cup may have a very low melting point and turn to oil. Pillar candles, large candles often with multiple wicks, have their own formula. Soy jar candles tend to have a lower melting point than pillars and votive candles. Candle quality also varies widely depending on the candle maker.

Hence, {{a large number of}} functional additives are added to the lube oil to enhance the characteristic properties already present or to impart some new additional properties. Their amount varies from > 1  % to 30  % or more [3]. The lube oil additives commonly used are viscosity modifier (VM) or viscosity index improver [4], pour point depressant (PPD) [5], antioxidant [6, 7], antiwear [8, 9], extreme pressure agent etc. Since multifunctional additives induce more than one of the above performances, research throughout the world is increasingly directed toward producing such type additives. The commercial synthetic acrylate-based additives are non-biodegradable and their widespread use has raised many environmental concerns. Due to increasing environmental pollution the direction towards the development of environmentally benign green polymeric additive in the lubricant chemistry is increasing day by day. There are lots of examples where biodegradable vegetable oils [10, 11, 12] are used for the synthesis of such type of polymeric additives. Sulfurized vegetable oil derivatives are used as lubricating oil additive since long time [13]. The US Patent 4970010 (1990) and 5282989 (1994) disclosed the use of sulfurized vegetable oils as lube oil additive (as extreme pressure and antiwear). Sulfurized <b>vegetable</b> <b>wax</b> esters as an antiwear, friction modifier and extreme pressure additive were described in US pat. No. 4152278.

The application of meadowfoam oil and meadowfoam oil derivatives as lubricant additive was claimed in US Patent 4925581 (1990). US Patent 3849323 refers to blended petroleum products for lubrication containing natural oil, such as jojoba oil.

These market analyses suggest that at £ 900 to £ 950 per tonne jojoba wax could compete in the wax markets and might obtain a share of the market of between 2, 000 and 5, 000 tonnes. At £ 500 to £ 600 per tonne jojoba oil could compete with sperm oil which at present has a market of below 20, 000 tonnes, although this will probably have been eroded to a substantial extent by synthetics by the time jojoba oil is available in quantities of this order. In particular, in this latter market jojoba oil might be used by the leather, lubricants and pharmaceutical industries. If, for illustrative purposes, a 25, 000 tonne market were to be secured and a future yield of 2. 5 tonnes per hectare of oil obtained, a cultivated area of 10, 000 hectares of jojoba would suffice. This is a very small area in global terms and it seems, therefore, that jojoba is unlikely to provide more than a minor new source of income for a few developing countries. Jojoba must be considered as {{one of a number of}} possible plant introductions to arid zones and the need is to direct attention to research priorities which aim at overcoming limitations in the cultivation of the crop.
