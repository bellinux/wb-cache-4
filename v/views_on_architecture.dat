5000|$|Ban's work {{encompasses}} several {{schools of}} architecture. First he is a Japanese architect, and uses many themes and methods found in traditional Japanese architecture (such as shōji) {{and the idea}} of a [...] "universal floor" [...] to allow continuity between all rooms in a house. In his buildings, this translates to a floor without change in elevation. By choosing to study under Hejduk, Ban opted to do something different. Hejduk's rationalist <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture</b> provided a way of revisiting Western modernism and gaining a richer appreciation than the reductive vision of it as a rationalized version of the traditionalist—yet ultra-modern—Japanese space. With his Western education and influences, Ban {{has become one of the}} forerunning Japanese architects who embrace the combination of Western and Eastern building forms and methods. Perhaps most influential from Hejduk was the study of the structure of architectural systems. Ban is most famous now for his innovative work with paper and cardboard tubing as a material for building construction. He was the first architect in Japan to construct a building primarily out of paper with his paper house, and required special approval for his building to pass Japan's building code. Ban is attracted to using paper because it is low cost, recyclable, low-tech and replaceable. The last aspect of Ban's influences is his humanitarianism and his attraction to ecological architecture. Ban's work with paper and other materials is heavily based on its sustainability and because it produces very little waste. As a result of this, Ban's DIY refugee shelters (used in Japan after the Kobe earthquake, in Turkey, Rwanda and around the world) are very popular and effective for low-cost disaster relief-housing.|$|E

40|$|<b>Views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture</b> {{that hold}} a {{significant}} position in architectural theory {{are the ones}} by Marc-Antoine Laugier, a French theoretician from the 18 th century. The research on his architectural theory that {{have been carried out}} so far are quite stereotypical and concern Laugier’s concept of primitive hut as his only significant contribution to architectural theory. It is well-known that the concept of primitive hut {{plays an important role in}} Laugier’s theory and it is what actually maintained his reputation up to now. However, by singling out this concept as an independent one, one actually neglects all the other aspects of Laugier’s theory. The aim of this paper is to present multidimensionality of Laugier’s architectural aesthetics by crossing the borders of architecture and viewing Laugier’s ideas in cultural, philosophical, religious and historical context, as well as applying the integrative process and considering the spiritual paths of the enlightenment movement in the mid- 18 th century. A special attention is paid to considering the aesthetic aspect which represents the gist and an inevitable part of Laugier’s architectural theory. His aesthetic theory is important in forming the classicist style, and despite its radical character, it influenced many architects in France and the rest of Europe. We may see Laugier as one of the first modernists considering his structuralist logic of the constructive circuit of architecture and aesthetic modesty of decoration. Laugier’s functionalist attitude that the constructive circuit should at the same time represent a decorative element of architecture confirms the thesis that modernist approach has its roots in the 18 th century...|$|E
40|$|Traditional and {{contemporary}} Japanese architecture is examined, with {{focus on the}} characteristics of emptiness and changeability, the point of departure being Japanese conceptions of space which are interpreted and described from a Western perspective. According to Japanese cultural tradition space is conceived as a subjective perception, a physical experience and a changeable process. A description and analysis of how these conceptions of space are expressed and perceived in architectonic forms, both in traditional sukiya architecture and in a selection of contemporary works of architecture, is then presented. The buildings discussed in the thesis are, among others, the Katsura villa, the pavilions Rinun-tei and Kyusui-ken in Shugaku-in, Shisen-do, Hillside Terrace, Church with the Light, Villa in Shimo-gamo, Gifu Kitagata Apartment Building and Tofu. The contemporary works of architecture have been designed by Fumihiko Maki, Tadao Ando, Waro Kishi, Kazuyo Sejima and Jun Tamaki. Besides visiting the buildings, articles written by these architects have been studied which convey their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture.</b> These texts reflect both Japanese and Western influences in a global debate about architecture. This thesis is based on a direct experience of various buildings together with a personal Western interpretation.

40|$|This {{study of}} the early work of Benjamin Mountfort is {{concerned}} with establishing the facts relating to Mountfort’s career as an architect, and with analysing the buildings which he designed during his first fifteen years in New Zealand. The main source of information has been documentary material relating to Mountfort’s buildings and to his <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture.</b> The buildings themselves and Mountfort’s plans and drawings form the other major source. The first two chapters deal with Mountfort’s life and architectural principles. They contain discussion of his early training and influences; his reasons for emigrating to New Zealand and his subsequent activities in this country; {{his knowledge of the}} architectural theory of the Gothic Revival; his interest in medieval history and the social and religious reforms of the 19 th century. The next three chapters deal with the buildings and explore the relationship of his church designs to the ideas of the Ecclesiologists; the expression of natural forces and forms in the structure and composition of his buildings; their reaction against classical notions of symmetry, proportion and beauty; the influence of the ideas of Pugin, Ruskin and Downing; {{and the development of a}} new approach to domestic design which foreshadows the English "Domestic Revival". The analysis of the buildings also deals with his use of local materials and his adaptation of forms derived from English architecture to New Zealand conditions.

40|$|During {{the shift}} from the rule of Joseph Stalin to that of Nikita Khrushchev, people in the Soviet Union {{witnessed}} dramatic political, economic, and social changes, evident even in such private aspects of life as residential home interiors. The major architectural style of Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s era, known as Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s Empire Style, was characterized by grandeur and rich embellishments. The buildings 2 ̆ 7 interiors were similarly grandiose and ornate. By endorsing this kind of design, Stalin attempted to position himself as an heir of classical traditions, to encourage respect for his regime, and to signal his power. When Nikita Khrushchev became the country 2 ̆ 7 s leader shortly after Stalin 2 ̆ 7 s death in 1953, he proclaimed that 2 ̆ 2 excessive decorations 2 ̆ 2 were not only unnecessary, but harmful. As a result, the standardized panel buildings produced at his initiative were defined by straight, plain lines, and were devoid of literally any architectural details that were not considered functional. These changes in Soviet architecture were reflected in interior design and furnishings: the minimalist aesthetic became their defining characteristic. The {{purpose of this study}} is to gain, through examination of existing literature, new insight into why a transition to a minimalist aesthetic was happening in the 1950 s and 1960 s in Soviet urban interior design. To achieve this goal, the present thesis analyzes works by contemporary scholars on the subject and examines statements the Soviet government as well as Soviet architects and interior decoration specialists made regarding the state 2 ̆ 7 s <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture</b> and interiors during the period of 1950 - 1960.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work has been to examine the {{correctness}} of my hypothesis that the Bergen School in the 1930 s, through their social interaction, works and writings formed a ”school” and were an alternative to international functionalism, the urban planning ideals {{of the day and}} industrial building designs, and that the school may be the last manifestation of the international Arts and Crafts movement. And furthermore, that within the Bergen School, we find the only architects in Scandinavia in the interwar years who embraced Frank Lloyd Wright’s (1869 - 1959) organic architecture as an ideal. In the context of architectural history, the term ”school” is frequently used of a group of practising architects with {{more or less the same}} thoughts and ideals, who design buildings that have so many features in common that together they stand out from the main stream of contemporary architecture. ”The Bergen School” is a movement in Norwegian architecture that came into being around 1930. The school continued a view on architecture and conservation that had its roots in the English Arts and Crafts movement and that created a synthesis between traditional West Norwegian building styles and architecture. The School renewed its design form inspired by English and American Arts and Crafts architecture, and in its monumental buildings, we glimpse lines connecting it both to medieval building designs and to the Austrian and German secessionists – an urban version of the Arts and Crafts ideals that found their inspiration in pre-classical architecture. A number of architects made up the Bergen School, some of the most prominent of whom were Frederik Konow Lund (1889 - 1970), Per Grieg (1897 - 1962), Johan Lindstrøm (1893 - 1958) and Kristian Bjeknes (1901 - 81). This thesis aims to shed light on the factors that shaped the Bergen School, what affected their <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture,</b> characterised their buildings and conservation work, and what formed the core of their agitation and writings. It covers a period from around 1850 to around 1980, but focuses mainly on the School’s architecture and writings from the 1930 s when the Bergen School most clearly expressed its individuality in its encounter with international functionalism. We may well say that the 1930 s were the decade of the Bergen School. The Bergen School continued to build on an architectural philosophy that manifested itself nationally and internationally in the decade prior to World War I and that was based on the ideals of the English Arts and Crafts movement as they were first introduced and developed by John Ruskin and William Morris in the latter part of the 19 th century. Several of the architects discussed in this thesis were themselves associated with this tradition, and through their studies in Norway and abroad, they were stimulated to continue, develop and practise this architectural philosophy in the interwar years. The interest for traditional West Norwegian building styles within the Bergen School was expressed in the architects’ strong commitment to conserving the past, through surveying and restoration work and in their arguments for improved styles of architecture in Western Norway. In this way they became a manifestation of the dualism in the Arts and Crafts ideals, “the architect creates by preserving”. The concept ”local building styles” therefore became synonymous with an organic connection between tradition and innovation, and between location and building. In this there is a close link to architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright who must have been familiar to the members of the Bergen School through Frederik Konow Lund. In 1934, Raymond McGrath’s book Twentieth Century Houses referred to Konow Lund together with, among others, Frank Lloyd Wright. This book discussed and made clear the differences between the ideals of functionalism and the Arts and Crafts movement, and may have influenced the School’s architects to distance themselves more clearly from functionalism and to continue developing their own regional architecture. The time around 1934 seems to mark a clear shift in the architecture and agitation of the Bergen School. From this time on, the architectural devices in the School’s houses became fewer and fewer, though there was no reduction in the strict demands to detail and the high quality of the craftsmanship. Instead of a more or less replicating approach to the urban wood and brick buildings of middle-class and bureaucratic circles in the 18 th century and the beginning of the 19 th century, they found their inspiration in the more anonymous West Norwegian building style. Through an abstraction and reinterpretation of the design language of West Norwegian architectural styles, and through a resumption and continuation of regional building styles, Konow Lund and his colleagues in the Bergen School created a unique style of architecture in both a Norwegian and an international perspective. Somewhat simplified, we can say that the Bergen School, as it was in the 1930 s, recounted the history of the struggle of regional building styles against international architectural styles, the struggle of craft traditions against industrial presentation and standardisation, the struggle of the peripheral districts against the capital, and last but not least, the struggle of the creative architect against the increased influence of the engineer and the entrepreneur. International research on the development of the Arts and Crafts movement has concluded that this movement came to an end in the 1920 s. In this perspective, the Bergen School is interesting because it continued the ideals into the 1930 s and beyond, and thus may well be considered the last manifestation of the Arts and Crafts movement. The thesis is divided into the following chapters: I. THEORETICAL CONNECTING LINES Here I have explained the factors that affected and shaped the School’s architecture and architectural philosophy, and the influence the architectural environment had on Bergen and the country in general, as well as possible international influences that may have come from where the architects studied, their travels, professional contacts, as well as from contemporary literature and writings. II. THE HOUSE AS A LOCAL ART FORM Through building analyses of selected houses, I have identified formal and structural traits that characterise the architecture of the Bergen School, such as the influences from traditional West Norwegian building styles. These characteristics I have subsequently discussed in the light of the ideals of the international Arts and Crafts movement. III. MAJOR BUILDING PROJECTS Several of the architects in the Bergen School received major commissions that resulted in monumental and urban buildings of high artistic quality and craftsmanship. Through an analysis of selected buildings, I have tried to identify characteristic traits and lines of influence that place them in the context of architectural history. IV. CONSERVATION THEORY AND CONSERVATION STRATEGIES The architects in the Bergen School were all firmly committed to conservation work. I have explained which conservation philosophies the School represented and how these are expressed in their conservation work and restoration projects. V. AGITATION AND ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY In the light of the School’s agitation and writings, I have attempted to study their architectural philosophy in depth and to shed light on the symbiotic relationship between conservation work (recording, surveying and restoration) and the School’s own architecture. Against this background, I have discussed whether the architects of the Bergen School stand out from other Norwegian architects who were seeking a “traditional” design form in the 1930 s. In conclusion, I have summarised the features that characterised the Bergen School and its architectural philosophy, and assessed the School’s contribution to Norwegian and international architectural history. It is my hope that this work can contribute towards giving the Bergen School’s architecture and values their rightful place in the history of architecture, and that the School’s many and varied activities can act as a source of knowledge and a reference base for the architects, architectural students and antiquarian authorities of our times. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

Böylece çizilen rota tartışmayı öncelikle Lefebvre’nin (toplumsal) mekân (toplumsal) bir üründür tezine, yani mekânın mimarlığı da kapsayan fakat onunla sınırlandırılamayacak, ona indirgenemeyecek ve ancak bir bütün olarak topluma mal edilebilecek üretimi sürecine ulaştırır. Ulaştığı bu noktadan itibarense artık tartışma, bir taraftan çeşitli örnekler üzerinden böyle bir yaklaşımın gerekliliğine ilişkin bir sorgulama, diğer taraftansa onun olası sonuçlarını açığa çıkarmaya ve bu sonuçlarla yüzleşmeye yönelik bir çaba halini alacaktır. Bütün bunlar tartışma süresince ele alınan ve farklı nitelikleriyle öne çıkan üç örneğin yardımıyla gerçekleşir. İlk olarak ele alınan Pruitt-Igoe örneği, yıkımı ardından yapılan yorumların içerdiği sağlam bir temele oturmayan varsayımlarla birlikte neden mekânın üretiminin yalnızca mimarın çabalarına indirgenemeyeceğini gösterir. Fakat bunu gerçekleştirirken aynı zamanda mimarın üretimde neredeyse hiçbir söz sahibi olmadığı bir çerçeve çizer. Tartışmada ele alınan ikinci örnek olan Soykırım Anıtı da bu noktada devreye girer ve mimarlığın, sürecin diğer aktörlerine olan bağımlılığını sorgulayarak, mekânın üretiminde nasıl daha etkin bir rol oynayabileceği sorusunu cevaplamaya çalışır ve bunu mimari eylemler ile onların mekândaki karşılıkları arasında doğrusal bir neden sonuç ilişkisi kurarak gerçekleştirir. Bu noktada, Soykırım Anıtı ile sonuçları açısından büyük benzerlik gösteren ancak üretim süreci göz önüne alındığında ondan tamamen farklı olan Torre David örneği devreye girerek bunun her durumda doğrulanamayacağını, açıkça gözler önüne serer. Böyle bir tartışmanın sonucunda artık bağımsız materyal bir gerçeklik olarak değil de sürekli olarak üretilen ve yeniden üretilen karmaşık bir ilişkiler ağı olarak mekânda mimarlığın yerine ilişkin bir değerlendirme yapmak mümkün olacaktır. In {{his book}} “Architecture Depends” Jeremy Till shares the {{following}} anecdote about {{the event that}} ended up changing his <b>views</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture</b> by challenging his assumptions about the role architecture plays {{in the process of}} the production of space: “I was the bright, youngish thing on the block. Or so I thought. Always at the front of lectures, always the ﬁrst to put up his hand. I even did it with Rem Koolhaas, in front of 400 others. A question about his ethical ambivalence, which he knocked back hard with withering brilliance. No more questions followed; no one else was prepared to have skin pulled back in public. I should have learnt my lesson, but didn’t. This time it was a lecture at the Bartlett in the mid- 1990 s, just in the period that Lefebvre was beginning to seep into the cracks left in the shiny surfaces. Ed Soja was lecturing on “Thirdspace,” his homage to and development of the Lefebvrian triad. At the end my hand went up. “Whilst geographers only speculate and comment on space, architects actually produce it [...] .,” I started. At which, pulling himself up to his not inconsiderable full height, Soja cut in and thundered: “WE ALL PRODUCE SPACE. ” The phrase we all produce space that Soja used {{at the end of his}} lecture to stop Till from completing his question, becomes the focal point for this study. However, rather than defining this study’s aim as an explanation of this phrase that lies in its center, it would be much more accurate to define it as an exploration that starts with this phrase and moves forward in order to discover its implications concerning architecture. There is a subtle yet at the same time very important difference between these two approaches. While an explanation generally tries to communicate the result that was reached beforehand as clearly and as efficiently as possible, an exploration focuses on the process that lies behind that explanation, or in other words on the process of obtaining that result. What this means is, as the study progresses from beginning to end, it may arrive at some seemingly counter intuitive or inconsistent results at its different stages of development. It is important to note that this is done intentionally, so that the reader can clearly see the relationships between different moments of the production of space and more importantly, how definitive architecture’s contribution will be in each of these moments. The exploration that defines this study first starts with a discussion about the meaning of the phrase we all produce space and its implications concerning architect’s role in the production process of space. At the first look, it can be seen clearly that aforementioned phrase derives from Lefebvre’s well-known and widely accepted thesis: (social) space is a (social) product. In spite of the fact that after realizing we all produce space does not necessarily say anything different it makes much more sense to disregard it and focus entirely on Lefebvre’s thesis, what makes it more important for the present discussion is the context in which it was used. In the context Soja used it, we all produce space refers to the fact that since space can only be defined as a social product and not as an independent material reality or simply a thing in itself, only the society itself as a whole can be held responsible from its production. In other words, we all as a society in one way or another take part in the production of space and as far as this socially produced space is concerned an architect neither was nor can ever become the only producer. Architects’ claim that they produce space would require a dangerously simplistic conception of space, which in turn could allow them to manipulate it according to their desires. However acceptable or convincing they may be, all these explanations fail to answer one simple question: Why is it so important to re-examine or rethink the role architects play in the process of the production of space? Would this have any practical impact on how architecture functions or is it just a play on semantics? The answers to these questions bring forward the first of three examples that will be examined in detail throughout this study. Pruitt-Igoe housing project is probably one of the very few projects in the history of architecture, which is remembered by the pictures showing how it died rather than lived. Charles Jencks marked the time and date of the demolition as the death of modern architecture and by doing so provided one of the most memorable contributions along with names like Oscar Newman to what is today known as The Pruitt-Igoe Myth. Here myth refers to the mistaken impression that only architecture was to blame for the failure of the project. However, the fact remains that even though architecture played its part in the decline and demolition of Pruitt-Igoe housing project, it was by no means the only cause. A detailed examination even suggests that not only architecture was not alone, but also its contribution to the decline of the project was minimal especially compared to contribution of the social reality of that era. In other words, myth was born out of the lack of the necessary understanding of space as a social product and over exaggeration of the role that architecture plays in its production process. Even though Pruitt-Igoe clearly demonstrate the need to re-evaluate architects’ role in the production process in order to avoid creating further myths, by doing so it also puts architecture in a position where it loses all of its power to affect any kind of change and from where every attempt to escape ends up creating another myth. Then the question here must be is there any other way in which architecture can both be a part of social production process and yet retain its disciplinary identity. The second example examined in this study clearly shows that it is in fact possible to do this. Peter Eisenman’s Holocaust Memorial examined together with his idea of blurring clearly provides a possible escape from the aforementioned position. According to Eisenman when architecture tries to blur the existing framework by introducing a certain level of uncertainty to the mixture, it can open up the space to new experiences and thus become an effective part of the production process. Holocaust Memorial stands today as a testament to the potential of Eisenman’s approach to architecture: Some people come to walk among the blocks to mourn the dead or to experience a rationality that is pushed to an extreme; others come just to enjoy themselves by jumping over those blocks. The Memorial somehow manages to bring together these scenarios and many more each with its own distinct character. However, does this mean that the extraordinary quality of the Memorial can be explained solely by architecture’s contribution to the production process? Third and the final example of this study indicates that although it would be wrong to ignore architecture’s contribution, it would be equally wrong to reduce these kind of unexpected results to architecture, especially since similar effects can be observed even without any contribution from architecture. Torre David is no doubt one of the most well-known examples of this in history. People come together, occupied and turned the unfinished office tower into a housing complex which today provides shelter for over 750 families and more importantly did this in the absence of any kind of contribution from architecture. Torre David clearly shows that how important and defining the role played by people in the process of the production of space can become. After all these discussions it is now possible to understand space as an incredibly complex set of relationships, as an unfinished product that is continuously being produced; to see the architects not as the uniquely capable producers but as one of the many equally important producers of space and finally to talk about space within architecture without turning it into a purely architectural product.

40|$|The {{last years}} we are {{witnessing}} of rapid advances in the industrial automation domain, mainly driven by business needs towards agility and supported by new disruptive tech- nologies. Future factories will rely on multi-system interactions and collaborative cross-layer management and automation ap- proaches. Such a factory, configured and managed from archi- tectural and behavioural viewpoints, under the service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm is virtualized by services exposed by its key components (both HW and SW). One of the main results of this virtualization is that the factory {{is transformed into a}} ”cloud of services”, where dynamic resource allocation and interactions take place. This paper presents a <b>view</b> <b>on</b> such <b>architecture,</b> its specification, the main motivation and considerations, as well as the preliminary services it may need to support.

40|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, {{architectural}} criticism in Belgium was dominated by Geert Bekaert (° 1928). A former Jesuit, Bekaert started his career by publishing numerous essays on religious art and architecture, culminating in his 1967 book In een of ander huis. Kerkenbouw op een keerpunt [In One or Another House. Church Building at a Turning Point]. Frustrated with most of the contemporary production, Bekaert suggested that religious art should encourage a critical and cultural understanding of the sacred rather than foster piety through an outdated symbolism. As he stated in several articles, such a modern stance could be found in the work of his friend, the architect Marc Dessauvage (1931 - 1984). Dessauvage indeed stripped the parish church from all unnecessary imagery and considered it as a piece of social and liturgical infrastructure in the service of the local community. Despite this radical and progressive attitude, he was backed by the Archdiocese’s leadership and quickly became the most prominent church builder of his generation in Belgium. In this paper, we will show how at first, Bekaert somehow acted as Dessauvage’s ghostwriter, elucidating the liturgical and architectural ideas behind his buildings. Conversely, the latter’s churches became laboratories for Bekaert to test his opinions <b>on</b> sacred <b>architecture</b> and religious art. Bekaert thus became convinced that the relevance of architecture (both sacred and profane) depended on its capacity to provide a framework for human existence – an idea that structures his <b>view</b> <b>on</b> <b>architecture</b> up until today. We will therefore argue that Bekaert’s criticism on the church production of his day did not constitute an end in itself but prepared the ground for a long-lasting theoretical reflection about the meaning of architecture in a rapidly modernizing world. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Self-reconfiguration is the {{capability}} of a system to autonomously switch from one configuration to a better one in response to failure or context change. There is growing demand for software systems able to self-reconfigure, and specifically systems that can fulfill their requirements in dynamic environments. We propose a conceptual architecture that provides systems with selfreconfiguration capabilities, enacting a model-based adaptation process based on requirements models. We describe the logical <b>view</b> <b>on</b> our <b>architecture</b> for selfreconfiguration, then we detail the main mechanisms to monitor for and diagnose failures. We present a case study where a self-reconfiguring system assists a patient perform daily tasks, such as getting breakfast, within her home. The challenge for the system is to fulfill its mission regardless of the context, also to compensate for failures caused by patient inaction or other omissions in {{the environment of the}} system. ...|$|R
