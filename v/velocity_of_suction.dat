40|$|Japanese cedar pollinosis is a {{very serious}} problem, because the {{prevalence}} is considered more than 20 % in Japanese. This pollen is carried by the wind, and it invades our nose holes by taking in breath. This paper describes to predict the pollen scattering behavior in the wind and the pollen invasive behavior in taking in breath. The pollen scattering behavior is studied by the numerical calculation and the wind tunnel experiment. The velocity profiles of numerical calculation agree very well with the experimentally measured one by using the optical measurement techniques. The mean flow behavior of the pollen can be predicted by the calculation method of this study. The pollen invasive behavior into the nose hole is studied by using the phantom model. The velocity profiles around the nose hole of the phantom model were numerically calculated and optically measured too.

40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} of this study to find the numerical solution of unsteady magneto hydrodynamic flow of an electrically conducting viscous incompressible non – Newtonian Bingham fluid bounded by two parallel non – conducting porous plates is studied with thermal radiation considering the Hall Effect. An external uniform magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plates and the fluid motion is subjected to a uniform suction and injection. The lower plate is stationary and the upper plate moves with a constant velocity and the two plates are kept at different but constant temperatures. The fluid {{is considered to be}} a gray, absorbing emitting but non – scattering medium and the Roseland approximation is used to describe the radioactive heat flux in the energy equation. Numerical solutions are obtained for the governing momentum and energy equations taking the Joule and viscous dissipations into consideration. The dimensionless governing coupled, non – linear boundary layer partial differential equations are solved by an efficient, accurate, and extensively validated and unconditionally stable finite difference scheme of the Crank – Nicolson method. The effects of the Hall term, the parameter describing the non – Newtonian behavior, thermal radiation parameter and the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> and injection on both the velocity and temperature distributions are studied through graphs and tabular form...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is the study of}} the two {{dimensional}} laminar compressible boundary layer flow, with an adverse pressure gradient in the presence of heat and mass transfer. The partial differential equations and their boundary conditions, describing the problem under consideration, are transformed using the compressible Falkner-Skan transformation and the numerical solution of the problem is obtained by using a modification of the well known Keller's-box method. The obtained numerical results for the velocity and temperature field, {{as well as for the}} associated boundary layer parameters, are shown in figures for different free-stream Mach numbers M 1 and for the case (i) of heating of the wall 8 ̆ 5 Sw > 18 ̆ 6, (ii) of an adiabatic wall 8 ̆ 5 Sw< 18 ̆ 6 and (iii) of cooling of the wall 8 ̆ 5 Sw < 18 ̆ 6, followed by an extensive discussion. The analysis of these results showed that the flow field is noticeably influenced by the pressure gradient parameter, the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> or injection imposed at the wall, the heat transfer parameter Sw and the free-stream Mach number.

40|$|The {{majority}} of teleost fish use suction feeding to capture prey, yet teleosts display a remarkable diversity of feeding morphology. It has been assumed that this diversity results in variation in suction feeding performance, and several {{attempts have been}} made to link morphology to behavioral performance as measured experimentally (Lauder and Clark, 1984; Norton and Brainerd, 1993; Webb, 1984; Werner, 1977) or interpreted through trophic ecology (Huskey and Turingan, 2001; Norton, 1995). However, these attempts have been largely observational in that they did not quantitatively describe the link between morphology and suction feeding performance. The lack of a general and quantitative understanding of the morphological basis <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> feeding performance limits the functional interpretation of fish morphological form, its ecological implications and its evolution. The objective of the present study was to use a biomechanical model of force transmission in the fish head to predict one aspect <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> feeding performance, subambient buccal pressure generation, from morphological parameters in five species <b>of</b> centrarchid fish. <b>Suction</b> feeding on elusive prey involves explosive cranial kinematics that incur hydrodynamic loading, measurable as subambient pressures inside the mouth (buccal) cavity (Alexander, 1969; Van Leeuwen and Muller, 1983). The magnitude of subambient buccal pressure indicates the strength <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> generated by the fish and is expected to increase with the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> water flow into the mouth (Muller et al., 1982). The magnitude of buccal pressure is known to increase with increasing speed of kinematic movement (Sanford and Wainwright, 2002; Svanback et al., 2002) or in situations where increased kinematic speed would be expected, such as increased predator motivation (Lauder, 1980) or increased prey elusivity (Nemeth, 1997).

40|$|Summary. -Experiments {{have been}} carried out in the closed-circuit wind-tunnel at Cambridge University to {{determine}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> distributed <b>suction</b> as a means of controlling and stabilizing the flow in a boundary layer. These experiments have shown that the laminar exponential suction profile can be established and retained, provided the boundary layer is in an undisturbed laminar condition at the start <b>of</b> the <b>suction</b> region. Good agreement has been obtained between the measured velocity profiles and the theoretical exponential form. It has also been shown that the laminar suction profile, when once established, is able to surmount small disturbances which would normally be sufficient to promote transition in the absence <b>of</b> <b>suction.</b> There is, however, no evidence whatever to suggest that laminar flow can be re-established if transition once occurs. The variation with rate <b>of</b> <b>suction</b> <b>of</b> the total effective drag of a flat plate has been investigated.
