40|$|This disser tation {{explores the}} {{relationship}} among creditors in sovereign debt restructuring and specifically focuses {{on the issue of}} inter-creditor equity. It consists of five ar ticles focusing on the core issues regarding inter-creditor equity in the context of domestic insolvency law. It is largely inspired by international developments on the legal reform and practice of sovereign debt restructuring in the past three years. Overall, this disser tation argues that a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring should not {{take the form of a}} collective proceeding and should not include debt claims with all types of maturities. In the context of <b>a</b> cram-down, <b>a</b> <b>safeguard</b> <b>procedure</b> should be put in place to ensure that any amendment of the contract terms imposed by majority bondholders is fair and equitable with respect to minority bondholders who have voted against the amendment. Arbitral tr ibunals established pursuant to international investment treaties could serve as an appropriate forum to develop such <b>a</b> <b>safeguard</b> provision. <b>A</b> new arbitral tribunal, preferably modelled after the tribunal concerning the Bank for International Settlements, could apply the safeguard provision once developed, because not al...|$|R
40|$|Constraints {{nonlinear}} optimization {{problems can}} be solved using penalty or barrier functions. This strategy, based on solving the problems without constraints obtained from the original problem, have shown to be e ective, particularly when used with direct search methods. An alternative to solve the previous problems is the lters method. The lters method introduced by Fletcher and Ley er in 2002,, has been widely used to solve problems of the type mentioned above. These methods use a strategy di erent from the barrier or penalty functions. The previous functions de ne a new one that combine the objective function and the constraints, while the lters method treat optimization problems as a bi-objective problems that minimize the objective function and a function that aggregates the constraints. Motivated {{by the work of}} Audet and Dennis in 2004, using lters method with derivative-free algorithms, the authors developed works where other direct search meth- ods were used, combining their potential with the lters method. More recently. In <b>a</b> new <b>variant</b> of these methods was presented, where it some alternative aggregation restrictions for the construction of lters were proposed.

40|$|The U. S. Support Program to IAEA Safeguards (USSP) {{priority}} {{of training and}} human resources is aimed at providing the Department of <b>Safeguards</b> with <b>an</b> appropriate mixture of regular staff and extrabudgetary experts who are qualified to meet the IAEA's technical needs and to provide personnel with appropriate instruction to improve the technical basis and specific skills needed to perform their job functions. The equipment and methods used in inspection activities are unique, complex, and evolving. New and experienced safeguards inspectors need timely and effective training to perform required tasks and to learn new skills prescribed by new safeguards policies or agreements. The role of the inspector has changed from that of strictly an accountant to include that of <b>a</b> detective. New <b>safeguards</b> <b>procedures</b> are being instituted, and therefore, experienced inspectors must be educated on these new procedures. The USSP also recognizes the need for training safeguards support staff, particularly those who maintain and service safeguards equipment (SGTS), and those who perform information collection and analysis (SGIM). The USSP is committed to supporting the IAEA with training to ensure the effectiveness of all staff members {{and will continue to}} offer its assistance in the development and delivery of basic, refresher, and advanced training courses.

40|$|The US {{has placed}} certain special nuclear {{materials}} declared excess to their strategic needs under international safeguards through the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This Presidential initiative has obligated materials at several Department of Energy (DOE) facilities for these safeguards activities {{to demonstrate the}} willingness of the US to ban production or use of nuclear materials outside of international safeguards. However, IAEA inspection activities generally tend to be intrusive in nature and are not consistent with several domestic <b>safeguards</b> <b>procedures</b> implemented to reduce worker radiation exposures and increase the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of accounting for and storing of special nuclear materials. To help identify and provide workable solutions to these concerns, the Office of Safeguards and Security has conducted a program to determine possible changes to the DOE safeguards and security requirements designed to help facilities under international safeguards inspections more easily comply with domestic safeguards goals during international inspection activities. This paper will discuss the impact of international inspection activities on facility safeguards operations and departmental <b>safeguards</b> <b>procedures</b> and policies...|$|R

40|$|The Doha Trade Round {{maintains}} that a considerable {{effort will be}} given to take into account better the particular needs of developing nations.
