40|$|We propose {{an active}} sensing method {{that uses a}} mobile phone’s {{acceleration}} sensor and its <b>vibration</b> <b>motor</b> as an actuator to estimate the phone’s situation and its user’s action. This method overcomes the problem of existing methods: despite obtaining accurate action estimation from a single acceleration sensor, they cannot estimate the phone’s situation because they utilize differences in acceleration sensor data caused by user actions and estimate the user’s action based on that change. Our method vibrates the mobile phone by using its <b>vibration</b> <b>motor</b> under pulse width modulation (PWM) control and extracts the feature quantities from the acceleration sensor data. It then simultaneously estimates the user’s action (dynamic items) and phone’s situation (static items) with high accuracy from the differences in feature quantities...|$|E
40|$|Smartphones {{have become}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in recent years}} and offer many useful services to their users, such as notifications about incoming calls and messages, or news updates in real-time. These notifications however do not consider the current user's and phone's context. As a result, they can disturb users in important meetings or remain unnoticed in noisy environment. In this paper, we therefore propose an approach to infer the phone's context based on its <b>vibration</b> <b>motor.</b> To this end, we trigger the phone's <b>vibration</b> <b>motor</b> for short time periods and measure the response of its environments using the built-in microphone and/or accelerometers. Our evaluation shows that leveraging accelerometers allows to recognize the current phone's context with an accuracy of more than 99 %.

The sensory function of the fabric is achieved by temperature sensors, soldered on conductive threads coated with cotton. The presence of stainless steel wires gives these materials conductive properties, enabling the detection of human body temperature and transmitting the signal form sensors to the motors on the fabric. When body temperature decreases, hardware/software platforms send a signal to the <b>vibration</b> <b>motors</b> in order to stimulate the driver.

5000|$|Different {{types of}} devices {{can be used}} to produce the {{physiological}} changes. Of the bodily organs, the heart plays a particularly important role in our emotional experience. The heart imitator HaptiHeart produces special heartbeat patterns according to emotion to be conveyed or elicited (sadness is associated with slightly intense heartbeat, anger with quick and violent heartbeat, fear with intense heart rate). False heart beat feedback can be directly interpreted as a real heart beat, so it can change the emotional perception.

40|$|Purpose. To {{develop and}} {{to test a}} {{feedback}} training system for improvement of tactile perception and coordination of fingers in children and youth with cerebral palsy. Methods. The fingers of 7 probands with cerebral palsy of different types and severity were stimulated using small <b>vibration</b> <b>motors</b> integrated in the fingers of a hand glove. The <b>vibration</b> <b>motors</b> were connected through a microcontroller to a computer and to a response 5 -button keyboard. By pressing an appropriate keyboard button, the proband must indicate in which finger the vibration was felt. The number of incorrect responses and the reaction time were measured for every finger. The perception and coordination of fingers were estimated before and after two-week training using both clinical tests and the measurements. Results. Proper functioning of the developed system in persons with cerebral palsy was confirmed. The tactile sensation of fingers was improved in five of seven subjects {{after two weeks of}} training. There was no clear tendency towards improvement of selective use of fingers. Conclusion. The designed feedback system could be used to train tactile perception of fingers in children and youth with cerebral palsy. An extensive study is required to confirm these findings...|$|R
