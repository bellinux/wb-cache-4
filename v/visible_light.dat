5|$|It {{is known}} that the {{silicate}} particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b> However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from very light to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5|$|The visible {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to <b>visible</b> <b>light.</b> Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> easily. Conversely, the <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

30|$|The {{problem of}} {{single-mode}} image registration has been solved {{in the end}} of the twentieth century; however, multi-modal image registration is still not well settled. Multi-modal image which is derived from different imaging equipment can provide more abundant and comprehensive information than single-mode image. As infrared imaging reflects the radiation information of scene and <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> reflect the reflection information, so the output images have different gray level features, and these information are complementary to each other and suited to be fused together for target positioning and identification. The premise of fusion is the registration. Therefore, the registration between infrared image and <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> is one of the most typical multi-modal image registration.|$|R
5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by hand. In the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{light is}} of lower energy than <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> hence is emitted by cooler objects. As such, the {{following}} {{can be viewed}} in the infrared: cool stars (including brown dwarves), nebulae, and redshifted galaxies.|$|E

40|$|Heterostructures {{composed}} of Nd 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 and Nb-SrTiO 3 were fabricated by laser ablation and characterized under different fields (optic, electric, and magnetic). The asymmetric ratios [β=I(1 V) /I(- 1 V) in I-V curves were over 107, demonstrating highly rectifying properties {{in a wide}} temperature range. Under magnetic fields, remarkable modulations of I-V curves were achieved. Significant open circuit voltages were observed when illuminated by <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> with wavelengths of 532 nm and 650 nm.

40|$|International audienceAmong other photoinitiating systems, {{aromatic}} ketone based compounds {{have been largely}} exploited as photoinitiators (PIs). However, none of these compounds efficiently absorb above 420 nm. The search of novel architectures of PIs for getting an important red-shift of the absorption is crucial {{for the use of}} <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> for polymer synthesis. Novel bifunctional dyes derived from the Michler's ketone structure are proposed here as photoinitiators for the free radical polymerization of acrylates and the cationic polymerization of epoxides upon exposure to 457, 473, and 532 nm laser diodes and even to a green LED bulb at 514 nm. Excellent polymerization profiles are obtained. These original dyes exhibit a push−pull molecular character for a remarkable covering of the <b>visible</b> <b>lights.</b> The formation of the radicals and the ions in the two- and three-component photoinitiating systems is described and the initiation steps are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> sometimes in combination with pigments.

50|$|In all {{of these}} {{treatments}} the effects are gradual and a strict avoidance of sunlight is required. The use of broad-spectrum sunscreens with physical blockers, such as titanium dioxide and zinc dioxide is preferred over that with only chemical blockers. This is because UV-A, UV-B and <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> are all capable of stimulating pigment production.|$|R
30|$|In view of this, {{this paper}} proposes an image {{registration}} algorithm which combines visual saliency and SIFT {{based on the}} optimization of search space and feature space. After extracting the salient region of image, PCA method is used to establish the dimensionality reduction of SIFT feature, and finally, the robust registration of infrared image and <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> is realized. The contents of this paper are as follows. Section 1 gives some registration methods between infrared image and <b>visible</b> <b>lights</b> and existing problems. Section 2 utilizes the theory of salient region detection and puts forward the detection method of salient region center of image based on entropy priority strategy. On this basis, Section 3 gives a SIFT feature extraction method based on PCA. Section 4 presents the whole procedure for proposed image registration method. Sections 5 and 6 give experiments and discussion respectively. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 7.|$|R

5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the wavelength range of <b>visible</b> <b>light</b> corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of <b>visible</b> <b>light,</b> then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
