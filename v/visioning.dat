25|$|While {{the many}} thwarted {{plans of the}} 1960s may {{constitute}} a warning about prognostication, the city has adopted an official Waterfront Concept Plan.

Aside from the city's process, plans are under consideration for major work at the Washington State Ferry terminal and the Seattle Aquarium; the Olympic Sculpture Park has already transformed the northern end of the Central Waterfront.|$|E

500|$|The Tennessee Aquarium was {{designed}} {{to serve as a}} cornerstone for redevelopment in downtown Chattanooga by reconnecting the city with the Tennessee River. [...] At the beginning of the 1980s the Chattanooga-based Lyndhurst Foundation funded a series of initiatives to promote revitalization in the city, which was suffering from the impacts of deindustrialization and population decline. [...] In 1981 the University of Tennessee's urban design program, with funding from Lyndhurst, established the Urban Design Studio in Chattanooga as an opportunity for its students to gain real-world experience in urban planning. [...] This led to the first public mention of an aquarium project, in a 1982 student exhibit of what they described as an [...] "urban design structure" [...] for downtown Chattanooga and the adjacent riverfront. [...] Another Lyndhurst-funded venture, the Moccasin Bend Task Force, was impaneled in 1982 by the City of Chattanooga and Hamilton County to study options for the Moccasin Bend archaeological site immediately north of the Tennessee River, but expanded its scope to cover the city's entire 22-mile riverfront. [...] Its Tennessee Riverpark Master Plan, finalized in 1985, also included a recommendation for a riverfront aquarium. [...] The aquarium plan was additionally endorsed by Vision 2000, a public <b>visioning</b> process carried out in 1984 {{under the auspices of the}} nonprofit Chattanooga Venture, as one of forty goals set out for the city to pursue.|$|E

[...] In early 2016, Rabbi Boris Dolin, a Reconstructionist rabbi from Oregon was chosen from among 27 candidates to be the next full-time rabbi. [...] Before joining the Dorshei Emet community, Rabbi Dolin was the rabbi of Beit Polska, the Union of Progressive Congregations in Poland, and Beit Warszawa, a progressive congregation in Warsaw.|$|E

This study examined the influence of visual acuity and visual field conditions on upright posture. Eleven males (21. 1 ± 2. 0 yrs) and 15 females (22. 2 ± 2. 2 yrs) were classified into high (above 1. 0 binocular <b>vision)</b> and low (below 0. 3) visual acuity groups. Postural sway was measured for 1 min in each of three visual field conditions (central <b>vision,</b> full <b>vision,</b> and no <b>vision).</b> Participants were given only central visual information (central <b>vision),</b> central and peripheral visual information (full <b>vision),</b> or no visual information (no <b>vision).</b> The effect of central <b>vision</b> on postural sway was detected as a difference between no <b>vision</b> and central <b>vision</b> conditions, and the effect of peripheral <b>vision</b> was assessed as a difference between central <b>vision</b> and full <b>vision</b> conditions. The low visual acuity group decreased their sway amplitude in antero-posterior direction using central plus peripheral visual information, but the high visual-acuity group did not. The high frequency sway was significantly smaller in the low visual-acuity group than that in the high visual-acuity group under the no <b>vision</b> and central <b>vision</b> conditions. These findings suggest the necessity of considering participants' visual acuity in examining the role of the visual information from the central and peripheral visual fields...|$|R
