5|$|The communists' {{principal}} rivals {{were the}} <b>veterans</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armia Krajowa movement, Mikołajczyk's Polish People's (Peasant) Party (Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe; PSL), and the <b>veterans</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish armies which {{had fought in}} the West. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party, because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections. Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, {{would be allowed to}} act as a bridge between the east and the west.|$|E
