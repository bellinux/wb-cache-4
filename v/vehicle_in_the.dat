5|$|A month later, Gangstas in Space was released. In three missions, players {{continue}} the Saints Row: The Third {{story in a}} new arc about the Gangstas in Space film referenced in the main story. In the game, the film about the Saints is being directed by the self-interested Hollywood director Andy Zhen and the player is acting the final scenes of the film alongside a female co-star making her debut. In the first level, the player fights the military to save a female alien and controls the turret on the getaway <b>vehicle.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second, the player is in a shootout in a linear map. The last mission has the player in an aircraft fighting other aircraft while the co-star uploads viruses to transmitters. At the time of review, the player could not revisit the old missions to earn missed achievements, but was later patched. Costumes and vehicles are unlocked upon completing the pack. The pack was released in North America on February 21, 2012, and in Europe the next day.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{three years}} after the Apperson {{brothers}} split from Haynes, Haynes-Apperson was renamed the Haynes Automobile Company and Haynes launched a series of publicity campaigns. A parade of 2,000 cars was organized in New York City during 1908 and Haynes, whom many recognized as the inventor of the American automobile, led the parade down Broadway riding in the Pioneer. He was followed by ten Haynes cars, a model from each year to display the advancement in technology. On his way to the parade, Haynes was unaware of the city's newly established speeding laws and was arrested for driving too fastin a car with a top speed of 15mph (17km/h)and taken to jail. He was soon able to see a magistrate who released him after learning that he was Elwood Haynes and had come to lead the parade. The celebration was intended to be a ten-year commemoration of the invention of the automobile, although earlier self-vehicles dated back nearly twenty years in Europe. Haynes donated the Pioneer to the United States Government in 1910 to be placed in the Smithsonian Institution where it is still on display in the National Museum of American History as the second oldest motorized <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2014, a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) {{emergency}} meeting {{concluded that the}} RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the next day, when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E

5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of racial profiling. Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of racial profiling. Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of racial profiling by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate racial profiling and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E
