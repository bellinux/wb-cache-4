5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say. In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean that he gave warning to his people that the sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean 'at sunrise.' As regarding dǫglings for Dellings in H, and Dǫglingar were the descendants of Dagr (according to SnE. 183).|$|E
5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle {{the origins of the}} city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, {{and at the same time}} to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

25|$|Subsequent {{cases have}} focused {{attention}} on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> informed observer has sometimes become dangerously close to becoming the court's view. In dealing with this, the court must adopt <b>the</b> public's <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> not its own view.

25|$|The Church's general {{responsibility}} for comprehensive education {{and for the}} care of the poor was transferred to the secular municipalities.The Church accepted separation from the state because, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the head of state was the Orthodox Russian Emperor, it regarded complete integration with the state as problematic.|$|E
25|$|Noel Odell, {{the last}} man to see Mallory and Irvine on their ascent in 1924, offered a more benign explanation: that the ice-axe had merely been placed there on the ascent to be {{collected}} {{on the way back}} in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the climbing ahead was almost entirely on rock under the prevailing conditions.|$|E

25|$|A {{petition}} {{was started}} on Change.org on 15 May 2016 {{calling on the}} EBU and the contest's organisers to void the final results in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the overall winner only placed second in both the jury and televote.

25|$|The {{ability of}} natural {{geologic}} barriers to isolate radioactive waste {{is demonstrated by}} the natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo, Africa. During their long reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of plutonium together with other transuranic elements were generated in the uranium ore body. This plutonium and the other transuranics remained immobile until the present day, a span of almost 2 billion years. This is quite remarkable in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that ground water had ready access to the deposits {{and they were not}} in a chemically inert form, such as glass.|$|E
25|$|Discovery Bay {{currently}} (April 2009) {{consists of}} 14 residential development phases with properties ranging from garden houses to high-rise towers {{of up to}} 24 storeys. The development also features a 400-metre-long privately owned beach (accessible to the public but no lifeguards present), four private membership clubs including a golf club and a marina club and a public park (Siena Central Park). The absence of public recreational facilities is a bone of discontent with the residents especially in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the developer has an outstanding obligation to provide 300,000 square metres of such facilities {{as part of the}} original plan.|$|E
30|$|With {{this in mind}} as {{the basic}} hypothesis, and in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and {{experience}} gained in the USA, a number of experiments were planned and have been put under way since 1968 in Pinus brutia stands. With this net of experiments it is hoped and expected to have valuable results, that properly analysed and interpreted, would answer the general problems created by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> prescribed burning in forests of Pinus halepensis and Pinus brutia.

25|$|In September 1989, the 120,000 ton collier M.S. Leon entered port with 85,000 tons of coal. The coal was {{unloaded}} by crane {{unto the}} conveyor {{and taken to}} the Coal Company {{at the rear of}} the Ashdod power station. The big ship was brought into port by modern Voit-Schneider type tugboats, which have an exceptional maneuverability and a bollard pull of 35 and 45 tons respectively. Bringing 160,00 G.R.T. ships into the port (at partial load capacity) is a considerable accomplishment in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Port of Ashdod was intended for navigation by ships of maximum deadweight of 30,000 tons (before the port was expanded in the 2000s).|$|E
25|$|Although Hindus were {{frequently}} soft targets in Pakistan, {{the rise of}} Taliban forces {{in the political arena}} has particularly unsettled the already fragile situation for the minority community. Increasing persecution, ostracism from locals and lack of a social support system is forcing more and more Hindus to flee to India. This has been observed in the past whenever the conflicts between the two nations escalated but this has been a notable trend in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> the recent developments are due to internal factors almost exclusively. The Taliban have used false methods of luring, as well as the co-operation of zealots within local authorities to perpetrate religious cleansing.|$|E
25|$|On 6 March 1964, King Paul died, and Constantine succeeded him as King of the Hellenes. In July 1964, the {{announcement}} of the engagement of Constantine and Anne-Marie raised the polite protests of the Left in Denmark. Anne-Marie and Constantine were married on 18 September 1964 (two weeks after Anne-Marie's 18th birthday) in the Metropolis, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Athens. The bride wore a Jørgen Bender design. Prior to the wedding, Anne-Marie converted from Lutheranism to the Greek Orthodox Church. Also, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that she was marrying a foreign ruler, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her succession rights to the Danish throne for herself and her descendants.|$|E

25|$|Referring to coverage, between 2001 and 2006 PRAGUAS I {{equipped}} 252,000 {{persons with}} new supply systems and 127,000 people with on-site sanitation (i.e., approximately 5% and 3% of the Ecuadorian rural population of 4.7 million people). In small towns (cabeceras cantonales), where water service was interrupted, technical assistance {{was provided to}} improve the performance, separating service provision from direct provision by municipalities and increasing operative efficiency, to reach continuous sustainable service of good quality. In <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that designs for more than 600,000 inhabitants (which is 13% of the Ecuadorian rural population) have already been prepared, a fast coverage expansion is expected within PRAGUAS II, which began in 2007 and was to last until 2011.|$|E
25|$|Rabinow {{has also}} devoted {{a great deal}} of energy to the {{invention}} of new venues, adjacent to the existing university structures, diagnosing the university’s disciplinary organization and career patterns as among the major impediment to 21st century thought. In <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the organization and practices of the social sciences and humanities in the U.S. university system have changed little in recent decades, they are unlikely to facilitate the composition of contemporary equipment. Rabinow has called for the creation of venues that are adjacent to, but more flexible than, the university and the existing disciplinary structure. He has played leading roles in the design of two such organizations, the Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory (ARC), and the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC).|$|E

In addition to free residence, the office carried with it a yearly salary of 2,500 Dutch guilders (a large sum, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that fifty years later 375 guilders was the usual salary of the chief rabbi of Berlin). Unselfish and independent by nature, Ashkenazi renounced the perquisites of his office, such as fees in civil suits, {{in order to maintain}} his independence, and accepted the high position only upon the condition that under no circumstances was he to be required to subordinate himself to the congregation, or to be obliged to receive gifts, and that he should be permitted to preserve absolute freedom of action on all occasions.|$|E

The bottom line: globalization {{is not the}} cause, but neither is it the solution to world poverty and inequality. The paper then explores why and how the global economy is stacked against the poor, making globalization asymmetric, at least up to now. It concludes with some ideas about a new agenda of good global politics, an agenda to shape a future global economy and society that is less poor and less unequal [...] {{not only because it}} is more global and competitive, but also because it is more fair and more politically representative.

50|$|The term “stylised facts” was {{introduced}} by the economist Nicholas Kaldor in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a debate on economic growth theory in 1961, expanding on model assumptions made in a 1957 paper.Criticizing <b>the</b> neoclassical models <b>of</b> economic growth of his time, Kaldor argues that theory construction should begin with a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant <b>facts.</b> However, to handle the problem that “facts as recorded by statisticians, are always subject to numerous snags and qualifications, {{and for that reason}} are incapable of being summarized”,he suggests that theorists “should be free to start off with a stylised <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> - i.e. concentrate on broad tendencies, ignoring individual detail”.With respect to broad tendencies that result from such a process, Kaldor coins the term “stylized facts”.|$|R

25|$|Uthman was {{a shrewd}} {{businessman}} and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed {{greatly to the}} Rashidun Empire. Umar had fixed the allowance {{of the people and}} on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the public treasury. Under Umar, it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners. The army felt dissatisfied at this decision, but Umar suppressed the opposition with a strong hand. Uthman followed the policy devised by Umar and there were more conquests, and the revenues from land increased considerably.|$|E
25|$|Under Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum {{qualifications}} {{of age and}} priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of His Holiness (35 {{years of age and}} 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that, as long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of His Holiness. All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of His Holiness and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.|$|E
25|$|However, Baalis, king of Ammon, was {{hostile and}} envious of the Judean remnant {{and sent a}} Judean, Yishmael Ben Netaniah, who was descended from the royal family of Judea, to assassinate Gedaliah. In the seventh month (Tishrei) of 582/1 BCE (some {{four to five years}} {{following}} the destruction of the Temple, although the exact year is unclear and subject to dispute; others claim the assassination took place in the same year as the destruction), a group of Jews led by Yishmael came to Gedaliah in the town of Mitzpa and were received cordially. Gedaliah had been warned of his guest's murderous intent, but refused to believe his informants, having the belief that their report was mere slander. Yishmael murdered Gedaliah, together with most of the Jews who had joined him and many Babylonians whom the Babylonian King had left with Gedaliah.
