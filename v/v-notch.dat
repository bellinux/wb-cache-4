2500|$|In {{reflectivity}} (precipitation intensity) data, a tight echo gradient (particularly on the inflow area) and a fan shape generally {{indicate a}} supercell.

This {{is not to be}} confused with an inflow notch; which is a lower level indentation in the precipitation where there is little to no reflectivity, indicative of strong, organized inflow and a severe storm that is most likely a supercell. [...] The rear inflow notch (or weak echo channel) occurs to the east or north of a mesocyclone and hook echo.

40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{is devoted to}} the theoretical and numerical study of the elasto-static fields at a vertex notch under mode I loading. The analysis is based on the plane deformation hyperelasticity theory for an incompressible Mooney-Rivlin material. While for cracked components some contributions {{can be found in the}} recent and past literature, studies on <b>V-notched</b> components are instead very limited. The aim of this paper is to partially fill this lack, providing a fracture criterion for the assessment of components weakened by sharp <b>V-notches.</b> In the first part of the paper, a brief description of the analytical frame available for <b>V-notches</b> in hyperelastic material is reported. A Williams' type diagram reporting the degree of singularity for a material obeying a Mooney-Rivlin behavior is present. The asymptotic stress field and the local strain energy density are investigated by means of non-linear finite element analyses. In the second part of the paper, a criterion based on the local energy is proposed and successfully applied to a set of experimental data taken from the literature. Future works are surely necessary to validate the criterion considering more sets of data from sharp and blunt <b>V-notches...</b>|$|R

40|$|The fictitious notch {{rounding}} {{concept is}} applied here to V-shaped notches with root holes subjected to mode I loading. The fictitious notch radius rho(f) is determined {{as a function}} of the real notch radius rho, the microstructural support length rho* and the notch opening angle 2 alpha, at first using the normal stress criterion. Two analytical methods have been developed resulting in closed-form expressions for the multiaxiality factor s in the well-known relationship rho(f) = rho + s rho*. The first method expresses the notch stress averaged over the microstructural support length at pointed <b>V-notches</b> by the maximum notch stress of fictitiously rounded <b>V-notches</b> (with root hole), taking advantage of a newly developed analytical solution. The second method considers <b>V-notches</b> with root holes both in the real and in the fictitious configuration. It uses a procedure given by Neuber.

40|$|By {{making use}} of the {{generalized}} plane strain hypothesis, an approximate stress field theory has been developed according to which the three-dimensional governing equations lead to a system where a bi-harmonic equation and a harmonic equation should be simultaneously satisfied.

The system can be applied not only to pointed three-dimensional <b>V-notches</b> but also to sharply radiused <b>V-notches</b> characterized by a notch tip radius small enough.

40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} “elementary” volume and “micro {{structural}} support length” was introduced {{many years ago}} by Neuber. Neuber formulated the idea that, also {{in the presence of}} a sharp notch, a generic material is sensitive to a fictitious root radius whose value is only simply correlated to the ‘micro-structural support length’ and to the multiaxiality of the stress state. On the other hand, Rice’s J-integral is a commonly used elastic and elastic-plastic fracture parameter for the description of the local fields in the neighbourhood of stress concentrations and for the study of crack initiation and propagation. In order to be applied to un-cracked geometries, J-integral needs a path definition. A particular control area, which embraces the tip of sharp and blunt notches, is defined here, and over that area the mean value of the strain energy E(e) and J-integral are determined under Mode I loading. The semi-moon-like area Ω adapts itself as a function of the notch geometry leaving unchanged its depth Rc measured on the notch bisector line. The variability of the E(e) /J ratio versus Rc is analysed considering sharp <b>V-notches</b> as well as blunt notches with a semicircular root and an opening angle ranging from 0 ° to 135 °. The analyses demonstrated that a linear law permits a link between the two parameters in the case of sharp <b>V-notches</b> and blunt <b>V-notches</b> with a large opening angle. By decreasing the angle, the linear law is valid only as a first approximation, due to the increasing influence of two elliptic integrals in the analytical formulation of J. Some elastic-plastic analyses limited to <b>V-notches</b> with a large opening angle confirm those findings...|$|R

In the absence of an exact mode II stress field solution for this kind of notches, the Generalised NSIFs are determined using a solution recently developed for <b>V-notches</b> with end-holes. The approximate nature of this solution makes the Generalised NSIFs sensitive to the finiteness of the notch radius and un-constant along the notch bisector line.

40|$|A "direct measurement" of {{the impact}} {{toughness}} of both Tempcore and microalloyed with vanadium reinforcing steel bars, of the same strength class (50 OMPa nominal yield stress), is undertaken. The term "direct measurement" means that <b>V-notched</b> specimens with the original round section of the bars (and not with the standard rectangular one) are used, mentioned here as direct <b>V-notched</b> (DVN) specimens. The major complications encountered with them are the use of non-standard geometry (Charpy <b>V-notched,</b> CVN), the variable size of the bars and the composite microstructure of the Tempcore reinforcing steel. It {{has been shown that}} the toughness characteristics of reinforcing steels may be estimated by the CVN impact test using direct (DVN) specimens. It is found that if the notch exceeds a critical depth, meaningful measurements may be obtained, regardless of the diameter of the reinforcing steel bar and that the transition temperature may be estimated from the residual fracture angle of direct (DVN) specimens. The microalloyed with vanadium reinforcing steel has a lower temperature-transition range from ductile-to-brittle fracture (- 10 degrees C), compared to the AISI 1020 steel, attributed to the vanadium micro-additions, but it is higher compared to the Tempcore steel (- 30 degrees C).
