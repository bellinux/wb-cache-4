The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, {{and the fact that it}} is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|Nesting in a rookery {{is always}} colonial, usually in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees.

Both adults feed the young, which are fledged by the 32nd or 33rd day.|$|R

Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5|$|One-thousand years ago, the nomadic Timbisha (formerly called Shoshone {{and also}} known as Panamint or Koso) moved into the area and hunted game and {{gathered}} mesquite beans along with pinyon pine nuts. Because of the wide altitude differential between the valley bottom and the mountain ridges, especially on the west, the Timbisha practiced a vertical migration pattern. Their winter camps were located near water sources in the valley bottoms. As {{the spring and summer}} progressed and the weather warmed, grasses and other plant food sources ripened at progressively higher altitudes. November found them at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain ridges where they harvested pine nuts before moving back to the valley bottom for winter.|$|E
5|$|The early 2000s {{were seen}} as a time of {{transition}} in tennis, with older players retiring and a few players breaking through at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998, finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world, his first year-end ranking in the top 8. His breakthrough came in 2003 when {{he won his first}} Grand Slam tournament, and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick. The following two years, he almost completely dominated, winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005. Between Wimbledon in 2005 and the US Open in 2007, Federer captured 8 of 10 majors with a staggering record of 67–2 in those tournaments.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot at Pinewood Studios at its 007 Stage in the UK, as well as Weissensee in Austria. The pre-title {{sequence}} was filmed on the Rock of Gibraltar and although the sequence shows a hijacked Land Rover careering down various sections of road for several minutes before bursting through a wall towards the sea, the location mostly used the same short stretch of road at the <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock, shot from numerous different angles. The beach defences seen {{at the foot of}} the Rock in the initial shot were also added solely for the film, to an otherwise non-military area. The action involving the Land Rover switched from Gibraltar to Beachy Head in the UK for the shot showing the vehicle actually getting airborne. Trial runs of the stunt with the Land Rover, during which Bond escapes by parachute from the tumbling vehicle, were filmed in the Mojave Desert, although the final cut of the film uses a shot achieved using a dummy. Other locations included Germany, the United States, and Italy, while the desert scenes were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco. The conclusion of the film {{was shot at}} the Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Elveden Hall, Suffolk.|$|E

The <b>very</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pole, usually embellished with a large figure of a fish or other sacred animal, was worth three points.
