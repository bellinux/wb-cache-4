40|$|The {{problem of}} urban {{mobility}} {{is complicated by}} traffic delay, resulting from poor planning, high population density and poor condition of roads within urban spaces. This study assessed traffic congestion resulting from differential contribution made by various land-uses along Apapa-Oworoshoki expressway in Lagos metropolis. The {{data for this study}} was from both primary and secondary sources; GPS point data was collected at selected points for traffic volume count; observation of the nature of vehicular traffic congestion, and land use types along the corridor. Existing data on traffic count along the corridor, connectivity map and land use map sourced from relevant authorities were acquired. Traffic congestion within the area was estimated using <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (V/C). Heterogeneity Index was developed and used to quantify the percentage contribution to traffic volume from various land-use categories. Analytical Hierarchical Processing (AHP) and knowledge-based weighting were used to rank the importance of different heterogeneity indices. Results showed significant relationship between the degree of heterogeneity of the land use pattern and road traffic congestion. <b>Volume</b> <b>Capacity</b> <b>Ratio</b> computed revealed that the route corridor exceeds its designed capacity in the southward direction between the hours of 8 am and 12 pm on working days. Five major nodes were analyzed along the corridor, and were all above the expected Passenger Car Unit (PCU), these are “Oshodi” 15  %, “Airport junction” 10  %, “Cele bus stop” 21  %, “Mile 2 ” 14  %, “Berger” 15  % and “Tincan bus stop” 33  % indicating heavy traffic congestion...|$|E
40|$|Road {{investment}} appraisal models have had difficulty incorporating {{the effects of}} congestion on vehicle fuel consumption. The new Highway Development and Management Model, HDM- 4, incorporates the Australian Road Research Board’s Model “ARFCOM ” to predict fuel consumption in combination with a simulated vehicle speed profile. A key determinant of the simulated speed profile is acceleration noise (the standard deviation of the second-by-second acceleration) which is in turn derived from the highway <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio.</b> To investigate this further, detailed speed profiles were obtained for a light passenger vehicle (a Toyota Kijang) and a medium truck on a 17 km congested road close to Bandung in Java. In total 100, 000 speeds and 10, 000 fuel readings were measured over 1000 km of test runs. Speed data were compared with predictions of the Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (IHCM) and observed fuel consumption data were compared with ARFCOM’s predictions. It {{was found that the}} IHCM model appeared to overestimate the Kijang’s speed although a close estimate of the truck’s speed was obtained. Total observed fuel consumption was found to be three per cent more for the truck and six per cent more for the Kijang compared with ARFCOM’s predictions. The data were analysed in 30 second and four minute intervals and it was found that multiple regression models were able to give good explanations of the IHCM predicted speeds and of the ARFCOM’s predicted fuel consumption. However only a very poor explanation of acceleration noise was found from formulae based on the highway <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio.</b> In view of the promising results it is proposed that relatively simple multiple regression models be used to predict fuel consumption under congestion...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two redundancy indices {{for road}} traffic network junctions and also an aggregated network redundancy index. The proposed redundancy indices could be implemented to identify optimal design alternatives during the planning {{stage of the}} network junctions whereas the aggregated network redundancy index could assess the best control and management policies under disruptive events. Furthermore, effective measures of network redundancy are important to policy makers in understanding the current resilience and future planning to mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gases. The proposed junction indices cover the static aspect of redundancy, i. e. alternative paths, and the dynamic feature of redundancy reflected by the availability of spare capacity under different network loading and service level. The proposed redundancy indices {{are based on the}} entropy concept, due to its ability to measure the system configuration in addition to being able to model the inherent uncertainty in road transport network conditions. Various system parameters based on different combinations of link flow, relative link spare capacity and relative link speed were examined. However, the two redundancy indices developed from the combined relative link speed and relative link spare capacity showed strong correlation with junction delay and <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> of a synthetic road transport network of Delft city. Furthermore, the developed redundancy indices responded well to demand variation under the same network conditions and supply variations.

This removes the choice of timing plan from the capacity results. The ICU can also be used on uncontrolled intersections to determine the capacity utilization if the intersection were to be signalized. The ICU is not intended for operations or signal timing design. The primary output from ICU is similar to the intersection <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio.</b> Some of the benefits to using ICU over delay-based methods include greater accuracy, and a clear image of the intersection’s <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

The limitation of Highway Capacity Manual’s PCU values is ex-plained. Statistical analysis determined that there is a significant difference in volume of cars only between homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic conditions for various road widths. Hence the PCU values of heterogeneous traffic are recommended for the design of traffic systems over homogeneous traffic conditions. The {{results of the present study}} shows that for heavy vehicles, SUVs and motorcycles, the PCU values as a function of <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> vary from 0. 8 to 2. 8, 1. 0 to 2. 3 and 0. 2 to 0. 65 respectively.

One of the aspect that can improve and develop Kabupaten Sukamara is transportation, because the transportation facilities and infrastructure that exist currently is very low in Kabupaten Sukamara, in this case, especially the road which connects the villages because the lack of road development as a rural access. The methodology used for analyze {{the performance of the}} road is by calculate the number of trip generation based on the population of study area based on method developed by the Ministry of Public Works for planning transportation of urban road which belong to the small town category. The next step is to analyze the amount of trip that generates Origin Destination Matrice (OD) by using Double Constrain Gravity method (DCGR), assign OD matrice to the road network by using EMME 3. 4. 1 and calculate the road capacity,then calculate and analyze <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (VCR) based on the assignment result and the road capacity calculation. By determining the 20 year plan, the prediction of trip generation of Kabupaten Sukamara is 235. 023 people/day. Based on OD matrice, can be known that the closer the distance trip, the greater the trip that occur and vice versa. From the calculation, the capacity of the collector road is 1. 197 smp/hour, local road is 856 smp/hour and small road is 838 smp/hour. From the assignment result, the largest trip volume is 314 smp/hour and the smallest is 1 smp/hour, so the largest VCR value is 0, 279 which means VCR < 0, 8 for every road that connects the villages. Therefore, the performance condition of the entire road that connects the villages can be concluded stable/safe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe German Highway Capacity Manual HBS (Handbuch fuer die Bemessung von Strassenverkehrsanlagen, FGSV 2015) {{like other}} Highway Capacity Manuals {{provides}} {{a collection of}} methods for evaluating the Level of Service for single road facilities, i. e. a particular network element like a road segment, a ramp, or an intersection. The Level of Service of single road facilities (LOS) {{is derived from the}} <b>volume</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio,</b> the delay time or the traffic density. In addition to the HBS the German guidelines provide a complementary Guideline for Integrated Network Planning RIN (Richtlinien für die integrierte Netzgestaltung, FGSV 2008) which is used for categorising transport networks and for evaluating the service quality in multi-modal networks. Here the LOS refers to entire journeys, i. e. to origin-destination-pairs. The most important indicator for evaluating the service quality of a particular od-pair is the direct speed (= direct distance / journey time). Journey time and the resulting direct speed include not only the in-vehicle time but also access and egress times which can reduce the speed of the entire journey significantly, especially in public transport. Additional indictors evaluation the directness and the travel time ratio of competing modes complement the set of indicators for evaluating the service quality. For each indicator the guideline provides evaluations functions for the service levels A to F which depend on the direct distance between origin and destination. This reflects the fact that speeds typically increase with longer distances while detour factor and travel time ratio decreases. The paper summarizes the approach of the guideline for evaluating the service quality and presents experience with the evaluation scheme collected in various applications covering car and public transport networks. It shows how the evaluation results can be used to recognize shortcomings in the network not only on the level of od-pairs but also to identify critical network elements. Finally the paper explains how the two guidelines HBS and RIN are connected...|$|E

Estimation of PLOS criteria is very important as {{this is the first}} step of LOS analysis but this is not well defined in Indian context. The analysis followed in India is basically an adaptation of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology. However, the defined ranges of various measuring parameters mentioned in HCM 2010 are more suitable for developed countries. In this research, an in- depth study has been carried out to define PLOS criteria of urban off-streets facilities in developing countries having heterogeneous traffic flow conditions. Defining LOS is basically a classification problem and to solve it Affinity Propagation (AP), a very recently developed cluster algorithm is used. Inventory details and speed data are collected from two important cities (Bhubaneswar and Rourkela) of Odisha state, India having less than a million populations, through the application of video camera. After the collection of data, based upon average pedestrian space, flow rate, speed and <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (v/c), six categories of PLOS are estimated. PLOS ranges found from this study for six categories (A-F) using average pedestrian space are (in m 2 /pedestrian) > 15. 67, >(13. 84 - 15. 67), >(10. 67 - 13. 84), >(7. 63 - 10. 67), >(5. 08 - 7. 63), ≤ 5. 08, flow rate are (in pedestrian/sec/m) ≤ 0. 065, >(0. 065 - 0. 081), >(0. 081 - 0. 096), >(0. 096 - 0. 116), >(0. 116 - 0. 141), > 0. 141, speed are (in m/pedestrian) > 1. 51, >(1. 32 - 1. 51), >(1. 13 - 1. 32), >(0. 91 - 1. 13), >(0. 69 - 0. 91), ≤ 0. 69 and <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (v/c) are ≤ 0. 4, >(0. 4 - 0. 57), >(0. 57 - 0. 76), >(0. 76 - 0. 9), >(0. 9 - 1), > 1 for PLOS categories A, B, C, D, E and F respectively.

This goal, in respect of road transport, can be attained by encouraging public transport modes like buses by assigning priority. This paper is concerned with application of micro simulation technique to study the impact of provision of reserved bus lanes on the flow of highly heterogeneous traffic on urban roads. The specific objectives of this paper are (i) to modify and validate a newly developed model of heterogeneous traffic flow using field observed data and (ii) to apply the validated simulation model to study the impact of exclusive bus lanes introduced on urban arterials {{for a wide range}} of traffic volume levels. The impact of introduction of an exclusive bus lane is measured in terms of the reduction in speed of other categories of motor vehicles, due to the consequent reduction in road space, over a wide range of traffic volume. The main finding of this paper is, that if an exclusive bus lane is provided under highly heterogeneous traffic conditions,(prevailing in Indian cities), then, the maximum permissible <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> that will ensure a level of service of C for the traffic stream comprising all the motor vehicles, except the buses, is about 0. 53...|$|R

The model required three traffic parameters, namely average daily traffic (ADT), <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (V/C), and surface texture depth (STD), and two chemical parameters, namely total suspended solid (TSS) and total organic carbon (TOC), as predictor variables. Principal component analysis and two phase factor analysis were performed to characterize the model calibration parameters. Traffic congestion {{was found to be}} the underlying cause of traffic-related VOC buildup on urban roads. The model calibration was optimized using orthogonal experimental design. Partial least squares regression was used for model prediction. It was found that a better optimized orthogonal design could be achieved by including the latent factors of the data matrix into the design. The model performed fairly accurately for three different land uses as well as five different particle size fractions. The relative prediction errors were 10 – 40 % for the different size fractions and 28 – 40 % for the different land uses while the coefficients of variation of the predicted intersite VOC concentrations were in the range of 25 – 45 % for the different size fractions.

Intersection safety is related to traffic operations, such as traffic signal and approaching volume. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the contributing factor for left-turn crashes at signalized intersections by a statistical modeling process and to develop crash prediction models. Potential contributing factors representing the characteristic of a left-turn operation were identified and considered for inclusion in crash prediction models. HCS (Highway Capacity Software) 2000 was utilized for computing some traffic indicators such as <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> for potential inclusion in the models. Three years of crash data were collected in the College Station area. The Signal timing and Volume data were obtained from public works in College Station.

The division of time periods results from timing plans being changed for different periods. Relationship between crash count and each factor was explored to identify whether the factor has the potential to influence the crash count. Afterwards, the prediction models were developed using the negative binomial structure because of many zero samples. Akaike Information Criteria was used for selecting the model having the best fit.

40|$|As highway systems {{become more}} congested, it becomes {{increasingly}} {{important to understand}} the reliability with which we can estimate important performance measures such as <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratios,</b> particularly as we move toward leveraging field infrastructure to obtain real-time performance measures. In 1947, Greenshields wrote a paper that characterized “green time consumed” by “car-in-line-number” that ultimately was called headway. Average headway is one of principles used by the highway capacity manual to estimate saturation flow rate at signalized intersections. However, the current analytical techniques calculate a deterministic value for saturation flow rate that does not consider the stochastic variation of saturation flow rate. This paper reviews techniques used to estimate saturation flow rate, and proposes enhanced calculation methods to group saturation flow rate estimates by queue length. Grouping saturation flow rate estimates by queue length provides a convenient framework to evaluate saturation flow rate reliability. The inter-quartile range (25 % - 75 %) of saturation flow rates was calculated to be 1000 vph based on Greenshields’ calculation techniques. Using the proposed enhanced calculation characterizing saturation flow rate, the inter-quartile range of saturation flow rate was shown to decrease from approximately 400 vph with 5 cars in a queue to 300 vph with 10 cars in queue. Because saturation flow rate is a fundamental input to volume-to-capacity performance measures, characterizing the stochastic variation of saturation flow rates provides a basic input for assessing how reliably one can estimate important performance measures such as volume-to-capacity ratios, as well as other performance measures that build upon volume-to-capacity ratios...|$|R

The movements of the vehicles were observed at 5 roundabouts along ring road in Rourkela. Gap acceptance and follow up time were estimated for cars for one hour analysis. The relation between a roundabout performance measure and capacity is expressed in terms of degree of saturation (<b>volume</b> – <b>Capacity</b> <b>ratio).</b> The <b>capacity</b> analysis is done based on gap acceptance method that is adopted by Tanner based on the HCM 2010. The traffic movement data with vehicle characteristics were collected from 5 roundabouts in Rourkela. These 5 roundabouts are directly related to their approach leg numbers. Tanner models use the gap-acceptance theory (or critical headway) to simulate the behaviour of entering vehicles and vehicles circulating within the roundabout. Current research work on roundabout models mostly concentrates on determining the capacity of an approach based on the entering and circulating flows. Approach capacity is calculated as a mathematical function of critical headway and follow-up headway. The Tanner model is based on gap- acceptance theory with gap-acceptance parameters.

The freeway-arterial corridors of the highway system are crucial nodes allowing users to enter and exit yet are vulnerable to considerable disruptions {{in the flow of}} traffic due to the frequency of closely spaced grade separated roadways and high traffic volumes surrounding interchanges. By analyzing the closure of the interchanges and assessing the subsequent traffic conditions throughout the network using travel demand modeling software, it is possible to determine the effects, adverse or not, of major closures. Such an assessment is purposeful, ensuring the resiliency of the freeway by understanding the resulting congestion to relieving or preventing its occurrence. Through a detailed understanding of the effects, transportation authorizes may be better able to maintain an efficient flow of people and goods. This research analyzes the prevailing traffic conditions along the I- 95 corridor in New Castle County, DE due to the closure of three separately analyzed freeway-arterial interchanges along I- 95 : SR 896, SR 1, and US 202. It examines the change in volume, change in speed, and change in <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> on the network from before to after conditions.

The specific situation considered here is that the process cannot be defined as polytropic, characterized by constant in time thermodynamic coefficients. Instead, the coefficients of the proposed model are updated during the analysis. The results of the experimental research reveal that the proposed mathematical model is able to accurately reflect the physical behaviour of the fabricated demonstrator of the shock absorber...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} an {{effective}} way to measure the effects of changes in traffic volumes and <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> <b>ratios</b> (v/c) on accident frequency at signalized intersections was the motivation for this research. Today, different methods are incorporated by various agencies for determining accident reductions, but no widespread or uniformly accepted method has been established. ^ Many factors are believed to influence accident frequency. Some of these factors such as traffic volume and geometric and signal designs are easily observed, documented, and controlled while other factors such as regression to the mean, varying levels of accident reporting, and human behavior are not. ^ A new technique which compromises the effects of the uncontrollable factors and emphasizes the effects of the controllable factors was introduced and implemented in this research. Accident frequency in this new technique is also related to the conflicting movements to which the colliding vehicles belong. For a given type of accidents, data sets including observed number of accidents, traffic volumes, and v/c ratios of the conflicting movements were sorted in ascending order by the appropriate parameter and then divided into groups of equal sizes. Average number of accidents, traffic volumes, and v/c ratios of the above groups were then used to develop series of least squares regression equations to predict the number of accidents in the a. m., p. m., and off peak periods. Equations were developed for the four most frequent collision types which included rear end, left turn leaving, left turn entering, and cross traffic collisions. These equations provided fairly good estimates when they were tested using an out of sample empirical data. ^ This research concluded that these equations can be used to help identify sites with unusually high accident frequencies and as an effective tool in evaluating benefits and costs for intersection improvements. ...|$|R

40|$|Standard” roundabouts, {{for example}} those {{designed}} in some European countries, {{can often be}} characterized by low levels of safety or capacity and {{a high degree of}} sustainability. Given the proliferation of newer layouts, it is of interest to explore whether design practices could be improved by capitalizing on the experience gained internationally. Operational aspects of some of these designs have been explored previously, but {{there is a need to}} compare both the operational and safety performance of new designs to that of standard roundabouts. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the safety and operational implications of various potential alternatives to the standard roundabouts that proliferate in Europe and elsewhere. Microsimulation is used to simulate traffic operations at roundabout layout alternatives at the same levels of <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> (V/C) <b>ratio</b> and also with the same traffic flow. Operational performance measures include the common level of service parameters, while measures of safety are based initially on time to collision (TTC) values. Threshold values of TTC were then applied in defining conflicts that are used for crash-based safety evaluation by applying crash-conflict models estimated in published research. Interesting insights were revealed, suggesting that the newer layouts should be considered where warranted by cost-benefit considerations...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{impact of}} size {{matching}} between {{donor and recipient}} is unclear in lung transplantation. Therefore, we determined the relation of donor lung size to 1) posttransplant survival and 2) pulmonary function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second. MethodsFrom 1990 to 2006, 469 adults underwent lung transplantation with lungs from donors aged 7 to 70 years. Donor and recipient total lung capacities were calculated using established formulae (predicted total lung capacity), and actual recipient lung size was measured in the pulmonary function laboratory. Disparity between donor and recipient lung size was expressed as a ratio of donor predicted total lung capacity to recipient predicted total lung capacity—the predicted total lung capacity ratio—and predicted donor total lung capacity to actual recipient total lung capacity—the actual total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio.</b> Survival was measured by multiphase hazard methodology and repeated measures of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey–normalized forced expiratory volume in 1 second analyzed by temporal decomposition. ResultsPredicted total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> and actual total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> ranged widely, from 0. 55 to 1. 59 and 0. 52 to 4. 20, respectively. Overall survival was unaffected by predicted total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (P =. 3) or actual total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> (P =. 5). Patients with emphysema and an actual total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 67 or less or 1. 03 or greater had higher predicted mortality (P =. 01). During the first posttransplant year, forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased and then gradually declined. Predicted total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> and actual total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> had a small impact on forced expiratory volume in 1 second, primarily in the late phase after transplant in a disease-specific manner. ConclusionSize matching between donor and recipient using predicted total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> and actual total lung <b>capacity</b> <b>ratio</b> is an effective technique. Wide discrepancies in lung sizing do not affect overall posttransplant survival or pulmonary function. Therefore, {{a greater degree of}} lung size mismatch can likely be accepted, thereby improving patients' odds of undergoing transplantation...|$|R
40|$|The city of Portland, Oregon has {{deployed}} Transit Signal Priority (TSP) at {{more than}} 300 intersections, in cooperation with TriMet, the regional transit operator. TSP is used on particular routes and only within the city limits. Benefiting from TriMet’s “smart ” buses, using global positioning systems (GPS), each vehicle “knows ” whether it is on route and on schedule. Therefore, using the on-board technology, TSP is only activated when it is needed—when a bus is late. For each intersection there is a predetermined distance at which the TSP call is made. While this distance is particular to each intersection, it does not vary throughout the day in coordination with traffic flow patterns. Of the numerous {{factors that contribute to}} varying dwell times, {{one of the most important}} is the magnitude of traffic congestion on the street being traveled. The purpose of this paper is to describe the relationship between the effective call distance and the traffic congestion on the bus route. It is believed that by coordinating the call distance with the amount of roadway congestion will improve transit performance as well as a decrease the proportion of TSP calls that are not fully utilized. The analysis uses varying approach <b>volume</b> to <b>capacity</b> (v/c) <b>ratios</b> while measuring bus delay. Using a hardware-in-the-loop simulation system for evaluating TSP in Portland, this research has been performed by modeling intersections using VISSIM traffic modelin...|$|R
