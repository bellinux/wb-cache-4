30|$|Together with Raine Mäntysalo and Jonna Kangasoja, {{from the}} Aalto University, we started from a re-interpretation of Lindblom, {{not only as}} the proponent of a {{rationality}} based upon partisan mutual adjustment and partial agreements, but rather of a rationality based upon conflict and agonism (Mäntysalo et al. 2011). For Lindblom, in fact, it is not relevant {{whether or not you}} share, in general terms, the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> counterpart, {{as long as you are}} able to bargain on a concrete (planning) decision. What matters is whether your counterpart agrees with a concrete proposal, not why s/he agrees.

40|$|Abstract. Perhaps {{you have}} noticed some {{inconsistencies}} in your company too. A salesperson brings {{in a million}} in revenue and receives a hero’s acclaim while a purchasing agent saves a million and no one notices.
