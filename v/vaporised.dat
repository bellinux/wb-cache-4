5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly <b>vaporised</b> in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact. Debate {{continues}} {{about how}} much ice is in a comet. In 2001, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the surface of Comet Borrelly. It {{was found that the}} surface of comet Borrelly is hot and dry, with a temperature of between , and extremely dark, suggesting that the ice has been removed by solar heating and maturation, or is hidden by the soot-like material that covers Borrelly. In July 2005, the Deep Impact probe blasted a crater on Comet Tempel 1 to study its interior. The mission yielded results suggesting that the majority of a comet's water ice is below the surface and that these reservoirs feed the jets of <b>vaporised</b> water that form the coma of Tempel 1. Renamed EPOXI, it made a flyby of Comet Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010.|$|E

The other is diverted into the <b>vaporising</b> chamber. Gas in the <b>vaporising</b> chamber becomes fully saturated with volatile anaesthetic vapour. This gas is then mixed with the gas in the bypass channel before leaving the vaporizer.|$|R

25|$|Mixtures of {{dispersed}} {{combustible materials}} (such as gaseous or <b>vaporised</b> fuels, and some dusts) and air will burn {{only if the}} fuel concentration lies within well-defined lower and upper bounds determined experimentally, referred to as flammability limits or explosive limits. Combustion can range in violence from deflagration through detonation.|$|E
25|$|Carboxylic acids tend to {{have higher}} boiling points than water, {{not only because of}} their {{increased}} surface area, but also because of their tendency to form stabilised dimers. Carboxylic acids tend to evaporate or boil as these dimers. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be <b>vaporised,</b> both of which increase the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly.|$|E
25|$|Distillation {{involves}} boiling {{the water}} to produce water vapour. The vapour contacts a cool surface where it condenses as a liquid. Because the solutes are not normally <b>vaporised,</b> they remain in the boiling solution. Even distillation does not completely purify water, because of contaminants with similar boiling points and droplets of unvapourised liquid carried with the steam. However, 99.9% pure water {{can be obtained by}} distillation.|$|E
40|$|When {{liquid is}} {{injected}} into a geothermal reservoir, {{a fraction of}} the liquid may <b>vaporise</b> if the reservoir is sufficiently hot. The vapour forms at an approx-imately p 1 ana. r liquid-vapour interface and diffuses towards the far boundary of the reservoir. If vapour is extracted froin the far boundary, then once the new vapour has diffused across the reservoir, the rate of production of vapour at the liquid-vapour interface approximately balances the rate of extrac-tion. We find that if the pressure a. t the injection pump and extraction well is fixed, then the fraction of the liquid which <b>vaporises</b> a. nd the rate of ex-traction of vapour from the reservoir increase with time. However, the rate at which liquid is pumped into the reservoir inay initially decrease but subse-quently increases with time, if a sufficient fraction of the liquid <b>va,porises.</b> If the inass flux of liquid injected into the reservoir is fixed, then aga. in both the fraction of the liquid which <b>vaporises</b> and the inass flux of vapour which may be extracted in-crease with time.

25|$|The extreme {{heat and}} {{pressure}} of an {{underground nuclear explosion}} causes changes in the surrounding rock. The rock closest {{to the location of}} the test is <b>vaporised,</b> forming a cavity. Farther away, there are zones of crushed, cracked, and irreversibly strained rock. Following the explosion, the rock above the cavity may collapse, forming a rubble chimney. If this chimney reaches the surface, a bowl-shaped subsidence crater may form.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed to darken the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is <b>vaporised,</b> creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel as though they were outside a prison while an escape was in progress.|$|E
25|$|The second {{explosion}} killed twelve soldiers: ten {{from the}} Parachute Regiment {{and the two}} from the Queen's Own Highlanders. Mike Jackson, then a major in the Parachute Regiment, was at the scene soon after the second explosion and later described seeing body parts scattered over the road, {{in the water and}} hanging from the trees. He was asked to identify the face of his friend, Major Peter Fursman, still recognisable after it had been completely ripped from his head by the explosion and recovered from the water by divers from the Royal Engineers. Only one of Colonel Blair's epaulettes remained to identify him as his body had been <b>vaporised</b> in the blast.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{volatile}} agent, isoflurane, has a {{saturated vapour}} pressure of 32kPa (about 1/3 of an atmosphere). This {{means that the}} gas mixture leaving the <b>vaporising</b> chamber has a partial pressure of isoflurane of 32kPa. At sea-level (atmospheric pressure is about 101kPa), this equates conveniently to a concentration of 32%. However, {{the output of the}} vaporizer is typically set at 1-2%, which means that only a very small proportion of the fresh gas needs to be diverted through the <b>vaporising</b> chamber (this proportion is known as the splitting ratio). It can also be seen that a plenum vaporizer can only work one way round: if it is connected in reverse, much larger volumes of gas enter the <b>vaporising</b> chamber, and therefore potentially toxic or lethal concentrations of vapour may be delivered. (Technically, although the dial of the vaporizer is calibrated in volume percent (e.g. 2%), what it actually delivers is a partial pressure of anaesthetic agent (e.g. 2kPa)).|$|R

After Magneto is defeated, Jean is almost pacified by Logan, but the military's reinforcements arrive and open fire on the X-Men, causing the Phoenix to resurface and devastate Alcatraz Island, wiping out the military and most of Magneto's army. Magneto and the X-Men escape while Logan stays behind to reach Jean, his healing factor keeping him from being <b>vaporised</b> completely. Jean temporarily regains control and begs Logan to save her; he stabs her fatally after telling her he loves her. She is buried on the school grounds next to the graves of Xavier and Scott.|$|E
25|$|When Lucy {{returns and}} sees the Time Lord, the Doctor reveals {{to her that the}} alien brains {{colonise}} planets by taking control of their prominent leaders, with Earth being their next target. Leaving Lucy to prepare for an interview with Grant's alter ego, the Doctor and Nardole track down the alien's ship in a low orbit and board it via the TARDIS. There, they discover that the ship's reactor is in a critical state and realise from Dr Sim that he intends to drop it on New York. Remembering an observation made by Nardole, the Doctor realises the city would be <b>vaporised</b> except for the Harmony Shoals building. World leaders would then take shelter in the company's other buildings within each capital city, believing Earth was under attack, effectively allowing the brains to take them over. After Dr Sim lets slip the ship is to be dropped at a designated time, the Doctor forces its descent ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|Disheartened {{at their}} poor showing, Crijnseen decided to part {{company with the}} French.

The English remained at Nevis and were not threatened {{for the rest of}} the war. As a result of the battle Franco-Dutch strategic collaboration in the Caribbean which could have promised so much all but ceased. To make matters worse for them Louis was not willing to commit more men and ships to the Caribbean. An English attempt to retake St. Kitts ended in failure but it would not matter as more English reinforcements arrived under Rear-Admiral Sir John Harman. They reached the West Indies in June and inflicted a heavy defeat on de la Barre at Martinique on 25 June which virtually <b>vaporised</b> the entire French fleet in the America's changing the situation and making sure the English had the upper hand in the Caribbean for the remainder of the war.|$|E

25|$|The {{energy of}} the nuclear {{explosion}} is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are <b>vaporised,</b> with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable {{with the weight of}} the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The cracked zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a seismic wave. A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting {{on the bottom of the}} cavity and the cavity content begins cooling. The rebound after the shock wave causes compressive forces to build up around the cavity, called a stress containment cage, sealing the cracks.|$|E
500|$|Environment and {{situation}} are {{the crucial}} factors that determine how corpses decay. For instance, corpses will decay differently {{depending on the}} weather, {{the way they are}} buried, and the medium in which they are buried. Peat slows the decay of corpses. It was feared that, once Lindow Man was removed from that environment, which had preserved the body for nearly 2,000years, the remains would rapidly start to deteriorate, so steps were taken to insure preservation. After rejecting methods that had been used to maintain the integrity of other bog bodies, such as the [...] "pit-tanning" [...] used on Grauballe Man, which took a year and a half, scientists settled on freeze-drying. In preparation, the body was covered in a solution of 15% polyethylene glycol 400 and 85% water to prevent its becoming distorted. The body was then frozen solid and the ice <b>vaporised</b> to ensure Lindow Man did not shrink. Afterwards, Lindow Man was put in a specially constructed display case to control the environment, maintaining the temperature at [...] and the humidity at 55%.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{international}} politics, the United Nations Headquarters is often featured in movies and other pop culture. The only film actually shot on location in the UN headquarters is The Glass Wall (1953) by legendary Hollywood writer/director/producer Ivan Tors. When {{he was unable to}} obtain permission to film in the UN Headquarters, director Alfred Hitchcock covertly filmed Cary Grant arriving for the 1959 feature North by Northwest. After the action within the building, another scene shows Grant leaving across the plaza looking down from the building's roof. This was created using a painting. In the 1976 comedy film The Pink Panther Strikes Again, the building is <b>vaporised</b> by Dreyfus with a doomsday device. The final Roadblock of the 21st season of the American version of The Amazing Race also took place inside the gates of this building and had teams associating national flags with the different [...] "hellos" [...] and [...] "goodbyes" [...] they heard during the race. The building is seen in the 2008 game Grand Theft Auto IV, but called the Civilization Committee Building (CC). The building is also in the racing game The Crew in the New York City area of the game.|$|E
