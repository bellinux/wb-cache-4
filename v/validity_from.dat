500|$|While {{the birth}} {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the 220s, in the legal opinion of Ulpian (ca. 215), fideicommissa (bequests in trust) were not limited to Latin or even Greek, but could also be created in [...] "Punic, Gaulish or any other" [...] language. Originally, a testator's fideicommissum placed the heir under a moral rather than legal obligation, and Ulpian asserted that [...] "any kind of speech contains the obligation of its words, provided that each party understands the other's language himself or through accurate interpreters". The jurist Gaius distinguished between verbal contracts that derived their <b>validity</b> <b>from</b> formulaic utterance in Latin, and obligations expressing a mutual understanding of the ius gentium {{regardless of whether the}} parties were Roman or not.|$|E
500|$|Hill, on {{the other}} hand, argued that: [...] "The United Kingdom was not a foreign power at Federation, is not a foreign power now {{and never will be}} a foreign power while the Constitution remains in its present form." [...] Hill said that because the Constitution was enacted as part of a statute of the British Imperial Parliament it derived its <b>validity</b> <b>from</b> British law. Further, she argued that because section 128 of the Australian Constitution {{provides}} that the Constitution cannot be changed except in accordance with that section, then only a constitutional referendum could change this special status of the United Kingdom, and the Australia Act had no effect, [...] "so long as the United Kingdom retained any residual influence upon legislative, executive or judicial processes in Australia, it could not be regarded as 'foreign' to Australia." ...|$|E

40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) is {{a psychiatric}} affliction with a lifetime prevalence of 1 - 3 %. OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by obsessive thinking (persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses or {{images that are}} experienced as intrusive and inappropriate) and compulsive behaviour (repetitive behaviours or mental acts [e. g. hand-washing, checking, praying, and counting]) that causes marked distress or significant impairment. During the last 30 years {{there have been many}} attempts to develop animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), in the hope that they may provide a path for furthering our understanding and treatment of this disorder. The present review article provides the reader with an overview of the currently active animal models of OCD with their strengths and limitations. We have reviewed the genetic, pharmacological, neurodevelopmental and behavioural animal models of OCD, and discussed their face <b>validity</b> (derived <b>from</b> phenomenological similarity between the behavior of the animal and the specific symptoms of the human condition), predictive <b>validity</b> (derived <b>from</b> similarity in response to treatment) and construct <b>validity</b> (derived <b>from</b> similarity in the underlying mechanisms) ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Leo {{and several}} Church Fathers {{as well as}} certain interpretations of the Scriptures, the Church is built upon Peter, in pursuance of the promise of [...] Peter participates in {{everything}} which is Christ's; what the other apostles {{have in common with}} him they have through him. What is true of Peter is true also of his successors. Every other bishop is charged with the care of his particular flock, the Roman pontiff with that of the whole Church. Other bishops are his assistants in this great task. In Leo's eyes the decrees of the Council of Chalcedon acquired their <b>validity</b> <b>from</b> his confirmation.|$|E
60|$|Before {{the year}} 1773 the whole {{administration}} of India, {{and the whole}} patronage to office there, was {{in the hands of}} the East India Company.

60|$|The {{whole of}} their {{usurpation}} is established upon {{this method of}} arguing. We do not make laws. No; we do not contend for this power. We only declare law; and as we are a tribunal both competent and supreme, what we declare to be law becomes law, although {{it should not have}} been so before. Thus the circumstance of having no appeal from their jurisdiction is made to imply that they have no rule in the exercise of it: the judgment does not derive its <b>validity</b> <b>from</b> its conformity to the law; but preposterously the law is made to attend on the judgment; and the rule of the judgment is no other than the occasional will of the House. An arbitrary discretion leads, legality follows; which is just the very nature and description of a legislative act.|$|E

5000|$|Denials of Herodotus' <b>validity,</b> <b>from</b> mild to severe, {{although}} widespread, {{were never}} universal.

There was never any such universal and long-standing denial of Herodotus. On the contrary, the main events, such as the Battles of Marathon and Thermopylae, have been accepted as basically credible by many scholars of many ages. It is therefore misplaced to speak of the [...] "rehabilitation" [...] of Herodotus in medical or neo-ideologic terms.|$|E

50|$|In 1984 his orthodoxy {{was again}} called into {{question}} by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: he was summoned to Rome to explain his views expressed in The Ministry in the Church, which were regarded as Protestant. And in 1986 {{for a third time}} Schillebeeckx' theological views were put into question, again regarding the sacramental nature of office in the Roman Catholic Church. More precisely, in The Church with a Human Face Schillebeeckx argued, on biblical-historical grounds, that the consecration to Catholic priesthood does not necessarily gain its <b>validity</b> <b>from,</b> and can therefore be detached from, apostolic succession; rather, the choice of priests (and as a consequence the celebration of the Eucharist) is dependent on the local church community.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s {{there was}} growing debate between theorist {{who began to}} see {{construct}} validity as the dominant model pushing towards a more unified theory of validity and those who continued to work from multiple validity frameworks.
