5|$|I wish I could dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on was the sense that one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> all too depressingly right.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June {{the court}} acquitted nine medics and {{downgraded}} sentences against nine others. Ali Al-Ekri {{was sentenced to}} five years imprisonment, another doctor to three years and seven were given from one month to one year. Two other doctors did not appeal their sentences of 15 years' imprisonment, instead fleeing the country. On 1 October, the Court of Cassation, the country's highest court, closed the first case involving twenty medics by upholding jail sentences on the remaining nine. Although the <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> final, activist Mohamed al-Maskati said that they could still be pardoned by the king.|$|E
25|$|Khalil al-Dulaimi {{and various}} {{international}} commentators {{alleged that the}} date on which the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> read live to the world, 5 November 2006, was deliberately selected by the Bush Administration in order to influence the US midterm elections which occurred two days later. This {{has been called a}} November Surprise. The <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> expected to be on 16 October 2006, but was postponed to consider recalling some of the witnesses. Even as the <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> released verbally on 5 November, the written, final <b>verdict</b> <b>was</b> not released until days later.|$|R

5|$|The victory {{claims that}} were made by each side in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads, based as both were on misinterpretations of the opponent's behavior, have been dismissed by present-day historians. They agree that the result of the Monitor–Merrimack encounter was not a victory for either side. As the combat between ironclads was the primary significance of the battle, the general <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> that the overall result was a draw. All would acknowledge that the Southern fleet inflicted far more damage than it received, which would ordinarily imply that they had gained a tactical victory. Compared to other Civil War battles, the loss of men and ships for the Union Navy would be considered a clear defeat. On the other hand, the blockade was not seriously threatened, so the entire battle can be regarded as an assault that ultimately failed.|$|E
5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|Potential presidential {{candidates}} are vetted by an unelected three-member Presidential Elections Committee ("PEC"). The PEC is not constitutionally obliged to give reasons behind its decisions to award or deny {{a certificate of}} eligibility. Its decision {{is not subject to}} legal or political scrutiny, and its <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> final. There has been criticism of how Andrew Kuan, who applied to be a candidate in the 2005 presidential election, was denied a certificate of eligibility. Before the PEC could reach a decision on the matter, he was reportedly discredited though statements from various people which were published in the media that alleged incompetence and cast doubt on his character. Subsequently, Kuan was denied a certificate, the PEC stating that his seniority and responsibility as the Jurong Town Corporation's Group Chief Financial Officer were not comparable to the experience of a chairman or chief executive officer of a statutory board or a company with a paid-up capital of at least $100 million, as required by the Constitution. There is no legal requirement for the PEC to interview prospective candidates, and it did not do so to allow Kuan to explain his side of the story. As a result, the unopposed incumbent S.R. Nathan was declared the President for a second term.|$|E

25|$|Jurors are {{generally}} {{required to keep}} their deliberations in strict confidence during the trial and deliberations, and in some jurisdictions even after a <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> rendered. In English law, the jury's deliberations must never be disclosed outside the jury, even years after the case; to repeat parts of the trial or <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> considered to be contempt of court, a criminal offense. In the United States, confidentiality is usually only required until a verdict has been reached, and jurors have sometimes made remarks that called into question whether a verdict was properly reached. In Australia, academics are permitted to scrutinize the jury process only after obtaining a certificate or approval from the Attorney-General.|$|E
25|$|When Hercule Poirot's own dentist, Henry Morley, {{is found}} dead from a gunshot wound, the {{official}} <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> {{that he has}} killed himself; a verdict apparently supported when it appears that he has given one of his patients a fatal overdose of anaesthetic. Poirot suspects, however, {{that there is more}} to the case than at first appears, and soon events confirm his worst suspicions.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{individuals}} {{accused of}} any crime are considered {{innocent until proven}} guilty, although the defendant may be held in detention. Unless the accused opts for a fast-track trial, murder cases are heard by a corte d'assise (English translation: court of assizes). A guilty <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> not regarded as a definitive conviction until the accused has exhausted the appeals process, irrespective {{of the number of}} times the defendant has been put on trial.|$|E

25|$|While {{the sword}} and scales are {{traditional}} attributes of Iustitia, the Bernese statue's blindfold is a novelty; only later did it become a common element in personifications of Justice {{and a general}} symbol for the principle of equality before the law. The blindfold implies that justice {{ought to be done}} without respect to rank or standing; that a just <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> arrived at through introspection rather than with a view to outward looks. Gieng's Iustitia is a symbol of republican justice, and was a forceful public reminder of the Bernese Republic's authority through law.|$|E
25|$|On 26 April 2012, Gillani {{was convicted}} on {{the charges of}} Contempt of Court, {{becoming}} Pakistan's first Prime Minister to be convicted while holding office. He was sentenced {{to be held in}} custody till the rising of court, a symbolic sentence lasting 30 seconds. The verdict was a short order and the full verdict of the court (over 70 pages) had been reserved, and was handed over after few days' time. Gillani's lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan announced that the Prime Minister shall file an appeal against the Supreme Court's verdict once the full <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> handed over, despite opposition parties urgings. However, Gilani refused to step down.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a {{man known}} as Peter Hays {{has been on}} trial for murder, and the case is already with the jury, and a <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> {{expected}} soon. Wolfe and Archie Goodwin are sufficiently distracted by enquiries about Peter Hays being the man named in the advertisement (and that he is by implication innocent of the murder for which Hays is currently being tried) that Wolfe dispatches Archie to visit the court room to hear the verdict against Hays. By comparing the man he sees in court to photos supplied by the father, Archie tentatively identifies the two names as referring to the same man.|$|E

25|$|Milenko Trifunović, Brane Džinić, Aleksandar Radovanović, Slobodan Jakovljević, Branislav Medan - the Appellate Panel {{ruled that}} trial <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> altered {{in the sense}} that the accused, being aware of the {{existence}} of the genocidal plan of others, performed the actions by which they considerably contributed to the commission of that offense, and therefore they participated in the criminal offense of Genocide as accessories (not as co-perpetrators), since it was not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused themselves acted with genocidal intent. Hence, Trifunović was sentenced to 33 years, Džinić to 32 years, Radovanović to 32 years, Jakovljević to 28 years and Medan to 28 years.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the {{distinction}} between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, {{the amount of money}} due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.|$|E
25|$|Signing with Indianola Records {{for their}} first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was {{replaced}} by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for Victory Records. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You (2010), the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. Since 2011, the band {{has been involved in}} a lawsuit with Victory Records over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums until a final <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> reached. They released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, that month.

500|$|Seen as a cult {{series by}} some critics, Captain Scarlet ranked 33rd in a 2007 Radio Times poll to {{determine}} the greatest science-fiction series of all time. Despite concerns {{that it is not}} a true [...] "children's" [...] series on account of its [...] "dark" [...] tone and violence, it appeared in 51st position in the 2001 Channel 4 list show 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows. Judging Captain Scarlet next to its immediate predecessor, Thunderbirds, Gerry Anderson's own <b>verdict</b> <b>is</b> unambiguous: [...] "Nothing was as successful as Thunderbirds.

500|$|The first printed {{version of}} Amy Robsart's murder {{appeared}} in the satirical libel Leicester's Commonwealth, a notorious propaganda work against the Earl of Leicester written by Catholic exiles in 1584.

What he {{will be remembered for}} is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation." [...] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests that [...] "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy". Aitken feels that [...] "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues.
