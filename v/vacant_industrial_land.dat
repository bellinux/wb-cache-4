I use a binomial logit model and find that within the 1 -mile submarket near LRT, the effect of distance to LRT stations on land use change had a different radius and magnitude depending on existing land use. The effect of LRT on conversions of low-density housing to denser uses only extended out to 90 feet from stations after LRT went into operation. <b>Vacant</b> and <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> were the most likely to experience land use change, especially in working class, mixed land use neighborhoods with higher population densities. In general, the effect of LRT on land use change was limited in high income neighborhoods. Zoning policy changes around stations had a small but significant positive effect on land use change...|$|R

It lays its regard over the <b>vacant</b> <b>industrial</b> heritage building looking for a possibility of recuperation or repurpose of their spaces. Though the number of examples overtakes {{the capacity of the}} decision markers. This together with a lack of tools for the definition of new function leave the spaces to interventions that no always correspond with the context and the object. Nevertheless, there is a large path already done in term of reuse of <b>vacant</b> <b>industrial</b> buildings. Some authors characterize this an a culture of the exploitation. This scenario is also present in Havana, Cuba. There is a vast representation of <b>vacant</b> <b>industrial</b> heritage buildings not correct exploited according their capacities. In this frame, the thesis is supported on the determination of a methodology for the identification of potential uses for the <b>vacant</b> <b>industrial</b> heritage building, taking as a relevant resource, the experience gained in the world in term of reuse that could be applied to the case of the industrial building along the Almendares River.

40|$|Efforts to {{cope with}} the legacy of our {{industrial}} cities [...] blight, poverty, environmental degradation, ailing communities [...] have galvanized action across {{the public and private sectors}} to move <b>vacant</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>land,</b> also referred to as brownfields, to productive use; to curb sprawling development outside urban areas; and to reinvigorate urban communities. Such efforts, however, may be proceeding without thorough investigations into the environmental health and safety risks associated with industrial brownfields properties and the needs of affected neighborhoods. We describe an approach to characterize vacant and underused industrial and commercial properties in Southeast Baltimore and the health and well being of communities living near these properties. The screening algorithm developed to score and rank properties in Southeast Baltimore (n= 182) showed that these sites are not benign. The historical data revealed a range of hazardous operations, including metal smelting, oil refining, warehousing, and transportation, as well as paints, plastics, and metals manufacturing. The data also identified hazardous substances linked to these properties, including heavy metals, solvents, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, plasticizers, and insecticides, all of which are suspected or recognized toxicants and many of which are persistent in the environment. The health analysis revealed disparities across Southeast Baltimore communities, including excess deaths from respiratory illness (lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, influenza, and pneumonia), total cancers, and a "leading cause of death" index and a spatial and statistical relationship between environmentally degraded brownfields areas and at-risk communities. Brownfields redevelopment is a key component of our national efforts to address environmental justice and health disparities across urban communities and is critical to urban revitalization. Incorporating public health into brownfields-related cleanup and land-use decisions will increase the odds for successful neighborhood redevelopment and long-term public health benefits...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} and {{unbalanced}} development of industry, {{a large amount}} of cultivated land is converted into <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> with lower efficiency. The existing research is extensively concerned with <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use and <b>industrial</b> development in isolation, but little {{attention has been paid to}} the relationship between them. To help address this gap, the paper creates a new efficiency measure method for <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use combining Subvector Data Envelope Analysis (DEA) with spatial analysis approach. The proposed model has been verified by using the <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2001 to 2013. The spatial autocorrelation relationship between industrial development and <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use efficiency is explored. Furthermore, this paper examines the effects of industrial development on <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use efficiency by spatial panel data model. The results indicate that the <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use efficiency and the industrial development level in the provinces of eastern region are higher than those of the western region. The spatial distribution of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use efficiency shows remarkable positive spatial autocorrelation. However, the level of industrial development has obvious negative spatial autocorrelation since 2009.

Whereas, as agricultural, residential and commercial land management becomes much emphasized, less attention is paid to <b>industrial</b> <b>land.</b> Based on literature review and data mining, the paper briefly analyzes the evolution of land policy in China and presents a description of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use during the process, dividing the whole period into four stages. In each stage, there are some specific conditions of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use, as the <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> allocation changed from freely administrative allocation to the bid invitation, auction and listing with reserve price in policy. The features of large area, low intensity and free/low price of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> have remained through all those years, waiting to be further addressed. Country-wide data and practices show that several problems stays around the country. In a context that allocations of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> are mainly driven by policy, the regulatory function of market mechanism is quite limited. A few suggestions are proposed to improve the situation at the end of this paper. Department of Building and Real EstateAuthor name used in this publication: Eddie C. M. Hu...|$|R

40|$|In most {{empirical}} applications, forecasting {{models for}} the analysis of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> focus on the relationship between current values of economic parameters and <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use. This paper aims to test this assumption by focusing on the dynamic relationship between current and lagged values of the 'economic fundamentals' and <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> development. Not much effort has yet been attributed to develop land forecasting models to predict the demand for <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> except those applying static regressions or other statistical measures. In this research, we estimated a dynamic panel data model across 40 regions from 2000 to 2008 for the Netherlands to uncover the relationship between current and lagged values of economic parameters and <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> development. Land-use regulations such as land zoning policies, and other land-use restrictions like natural protection areas, geographical limitations in the form of water bodies or sludge areas are expected to affect supply of land, which will in turn be reflected in <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> market outcomes. Our results suggest that gross domestic product (GDP), industrial employment, gross value added (GVA), property price, and other parameters representing demand and supply conditions in the industrial market explain <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> developments with high significance levels. It is also shown that contrary to the current values, lagged values of the economic parameters have more sound relationships with the industrial developments in the Netherlands. The findings suggest use of lags between selected economic parameters and <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use in land forecasting applications...|$|R
40|$|Rapid industrialization, {{as one of}} {{the main}} driving forces {{promoting}} sustainable economic growth, has increased the area of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use significantly. <b>Industrial</b> <b>land</b> use manifests that the competition between it and other kinds of land use is growing. During the last decade in China, many targeted <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use policies have been enacted to stimulate appropriate <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use and to promote healthy economic development. However, it is difficult for scholars and governments of rapidly developing countries to judge and evaluate the performance of such policies. Based on statistical data gathered over almost 10 years and an idea called “industrial land equivalent” (ILE), this paper analyzes the contribution made by the implementation of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use policy to economic development, using a Cobb-Douglas production function by which to quantify the influence of land institutions and land regulation systems. The result of the study shows that factors, such as <b>industrial</b> <b>land,</b> labor and capital, all {{play an important role in}} GDP growth. Additionally, it is found that <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> institutions and regulation systems have a strongly positive influence on economic development. It was also found that the influence of policy in eastern China is greater than that in the west and that repeated, short-term land regulation has a negative effect on the economy. Therefore, it is profoundly important for the Chinese economy that a stable and durable <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use policy be maintained as the industrial center migrates to the Midwest. The research philosophy and method offered by this paper have great significance for the quantitative evaluation of policy performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{planned economy}} system’s {{previous}} form of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> market control in China {{has led to}} current market failure because of {{a large amount of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> being sold at a very low price, causing extensive overuse of land and negative effects on land management. As the “World Factory”, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is well known for its rapid urbanization largely driven by Foreign Direct Investment in labor-intensive industries. A low-land price strategy has been commonly adopted by the local government in order to attract industrial investment. In the past decade, the PRD has increasingly faced the increasing competition from its neighboring competition from its neighboring countries in Southeast Asia that have established preference policies to attract FDI and foreign enterprises. Despite a growing body of literature on the internal forces of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> in China, little is known of the external forces involved except for the importance of FDI and the intensity of interregional competition between China and other countries in attempting to attract foreign investment. This research fills the knowledge gap by modeling the situation {{in the form of an}} international cooperative game model aimed at revealing the <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> price formation mechanism between the PRD region and Southeast Asian regions. The conditions of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> in the area and several Southeast Asian countries are first analyzed for their <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> price movements in recent years. A game theoretic model is then built that exhibits similar characteristics. The result indicates that the governments’ low land price strategy and the competition between the PRD and its neighboring countries have created unnecessarily high social and environmental costs. Policy suggestions are made to encourage a more appropriate use of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> in China, and the most important being the need for a mindset shift from competition towards coopetition between the PRD and Southeast Asian regions.
