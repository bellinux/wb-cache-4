5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: The <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> weak and insufficient.|$|E
5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eighteenth}} century, English {{merchant}} law was still {{based on the}} Lex mercatoria, a medieval series of customs and principles used to regulate trading. Other countries in Europe had reformed and modernised their law, resulting in English merchant law being about a century behind mercantile law of other European countries. A merchant was, by his <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> international, and the inconsistencies between English law and the law of other nations made business difficult.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried {{men and women to}} intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E

40|$|The {{contemporary}} Humean programme {{that seeks}} to combine property realism with the denial of necessary connections between distinct existences is flawed. Objects and properties by their <b>very</b> <b>natures</b> are entangled in such connections. It follows that modal notions cannot be reductively analysed by appeal to the concept property, not even if the reducing theory posits an abundant supply of entities to fall under that concept...|$|R

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|But {{although}} the Sermons of Swift are deficient in eloquence, and were lightly esteemed by their author, {{they must not}} be undervalued by the modern reader. They exhibit, in an eminent degree, that powerful grasp of intellect which distinguished the author above all his contemporaries. In no religious discourses can be found more sound good sense, more happy and forcible views of the immediate subject. The reasoning is not only irresistible, but managed in a mode so simple and clear, that its force is obvious to the most ordinary capacity. Upon all subjects of morality, the preacher maintains {{the character of a}} rigid and inflexible monitor; neither admitting apology for that which is wrong, nor softening the difficulty of adhering to that which is right; a stern stoicism of doctrine, that may fail in finding many converts, but leads to excellence in the few manly minds who dare to embrace it. In treating the doctrinal points of belief, (as in his Sermon upon the Trinity,) Swift systematically refuses to quit the high and pre-eminent ground which the defender of Christianity is entitled to occupy, or to submit to the test of human reason, mysteries which are placed, by their <b>very</b> <b>nature,</b> far beyond our finite capacities. Swift considered, that, in religion, as in profane science, there must be certain ultimate laws which are to be received as fundamental truths, although we are incapable of defining or analysing their nature; and he censures those divines, who, in presumptuous confidence of their own logical powers, enter into controversy upon such mysteries of faith, without considering that they give thereby the most undue advantage to the infidel. Our author wisely and consistently declared reason an incompetent judge of doctrines, of which God had declared the fact, concealing from man the manner. He contended, that he who, upon the whole, receives the Christian religion as of divine inspiration, must be contented to depend upon God's truth, and his holy word, and receive with humble faith the mysteries which are too high for comprehension. Above all, Swift points out, with his usual forcible precision, the mischievous tendency of those investigations which, while they assail one fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion, shake and endanger the whole fabric, destroy the settled faith of thousands, pervert and mislead the genius of the learned and acute, destroy and confound the religious principles of the simple and ignorant.|$|E
