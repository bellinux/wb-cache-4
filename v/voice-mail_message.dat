2500|$|Because of {{evidence}} management concerns, San Diego County Sheriff's Department investigators initially {{did not attempt}} to power up the phone or operate it, fearing that they might over write evidence contained in its memory. Instead, they tried to determine whether forensic software was available which would allow them to examine that model of phone. On August 15, unable to identify any such technology, a detective turned on the phone and conducted a manual search of it, finding that the <b>voice-mail</b> <b>message</b> was not stored on the phone. They did not request that AT try to retrieve the deleted message from its servers. Later, on September 21, a homicide investigator with the department announced that they would be searching it again, using what they described as [...] "new technology" [...] to copy the phone's data for further investigation. Because Zahau's cell phone was a newer model that investigators were not familiar with, they had previously been unsure what software they could use to accomplish this task. In early October, investigators completed their second examination of the cell phone. They stated that they did not uncover any additional information and would soon return the phone to Zahau's family.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1993, Vedder and McDowell were {{involved}} in a bar room brawl in New Orleans, Louisiana that resulted in Vedder being arrested for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace. The Pearl Jam song [...] "Black, Red, Yellow" [...] (from the [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] single) is about the Rodman/Michael Jordan/Phil Jackson-era Chicago Bulls teams. The middle of the song features a <b>voice-mail</b> <b>message</b> Rodman left for Vedder asking Vedder to return his call. Vedder sang the national anthem before the third game of the 1998 NBA Finals in Chicago, and has sung [...] "Take Me Out to the Ball Game" [...] at six Cubs games, including Game 5 of the 2016 World Series. In 2007, a few days before performing with Pearl Jam in Chicago for Lollapalooza, he threw out the first pitch at Wrigley Field, the home of the Cubs. Vedder wrote a song at the request of former Cubs shortstop and first baseman Ernie Banks paying tribute to the Cubs called [...] "All the Way". On September 18, 2008, the song was made available for digital download via Pearl Jam's official website for US$0.99. The day after the Cubs won the 2016 World Series, the Cubs' official Twitter account posted a montage video backed by Vedder's song in a tribute to Cubs fans.|$|E

50|$|On March 20, 2005, O'Brien {{issued a}} written {{statement}} announcing {{that he had been}} admitted to a rehabilitation facility for alcoholism. Around the announcement of O'Brien entering rehabilitation, a string of sexually graphic <b>voice-mail</b> <b>messages</b> that contained O'Brien's voice started to make the rounds, particularly within the Internet community and radio programs The Bubba the Love Sponge Show, The Wendy Williams Experience, The Howard Stern Show and The Opie and Anthony Show. The drunk dialing incident consisted primarily of O'Brien, in a state of arousal, repeatedly recording sexually graphic messages, complete with suggestions of drug use, on the cellular vocal mail-box of a woman who continues to remain anonymous.|$|R
5000|$|Section 209 (Seizure of <b>voice-mail</b> <b>messages</b> {{pursuant}} to warrants) removed the text [...] "any electronic storage of such communication" [...] from title 18, section 2510 of the United States Code. Before this was struck from the Code, the U.S. government needed {{to apply for}} a title III wiretap order before they could open voice-mails; however, now the government only need apply for an ordinary search. Section 2703, which specifies when a [...] "provider of electronic communication services" [...] must disclose the contents of stored communications, was also amended to allow such a provider to be compelled to disclose the contents via a search warrant, and not a wiretap order. According to Vermont senator Patrick Leahy, this was done to [...] "harmonizing the rules applicable to stored voice and non-voice (e.g., e-mail) communications".|$|R
5000|$|A {{commanding}} {{presence on}} the field who was fined by National League and Major League Baseball {{on more than one}} occasion for his public comments and behavior, Froemming has acknowledged that [...] "the one moment I would take back if I could" [...] was in January 2003 when he referred to an umpire administrator as a [...] "stupid Jew bitch" [...] during a dispute over a relatively minor conflict over travel arrangements to Japan; the comment was made at the end of a <b>voice-mail</b> <b>message,</b> apparently after Froemming thought the call had ended. He was given a 10-day suspension without pay for the incident, which he accepted after making a public apology. Froemming was also fined in 1996 for going into the Los Angeles Dodgers' clubhouse before a game in New York against the Mets to get Mike Piazza's autograph. Froemming told Piazza that catcher Johnny Bench refused to sign baseballs for him once and proceeded to go 0 for 4 that day with three strikeouts.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2010, he {{released}} the Gazzillion Ear EP on Lex {{which included the}} Thom Yorke Remix and two mixes by Jneiro Jarel. A further remix by Madvillainz featuring a <b>voice-mail</b> <b>message</b> from Kanye West was released online. The release of the Gazzillion Ear EP coincided with Doom's first ever live performances outside North America. On 5 March 2010, Lex and Sónar presented the first Doom show in London, at The Roundhouse in Camden. The event {{was the first of}} many Doom live performances around the world between early 2010 and the present. These shows included the Lex 10th Anniversary show at The Roundhouse with Ghostface Killah and Jneiro Jarel, performances in Europe with Gorillaz, support for Portishead and performances with Jneiro Jarel at Bestival 2012. During this period Doom released some material on labels other than Lex. On 26 May 2010, part of the track Madvillain [...] "Paper Mill" [...] was released a digital single through Adult Swim. Expektoration, a live Doom album, was released on 14 September 2010 through Gold Dust Media.|$|E

Another old DVS Mindz song, [...] "Birds," [...] was given a complete makeover, as was a retooled version of [...] "DVS Mindbender," [...] which appeared in its original form on Million Dolla Broke Niggaz.|$|R
40|$|IP {{telephony}} means “telephone calls transported {{using the}} Internet Protocol”, but {{the degree to}} which IP is used varies between IP telephony providers. Some providers only use the Internet (e. g. Skype) and some use a mixture of IP and regular phone lines. The public interest in IP telephony is triggered by several factors. Households are often most interested in the cost-cutting aspects. Corporations are also focused on cost savings, but see simplified administration as another motive for IP telephony. Besides those pros there are some cons of IP telephony, and one example is the generally weak security due to a dependency on low-security protocols, like SIP. SIP is a very popular protocol for setting up, maintaining and tearing down IP telephony connections. It does not define any particular services, such as instant messaging, video conferencing or voice mail, but rather defines a set of operations {{that can be used to}} design such services. SIP is text-based protocol that is easy to understand, but it suffers from many security issues due to its default non-encrypted design. Related to the security issues of IP telephony and SIP is “spam over IP telephony ” (SPIT). SPIT usually refers to audio-based spam, either scam/phishing <b>voice-mail</b> <b>messages</b> or telemarketing calls. Since the content of a conversion cannot be analysed beforehand it is much harder to detect VoIP spam than e-mai...|$|R
40|$|Communication {{technology}} has been seeing rapid growth, characterized by new access networks (e. g., cellular, pager, wireless-IP) and end-devices (e. g., PDAs, twoway pagers, multi-model access devices). There have been several efforts at integrating services across such heterogeneity. However, little {{work has been done}} on identifying an underlying architecture for such an integration. We identify the requirements for this {{in the context of an}} integrated network with heterogeneous end-points. The Universal Inbox provides (a) generic data type transformation, (b) customizable redirection of incoming communication based on user preference profiles, and (c) device name mapping and translation. We present an architecture mapping these functionalities to reusable infrastructure components realized as Internet services. The unique feature of the architecture is its extensibility – it allows not only the integration of existing end-points, but also extension in terms of the enddevices and novel services it can handle. We have implemented the Universal Inbox components in a test-bed setting, supporting a variety of devices and services: GSM cellular-phones, voice-over-IP end-points, <b>voice-mail,</b> e-mail, instant <b>messaging</b> service, etc. With our architecture, building personal mobility and service mobility features, and extending them to new end-points has been easy in concept and in implementation. The performance analyses with the initial implementation show that even the heavy-weight components can be scaled to accommodate a large user-base...|$|R
