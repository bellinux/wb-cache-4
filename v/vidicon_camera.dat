25|$|The Imaging Science Subsystem, {{made up of}} a {{wide angle}} and a narrow angle camera, is a {{modified}} version of the slow scan <b>vidicon</b> <b>camera</b> designs that were used in the earlier Mariner flights. The Imaging Science Subsystem consists of two television-type cameras, each with eight filters in a commandable filter wheel mounted in front of the vidicons. One has a low resolution 200mm focal length wide-angle lens with an aperture of f/3 (the wide angle camera), while the other uses a higher resolution 1500mm narrow-angle f/8.5 lens (the narrow angle camera).|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{the arrival}} of the <b>Vidicon</b> <b>camera</b> tube made smaller cameras possible. 1952 saw the first Walkie-Lookie [...] "portable cameras". Image Orthicon tubes were still used till {{the arrival of}} the Plumbicon.|$|E
50|$|During the mid-1950s, its {{laboratory}} {{work had}} produced another early test prototype capable of transmitting still images every two seconds over regular analog PSTN telephone lines. The images were {{captured by the}} Picturephone's compact <b>Vidicon</b> <b>camera</b> and then transferred to a storage tube or magnetic drum for transmission over regular phone lines at two-second intervals to the receiving unit, which displayed them on a small cathode-ray television tube. AT&T had earlier promoted its experimental video for telephone service at the 1939 New York World's Fair.|$|E

5000|$|G.E. ceased {{production}} of its 3 x I.O., the type PC-25 in 1966. Meanwhile, {{the company had}} brought out, in 1965, a 4-tube <b>vidicon</b> <b>camera,</b> the GE PE-24, for film scanner use. [...] This was followed by an all-Plumbicon 4-tube camera, the type PE250, which used conventional relay optics, rather than the prism optics of some other colour cameras. This camera was later followed by the PE350 and PE400, which continued to use the 4-tube format. (G.E. maintained, at that time, that 4-tube cameras gave the best pictures).|$|E

50|$|ESSA-9 carried {{two sets}} of two main instruments, the Advanced <b>Vidicon</b> <b>Camera</b> System (AVCS) and the Flat Plate Radiometer (FPR). The AVCS was used to collect imagery of cloud cover on earth. The cameras had a {{resolution}} of 2 mi and covered an area of 2000 sq mi. The cameras took single images of a particular region of the earth's surface once a day.

40|$|The International Ultraviolet Explorer {{spectral}} image processing system is an on-line interactive system which provides {{data on the}} UV spectra of astronomical objects in the wavelength range 1000 to 3200 A. In operation for one year, the image processing system accepts two-dimensional images transmitted digitally from the satellite's SEC <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras.</b> The system extracts spectral intensity {{as a function of}} wavelength and removes background, scattered light, halation and echelle effects...|$|R
50|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed as a joint project between NASA, ESRO (which became ESA in 1975) and the UK Science and Engineering Research Council. SERC provided the <b>Vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> for the spectrographs {{as well as}} software for the scientific instruments.

50|$|MineCam 1 used a {{monochrome}} <b>vidicon</b> <b>camera</b> in {{a waterproof}} housing {{made out of}} a 10 cm plastic sewer pipe and fittings, with an acrylic window. This was successfully tested in the deep end of a swimming pool. The camera was insensitive - it needed a 150 W lamp, which required a 240 V supply, but so did the camera. The cable was 100 m of video co-axial and power, taped together at 2 m intervals and numbered to give a crude depth measurement. The camera and lamp were heavy, so an old 6 mm static climbing rope was used to support it. The monitor was a 10 cm portable TV.|$|E

The major parameters of the two-inch return-beam <b>vidicon</b> <b>camera</b> subsystem are explained, and its performance characteristics are given. The relationship of the three-camera subsystem and the associated ground stations is illustrated. A multispectral aerial photograph is shown which is a simulation of a scene taken on the Apollo 9 mission.

40|$|Photometrically {{corrected}} {{images from}} the IUE's two intensified <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> are used to explore the character of detector noise, and a protocol for the derivation of realistic noise models is proposed {{on the basis of}} available collections of UV-Flood calibration images. The incomplete removal of the pixel-to-pixel sensitivity pattern can lead to a factor-of- 2 enhancement in apparent noise; even with good suppression of pixel granularity, the remaining random noise can exhibit saturation behavior which causes S/N to cease improving with increasing exposure. When all relevant effects are considered, underlying, 'pristine' noise models show virtually no dependence on spatial position...|$|R
40|$|The large {{quantity}} of Mariner 9 television pictures taken at phase angles ranging up to twice those accessible from earth {{has been used}} to describe integrated photometric properties of Mars. Although frame-to-frame variations emphasize the shortcomings of <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> when used in a photometric mode, statistical trends have yielded data comparable with earth-based observations. Analysis of atmospheric parameters over a period of changing opacity - November 1971 through March 1972 - has provided time-varying optical depths and light-scattering information. Linear function characterization of the Mars reflectance is clearly discrepant at large incidence or emission angles and at phase angles greater than 40 deg...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} is {{proposed for the}} semi-automatic digitization of topographic maps using a <b>vidicon</b> <b>camera</b> interfaced with a mini-computer system. The required input is {{a black and white}} map that shows only contour lines and corresponding elevation values such as the advance prints of 7. 5 minute USGS topographic sheets. A set of image processing algorithms is implemented on an image of the contour map acquired by a <b>vidicon</b> <b>camera.</b> The system developed performs extraction of contour lines, tagging elevation values and subsequent interpolation of elevations to produce, in 5 sec. x 5 sec. intervals of latitude and longitude, digital elevation matrices. The interpolation of elevations for non-contour points is achieved using a steepest descent algorithm. A communications capability allows the final data to be transferred over telephone lines to an off-site unit such as the floppy disk or a micro-computer...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of planetary slow-scan <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> {{started with the}} exploratory flyby mission to Mars in 1965, and has continued through the planned launch of the Mariner Jupiter/Saturn 1977 Mission. To date, the camera performance has been constrained by limited spacecraft capabilities rather than driven by desires of experimenters. The paper traces this evolution for a generation of camera using charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors, which have greater capability within spacecraft weight and power constraints. Projections are given of scientific objectives for the CCD cameras, and it is shown how these objectives will drive the camera performance, data rates, on-board processing, pointing accuracy, and other spacecraft system parameters...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{reflectance}} {{data from}} the Viking-II Orbiter <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> have provided a means of mapping and classifying Martian surface materials over about 65 % of the planet. The imagery, acquired at three wavelengths, was processed to remove an average Martian photometric function; albedo maps at the three wavelengths were created. Analysis of the imagery showed that the dark region between the equator and about 30 deg S in the Martian highlands consists of ancient ridges, crater rims and rugged plateaus which are very red, and younger intercrater volcanic plains exhibiting mare ridges which are much less red. In addition probable eolian deposits {{were found in the}} intermediate and high albedo regions...|$|R

40|$|The Video Inertial Pointing (VIP) System {{is being}} {{developed}} to satisfy the acquisition and pointing requirements of astronomical telescopes. VIP employs a single video sensor to generate three-axis pointing error signals and to provide inputs for a cathode ray tube (CRT) display of the star field. The pointing error signals update the telescope's gyro stabilization system. The CRT display facilitates target acquisition and positioning of the telescope by a remote operator. The present paper describes the analysis, simulation, and hardware development of a prototype, advanced VIP system.

40|$|Imaging for {{navigation}} and science {{has been studied}} for a 1980 Encke flyby at 0. 4 to 0. 8 AU from the sun with spinning and three-axis spacecraft. Trajectory errors, maneuvers, encounter geometry, imaging performance, and data transmission were considered. Onboard comet sightings are needed for navigation. Recommended for a three-axis spacecraft are two <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> and a nucleus sensor for closed-loop pointing control. The cameras are essentially the Mariner 9 and Mariner 10 instruments; the nucleus sensor is {{an updated version of}} a sensor flown on Mariners 6 and 7. For a spinning spacecraft, a framing camera using a charge-coupled device and a spin-scan photometer are proposed. The framing camera would be a new design; it would not be despun, but the spin axis should point along the comet-centered velocity vector. The photometer is essentially that flown on Pioneer 10 and 11. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{objectives}} of the imaging experiment on the Viking Orbiter are to aid the selection of Viking Lander sites, to map and monitor the chosen sites during lander operations, {{to aid in the}} selection of future landing sites, and to extend our knowledge of the planet. The imaging system consists of two identical <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> each attached to a 1026 -mm T/ 8 telescope giving approximately 1 -deg square field of view. From an altitude of 1500 km, the picture elements will be approximately 24 m apart. The vidicon is coupled with an image intensifier which provides increased sensitivity and permits electronic shuttering and image motion compensation.

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the cometary meteoroids was studied by {{closed circuit television}} observing systems. <b>Vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> produce basic data on standard video tape and enable the recording of the spectra of faint shower meteors, consequently the chemical study is extended to smaller particles {{and we have a}} larger data bank than is available from the more conventional method of recording meteor spectra by photography. The two main problems in using video tape meteor spectrum records are: (1) the video tape recording has a much lower resolution than the photographic technique; (2) video tape is relatively new type of data storage in astronomy and the methods of quantitative photometry have not yet been fully developed in the various fields where video tape is used. The use of the most detailed photographic meteor spectra to calibrate the video tape records and to make positive identification of the more prominent chemical elements appearing in the spectra may solve the low resolution problem. Progress in the development of standard photometric techniques for the analysis of video tape records of meteor spectra is reported...|$|R
50|$|The {{instruments}} of the orbiter {{consisted of two}} <b>vidicon</b> <b>cameras</b> for imaging (VIS), an infrared spectrometer for water vapor mapping (MAWD) and infrared radiometers for thermal mapping (IRTM). The orbiter primary mission ended {{at the beginning of}} solar conjunction on November 5, 1976. The extended mission commenced on December 14, 1976, after solar conjunction. Operations included close approaches to Phobos in February 1977. The periapsis was reduced to 300 km on March 11, 1977. Minor orbit adjustments were done occasionally {{over the course of the}} mission, primarily to change the walk rate — the rate at which the areocentric longitude changed with each orbit, and the periapsis was raised to 357 km on July 20, 1979. On August 7, 1980, Viking 1 Orbiter was running low on attitude control gas and its orbit was raised from 357 × 33943 km to 320 × 56000 km to prevent impact with Mars and possible contamination until the year 2019. Operations were terminated on August 17, 1980, after 1485 orbits. A 2009 analysis concluded that, while the possibility that Viking 1 had impacted Mars could not be ruled out, it was most likely still in orbit.|$|R
