5|$|Apart {{from these}} two long lasting {{newspaper}} comic strips, Vandersteen {{made a number of}} other comics in these years. Most important was his work for Ons Volkske, the youth supplement of the weekly magazine Ons Volk, which from the end of 1945 on became an independent comic magazine. Marc Sleen was editor-in-chief and filled most pages together with Vandersteen. Vandersteen created a number of realistic stories of about 20 pages each, where he developed his own style after starting <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a follower of Harold Foster. In his usual more caricatural style, he created in August 1946 the recurring gagstrip De Vrolijke Bengels (The Happy Rascals). More adult comics appeared in the magazine Ons Volk.|$|E

25|$|The third HMS Polyphemus was a Royal Navy torpedo ram, serving from 1881 until 1903. A shallow-draft, fast, {{low-profile}} vessel, she {{was designed}} to penetrate enemy harbours at speed and sink anchored ships. Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby primarily as a protected torpedo boat, the ram was provided <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> secondary armament.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few years {{extensive}} improvements were implemented, many new trees were planted, as well as new footpaths and bridges being constructed. The layout of the park today is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> it was in this period. A bowling green was built in 1905, reputed to be the first in Luton.|$|E

25|$|The {{amalgamation}} of the BNCR {{with the}} Midland Railway {{took place on}} 1 July 1903. The railway retained {{a great deal of}} autonomy and was run by a management committee based in Belfast – the Northern Counties Committee (NCC). Locomotive and rolling stock liveries remained <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they had been under the BNCR except for the adoption of the Midland Railway coat of arms and NCC monogram.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{liked the}} Fw 190 <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> far as handling, {{performance}} and armament was concerned. Compared with the Bf 109 {{series of the}} time, the Fw 190 was superior, but this did not hold true at altitudes above 8,000 metres (25,000 feet). Especially against bombers the Fw 190 was by far superior because of its heavy armament, its lower vulnerability, and its better protection for the pilot. All these features were favourable for bomber and schlachtflieger operations.|$|E
25|$|By December 1999, Anderson {{was working}} on plans for a {{computer}} animated sequel to Captain Scarlet, and he showed early test reels at a few fan conventions. These reels had the visual design and characters looking <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> {{they had in the}} original show, although the vehicle designs had been somewhat modernised. Several years after the initial tests the project evolved into the remake Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet, by which time the entire appearance had been significantly updated.|$|E

25|$|He {{worked with}} great rapidity and long hours, but {{he used his}} colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and week to week, and often from month to month.... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It was as if the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Māori r is {{also found}} occasionally changed to an l in these southern dialects and the wh to w. These changes are most commonly found in place names, such as Lake Waihola and the nearby coastal settlement of Wangaloa (which would, in standard Māori, be rendered Whangaroa), and Little Akaloa, on Banks Peninsula. M. Goodall & Griffiths claim that final vowels are given a centralised pronunciation as schwa or that they are elided (pronounced indistinctly or not at all), resulting in such seemingly-bastardised place names as The Kilmog, which in standard Māori would have been rendered Kirimoko, but which in southern dialect would have been pronounced <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the current name suggests....has a much debated name, but its origins are clear to Kaitahu and the word illustrates several major features of the southern dialect. First we must restore the truncated final vowel (in this case to both parts of the name, 'kilimogo'). Then substitute r for l, k for g, to obtain the northern pronunciation, 'kirimoko'.... Though final vowels existed in Kaitahu dialect, the elision was so nearly complete that pākehā recorders often omitted them entirely. This same elision is found in numerous other southern placenames, such as the two small settlements called The Kaik (from the term for a fishing village, kainga in standard Māori), near Palmerston and Akaroa, and the early spelling of Lake Wakatipu as Wagadib. In standard Māori, Wakatipu would have been rendered Whakatipua, showing further the elision of a final vowel.|$|E
25|$|United {{failed to}} build on the {{momentum}} of the Kansas City win, suffering a crushing 0-2 home loss to Seattle, on late goals by rookie Jordan Morris and Joevin Jones. The entire MLS went on break for the Copa América Centenario. Birnbaum and Saborio were called up to their respective national team squads for the USA and Costa Rica. During the league break, the team made an unusual move, adding 16-year old youth national team captain Chris Durkin as a Homegrown Player signing. Durkin was one of the youngest signings in league history, but the unusual deal did not add Durkin to D.C. United's MLS roster. Instead, he was available to play in a U.S. Open Cup match the next day, and would go out on loan after the match, first to Richmond Kickers, and then to resume his residency with the national team program in Bradenton as least until the USA U-17s finished their run at the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Durkin did make his debut in the USOC match and by all accounts looked <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> if he belonged. However, the team was unable to break through against the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers defense, and the D.C. squad made a quick exit from the competition, after losing to the Strikers in a penalty kick shootout. When MLS league action resumed, United claimed 4 points in their final 2 matches of the month, including a dreary 0-0 draw in Houston that produced no excitement until stoppage time, when Bill Hamid was forced into two spectacular reaction saves. D.C. United turned in a stronger performance with some home cooking against the New England Revolution, as Neagle and Franklin turned in highlight reel goals, and the home team cruised to a 2-0 win.|$|E

500|$|Like the islands, {{the ridges}} {{surrounding}} the city, including the cliffs in the foreground, look <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> they still do. South (right) {{of the city}} is the island of Södermalm, where a cluster of buildings (see image of the southern city gate above) lined up along the shore called Tranbodarna were used to burn train oil (e.g. seal lard). [...] The round building on the eastern end of Södermalm was the gallows hill. [...] As depicted in the painting, it was used exclusively for men (women were beheaded). [...] The gallows remained there until the late 17th century when they were moved to present-day Hammarbyhöjden south of the historical city centre.|$|E
500|$|Although the Queen was {{set against}} Beatrice marrying {{anyone in the}} {{expectation}} that she would always stay at home with her, {{a number of possible}} suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, the Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria's journal records their grief: [...] "Dear Beatrice, crying <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I did too, gave me the telegram... It was dawning and little sleep did I get... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned." ...|$|E
500|$|The Belgian Parliament had {{recently}} {{passed a law}} allowing the expropriation of privately owned land by the government when the land was {{to be used for}} the [...] "greater good." [...] This could be done even if the project was still speculative in nature, and allowed for more land to be taken beyond what was strictly necessary for a project. The city expropriated large swathes of the lower town, counting on reselling the land for a profit, which, after the project was complete, would be on a grandiose modern boulevard in an upper-class neighbourhood. The selling of land after the completion of the project was seen as a way of financing the project itself. That the poorer residents of the lower town were forced away into other already overcrowded districts or into the surrounding suburbs did not trouble the upper classes <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>as</b> the displaced residents did not pay taxes or have the right to vote.|$|E

500|$|The State Dining Room is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> Blore {{designed}} it, {{and has a}} panelled {{ceiling with}} pendants, and wooden panelling up {{to the line of}} the dado. [...] The room contains a large fireplace in early Renaissance style, made from white and variegated marble, and containing the family arms. [...] Also in the room are sculptures by Joseph Wilton. [...] The Staircase Hall is by Salvin, and is divided from the Sculpture Gallery by three semicircular archways. [...] On the walls are portraits of the Bromley family. [...] The staircase has a wrought iron balustrade decorated with acanthus and roundels with the crests of the Bromleys and the Davenports. [...] The Davenport crest consists of a felon with a rope around his neck; in these roundels the felon has the face of William Gladstone, a political opponent of the Davenports. [...] There are four further ground floor rooms, all by Salvin.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, after Andhrawala 's [...] {{commercial}} failure, {{its director}} Puri Jagannadh planned a film titled Sri Krishnudu from Surabhi Company starring Chiranjeevi {{in the lead}} role. He later decided that explaining the story to Chiranjeevi, talking him into accepting the role, and filming the movie, would be a long, tiring process. He chose instead to revive the script of Uttam Singh S/O Suryanarayana which he had written during the production of Badri (2000). He approached Pawan Kalyan to play the lead role, but he declined it. Later, he approached Ravi Teja who agreed to play the lead; Nagendra Babu was to produce the film. However, Teja was approached by Cheran, an award winning director, to remake the 2004 Tamil film Autograph in Telugu. Teja was eager {{to be involved in}} the remake as he liked the original <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the production Uttam Singh S/O Suryanarayana was temporarily shelved. Jagannadh meanwhile directed and produced 143 (2004). Teja had backed out of participating in it citing scheduling conflicts with other existing commitments. Jagannadh wanted to experiment by casting Sonu Sood in the lead role but this too failed to materialise.|$|E
500|$|Former Sega of America senior {{producer}} Scot Bayless {{attributes the}} unsuccessful market {{to a lack}} of direction from Sega with the add-on. According to Bayless, [...] "It was a fundamental paradigm shift with almost no thought given to consequences. I honestly don't think anyone at Sega asked the most important question: 'Why?' There's a rule I developed during my time as an engineer in the military aviation business: never fall in love with your tech. I think that's where the Mega-CD went off the rails. The whole company {{fell in love with the}} idea without ever really asking how it would affect the games you made." [...] Sega of America producer Michael Latham offers a contrasting view of support for the add-on, however, stating [...] "I loved the Sega CD. I always thought the platform was under-appreciated and that it was hurt by an over-concentration of trying to make Hollywood interactive film games versus using its storage and extended abilities to make just plain great video games." [...] Former Sega of Europe president Nick Alexander commented on the Mega-CD, saying [...] "The Mega CD was interesting but probably misconceived and was seen <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> the interim product it was. I am afraid I cannot recall the sales numbers, but it was not a success." ...|$|E
