5|$|Nevertheless, Palestinian historiography and {{collective}} memory {{point out that}} during the exodus of Palestinian Arab population of the 1948 War the massacres and forced expulsions that happened {{could be seen as}} ethnic cleansing. In the Latrun zone, this affected about 20 villages and ten thousand Palestinian Arabs. Some inhabitants fled during the fights of April but most fled when the Israelis attacked their village during the following operations. After capturing a village, the Israeli soldiers systematically expelled the non-combatants, intimidating them to leave and demolishing houses. A massacre of between thirty and seventy Arabs took place some days after Abu Shusha was taken. Most villages were levelled, {{so as not to be}} used by the Arab volunteers and to prevent the inhabitants returning. In some cases Jewish settlements were established on <b>village</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{the war had}} {{severely}} exhausted the Dutch finances, the pacification of Java {{enabled the}} colonial government of Dutch East Indies to implement Cultuurstelsel ("The Culture System") in Java, without any local opposition. Implemented in 1830 by the new governor general, Johannes van den Bosch, this cultivation system requires 20% of <b>village</b> <b>land</b> had to be devoted to government crops for export or, alternatively, peasants had to work in government-owned plantations for 60 days of the year.

25|$|The {{buildings}} in the Tampico Historic District all have a uniform setback, save the neo-Colonial, 1970s era bank building.

The most architecturally significant structures in the district are part of an integrated, cohesive unit.

25|$|The Belgian Revolution at {{home and}} the Java War in the Dutch East Indies brought the Netherlands {{to the brink of}} bankruptcy. However, the Cultivation System was {{introduced}} in 1830; in the Dutch East Indies, 20% of <b>village</b> <b>land</b> had to be devoted to government crops for export. The policy brought the Dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient. On the other hand, the colonies in the West Indies (Dutch Guiana and Curaçao and Dependencies), relied heavily on African slaves in which the Dutch part is estimated at 5–7 percent, or {{more than half a million}} Africans. The Netherlands abolished slavery in 1863. Furthermore, slaves in Suriname would be fully free only in 1873, since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition. The Dutch were also one of the last European countries to industrialise, in the second half of the 19th century.|$|E

Major streams running through Briarcliff Manor include the centrally-located Caney Brook, the Pocantico River, and Sparta Brook. Abundant rock outcroppings include dolomite, granite, gneiss, and mica schist.

The highest natural point in Briarcliff Manor is [...] southwest of NGS station mark LX4016, off Farm Road, at [...] above sea level. The village, which covered one square mile when incorporated in 1902, has expanded primarily through annexation: of Scarborough in 1906 and acreage from the town of Mount Pleasant in 1927. It is in telephone area code 914 and the postal ZIP code area 10510.

2500|$|Estates (shiga), roughly {{similar to}} the English manorial system, were granted {{by the state and}} were hereditary, though revocable. As {{agricultural}} properties they consisted of two kinds: land held by the nobility or monastic institutions (demesne land), and <b>village</b> <b>land</b> (tenement or villein land) held by the central government, though governed by district administrators. Demesne land consisted on average of one half to three quarters of an estate. Villein land belonged to the estates, but tenants normally exercised hereditary usufruct rights in exchange for fulfilling their corvée obligations. Tibetans outside the nobility and the monastic system were classified as serfs, but two types existed and functionally were comparable to tenant farmers. Agricultural serfs, or [...] "small smoke" [...] (düchung) were bound to work on estates as a corvée obligation (ula) but they had title to their own plots, owned private goods, were free to move about outside the periods required for their tribute labour, and free of tax obligations. They could accrue wealth and on occasion became lenders to the estates themselves, and could sue the estate owners: village serfs (tralpa)were bound to their villages but only for tax and corvée purposes, such as road transport duties (ula), and were only obliged to pay taxes. Half of the village serfs were man-lease serfs (mi-bog), meaning that they had purchased their freedom. Estate owners exercised broad rights over attached serfs, and flight or a monastic life was the only venue of relief. Yet no mechanism existed to restore escaped serfs to their estates, and no means to enforce bondage existed, though the estate lord held the right to pursue and forcibly return them to the land.|$|E
