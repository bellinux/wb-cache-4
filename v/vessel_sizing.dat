Therefore, USPIO-enhanced MR-VSI was performed on DU- 4475, MDA-MB- 435, and EOMA tumor–bearing mice xenografts with known differences in angiogenic activity and vessel morphology. MR results were compared to <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> determined by immunohistochemistry (anti-CD 31) and by intravital microscopy (IVM). MR-VSI revealed significantly different mean <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> between the xenograft models at both USPIO doses (DU- 4475 : 20. 6 ± 4. 9 mm; MDA-MB- 435 : 37. 4 ± 8. 8 μm; and EOMA: 60. 3 ± 9. 6 μm at 80 μmol/kg; p <. 05). Immunohistochemistry revealed lower values for all tumor entities, whereas the size distribution was in line with MR-measurements.

40|$|Purpose: Inhibition of {{angiogenesis}} {{has shown}} clinical success {{in patients with}} cancer. Thus, imaging approaches that allow for the identification of angiogenic tumors and the detection of response to anti-angiogenic treatment are of high clinical relevance. Experimental Design: We established an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach {{that allows us to}} simultaneously image tumor microvessel density and tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> in a NSCLC model in mice. Results: Using microvessel density imaging we demonstrated an increase in microvessel density within 8 days after tumor implantation, while tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> decreased indicating a switch from macro- to microvessels during tumor growth. Moreover, we could monitor in vivo inhibition of angiogenesis induced by the angiogenesis inhibitor PTK 787, resulting in a decrease of microvessel density and a slight increase in tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size.</b> Conclusions: We present an in vivo imaging approach that allows us to monitor both tumor microvessel density and tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> in the tumor. Moreover, this approach enables us to assess, early-on, treatment effects on tumor microvessel density as well as on tumor <b>vessel</b> <b>size.</b> Thus, this imaging-based strategy of validating anti-angiogenic treatment effects ha...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the optimal window setting for displaying virtual monoenergetic reconstructions of third generation dual-source, dual-energy CT (DECT) angiography of the abdomen. METHODS: Forty-five patients were evaluated with DECT angiography (90 / 150 kV, 180 / 90 ref. mAs). Three datasets were reconstructed: standard linear blending (M_ 0. 6), 70 keV traditional virtual monoenergetic (M 70), and 40 keV advanced noise-optimized virtual monoenergetic (M 40 +). The best window setting (width and level, W/L) {{was assessed by}} two blinded observers and was correlated with aortic attenuation to obtain the Optimized W/L setting (O-W/L). Subjective image quality was assessed, and vessel diameters were measured to determine any possible influences between different W/L settings. Repeated measures of variance were used to evaluate comparison of W/L values, image quality, and <b>vessel</b> <b>sizing</b> between M_ 0. 6, M 70, and M 40 +. RESULTS: The Best W/L (B-W/L) for M 70 and M 40 + was 880 / 280 and 1410 / 450, respectively. Results from regression analysis inferred an O-W/L of 850 / 270 for M 70 and 1350 / 430 for M 40 +. Significant differences for W and L {{were found between the}} Best and the Optimized W/L for M 40 +, and between M 70 and M 40 + for both the Best and Optimized W/L. No significant differences for vessel measurements were found using the O-W/L for M 40 + compared to the standard M_ 0. 6 (p ≥ 0. 16), and significant differences were observed when using the B-W/L with M 40 + compared to M_ 0. 6 (p ≤ 0. 04). CONCLUSION: In order to optimize virtual monoenergetic imaging with both traditional M 70 and advanced M 40 +, adjusting the W/L settings is necessary.

BackgroundThere are no dedicated studies {{on the influence of}} <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> on the outcomes of patients treated with different DES. MethodsThe study population was composed of 2, 058 consecutive patients who received sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) or paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES). Patients were grouped into tertiles according to <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> (2. 84 mm in the upper tertile). The primary end point was target lesion revascularization (TLR). Secondary end points were binary angiographic restenosis and the composite of death or myocardial infarction. ResultsVessel size did not influence the composite end point of death and myocardial infarction. The TLR rates were higher among patients in the lower tertile (12. 1 %) as compared with the middle (8. 4 %) and upper (8. 0 %) tertiles (p = 0. 02). In a multivariate analysis, <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> emerged an independent predictor of TLR (p = 0. 009). The model showed also a significant interaction between DES type and <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> regarding TLR (p = 0. 008). There was a significant difference in TLR rates among patients treated with SESs (8. 6 %) and PESs (16. 4 %) in the lower tertile (p = 0. 002), but not in the middle and upper tertiles.

40|$|Based on the xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> and {{frequency}} in fossil wood, {{a number of}} studies have developed theories on climate change through time. The basic premise of these studies is that xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> decreases while <b>vessel</b> frequency increases with intensifying aridity. In this paper the relationship between rainfall and xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> {{and frequency}} is examined in two extant tree species. The results indicate that rainfall is related positively to vessel diameter and negatively to vessel frequency in Combretum apiculatum and Protea caffra. Xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>size</b> of both species is between 50 and 100 µm. However, the two species exhibit different responses to rainfall in that P. caffra has much smaller diameter vessels than C. apiculatum in high rainfall areas.

A more precise picture of climate change through time is possible with a more refined statistical analysis of reliably identified fossil wood. Water Research Commissio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} individual transferable quota regimes on technology choice, such as choice of <b>vessel</b> <b>size,</b> by using the laboratory experiment method. We find that even if <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> change over time, the quota price can converge to the fundamental value conditioned on the vessels chosen. We also find that subjects choose their vessel type to maximise their profits based on the quota trading prices in the previous period. This result implies that the efficiency of quota markets in the beginning period is important because any inefficiency in quota markets may affect <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> in ensuing periods. Moreover, {{we find that the}} initial allocations may significantly influence <b>vessel</b> <b>sizes</b> through two channels: first, a higher initial allocation to a subject increases the likelihood that the subject invests in a large-sized vessel; second, the quota price may be higher and more unstable under unequal allocation than under equal allocation; thus, whether the allocation is equal influences subjects' choice of vessel type. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc...|$|R

We investigated {{the role of}} inflammation in flow-mediated vascular remodeling using a murine model of partial outflow reduction without flow cessation or neointima formation. Common carotid arteries decreased in size after ipsilateral external carotid artery ligation in wild-type mice, but not in myeloid differentiation protein- 88 (MyD 88) –deficient mice. Inward remodeling was associated with MyD 88 -dependent and superoxide-initiated cytokine and chemokine production, as well as transient adventitial macrophage accumulation and activation. Macrophage depletion prevented flow-mediated inward vascular remodeling. Expression of MyD 88 by intrinsic vascular cells was necessary for cytokine and chemokine production and changes in <b>vessel</b> <b>size,</b> whereas MyD 88 expression by bone marrow–derived cells was obligatory for changes in <b>vessel</b> <b>size.</b> We conclude that {{there are at least}} two distinct roles for MyD 88 in flow-mediated inward remodeling of conduit arteries.
