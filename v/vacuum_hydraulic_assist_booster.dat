25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Booster stole the {{elements}} of his costume in the 25th century, recent Legion of Super-Heroes reboots and retcons depict them as having been invented in either the 30th or 31st century. Originally, the time bubble Booster used to travel from 2462 to 1985 was discovered in 2986 with pieces of Brainiac 5's force field belt aboard. This prompted Brainiac 5, Chameleon Boy, and Ultra Boy to travel to 1985 to investigate. In the process, they <b>assisted</b> <b>Booster</b> in foiling an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Brainiac 5 left his force field belt and flight ring with Reagan and determined that these would end up as the ones Booster would eventually steal in 2462, thus completing the causality loop.|$|R

50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assist</b> on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|R

40|$|Tutorialpg. 153 - 160 In {{rotating}} machinery, torque {{is transmitted}} from shafts to coupling hubs (or vice versa) through keys, friction, {{or a combination of}} the two. As a rule; coupling hubs must be installed on shafts {{with a certain amount of}} interference. This interference has two purposes: to prevent rocking of the hub on the shaft, and to help in the torque transmission. With sufficient interference all the torque can be transmitted by friction, and keys can be eliminated. Interference has two disadvantages: it makes installation difficult, and hub removal even more difficult. Hydraulic methods of hub removal are discussed. These methods are sound, make for easy and quick hub removal, and are safe. Some engineers are reluctant to use hydraulic removal for two reasons: it requires specialized tools and better training of mechanics, and it was known to be potentially dangerous. As any new and sophisticated procedure, it also received a bad name from early failures, all caused by misuse. The following topics are discussed: ? Torque transmission through keys ? Installation of keyed hubs using interference ? Torque transmission through friction ? Installation of keyless hubs, heat-assisted installation, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assisted</b> installation ? <b>Hydraulic</b> removal of hubs, dismounting keyed hubs, dismounting keyless hubs ?

Asymmetric membrane capsules (AMCs) {{are one of}} the novel osmotic delivery devices which deliver a wide range of drugs in controlled manner. In the present work, we developed and validated a semiautomatic process by fabricating a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assisted</b> bench topmodel for manufacturing AMCs. The capsule walls of AMCs were prepared by dip coating phase inversion process using cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) as coating polymer and propylene glycol (PG) as plasticizer and pore former. The comparative examination of physical parameters confirmed the consistency, efficiency, and reproducibility of the semiautomatic process over the manual procedure. The SEM studies revealed a thin dense region supported on a thicker porous membrane of the capsule shells. Formulations of AMCs were prepared based on a 23 full factorial design using metformin hydrochloride as the model drug. The effect of formulation variables such as concentration of PG and levels of fructose and potassium chloride were studied on the in vitro drug release using Design-Expert 8. 0. 2 (USA) software. From the in vitro release studies, it was observed that the concentration of pore former and level of osmogents had a direct effect on the drug release.
