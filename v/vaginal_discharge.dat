5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge,</b> fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation of the cervix is {{referred}} to as cervicitis. This inflammation may be of the endocervix or ectocervix. When associated with the endocervix, it is associated with a mucous <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge</b> and the sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea. As many as half of pregnant women having a gonorrheal infection of the cervix are asymptomatic. Other causes include overgrowth of the commensal flora of the vagina. When associated with the ectocervix, inflammation may be caused by the herpes simplex virus. Inflammation is often investigated through directly visualising the cervix using a speculum, which may appear whiteish due to exudate, and by taking a Pap smear and examining for causal bacteria. Special tests may be used to identify particular bacteria. If the inflammation is due to a bacterium, then antibiotics may be given as treatment.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> occur due {{to normal}} bodily functions, such as {{menstruation}} or sexual arousal (<b>vaginal</b> lubrication). Abnormal <b>discharges,</b> however, can indicate disease. Normal <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> include blood or menses (from the uterus), the most common, and clear fluid {{either as a}} result of sexual arousal or secretions from the cervix. Other non-infective causes include dermatitis. Non-sexually transmitted discharges occur from bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis and thrush or candidiasis. The final group of discharges include the sexually transmitted diseases gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. The discharge from thrush is slightly pungent and white, that from trichomoniasis more foul and greenish, and that from foreign bodies resembling the discharge of gonorrhea, greyish or yellow and purulent (pus-like).|$|R
25|$|Foreign body {{vaginitis}} (most common {{foreign bodies}} are retained tampons or condoms) may cause extremely malodorous <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges.</b> Treatment consists of removal, for which ring forceps may be useful. Further treatment {{is generally not}} necessary.|$|R
25|$|Common {{symptoms}} include increased <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge</b> that usually smells like fish. The discharge is often white or gray in color. There may be burning with urination. Occasionally, {{there may be}} no symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Cervical {{cancer may be}} {{prevented}} by pap smear screening and HPV vaccines. Vaginal cancer is very rare, and is primarily a matter of old age; its symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding or <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge.</b>|$|E

40|$|Haemophilus somnus was {{consistently}} isolated from <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> of dairy cows submitted from field cases of vaginitis, cervicitis and/or metritis in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands {{during the period}} July 1995 - December 2000 and from the East Griqualand area in November/December 2000. The purulent <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges,</b> red granular vaginitis and cervicitis, and pain on palpation described in these cases was {{very similar to that}} reported in outbreaks of H. somnus endometritis syndrome in Australia, Europe and North America. In all the herds involved in these outbreaks, natural breeding with bulls was employed. Although there was a good cure rate in clinically-affected animals treated with tetracyclines, culling rates for chronic infertility were unacceptably high. Employment of artificial insemination in these herds improved pregnancy rates in cows that had calved previously, but many cows that had formerly been infected failed to conceive...|$|R
50|$|It may be {{important}} for physicians to establish whether there is in fact any incontinence in women who report ejaculation, to avoid unnecessary interventions.It is also important for physicians to distinguish orgasmic ejaculation from <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> which may require further investigation and treatment.

25|$|Trichomoniasis (trich) is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. About 70% {{of women and men}} do not have symptoms when infected. When symptoms do occur they typically begin 5 to 28 days after exposure. Symptoms can include itching in the genital area, a bad smelling thin <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge,</b> burning with urination, and pain with sex. Having trichomoniasis increases the risk of getting HIV/AIDS. It may also cause complications during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The vagina {{provides}} a channel {{to deliver a}} newborn to its independent life outside {{the body of the}} mother. When childbirth (or labor) nears, several symptoms may occur, including Braxton Hicks contractions, <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge,</b> and the rupture of membranes (water breaking). When water breaking happens, there may be an uncommon wet sensation in the vagina; this could be an irregular or small stream of fluid from the vagina, or a gush of fluid.|$|E
25|$|Gonorrhea, also spelled gonorrhoea, is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Many people have no symptoms. Men may have burning with urination, discharge from the penis, or testicular pain. Women may have burning with urination, <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge,</b> vaginal bleeding between periods, or pelvic pain. Complications in women include pelvic inflammatory disease and in men include inflammation of the epididymis. If untreated, gonorrhea can spread to joints or heart valves.|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} report {{we present a}} case of the mummification of fetuses in a five year-old German {{shepherd}} dog that was presented with complaint of abdominal enlargement and <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges.</b> Case history revealed that estradiol benzoate was administered to the dog in an attempt to terminate the unwanted mating that occurred 5 months earlier. Ultrasonographic examination revealed death of the fetuses and accumulation of hypoechoeic fluid in both uterine horns. Ovariohysterectomy was performed on the dog. After the surgery, two mummified fetuses of different sizes and exhibiting different degrees of mummification were detected. This condition is likely {{due to the fact that}} the two fetuses died at different stages of the gestation. After the surgery, <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> ceased and postoperatively by the 10 th day, the dog was observed to be clinically normal. Our case reveals that although fetal mummification is a rare condition in dogs, it should be considered for differential diagnosis during treatment of conditions that show abdominal enlargement. The aim of this case report is to describe a successful diagnosis and treatment of canine fetal mummification in which the fetuses were of different sizes and exhibiting different degrees of fetal mummification coupled with a large amount of fluid accumulation (13 kg) in the uterus of a dog...|$|R

40|$|In the {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) era, adequate {{management of}} sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is a primary concern in Africa. Assessed {{in this study is}} the clinical efficacy and feasibility of WHO-recommended therapeutic algorithms for genital discharges and ulcers, diagnosed without laboratory tests, for use at the primary health care level. Drugs were sold on a cost-recovery basis and included intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral ciprofloxacin for single-dose therapy of gonorrhoea and chancroid. During April 1993 in 10 peripheral health care centres in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, a total of 207 patients were followed up, including 89 cases of male urethritis, 92 cases of <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> and 26 cases of genital ulcers; clinical success, assessed 7 days after the onset of therapy, was, respectively, 92 %, 87 %, and 100 %. Less than 10 % of the 207 patients were referred to the next care level, an acceptable rate from a public health point of view. Medical adherence to the algorithms was excellent for urethral discharges and genital ulcers but poor for <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges,</b> partly because of intentional therapeutic modifications, without detriment to success. For drugs, the average cost per cure was 1546 francs CFA (US$ 5. 60) (maximum, 2980 francs CFA (US$ 10. 70). Effective and affordable treatments for STDs are necessary for their realistic case management in Africa...|$|R
25|$|The {{discharge}} coats {{the walls}} of the vagina, and is usually without significant irritation, pain, or erythema (redness), although mild itching can sometimes occur. By contrast, the normal <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge</b> will vary in consistency and amount throughout the menstrual cycle and is at its clearest at ovulation—about two weeks before the period starts. Some practitioners claim that BV can be asymptomatic in almost half of affected women, though others argue that this is often a misdiagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is {{a disease}} of the vagina caused by {{excessive}} growth of bacteria. Common symptoms include increased <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge</b> that often smells like fish. The discharge is usually white or gray in color. Burning with urination may occur. Itching is uncommon. Occasionally, {{there may be no}} symptoms. Having BV approximately doubles the risk of infection by a number of other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. It also increases the risk of early delivery among pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|The {{finding of}} coccoid {{bacteria}} on a pap test {{is of no}} consequence with otherwise normal test findings and no infectious symptoms. However, if there is enough inflammation to obscure the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous processes, it may indicate treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic for streptococci and anaerobic bacteria (such as metronidazole and amoxicillin) before repeating the smear. Alternatively, the test will be repeated at an earlier time than it would otherwise. If there are symptoms of <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge,</b> bad odor or irritation, the presence of coccoid bacteria also may indicate treatment with antibiotics as per above.|$|E

40|$|Neutrophils are the {{predominant}} inflammatory cells {{found in the}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> of patients infected with Trichomonas vaginalis. Although chemoattractants, such as leukotriene B 4 and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), {{are found in the}} <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> of symptomatic trichomoniasis patients, {{little is known about the}} mechanism of how neutrophils accumulate or mediate initial inflammatory response after acute T. vaginalis infection. We examined IL- 8 production in neutrophils activated by T. vaginalis and evaluated the factors involved in T. vaginalis adherence that might affect IL- 8 production. When human neutrophils were stimulated with live trophozoites, T. vaginalis lysate, or T. vaginalis excretory-secretory products, the live trichomonads induced higher levels of IL- 8 production than the lysate or products did. When live trichomonads were pretreated with various inhibitors of proteinase, microtubule, microfilament, or adhesin (which are all known to participate in the adherence of T. vaginalis to vaginal epithelial cells), IL- 8 production significantly decreased compared with the untreated controls. Furthermore, an NF-κB inhibitor (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate), a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MEK) inhibitor (PD 98059), and a p 38 MAP kinase inhibitor (SB 203580) significantly suppressed IL- 8 synthesis in neutrophils. These results suggest that live T. vaginalis, particularly adherent trophozoites, can induce IL- 8 production in neutrophils and that this action may be mediated through the NF-κB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. In other words, T. vaginalis-induced neutrophil recruitment may be mediated via the IL- 8 expressed by neutrophils in response to activation by live T. vaginalis...|$|R
40|$|Brucella melitensis strain Rev. 1 is {{the most}} {{effective}} vaccine against brucellosis in sheep and goats. In Iran, mass vaccination is carried out all over the country in which adult animals are immunized by subcutaneous injection of reduced doses of the vaccine. However, due to antibody responses elicited by vaccination, concomitant implementation of test-andslaughter is impossible. To overcome the problem, vaccination through conjunctival route is recommended. In this study, serological responses of six pregnant Iranian fat-tailed ewes to conjunctival vaccination with standard doses of the vaccine were evaluated using modified Rose Bengal test, serum agglutination test and indirect ELISA. Besides, vaccine strain excretion in milk and <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges</b> was also examined by microbiological culture of milk and vaginal swab samples taken one day post-parturition. Animals were vaccinated {{during the second half of}} gestation. As the results, antibody titers of five (83. 3 %) ewes decreased to the levels not detectable by the tests within three months after vaccination. No vaccine-induced abortions occurred and vaccinated ewes delivered healthy lambs 50. 33 ± 15. 56 (mean ± standard deviation) days post-vaccination. Vaccine strain was not isolated from milk and vaginal swab samples. Generally, our study shows full doses of B. melitensis strain Rev. 1 can be used conjunctively to vaccinate pregnant Iranian sheep during late pregnancy without abortifacient effects, prolonged antibody responses and vaccine strain excretion in milk and <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharges.</b> Nevertheless, further studies are required to determine safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in field conditions...|$|R
25|$|Chlamydia infection, often simply {{known as}} chlamydia, is a sexually {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Most people who are infected have no symptoms. When symptoms do develop this can take a few weeks following infection to occur. Symptoms in women may include <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge</b> or burning with urination. Symptoms in men may include discharge from the penis, burning with urination, or pain and swelling of one or both testicles. The infection can spread to the upper genital tract in women causing pelvic inflammatory disease which may result in future infertility or ectopic pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI), {{also referred}} to as sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and venereal diseases (VD), are infections that are commonly spread by sex, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex or oral sex. Most STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include <b>vaginal</b> <b>discharge,</b> penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. STIs acquired before or during birth may result in poor outcomes for the baby. Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Chlamydia is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis.
