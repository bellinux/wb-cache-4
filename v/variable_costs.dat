25|$|While diseconomies {{of scale}} are {{typically}} associated with large mature firms, similar problems have been observed in the growth phase of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies. Mclean has observed that this can occur once the workforce exceeds around 20 employees. At this point business complexity grows more rapidly than revenue. The business experiences falling productivity, leading to rising <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> along with rapidly rising overheads.|$|E

50|$|The {{level of}} <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> is {{influenced}} by many factors, such as fixed cost, duration of project, uncertainty and discount rate. An analytical formula of <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> {{as a function of}} these factors has been derived. It can be used to assess how different factors impact <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> and total return in an investment.|$|R
50|$|The {{short run}} {{shutdown}} {{point for a}} competitive firm is the output level at the minimum of the average <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> curve. Assume that a firm's total cost function is TC = Q3 -5Q2 +60Q +125. Then its <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> function isQ3 -5Q2 +60Q, and its average <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> function is (Q3 -5Q2 +60Q)/Q= Q2 -5Q + 60. The slope of the average <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> curve is the derivative of the latter, namely 2Q - 5. Equating this to zero to find the minimum gives Q = 2.5, at which level of output average <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> is 53.75. Thus if the market price of the product drops below 53.75, the firm will choose to shut down production.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to use any type of solar thermal panel (sheet and tubes, roll-bond, heat pipe, thermal plates) or hybrid (mono/polycrystalline, thin film) {{in combination with the}} heat pump. The use of a hybrid panel is preferable because it allows to cover a part of the electricity demand of the heat pump and reduce the power consumption and consequently the <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> of the system.|$|E
25|$|Gross margin however exclude {{variable}} and {{fixed operating costs}} and depreciation. Notably, <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> greatly depend on the technology used, the factor making the difference being the acid consumption. Between 50 and 80nbsp&kg of H2SO4 frequently required to produce 1 ton of alkylate. At preferred condition, the consumption of acis can be much lower, such as 10–30nbsp&kg of acid per ton of alkylate. In a SAAU acid costs frequently account for about {{one third of the}} total operating costs of alkylation, hence there is considerable incentive to reduce H2SO4 consumption.|$|E
25|$|However, {{electricity}} generation is not evenly {{divided between the}} two dominating sources. In 2006, 72% of Peru’s total {{electricity generation}} came from hydroelectric plants (total generation was 27.4 TWh), with conventional thermal plants only in operation during peak load periods or when hydroelectric output is curtailed by weather events. This “underuse” of the country’s thermal capacity {{is due to the}} high <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> of thermal generation. In 2004, the country’s reserve margin was estimated at 45%. However, when those high cost thermal plants were taken out of the equation, margins fell to as low as 15%.|$|E
30|$|The {{economic}} benefit also was estimated by partial budget analysis (Upton 1979). <b>Variable</b> <b>cost</b> was determined as {{the difference between}} feed expense to formulate each treatment diet and prices of carcass. The net income (NI) was calculated {{as the amount of}} money which is left when total <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> (TVC) was subtracted from total returns. Marginal rate of return (MRR) was calculated by dividing net income to <b>variable</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|R

50|$|For some employees, {{salary is}} paid on monthly rates, {{independent}} {{of how many}} hours the employees work. This is a fixed cost. On the other hand, the hours of hourly employees can often be varied, so this type of labour <b>cost</b> is a <b>variable</b> <b>cost.</b> The cost of material is a <b>variable</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|R
25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the <b>variable</b> <b>costs.</b> The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E
25|$|High <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> {{mean that}} Pandora {{does not have}} {{significant}} operating leverage, {{and in the next}} couple years might actually have negative operating leverage due to an unfavorable shift in product mix towards mobile. Pandora is currently estimated to monetize mobile hours at roughly one-ninth the rate of desktop hours. Since Pandora pays the same licensing cost per hour irrespective of the user's platform, the net contribution to earnings per mobile hour is even more skewed with respect to contribution to earnings from desktop hours. Mobile revenues will improve over time as Pandora shifts from relying on third-party ad networks to selling ad inventory internally at premium rates.|$|E
500|$|The Act of Parliament {{establishing}} the LNC had specified maximum ticket {{prices for the}} railway, and traffic never rose to {{the level at which}} it would have been justified for either the LNC or the LSWR to undertake costly and time consuming lobbying for a change in the legislation. As a consequence, despite the effects of inflation, competition and <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> the fares of the London Necropolis Railway never changed throughout the first 85 of its 87 years of operation. Live passengers were charged 6s in first class, 3s6d in second class and 2s in third class (in 1854 worth about £, £ and £ respectively in [...] consumer terms) for a return ticket, while dead passengers were charged £1 in first class, 5s in second class and 2s6d in third class (in 1854 worth about £, £ and £ respectively in [...] consumer terms) for a one-way ticket. As the railway was intended only to be used by Londoners visiting the cemetery or attending funerals, the only tickets ever issued to living passengers were returns from London. In 1918 the LSWR (which provided the LNC's passenger carriages) abandoned second class services and the LNC as a consequence discontinued the sale of second class fares to living passengers, but continued to separate coffin tickets into first, second and third class dependent on the type of funeral booked.|$|E

Such enterprises often operate openly and in doing so generate cash revenue from incidental legitimate business in addition to the illicit cash – in such cases the business will usually claim all cash received as legitimate earnings. Service businesses are best suited to this method, as such enterprises have little or no [...] <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> and/or a large ratio between revenue and <b>variable</b> <b>costs,</b> which makes it difficult to detect discrepancies between revenues and costs.

[...] He offers a substitute, called throughput accounting, that uses throughput (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a variable cost. He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here.

50|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>costs</b> are {{costs that}} change in {{proportion}} to the good or service that a business produces. <b>Variable</b> <b>costs</b> are also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced.
