5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to {{the large amount of}} electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, it was decided to provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of}} the product increased. By April, K-25 had attained a 1.1 percent enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7 percent enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other {{production plant}}s and became the prototypes {{for a new generation of}} plants. Uranium was enriched by the K-25 gaseous diffusion process until 1985; the plants were then decommissioned and decontaminated. A 235 MW coal-fired power station was included for reliability and to provide <b>variable</b> <b>frequency,</b> although most electric power came from the TVA.|$|E

25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> {{oscillator}} known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order intermodulation products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
25|$|If {{the input}} {{function}} is in closed-form and the desired output function {{is a series}} of ordered pairs (for example a table of values from which a graph can be generated) over a specified domain, then the Fourier transform can be generated by numerical integration at each value of the Fourier conjugate <b>variable</b> (<b>frequency,</b> for example) for which a value of the output variable is desired. Note that this method requires computing a separate numerical integration for each value of frequency for which a value of the Fourier transform is desired. The numerical integration approach works on a much broader class of functions than the analytic approach, because it yields results for functions that do not have closed form Fourier transform integrals.|$|E
25|$|If {{the input}} {{function}} {{is a series}} of ordered pairs (for example, a time series from measuring an output variable repeatedly over a time interval) then the output function must also be a series of ordered pairs (for example, a complex number vs. frequency over a specified domain of frequencies), unless certain assumptions and approximations are made allowing the output function to be approximated by a closed-form expression. In the general case where the available input series of ordered pairs are assumed be samples representing a continuous function over an interval (amplitude vs. time, for example), the series of ordered pairs representing the desired output function can be obtained by numerical integration of the input data over the available interval at each value of the Fourier conjugate <b>variable</b> (<b>frequency,</b> for example) for which the value of the Fourier transform is desired.|$|E

2500|$|A {{phase-locked loop}} or {{phase lock loop}} {{abbreviated}} as PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase {{is related to the}} phase of an input signal.

Electronic ballasts are commonly supplied with AC power, which is internally converted to DC and then back to a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> AC waveform.

2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF).

[...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drives can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. <b>Variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drives are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive / motor combination depend on the efficiency of the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive. For example, because the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drive installed. The amount of energy that <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drives consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drives rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the <b>variable</b> <b>frequency</b> drives have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|E

40|$|Using the two {{parameters}} amplitude {{and frequency}} of a signal, four different types of representations can be obtained. The first two representations of a signal with (i) constant amplitudes and constant frequencies (CA-CF) by the Fourier theory, (ii) variable amplitudes and <b>variable</b> <b>frequencies</b> (VA-VF) using AM-FM model are well established. In this study, we present methods to obtain other two representations: (iii) constant amplitudes and <b>variable</b> <b>frequencies</b> (CA-VF) representation (FM model), and (iv) variable amplitudes and constant frequencies (VA-CF) representation (AM model) for time-frequency analysis of a signal. Moreover, contrary to perception available in literature, we show that the direct quadrature (DQ), which is a CA-VF type representation, cannot produce full sine wave form cosine wave and vice versa, thus not suitable for instantaneous frequency (IF) computation. In order to overcome the limitations of DQ, a novel Hilbert Quadrature (HQ) representation of a signal is proposed. Practically, some noise is always present in the signal under analysis and in such cases we demonstrate that the analytic signal representation obtained by suprressing the negative frequecnies in the Fourier method, which {{is equivalent to the}} Hilbert transform, is the most robust and suitable for the computation of IF...|$|R
