50|$|An airline, rail or {{shipping}} company can book more customers onto a vehicle than {{can actually be}} accommodated by an aircraft, train or cruise ship. This allows {{them to have a}} (nearly) full <b>vehicle</b> <b>on</b> most <b>runs,</b> even if some customers miss the trip or don't show up (tickets are often rebookable afterwards). Business travellers often cancel at the last minute, when their meetings take more time than planned. If everyone shows up, at least in the case of airlines, the overbooking will cause an oversale.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} the novice concept of “Eco-hybrid Two wheeler ” {{which is a}} combination of two systems i. e. petrol and electric system. This hybrid vehicle will make use of both technologies. Petrol system will be used for rear wheel drive and the electric system for front wheel drive. The batteries will be automatically charged when the <b>vehicle</b> <b>runs</b> <b>on</b> petrol system and that stored power will further be used for running the <b>vehicle</b> <b>on</b> electric system and so running of <b>vehicle</b> <b>on</b> electric system will be free of cost and pollution free also. The most attractive thing is that the batteries can also be recharged from electric supply...|$|R
