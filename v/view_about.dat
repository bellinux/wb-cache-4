5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of <b>view</b> <b>about</b> bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

During the interwar period the Luftwaffe leadership officially rejected the concept of terror bombing, and confined the air arms use to battlefield support of interdiction operations.|$|E
25|$|Legenden om Ljusets rike or Sagnet om Lysets rike in some Scandinavian {{language}} (in English The Legend of the Realm of Light; {{this novel}} {{has not been}} translated into English) {{is a set of}} fantasy novels by Norwegian-Swedish writer Margit Sandemo. It includes twenty titles. This set of novels can be read in Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic and Polish. Margit Sandemo says that she wrote this series of novels because she wanted, like many other fiction writers, to portray her own <b>view</b> <b>about</b> an idealized world. Another reason to write Legenden om Ljusets rike was for the character called Marco who Sandemo created in the end of The Legend of the Ice People. She was so fond of him that she wanted to write more about Marco in the following series of novels. Those ideas took shape in her mind when she had written around half of Häxmästaren.|$|E

25|$|Psycho-physical {{parallelism}} is a {{very unusual}} <b>view</b> <b>about</b> the interaction between mental and physical events which was most prominently, and perhaps only truly, advocated by Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz. Like Malebranche and others before him, Leibniz recognized the weaknesses of Descartes' account of causal interaction taking place in a physical location in the brain. Malebranche decided that such a material basis of interaction between material and immaterial was impossible and therefore formulated his doctrine of occasionalism, stating that the interactions were really caused by the intervention of God on each individual occasion. Leibniz's idea is that God has created a pre-established harmony such that it only seems as if physical and mental events cause, and are caused by, one another. In reality, mental causes only have mental effects and physical causes only have physical effects. Hence the term parallelism is used to describe this view.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} firstly aimed to {{determine}} the science teacher's <b>views</b> <b>about</b> “Nature of Science (NOS) ”. In addition to this, another {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the science teacher's level of knowledge and <b>views</b> <b>about</b> the place of NOS in science teaching and also NOS teaching. The research was applied in 2010 academic year in the province of Burdur which is in the first numbers in the overall success of national examinations in Turkey. In this context, semi-structure questionnaire which consists of 3 parts was applied to 8 science teachers through individual interviews. The first part of questionnaire is about teacher's demographic characteristics. The second part is VNOS-C Questionnaire which is created by Lederman, Abd-El-Khalick, Bell and Schwartz (2002) was used for assessing teacher's <b>views</b> <b>about</b> NOS. The last part is about the place of NOS in science curriculum, science teaching and teacher's self-assessments. According to results of research, it is found those science teacher's <b>views</b> <b>about</b> nature of classification schemes and scientific experiments are sufficient but the most of teachers have naive and insufficient level of <b>views</b> <b>about</b> the concept of science, scientific method, law and theory. Besides, it can be said that teacher's <b>views</b> <b>about</b> NOS models and observations are complex. The most of teachers have admitted that their NOS knowledge are insufficient but also stated that NOS is important in science teaching and themselves. However it was seen that teacher's NOS perceptions are consists of hypothesis, theories and laws and their improving processes...|$|R
