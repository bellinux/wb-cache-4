One important consequence of this approach is, that the integration of business oriented and technical components within a CIM system is significantly improved. Keywords.

The Arca-dia research project is investigating the construction of software environments that are tightly integrated, yet flexible and extensi-ble enough to support experimentation with alternative software processes and tools. This has led us to view an environment as being composed of two distinct., cooperating parts.

The other is the fixed part, or infmstructure, supporting creation, execution, and change to the constituents of the <b>variant</b> <b>part.</b> The ma-jor components of the infrastructure are a process programming language and interpreter, object management system, and user interface management system. Process programming facilitates precise definition and automated support of software develop-ment and maintenance activities.

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{property of}} biological visual systems is {{their ability to}} infer structure within the visual world. In order to infer structure, a useful representation should separate the invariant from the variant information [1, 2]. Invariant information is important for determining ‘what ’ we are seeing, recognizing objects and interpreting scenes; while variant information captures the ‘where ’ or ‘how ’ information, the transformations of objects. It has been hypothesized that biological visual systems represent ‘what ’ and ‘where ’ visual information in two separate cortical processing streams [3]. How do biological systems decompose visual information into separate invariant and variant representations? To explore such a decomposition, we present a model that learns to separate the invariant from the <b>variant</b> <b>part</b> of time varying natural movies. We first reformulate the sparse coding model [4], in which images are represented as a generative model of linear over-complete bases with sparse causal variables, so that images are instead represented {{in terms of a}} multiplicative interaction between two sets of causal variables. One set of variables is constrained to change slowly over time (the invariant representation), and the other set of variables is allowed to change quickly over time and is encoded as a phase angle (the variant representation). These variables effectively decompose the original sparse coding variables into invariant and variant representations...|$|E

A growing attention of GIS scientists and AI scientists {{has been paid to}} the uncertainty of NL-based spatial queries and spatial analysis which include uncertainty of natural language expression and processing as well as the one of GIS model and spatial data source. The uncertainty of natural language expression that origin from vagueness of natural language itself, limitation of spatial cognitive ability of speakers and incompleteness of natural language expression will probably be brought into natural language processing result. In spatial analysis calculation based on natural language, the calculation result uncertainty is from uncertainty of starting feature, uncertainty of operator and uncertainty of calculating factor. The confidence of spatial analysis result is a mixture of the uncertainty sources listed above. Furthermore the visualization of spatial analysis uncertainty as another hot issue in uncertainty research field helps domain experts and other users realize reliability of spatial analysis results plainly.

40|$|LEGOM is an application, on {{the market}} from three years, that {{supports}} the legal office of a bank or an insurance company in solving credit return problems related to high risk customers. Its application domain is characterized by conceptual differences among its set of interested stakeholders. For this reason, once {{on the market}} many specializations have been done, leading inevitably to many versions of the application. In this context, the application itself became difficult in terms of configuration management, maintenance and identification of the most appropriate “existing version” suitable for customer needs. So, the SME decided to migrate the application to a product line characterized by a core common part {{and a set of}} variants, each identified by a set of parameters. It was therefore possible to formalize all of the existing versions of LEGOM. Once identified all parts, the relations between parameters, common and <b>variant</b> <b>parts</b> were formalized in a decision table. The efficacy of such a decision tool was then evaluated. Moreover, after transforming the versions of LEGOM into a product line, the SME submitted a survey to their stakeholders with the aim of verifying whether the decision table was able to identify all of the specializations and variants requested by each stakeholder. Results of the survey show how the product line version of LEGOM is comprehensible for developers in the SME and for stakeholders in that it explicitly formalizes its components and easily leads to identification of the <b>variant</b> <b>parts</b> that make up the final product...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the development of a methodology and appropriate tools for the investigation of chemical reaction systems using measured data. More specifically, the determination of reaction stoichiometry and kinetics from concentration or, preferably, spectral measurements is considered. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of a nonlinear transformation of the dynamic model that enables the separation of the evolution of the states into three parts: (i) the reaction-variant part (related to the reactions), (ii) the reaction-invariant and flow-variant part (related to the inlet and outlet streams), and (iii) the reaction- and flow-invariant part (related to the initial conditions). This transformation is very helpful in the analysis of concentration and spectral data. Dynamic model First-principles models of reaction systems are gaining importance in chemical and biotechnological production. They can considerably reduce process development costs and be used for simulation, model-based monitoring, control, and optimization, thus leading to improved product quality, productivity, and process safety. These models include information regarding both the chemical reactions and the operational mode of the reaction system. For the analysis of these models, it is important to distinguish between the states that depend on the reactions and those which do not. The concept of reaction invariants is extended to include the flow invariants of reaction systems with inlet and outlet streams. A nonlinear transformation of the first-principles dynamic model to normal form is proposed. Model reduction, state accessibility, and feedback linearizability are analyzed in the light of this transformation. Concentration data Concentration data collected from reaction systems are highly structured, a result of the underlying reactions and the presence of material exchange terms. It is shown that concentration data can be analyzed in the framework of the three-level decomposition provided by the transformation to normal form. The resulting factorization, termed the factorization of concentration data, enables (i) the separation of the reaction and flow variants/invariants and (ii) the segregation of the dynamics (extents of reaction, integral of flows) from the static information (stoichiometry, initial and inlet concentrations). Using the factorization of concentration data, it is possible to isolate the reaction <b>variant</b> <b>part</b> by subtracting the reaction-invariant part from measured concentrations. The reaction-variant part is often unknown, since it depends on the kinetic description (typically the main difficulty in modeling chemical reaction systems). In contrast, the reaction-invariant part is usually known or measured. It is shown that, in cases where the reaction variants can be computed from the concentrations of a few measured species, the concentrations of the remaining species can be reconstructed using the known reaction-invariant part. Target factor analysis has been used successfully with concentration data to determine, without knowledge of reaction kinetics, the number of reactions and the corresponding stoichiometries. It is shown that, when only the reaction-variant part of the data is considered, existing target factor-analytical techniques can be readily applied. However, if target factor analysis needs to be applied directly to measured concentrations, knowledge of reaction-invariant relationships is required to specify necessary and sufficient conditions for the acceptance of stoichiometric targets. Spectral data In current practice, concentration measurements {{during the course of a}} reaction are generally not available, neither on-line nor off-line. Owing to new measurement technologies, spectral measurements are now available in both the laboratory and production. Various spectral instruments enable non-destructive indirect concentration measurement of most of the species in-situ/on-line during the course of a reaction. Measurements are available at high sampling rates and delay-free at low costs. Furthermore, in most cases, the spectral data are linear, i. e., the mixture spectrum is a linear combination of the pure-component spectra weighted by the concentrations. It is shown that the three-level interpretation provided by the transformation to normal form is applicable to spectral data from reacting mixtures. Similarly to traditional wet-chemical analysis methods, a calibration model must also be estimated that provides concentration estimates from spectral measurements. All calibration methods require that a new spectrum lies in the space spanned by the calibration spectral data (space-inclusion condition). To verify this space-inclusion condition, it is proposed to build a calibration model for the reaction-variant part only. Once the reaction variants are predicted from a new spectrum, the (known) reaction invariants can be added to reconstruct the concentrations. Concentration measurements for some species of interest are often not available due to difficulties/costs in sampling, sample preparation, and development of analytical techniques. Thus, traditional calibration of spectral measurements for the purpose of concentration estimation is not possible. Instead, explicit or implicit knowledge about the kinetic structure will be used (prior knowledge about the reaction-variant part), thus enabling the formulation of factor-analytical methods as a calibration problem. For pedagogical reasons, the results are developed for isothermal, constant-density reaction systems with inlet and outlet streams. The results are then extended to various scenarios such as reaction systems with varying density and temperature. Furthermore, factorizations of concentration data are presented that include temperature or calorimetric measurements. Several special cases are considered, encompassing continuous stirred-tank reaction systems, semibatch and batch reaction systems, systems with reactions in quasi-equilibrium conditions, and non-reacting mixtures with closure...|$|E
