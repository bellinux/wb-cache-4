5|$|Blake {{claimed to}} have seen visions {{throughout}} his life, and he claimed {{that they were a}} common aspect of life. His understanding of these events was, as he explained, similar to the experiences of biblical prophets. In the commentary to A <b>Vision</b> <b>of</b> the Last Judgement, Blake claimed that the image originated in a particular vision he experienced that allowed him to see the host of Heaven praising God. The actual design of A <b>Vision</b> <b>of</b> the Last Judgement was created in 1808 as an expansion of his 1805 work The Day of Judgement. Blake created this work to be used in Blair's The Grave, which was published 1808.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with corporate ideologies and <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> topmanagements in the local small manufacturing industries. We assume that corporate ideologies are unchanging values and that <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> topmanagement evolve according to actual interaction. Further we assume that visions are both value and factual premises. The questionnaire survey is analyzed. The analyses imply the followings. (1) Even in the local small companies, <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> top-managements are important for corporate performance. (2) In high performance small companies <b>of</b> local area, <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> top-managements relate to corporate ideologies. (3) In the high performance small companies, when top-management want to challenge projecting strategies, the projecting strategies are related to <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> top-managements and corporate ideologies. (4) In the high performance small companies, <b>visions</b> <b>of</b> top-managements and corporate ideologies lead to flexibility modification, but in low performance small companies oflocal area, field levels lead to flexibility modification...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF and the Soviet Union.

Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' characterisation from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning.

He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
