40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> {{syndication}} among <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> in the Philadelphia region from 1980 to 1999. The central question in the analysis {{is the extent to}} which regional actors have embraced a new type of investing. To explore this question, the paper looks at the distribution of syndication ties, that is, patterns of co-investment among <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms.</b> In particular, the analysis explores patterns of syndication and network structure among <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> to identify not only the extent of syndication but also cliques and clusters among syndication partners. The analysis utilizes an extensive database consisting of <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> disbursements and investments in the Philadelphia region from 1980 to 1999. The paper finds that {{the use of}} syndication among Philadelphia <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> was limited in nature. Although Philadelphia <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> syndicated extensively with <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> from outside the region, syndication among partners tended to be highly parochial. In addition, the emergence of a dominant clique of <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> is documented, and their impact is discussed. <b>Venture</b> <b>capital,</b> innovation, social networks, start-up companies, inter-organizational, Philadelphia, regional development,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the preferences of}} <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> for syndication partners and the impacts of syndication partners on <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms.</b> Co-investing with similar partners may reduce transaction costs, {{but it may also}} limit opportunities for learning. Based on U. S. data on <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> investments, I find that, on average, <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> are more likely to syndicate with partners that are similar to them, consistent with prior theoretical predictions. In the long term, however, <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> may benefit more from co-investing with partners that are different from them. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Venture</b> <b>capital</b> and {{corporate}} <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> {{are driven by}} high financial returns through the sale of ownership stakes. Additionally, corporate <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> maximize the profits of their parent companies by generating innovation advantage. Despite this, both intermediaries can join syndicates to obtain more information about their potential investments. We examine a model to show {{the differences between the}} syndication decisions of these two investor types. We find that corporate <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> finance more projects without a syndicate in comparison with <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms.</b> To reinforce our theoretical results, we conduct a survey about the German private equity market. The empirical evidence support our main theoretical findings...|$|R

By 1992, the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport, California, and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13million a year.

40|$|Studies about interfirm {{relationships}} within the <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> industry are usually focussed on syndication networks. Little {{is known about}} the relations <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> have in order to obtain complementary knowledge needed to make and manage investments, something this case study provides insight to. It is found that <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> in the Netherlands mainly use actors other than their syndication partners for this. Dutch <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> seem to be careful sharing knowledge with each other due to the competition they face. Learning may however take place when they syndicate deals, but this seems to be only a by-product since financial motives are the main reason to cooperate. The knowledge relations <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> have, are located as geographically dispersed as their syndication partners and both relations are mainly social in nature.

50|$|Jeffry Timmons’ main {{contribution}} to entrepreneurship research {{was on the}} subjects of <b>venture</b> <b>capital,</b> about which he co-authored several books. In the 1980s he and William Bygrave conducted a study called “Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth” where they classified 464 <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> {{with the aim of}} determining the characteristics of technology-oriented venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. They wanted to find out what factors influenced the supply of <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> to high-tech <b>firms</b> and if public policy instruments could be used in this process. The result of the study was presented in a number of articles during the 1980s. Timmons and Bygrave {{came to the conclusion that}} the number of <b>Venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> and the amount of money raised grew rapidly from 1976 to 1984, due to a considerable tax cut in 1979. They also demonstrated that <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> were far more heterogeneous than generally assumed and that a small percentage of the <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> were responsible for a large part of the investment in highly innovative technological ventures. According to Timmons and Bygrave (1986), these <b>venture</b> <b>capital</b> <b>firms</b> were highly skilled, experienced, and specialized in technology. This expertise was important for the entrepreneurs behind the new ventures, who actively sought out these specialized venture capitalists, whose expertise and contacts they actually valued more highly than the investments.|$|R
