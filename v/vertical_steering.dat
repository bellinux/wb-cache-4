The batteries were designed so that they could easily be replaced with fully charged batteries if they became flat. Control was by a two or three speed fully automatic controller and contactor assembly.

This was a 3-wheeled pedestrian controlled vehicle with a 3.5 cwt payload, which had a fixed speed of 3 mph on level ground. The battery drove a [...] motor which was connected to the rear axle by reduction gearing, and this configuration gave a range of around 10 mi.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of visual roll tilt on gaze and riding {{behavior}} when negotiating a bend using a motorcycle simulator. To this end, experienced motorcyclists rode along a track with a series of right and left turns whilst the degree of visual roll tilt was manipulated in three different conditions. Gaze behavior was analyzed by using the tangent point as a dynamic spatial reference; the deviation of gaze to this particular point was computed in both the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> directions. <b>Steering</b> control was assessed in terms of the lateral positioning, steering stability and number of lane departures. In the no-roll condition, the motorcyclists tracked a steering point on the road ahead, which was compatible with the hypothesis of ‘‘steer where you look” behavior. In the roll condition, our results revealed that the horizontal distribution of gaze points relative to the tangent point was preserved. However, significantly more fixations were made further ahead of the tangent point in the vertical direction. This modification of visual behavior was coupled with a degradation in steering stability and an offset in lateral positioning, which sometimes led to lane departures. These results are discussed with regard to models of visual control of steering for bend negotiation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{real-time}} MIMO channel sounder for 28 GHz. Until now, the common practice to investigate the directional characteristics of millimeter-wave channels has been using a rotating horn antenna. The sounder presented here is capable of performing horizontal and <b>vertical</b> beam <b>steering</b> {{with the help of}} phased arrays. Thanks to fast beam-switching capability, the proposed sounder can perform measurements that are directionally resolved both at the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) as fast as 1. 44 milliseconds compared to the minutes or even hours required for rotating horn antenna sounders. This does not only enable us to measure more points for better statistical inference but also allows to perform directional analysis in dynamic environments. Equally importantly, the short measurement time combined with the high phase stability of our setup limits the phase drift between TX and RX, enabling phase-coherent sounding of all beam pairs even when TX and RX are physically separated and have no cabled connection for synchronization. This ensures that the measurement data is suitable for high-resolution parameter extraction algorithms. Along with the system design and specifications, this paper also discusses the measurements performed for verification of the sounder. Furthermore, we present sample measurements from a channel sounding campaign performed on a residential street. Comment: 6 pages, 15 figures, conference pape...|$|R

30|$|When the D {{coefficient}} is 0, {{the sign}} of P is changed to observe the phenomenon. It is compared with a motor rotation phenomenon according to balance principle of a vehicle. When the motor has negative feedback for the upright loop, the parameter polarity of P is correct. After determining {{the sign of}} P, the calculation of the size range of the P starts. The approximate range of P is determined according to motor PWM fullness and range of angular deviation. (For example, in the vertical ring, the PWM is 7200 (100 %); the angle of inclination is about ±[*] 20 °, so P {{should be in the}} range of 0 – 360). After that, P is continuously increased until the balance vehicle can be quickly adjusted, thus causing repeated oscillation of the vehicle body. Here, P is close to the ideal value. Then, D is adjusted. Firstly, the sign of D is judged by observing the motor rotation feedback (positive/negative) according to negative feedback method of vertical loop. Then, the PD adjustment is closed to tune the parameter of PI adjustment. The balance vehicle is basically kept in the original position (without significant changes) by the PI adjustment. According to the experience, the PD parameters are 60 % of the measurements; I value is 1 / 200 of a P value. Finally, the speed loop is integrated with <b>vertical</b> and <b>steering</b> loops for vehicle test. PID parameter-tuning is completed.|$|R
40|$|In the {{interest}} of enhancing the capabilities of autonomous underwater vehicles US Naval Operations, controlling vehicle position to follow depth contours presents exciting potential for navigation. Use of a contour tracking control algorithm in lieu of preprogrammed waypoint navigation offers distinct advantages within new challenges. The difficult nature of this problem lies in the non-trivial connection between the necessary corrective action and the feedback error used in traditional control methods. Stated simply, modern vehicle control algorithms separate horizontal and vertical plane navigation. The autonomous vehicle senses heading error and applies rudder to steer the vehicle to a desired heading.

40|$|In marine time-domain controlled-source {{electromagnetics}} (CSEM), {{there are}} two different acquisition methods: with horizontal sources for fast and simple data acquisition or with vertical sources for minimizing the effects of the airwave. Illustrations of the electric field as a function of space and time for various source antenna orientations, based on analytical formulation of the electric field in two half-spaces, provide insights into the properties of the airwave and the nature of diffuse electric fields.

40|$|Abstract. Modification {{of the two}} {{existing}} DIII-D {{neutral beam}} lines is proposed to allow <b>vertical</b> <b>steering</b> to provide off-axis neutral beam current drive (NBCD) as far off-axis as half the plasma radius. New calculations indicate very good current drive with good localization off-axis {{as long as the}} toroidal magnetic field, B T, and the plasma current, I p, are in the same direction (for a beam steered downward). The effects of helicity can be large: e. g., ITER off-axis NBCD can be increased by more than 20 % if the B T direction is reversed. This prediction has been tested by an off-axis NBCD experiment using reduced size plasmas that are vertically shifted with the existing NBI on DIII-D. The existence of off-axis NBCD is evident in sawtooth and internal inductance behavior. By shifting the plasma upward or downward, or by changing the sign of the toroidal field, measured off-axis NBCD profiles, determined from MSE data, are consistent with predicted differences (40 %...|$|E
40|$|The cryo-hydro {{integrated}} robotic penetrator system (CHIRPS) is {{a partially}} developed instrumentation system {{that includes a}} probe designed to deeply penetrate the European ice sheet {{in a search for}} signs of life. The CHIRPS could also be used on Earth for similar exploration of the polar ice caps especially at Lake Vostok in Antarctica. The CHIRPS probe advances downward by a combination of simple melting of ice (typically for upper, non-compacted layers of an ice sheet) or by a combination of melting of ice and pumping of meltwater (typically, for deeper, compacted layers). The heat and electric power for melting, pumping, and operating all of the onboard instrumentation and electronic circuitry are supplied by radioisotope power sources (RPSs) and thermoelectric converters energized by the RPSs. The instrumentation and electronic circuitry includes miniature guidance and control sensors and an advanced autonomous control system that has fault-management capabilities. The CHIRPS probe is about 1 m long and 15 cm in diameter. The RPSs generate a total thermal power of 1. 8 kW. Initially, as this power melts the surrounding ice, a meltwater jacket about 1 mm thick forms around the probe. The center of gravity of the probe is well forward (down), so that the probe is vertically stabilized like a pendulum. Heat is circulated to the nose by means of miniature pumps and heat pipes. The probe melts ice to advance in a step-wise manner: Heat is applied to the nose to open up a melt void, then heat is applied to the side to allow the probe to slip down into the melt void. The melt void behind the probe is allowed to re-freeze. Four quadrant heaters on the nose and another four quadrant heaters on the rear (upper) surface of the probe are individually controllable for steering: Turning on two adjacent nose heaters on the nose and two adjacent heaters on the opposite side at the rear causes melt voids to form on opposing sides, such that the probe descends at an angle from <b>vertical.</b> This <b>steering</b> capability can be used to avoid debris trapped in the ice or to maneuver closer to a trapped object of scientific interest...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe effects that El Nino and La Nina events exert on western North Pacific tropical cyclones, {{and the physical}} mechanisms involved were examined using best track data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NCEP reanalysis data. During El Nino and La Nina events, equatorial heating anomalies induce anomalous tropical and extratropical atmospheric wave trains which alter circulation, <b>vertical</b> shear, and <b>steering</b> flow. The shear changes cause tropical cyclones to form farther south and east (north and west) than normal during El Nino (La Nina) events. These formation differences lead to longer (shorter) tracks and stronger (weaker) tropical cyclones during El Nino (La Nina) events. Late in the tropical cyclone season, the anomalous extratropical waves alter the subtropical ridge and steering flow to favor recurving (straight running) tropical cyclones during El Nino (La Nina). These track differences lead to a much higher number of land falling tropical cyclones in southeast Asia during La Nina events. A preliminary study of the North Atlantic shows that there are more, and stronger, tropical cyclones during La Nina than El Nino. This {{is the result of}} extratropical Rossby wave trains that originate in the east Asia and extend into the North Atlantic.

These radars are of a standard design and detect scattering from the D and lower E regions of the ionosphere in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. The interferometry techniques used were those of temporal, spatial and frequency domain interferometry which provide information on Doppler shifting and the directional and radial distribution of backscattered signals received by the radars. This project represents {{the first time that}} these techniques have been operated together on radars of the type used in this project. The techniques were also carried out in conjunction with the standard procedures used on these radars, that of Spaced Antennae Drifts with Full Correlation Analysis (FCA). Various forms of interferometric analyses were carried out and comparisons were made between the results of interferometric analyses and those of more conventional techniques. For example a study was made of the relationship between interferometric and FCA velocities in which it was found that there was good agreement between the two methods, particularly when the scattering region does not change rapidly as it moves. Other analysis techniques investigated included examination of the angular distribution of scattering and aspect sensitivity, the statistical distributions of scattered signals, post beam <b>steering,</b> <b>vertical</b> velocities and momentum fluxes. Frequency domain interferometry provided enhanced measurement of range and the scattering depth or distribution of range of scattered signals. Measurements of scattering depth clearly identified examples of thin layers or localized scatter. These localized scattering events appeared to be associated with either steady flow or long period variations in steady flow, for example with the semidiurnal solar tide.
