40|$|Thesis (MEd (Computer Science Education)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Computer {{technology}} and digital media {{are an integral}} part of present–day society. Consequently, learners are exposed to computers from an early age. What is lacking however, is that learners are not protected against the health and safety hazards of using computers. Learners have a constitutional right to work in a healthy and safe environment that is free of all hazards. <b>Computer</b> <b>centres</b> in schools therefore need to be ergonomically equipped to keep the best interests of learners at heart. Ergonomics allows for the harmonious interaction between humans and technology. In the context of the <b>computer</b> <b>centre</b> at a school, ergonomics ensures the safe use of computers without affecting the health of learners. Ergonomics in the <b>computer</b> <b>centre</b> involves more than just equipping the centre correctly in terms of furniture, the classroom environment or the computer equipment. Establishing the correct ergonomic behaviour in learners completes the ideal ergonomic environment in which learners can use computers. This study was done to determine the requirements for an ideally equipped <b>computer</b> <b>centre,</b> focussing on ergonomics. The literature review examined the relevant juridical requirements from the Constitution, the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Schools Act. The study further examined the aspects constituting the ideal ergonomic environment for a <b>computer</b> <b>centre.</b> By means of an empirical study, the researcher aimed to determine the current state of <b>computer</b> <b>centres</b> with regard to ergonomics, as well as to identify stumbling blocks for ergonomically correctly equipping <b>computer</b> <b>centres</b> at schools. By analysing photographs and observation checklist results, the researcher concluded that <b>computer</b> <b>centres</b> at schools are not equipped correctly when considering ergonomic requirements. Various stumbling blocks preventing the ideal ergonomic equipping of <b>computer</b> <b>centres</b> were also identified through interviews. The findings from this study provide strong evidence that could persuade the various stakeholders involved in the equipping of <b>computer</b> <b>centres</b> at schools, that by ergonomically correctly equipping their <b>computer</b> <b>centres,</b> they would ensure the health and safety of their learners.
