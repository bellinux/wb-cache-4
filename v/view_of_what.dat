5|$|In September 1947, Hull, Russell, who was {{designated}} test director on 14 October, and Joint Task Force 7's scientific director, Darol K. Froman from the Los Alamos Laboratories, set {{out with a}} group of scientists and military officers to examine various proposed test sites in the Pacific. Enewetak Atoll was chosen as the test site on 11 October. The island was remote, but with a good harbor and an airstrip. It also had ocean currents and trade winds that would carry fallout out to sea, an important consideration in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened at Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads.|$|E
5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> should be so for the amending process.|$|E
25|$|Any {{description}} of Tongan culture that limits itself to what Tongans see as anga fakatonga {{would give a}} seriously distorted <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> people actually do, in Tonga, or in diaspora, because accommodations are so often made to anga fakapālangi. The following account tries to give both the idealized and the on-the-ground versions of Tongan culture.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, Michael Taylor {{argued that}} {{previous}} critics offered a too cheerful <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the play depicts. He emphasised the less pleasant {{aspects of the}} otherwise appealing fairies and the nastiness of the mortal Demetrius prior to his enchantment. He argued that the overall themes are the often painful aspects of love and the pettiness of people, which here include the fairies.|$|E
25|$|During the Song dynasty, {{the scholar}} Zhu Xi (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from Daoism and Buddhism into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but {{not long after}} his death, his ideas became the new {{orthodox}} <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam until the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{only the}} players on the field could see the extent of the damage to Theismann's leg, the reverse-angle instant replay (shown multiple times) provided a clearer <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had actually happened—Theismann's lower leg bones were broken midway between his knee and his ankle, such that his leg from his foot to his mid-shin was lying flat against the ground while the upper part of his shin up to his knee was at a 45-degree angle to the lower part of his leg.|$|E

25|$|Archaeologists {{have also}} been obliged to re-examine what {{constitutes}} an archaeological site in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites {{to give them some}} protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help {{and at the same time}} study.|$|E
25|$|Le Guin {{exploits}} {{the creative}} {{flexibility of the}} science fiction and fantasy genres to undertake thorough explorations of dimensions of both social and psychological identity and of broader cultural and social structures. In doing so, she draws on sociology, anthropology, and psychology, leading some critics to categorize her work as soft science fiction. She has objected to this classification of her writing, arguing the term is divisive and implies a narrow <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes valid science fiction. There are also the underlying ideas of anarchism and environmentalism that make repeated appearances throughout Le Guin's work.|$|E
25|$|The pair were {{partners}} in 'Hudson Amusements' {{and had been}} operating their amusements in Omeath {{for the duration of}} the Omeath Gala. When the first explosion was heard across the Lough, the pair went down to the shore to see what was happening. The pair made their way to Narrow Water on the southern side to get a better <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening on the northern side of the Lough. Barry Hudson was shot in the arm and as he fell to the ground he saw his cousin, who was the son of a coachman at Buckingham Palace, fall to the ground. He died almost immediately.|$|E

25|$|A {{collaboration}} {{is like a}} good conversation, Nicola came to my studio {{a couple of times}} and I went to hers; we initially chatted about her music, the forthcoming album and how this related to her vision for the shoes. I went away and started designing my response to this. After our first meeting I was excited by her ideas and collaborating with people who have a strong vision is really fantastic. Nicola considers everything she does really carefully and has a totally clear <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she wants to achieve. While the shoes are just a small part of this, I knew it would be interesting and fun to work together.|$|E
25|$|Grand Theft Auto IV {{has also}} {{prompted}} editing in the Australian (PAL) version, as Rockstar was worried it {{might get a}} RC rating. In the American release, sexual encounters with prostitutes occur inside the player's vehicle and the player {{has the ability to}} rotate the camera for a clearer <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> transpires. In the censored Australian version, the camera is fixed behind the vehicle, which rocks from side to side with accompanying audio effects. It is impossible for the player to view the inside of the car. Rockstar later decided to rate the uncut version of the game which went on to receive a MA15+ and a patch was later released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 to uncensor the game.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we know of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle moves {{toward the back of the}} cell.|$|E

25|$|In September 1993, General Powell asked Aspin {{to approve}} {{the request of the}} U.S. {{commander}} in Somalia for tanks, armored vehicles and AC-130 Spectre gunships for his forces. Aspin turned down the request. Shortly thereafter Aidid's forces in Mogadishu killed 18 U.S. soldiers and wounded more than 75 in attacks that also resulted in the shooting down of two U.S. helicopters and the capture of one pilot (see the Battle of Mogadishu). In the face of severe congressional criticism, Aspin admitted that in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened he had made a mistake, but stated that the request for armored equipment had been made within the context of delivering humanitarian aid to Somalia rather than protecting troops. In an appearance before a congressional committee to answer questions about the Somalia disaster, Aspin made an unfavorable impression and appeared weak in response to the detailed probing and criticism of his performance. The president publicly defended Aspin but made clear that the White House was not involved in the decision not to send armor reinforcements to Somalia. Several members of Congress called on Clinton to ask for Aspin's resignation.|$|E
25|$|Rounding a {{bend and}} nearing the East River, the tram {{encountered}} Kong {{hanging from the}} Queensboro Bridge. A police helicopter hovering nearby opened fire on Kong to protect the approaching tram. Kong retaliated, pounding the roof of tram and sending the chopper crashing and exploding into the bridge. Narrowly escaping the attack, the tram finally crossed over the river to Roosevelt Island. A second helicopter hovering nearby shone a bright searchlight directly at the tram, inhibiting the <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> lay ahead. The tram operator urged the chopper {{to turn off the}} light, and in doing so, revealed that Kong had cut the tram off. He proceeded to grab, lift and subsequently drop the tram after being fired upon by the circling police helicopter. After narrowly escaping the enraged beast for a second time, small television monitors lowered from the tram's ceiling and guests watched themselves on the ride as part of a breaking news report as the tram safely made its way into the Roosevelt Island station. Although Kong was never actually defeated, the news report indicated that he was making his way away from New York City, thereby alleviating the threat.|$|E

500|$|Article One {{provides}} that Congress shall {{have the power}} [...] "o define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas." [...] Five sections in the Crimes Act [...] "were devoted to the subject." [...] Currie notes that the various piracy offenses [...] "take an exceedingly broad <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constituted piracy," [...] but that [...] "rom a constitutional standpoint no harm was done, since all of the acts punished were felonious and Congress's power extended to all felonies on the high seas." ...|$|E

500|$|Moreover, Black took {{a narrow}} <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{constituted}} [...] "speech" [...] under the First Amendment; for him, [...] "conduct" [...] {{did not deserve}} the same protections that [...] "speech" [...] did. For example, {{he did not believe}} that flag burning was speech; in Street v. New York (1969), he wrote: [...] "It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense." [...] Similarly, he dissented from Cohen v. California (1971), in which the Court held that wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words [...] "Fuck the Draft" [...] was speech protected by the First Amendment. He asserted that this activity [...] "was mainly conduct, and little speech." ...|$|E
