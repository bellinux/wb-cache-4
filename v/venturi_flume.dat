50|$|Styles of flow {{measurement}} flumes include: Cutthroat, HS / H / HL-type, Khafagi, Montana, RBC, Parshall, Palmer-Bowlus, Trapezoidal, and <b>Venturi</b> <b>Flume.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>venturi</b> <b>flume</b> is a critical-flow open flume with a {{constricted}} flow {{which causes}} {{a drop in}} the hydraulic grade line, creating a critical depth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Venturi</b> <b>flumes</b> {{have two}} {{advantages}} over weirs where the critical depth {{is created by}} a vertical constriction. First, the hydraulic head loss is smaller in flumes than in weirs. Second, there is no dead zone in flumes where sediment and debris can accumulate; such a dead zone exists upstream of the weirs.|$|R
5000|$|Measurement of {{discharge}} with <b>venturi</b> <b>flumes</b> requires two measurements, one upstream {{and one at}} the throat (narrowest cross-section), if the flow passes in a subcritical state through the flume. If the flumes are designed so as to pass the flow from sub critical to supercritical state while passing through the flume, a single measurement at the throat (which in this case becomes a critical section) is sufficient for computation {{of discharge}}. To ensure the occurrence of critical depth at the throat, the flumes are usually designed in such way as to form a hydraulic jump on the downstream side of the structure. These flumes are called 'standing wave flumes' ...|$|R
50|$|Differences {{between the}} <b>Venturi</b> and Parshall <b>flume</b> include: {{reduction}} of the inlet converging angle, lengthening the throat section, {{reduction of the}} discharge divergence angle, and introducing a drop through the throat (and subsequent partial recovery in the discharge section).|$|R
50|$|It {{is used in}} flow {{measurement}} of very large flow rates, usually given in millions of cubic units. A venturi meter would normally measure in millimetres, whereas a <b>venturi</b> <b>flume</b> measures in metres.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1915, Dr. Ralph Parshall of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service {{altered the}} {{subcritical}} <b>Venturi</b> <b>flume</b> include {{a drop in}} elevation through the throat of the flume. This created a transition from subcritical flow conditions to supercritical flow conditions through the throat of the flume.|$|E
50|$|Only {{two years}} after the dam's {{completion}} in 1916, it was decided that the flow from the reservoir was insufficient to support the surrounding population. As a result, between 1920 and 1931 the rivers Alport and Ashop were also diverted from the Ashop valley into the reservoir using tunnels and a <b>Venturi</b> <b>Flume.</b>|$|E
40|$|Shortcomings of the ISO Standard 4359 flumes {{have been}} pointed out, {{focused on the}} concept of a {{boundary}} layer, applied for computing flow rate through <b>Venturi</b> and Palmer–Bowlus <b>flumes.</b> Two different approaches to flow rate measurements by flumes have been compared. The first one requires and the second approach does not require crossing of critical depth by the liquid free surface somewhere in a flume throat. Computing the critical depth position in a flume throat was described and a method of improving flow rate computations accuracy suggested. This method differs from the ISO Standard 4359 in computing the distance by which depth and width of liquid stream in a throat should be modified according to the boundary layer concept. While the ISO Standard 4359 prescribes in calculating this distance for the end of a flume throat, the authors suggest calculating it for a cross section of critical depth. Some examples of flow rate computations are presented, showing a visible improvement in flow rate computations after applying this suggestion...|$|R
50|$|A {{modified}} version of the <b>Venturi</b> <b>flume</b> is the Parshall flume. Named after it creator, Dr. Ralph L. Parshall of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, the Parshall flume is a fixed hydraulic structure used in measuring volumetric flow rate in surface water, wastewater treatment plant, and industrial discharge applications. The Parshall flume accelerates flow though a contraction of both the parallel sidewalls and a drop in the floor at the flume throat. Under free-flow conditions the depth of water at specified location upstream of the flume throat can be converted to a rate of flow.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>venturi</b> <b>flume</b> {{is similar}} to the Parshall flume, without the {{contoured}} base, but the cross section is usually rectangular, the inlet shorter, and there is a general taper on the outlet similar to the venturi meter. [...] Because of their size, it is usual for these meters to be open to their surroundings just like a river or stream and therefore this type of measurement is referred to as open-channel flow measurement. Parshall flumes are much more efficient than standard flumes and generate a standard wave to effect a measurement.|$|E
5000|$|The short-section Parshall (sometimes {{referred}} to as a USGS or Portable Parshall) omits the discharge section of the flume. Originally designed by Troxell and Taylor in 1931 and published under [...] "Venturi Flume" [...] as a memorandum from the office of the Ground Water Branch, USGS, the design was again {{brought to the attention of}} potential users in Taylors' paper [...] "Portable <b>Venturi</b> <b>Flume</b> for Measuring Small Flows in 1954. [...] This modification - supplied by the USGS Hydrologic Instrumentation Facility - is available in two sizes: the original 3" [...] and the recently added 6".|$|E

40|$|In {{drilling}} operations, non-Newtonian {{drilling fluid}} is continuously circulated {{in a closed}} loop. One {{of the ways to}} monitor and regulate drilling operations is by accurately measuring the flow rate of circulating drilling fluid before entering and after returning from the wellbore. The circulating fluid flows in an open channel on the return path from the wellbore. This work investigates the use of Venturi constriction to estimate the non-Newtonian fluid flow in an open channel. Based on the specific energy principle, a relation between volumetric flow rate and critical depth is developed, which is used to estimate the flow rate based on the measured critical depth. To measure a critical depth for a given flow rate, it is necessary to locate a critical depth position in the <b>Venturi</b> <b>flume.</b> In this study, the critical depth position is located using specific energy diagram (at a minimum specific energy within the Venturi constriction) and Froude Number approach (at a Froude Number equals to 1). Based on the identified critical depth, the flow conditions (subcritical, critical or supercritical) along the <b>Venturi</b> <b>flume</b> are observed. The location of the critical depth in the Venturi section is found by performing experiments at 350 [kg/min] flow rate of the fluid. Further, the developed critical depth flow model is tested for randomly varying flow rates (250 - 500 [kg/min]) with the identified critical depth location. The flow estimations of the model were within the acceptable limit. However, it is found that the estimates for 350 [kg/min] are comparatively more accurate, which proves that the critical depth and critical depth position depends on the flow rate and rheological properties...|$|E
40|$|Most {{methods for}} flow rate {{measurement}} in open channels usually have low accuracy over {{a range of}} flow rates due to varying fluid properties, flow conditions and channel length. This paper suggests an algorithm to improve on the accuracy of flow rates computed based on hydraulic structure and slope-hydraulic radius methods. A model for determining flow rates in accelerating flows is also developed. In the proposed algorithm, the parameter used for adapting the flow rate models is obtained by comparing the measured fluid depth with the depth simulated based on the one-dimensional Saint Venant equations. The results show that an improvement from ± 2. 3 % to ± 0. 8 % accuracy in the flow rate measurement using the <b>Venturi</b> <b>flume</b> method could be achieved. In unsteady state flow in a straight-run channel, the results based on flow simulation also show possibility of achieving accurate computation {{over a wide range}} of flow rate...|$|E
40|$|It is {{suitable}} to add practical illustrations of hydraulic tasks during teaching hydraulics and hydrology. These practical illustrations {{can be realized}} by mobile hydraulic circuit which is situated in the auditorium. This thesis is focused on constructional and project solution of the circuit which consists of a compensatory tank with sufficient capacity, pump aggregate and hydraulic measure flume. The construction of hydraulic flume must enable quick, simple and safety installation of a scaled down models of a hydro technical structures. The main requirements of a mobile teaching circuit are clearness of practical hydraulic illustrations, compact dimensions, comparatively low weight, mobility and simple control and manipulation. This diploma thesis also includes design of a scaled down models of a hydro technical structures, especially set of plate weirs, bed-crested weir, ogee-crested weir, culvert, <b>Venturi</b> <b>flume,</b> sluice and radial gate, pier and roughened bed.

40|$|The Sector Venturi {{is a novel}} {{design to}} {{determine}} discharge in sewers. Its main features are simplicity, accuracy of ± 5 %, and low cost. Further, the modular limit is comparable to standard flumes, and the capacity is equal to similar devices. Based on an optimization procedure, the best geometry was retained. The Sector Venturi {{is characterized by a}} ring of variable diameter, in which two sharp-crested sectors are attached. When mounting the Sector Venturi, the ring is expanded to match with the pipe section. The sector elements are sharp crested and have a notch at the invert. The principle of discharge measurement involves critical flow across a constriction. To stabilize the depth reading, holes are drilled in the sectors and two symmetrically arranged containers allow reading of the total head. The discharge is determined with a rating curve. One particular feature of the Sector Venturi is its insensitivity to clogging. As outlined, there are several disadvantages when compared with the pier-shaped Mobile <b>Venturi</b> <b>Flume,</b> but these do not detract from a useful means of discharge measurements in sewage...|$|E
30|$|A flume is an {{artificial}} {{open channel flow}} section that restricts the stream area and changes its slope, which increases the velocity and changes {{the volume of the}} water flowing through the flume (Ancey et al. 2008). There is no impoundment, but the height of water in the flume is measured with a stilling well (Mutz et al. 2007). The discharge can be calculated by measuring the height of water in the flume. HS, H and HL type flumes are used for measuring intermittent runoff, <b>venturi</b> <b>flume</b> for measuring irrigation water and San dimas Flume for debris laden flows in mountain streams (USFWS 2006). For water flow calculations, tables given by Bos (1976) and Hudson (1993) can be used. Flumes give accurate results when properly manufactured and installed (Hudson 2004) and do not need calibration, but accuracy gets affected by approach velocity of liquid and siltation (Hudson 2004). This method is not suitable for streams with large amount of debris, sediment or solids. Construction and installation are difficult (Shieh et al. 1996; Baffaut et al. 2015). Flumes are not practical except for small streams and are more limited than weirs regarding the range of flows that can be measured. Additionally, flume construction is more difficult than weirs.|$|E
