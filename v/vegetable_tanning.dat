40|$|Background: foot eczema {{is caused}} by shoe contact allergy in 3 - 11 % of the cases. The most common sensitizers are {{represented}} by rubber, adhesives, chemical tans, dyes, several biocides and, the last but not the least, metal accessories. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> would be less important than chromium salts in the etiology of footwear allergic contact dermatitis. However, {{few studies have been}} made on their sensitization potential. Objectives: the two goals for this study were to determine a) the optimal patch testing concentration for the four most widely used and rich of tannins <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> (chestnut, mimosa, quebracho and tara) and b) the prevalence of irritant and allergic reactions to the four <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> and two vegetable-tanned skins (sole leather, vacchetta). Materials and Methods: in phase 1 find the optimal patch testing concentration of the four <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> diluted in petrolatum; this was evaluated by a serial dilution test (5, 2 and 1 %) in 100 subjects with various skin diseases. In phase 2, sensitization and irritation potential of the four <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> in petrolatum 2 % and the two vegetable-tanned skins were investigated in 563 patients patch tested for eczematous dermatitis or any suspected allergic skin disorder. Results and discussion: the study demonstrates that optimal concentration to test <b>vegetable</b> <b>tans</b> in petrolatum is 2 % and that delayed positive reactions to tans are very rare (0. 4 %) and not clinically relevant, while those to vegetable-tanned skins (1. 2 %) are more frequent but probably relevant only in 3 of the 7 patients. These last three cases were not associated to positive patch tests to single tan; therefore, they could be due to preservatives, chemical contaminants or reaction compounds introduced accidentally during the production cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to aquire an appropriate plating technique on leather product accessories made from metal without lessening the wonderful appearance of the accessories, to maintain the shade and to keep the rust away from the accessories that avoid or diminish defects on the leather. The plating was carried out by spraying using spraying-gun one, two, and three times, and repeated three times for each treatment to chrome plated metal, gold plated metal and roasted metal. The smaples were then pinned on a piece of chrome <b>tanning</b> leather and <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather, whereas the test carried out was wet and dry rub fastness. Data from completely randomized design are analyzed by factorial pattern according to Gasperz (1991), showed that there was not significant effect on plating neither metal on chrome and <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather having been stored for one, two, or three months, neither on similar things having not been stored yet. However there was significant difference on accessories having been do treated as the stated above and set on a piece of <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather stored for three months. Conclusion could be drawn from {{the research}} that the use of acrylate using spray system for plating metal accessories was able to maintain its beautiful appearance, kept the rust away, that was not create defects neither on chrome nor <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather...|$|R

40|$|The <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather is {{very famous}} for the its {{wonderful}} and unmistakable odour. In general terms the odour {{can be defined as}} any emanation perceived by sense of smell; practically the odorous substances have to be sufficiently volatile for being inhaled and for coming to be counted with the receptors of the nasal mucosa. In other words, the odour is connected to the emanation of volatile substances, therefore the knowledge of such substances can contribute to define the responsible components of the perceived odour. In a previous research, it has been demonstrated that the gas-chromatography with a mass spectrometer detector (GC/MS), coupled to the Purge & Trap technique, is a valid analytical approach for the identification of volatile compounds in the leather. Therefore in this study, such technique bas been employed {{for the study of the}} volatile substances rising from <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leathers. The investigations have been turned to leather goods, classified according to type of article (leather sole, fattened vachette, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves of}} certain sumacs yield tannin (mostly pyrogallol-type), a {{substance}} used in <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning.</b> Notable sources include {{the leaves of}} R. coriaria, Chinese gall on R. chinensis, and wood and roots of R. pentaphylla. Leather tanned with sumac is flexible, light in weight, and light in color. One type of leather made with sumac tannins is morocco leather.|$|E
5000|$|Tanneries process {{animal skins}} {{with the use}} of {{chemicals}} to alter the proteins and produce a durable and flexible product. Whether the tanning process is done using <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning,</b> chromium salt tanning or another process, solid and water waste are inevitable by-products. [...] Currently, all hides used by S.B. Foot Tanning Company are pre-processed to a “wet-blue” state prior to delivery to the tannery for final tanning and dying. The three stages of Wet-Blue processing (pretanning, tanning, finishing) produce 450-600 kg of waste per ton of processed leather. [...] The treatment of this waste is governed by EPA rules and regulations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> uses tannins (a {{class of}} {{polyphenol}} astringent chemicals), which occur naturally in the bark and leaves of many plants. Tannins bind to the collagen proteins in the hide and coat them, {{causing them to}} become less water-soluble and more resistant to bacterial attack. The process also causes the hide to become more flexible. The primary barks processed in bark mills and used in modern times are chestnut, oak, redoul, tanoak, hemlock, quebracho, mangrove, wattle (acacia; see catechol), and myrobalans from Terminalia spp., such as Terminalia chebula. Hides are stretched on frames and immersed for several weeks in vats of increasing concentrations of tannin. Vegetable-tanned hide is not very flexible and is used for luggage, furniture, footwear, belts, and other clothing accessories.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the basic chromium species in tanning, several steps are required to produce a tannable hide. The pH must be very acidic when the chromium is introduced to ensure that the chromium complexes are small enough to fit in between the fibers and residues of the collagen. Once the desired level of penetration of chrome into the substance is achieved, the pH of the material is raised again to facilitate the process. This step is known as basification. In the raw state, chrome-tanned skins are blue, so are referred to as wet blue. Chrome tanning is faster than <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> (less than a day for this part of the process) and produces a stretchable leather which is excellent for use in handbags and garments.|$|E
50|$|Toxic {{poultry feed}} {{contaminated}} by chromium-based leather tanning (as opposed to traditional slower <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning)</b> is entering {{the food supply}} in Bangladesh through chicken meat, {{which is the most}} common source of protein in the country. Tanneries in Hazaribagh Thana, an industrial neighborhood of Dhaka, emit around 21,600 cubic meters of toxic waste each day. The tanneries also generate as much as 100 tonnes per day of scraps, trimmed raw hide, flesh and fat, which are processed into feed by neighborhood recycling plants and used in chicken and fish farms across the country. Chromium levels ranging from 350 to 4,520 micrograms (0.35 to 4.52 mg) per kilogram were found in different organs of chickens which had been fed the tannery-scraps feed for two months, according to Abul Hossain, a chemistry professor at the University of Dhaka. The study estimated up to 25% of the chickens in Bangladesh contained harmful levels of chromium(VI).|$|E
5000|$|The only type {{of leather}} {{suitable}} for carving is vegetable tanned, full grain leather. This {{is because the}} <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanning</b> process allows the leather to absorb water, {{which is used to}} soften the leather before the carving process, and the grain of the leather is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.While the process of cutting into the leather and pushing the edges of the cuts in is relatively modern, marking wet leather has been around since the Roman period. There are some beautiful examples of Roman leather at Vindolanda near Hadrian's wall and the book [...] "Purses in Pieces" [...] is very informative with some lovely examples of medieval carved leather work. Historically, tools for stamping leather would probably have been made out of bone, but would not have been too different from what we use today.|$|E
30|$|Model <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leather {{was exposed}} to thermo-oxidative ageing. Heat ageing of the leather will allow a loss of moisture, {{reducing}} the flexibility, change {{as well as the}} dimensions of the leather and alter the colour. Artificial ageing is expected to produce deterioration similar in historical leather and tt is an absolute necessity to evaluate the effect of conservation treatments. The model samples were undergone dry thermal ageing in a standard laboratory oven with a dry heat at 100  °C for 11  days, at which point the leather weight is constant [1, 23, 24].|$|R
30|$|The samples (fresh/aged/aged-laser {{irradiated}} model <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> samples, used in Td measurements) {{have been}} employed {{to measure the}} moisture content of the leather which was determined by weighting before and after drying in a laboratory oven (Abinghurst LTd, UK) at 100  °C for 24  h or until a constant weight was achieved. The weighting of the samples was carried out using (A&D balance, USA, readability to 0.001  mg). Measuring the moisture content of leather could be an indicator for assessment of the thermal effect of laser cleaning of leather.|$|R
40|$|Chromium tannage is {{the most}} used {{technology}} in processing of garment leathers. Due to environmental requirements and demands on natural products there is an increasing interest on alternatives to chromium tannage especially on <b>vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leathers. Leather properties vary in a very wide range depending on the animal type it is obtained from and the process type and chemicals used in the manufacturing. In this study, the effect of various tanning materials to the sewability of garment leathers was investigated. For this purpose, vegetable, chromium and chromium-vegetable combination tanned garment leathers from the same animal origin were supplied from a garment leather manufacturing factory. Needle penetration force and the sewability values of these leathers were determined by using L&M Sewability Tester. It was found that material properties and sewing properties showed differences regarding to the tanning material used even in same type of raw material. Chromium tanned leathers had sewability values of 13. 4 % horizontal and 14. 2 % vertical which are considered good to fair. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>tanned</b> leathers and chromium-vegetable tanned leathers had sewability values of 38. 2 % horizontal, 49. 2 % vertical and 98 % horizontal, 98. 5 % vertical respectively which are considered poor. The {{results of the study}} conclude that, {{there is a big difference}} in material properties when the tanning technology and material is changed which also affects the sewing properties...|$|R
