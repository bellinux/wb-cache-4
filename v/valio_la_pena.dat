5000|$|By {{the onset}} of the Texas Revolution in October 1835, de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> had been demoted to {{lieutenant}} and was a staff officer for the elite Zapadores Battalion. However, when the Mexican Army of Operations marched into Texas to subdue the revolution in January 1836, de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> was serving as an aide for Colonel Francisco Duque of the Toluca Battalion. The Toluca Battalion joined the rest of Santa Anna's army in San Antonio on March 4, 1836, eleven days after the siege of the Texas garrison in the Alamo Mission had begun. Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo {{in the early hours of}} March 6. Duque was assigned to lead one of the four assault columns, and he requested that de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> accompany him. De <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> remained at the front until Duque fell wounded and then returned to the rear to find General Manuel Fernández Castrillón, second-in-command of that column. At least twice more de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> returned to the front lines to accept or deliver messages. His only wound was a serious bruise. After the Battle of the Alamo, de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> saw no further action. However, he saw campaign action till the end of the Texas war, till he arrived in Matamoros, Mexico, by the beginning of June 6, 1836.After Santa Anna was captured at the Battle of San Jacinto, de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> retreated with the rest of the Mexican army back to Mexico, arriving in Matamoros on June 6, 1836. [...] The Zapadores Battalion had an unfilled slot for a captain, and de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> was soon promoted to take that position. For the next few months de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> requested letters of combat commendations from other officers for his heroic actions during the Texas campaigns, receiving ones from Lieutenant Colonel Ampudia, Duque, Lieutenant Colonel Amat, and even from General Jose de Urrea, who had not been part of the battle of the Alamo. And all of them testified to his brave actions in the Alamo death fight, hence they all agreed to write recommendation affidavits testifying to De <b>la</b> <b>Pena's</b> brave conduct in the Alamo battle. In December 1836 de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> was in Mexico City, where he testified in the inquiry into the actions of General Vicente Filisola during the army's retreat from Texas. Filisola was accused of being a coward for ordering the Mexican army to Matamoros when there was no reason to do so. He claimed to have done this on orders from Santa Anna, who was a prisoner of the Texans. This action from both these men is surely unnatural; a general(Filisola) in the battlefield, obeying orders from his superior, who was a prisoner of the enemy. During this time, de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> wrote a newspaper articles criticizing Filisola, which he signed [...] "An Admirer of Texas". Filisola knew that de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> had authored the article and the following week published a counterattack, referring to de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> as [...] "Peñita". De <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> then published a very long article defending himself and further criticizing Filisola. His letters of commendation were published in conjunction with the article. [...] The articles also mentioned that de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> had kept a diary during his time in Texas.|$|R

Concluding peace treaties with the United States, de <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> called an election in which was elected José Joaquín de Herrera, who took office on June 2. Herrera concluded his term, and handed the presidency to President-elect Mariano Arista on January 15, 1851.|$|R

[...] The following week he issued a similar proclamation, published in El Cosmopolita in the town of Los Alamos. [...] De <b>la</b> <b>Peña</b> joined Urrea in an uprising to overthrow Santa Anna and restore the Constitution of 1824. While De <b>la</b> <b>Pena</b> was in Texas, he had kept a diary which was not published till 1955. It was located by researcher J. Sanchez Garza and subsequently translated into English by Carmen Perry of the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. Roger Borroel, a researcher known for his many discoveries of Mexican documents on the Texas War of 1836, found that De <b>la</b> <b>Pena</b> was murdered by a fellow Zapadores officer, Francisco Cosio, on October 10, 1840, at about 9pm, on a street corner in Mexico City. Further research by Borroel revealed a pardon request by De <b>la</b> <b>Pena's</b> killer in 1942.|$|R
