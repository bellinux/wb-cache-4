5000|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> {{involves}} a gene-for-gene relationship. This kind of resistance is genetically controlled by single genes, although several such genes {{may be present}} in a single host or parasite individual. <b>Vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> is ephemeral resistance because it operates against some strains of the parasite but not others, depending {{on whether or not}} a match occurs. In agriculture, <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> requires pedigree breeding and back-crossing. It has been the resistance of choice during the twentieth century.|$|E

This contrasts with the term <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> which was used to describe single-gene resistance. Raoul A. Robinson further refined the definition of horizontal resistance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} find the {{relationship}} between the cone resistances measured in horizontally and vertically aligned cone penetration tests, a test series has been performed in a 2 m. diameter rigid wall calibration chamber using a 36 mm. cone. This calibration chamber contains an unsaturated uniform sand, which can be prepared at different densities. It is found that the horizontal cone resistance is higher than the <b>vertical</b> cone <b>resistance</b> at a given point, whilst the side friction is lower horizontally than vertically. A simple cavity expansion model is used to explain the ratio of horizontal over <b>vertical</b> cone <b>resistance.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{effective}} resistance of a resistive mesh is a commonly used analogy for various scientific and engineering {{problems such as}} IR voltage drop estimation, distributed control including time synchronization and sensor localization, determining the chemical distance among multiple bonds, and finding the distance between two vertices in a graph. Resistive networks are a commonly used structure in electronics to model different elements of an integrated circuit, such as a physical substrate, an integrated circuit layout, and a power distribution network. On-chip power and ground networks are composed of orthogonal metal lines from different metal layers, and a resistive mesh is typically used to model these networks. A two layer mesh is therefore commonly used to analyze IR voltage drops and decoupling capacitor placement. A closed-form expression is described here for the {{effective resistance}} between the intersections of a two layer resistive mesh where the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> unit <b>resistances</b> are different. The physical distance between the nodes of interest and the ratio between the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>resistances</b> k {{are included in the}} expression. The maximum error of the closed-form expression, as compared with the exact solution, is less than 5 % {{for a wide range of}} k. The error further decreases with greater separation between the nodes of interest. Index Terms—Closed-form solution, effective resistance, noise analysis, power grid, power/ground network...|$|R
5000|$|Horizontal {{resistance}} {{does not}} involve a gene-for-gene relationship. It is the resistance that invariably remains after <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> has been matched. It is genetically controlled by polygenes and it is durable resistance as many ancient clones testify. Its use in agriculture requires population breeding and recurrent mass selection.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater the}} area of a uniform host {{population}} with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance,</b> the more dangerous that resistance becomes. This is because of an increased selection pressure for the matching parasite, and an increased loss when the matching does occur. The greater {{the area of}} uniformity of <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance,</b> therefore, the greater the danger. Conversely, the greater the area of a uniform host population with high horizontal resistances, the more effective the horizontal resistance becomes. This is because parasite interference declines as the area of a horizontally resistant host population increases, and it is least when the entire crop of a region has {{a high level of}} horizontal resistance in all of its cultivars. The greater the area of uniformity of horizontal resistance, therefore, the greater the security.|$|E

5000|$|Allo-infection {{means that}} the {{parasite}} originates away from its host and has to travel to that host. The first infection of any individual host must be an allo-infection. <b>Vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> can control allo-infection only. It normally does this with a system of locking (see below) which reduces the proportion of allo-infections that are matching infections.|$|E
50|$|Of {{particular}} importance {{is the concept}} of parasite interference, first defined by Vanderplank, who called it the cryptic error in field trials. Parasite interference does not affect the demonstration of <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance,</b> but it can totally destroy the evidence for high levels of horizontal resistance. This factor, which has only recently been recognised, largely explains the almost total neglect of horizontal resistance during the twentieth century.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPiled raft {{foundation}} {{has been widely}} recognized as a rational and economical foundation system with the combined effects of raft and piles. However, the behavior of laterally loaded piled {{raft foundation}} has not been well understood due to the complicated interaction of raft–ground–piles. A series of static horizontal loading tests were carried out on three types of foundation models, i. e., piled raft, pile group and raft alone models, on sand using a geotechnical centrifuge. In this paper, the influences of relatively large moment load and rotation on the overall performance of laterally loaded piled raft foundation were examined. From the centrifuge model tests, {{it is found that}} the vertical displacement due to horizontal loads is different between piled raft and pile group foundation, and this vertical displacement has significant influences on the performance of laterally loaded piled raft foundation. The horizontal resistance of the pile part in the piled raft foundation is higher than those observed in the pile group foundation due to raft base contact pressure. The vertical displacement of the foundation due to the horizontal loads affects the <b>vertical</b> <b>resistances</b> of piles, which results in the different mobilization of moment resistances between the piled raft and pile group foundations...|$|R
50|$|This {{system of}} locking cannot {{function}} in a crop pathosystem in which the host population has genetic uniformity. A crop pathosystem is usually the equivalent of every door in the town having the same lock, and every householder having the same key which fits every lock. A system of locking is ruined by uniformity, and {{this is exactly what}} we have achieved when protecting our genetically uniform crops with <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance.</b> It also explains why <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> is temporary resistance in agriculture. This type of error is called sub-optimization and it results from working at too low a systems level. The system of locking is an emergent property that is observable only at the systems level of the pathosystem. Comparable biological emergents are the schooling of fish, and the flocking of birds, which cannot be observed at any systems level below that of the population. The n/2 model is also the most important hypothesis to emanate from the concept of the pathosystem. It can also be argued that the gene-for-gene relationship must function on a basis of heterogeneity in the wild pathosystem because the gross instability of the 'boom and bust' of modern plant breeding would have no evolutionary survival value.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} round of {{breeding}} for horizontal resistance, plants are exposed to pathogens and selected for partial resistance. Those with no resistance die, and plants unaffected by the pathogen have <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> and are removed. The remaining plants have partial resistance and their seed is stored and bred back up to sufficient volume for further testing. The hope is that in these remaining plants are multiple types of partial-resistance genes, and by crossbreeding this pool back on itself, multiple partial resistance genes will come together and provide resistance to a larger variety of pathogens.|$|E
50|$|Major (<b>vertical)</b> <b>resistance</b> of corn hybrids {{comes from}} the race {{specific}} Ht1, Ht2, Ht3, and HtN genes, with the Ht1 gene being most prevalent. Plants with Ht1 Ht2, or Ht3 genes have smaller, chlorotic lesions and reduced sporulation. The HtN gene delays symptoms until after the pollen shed. Individually, each Ht gene has limited effectiveness because there are races of E. turcicum that are virulent {{in the presence of}} one or the other. For example, widespread use of the Ht1 gene has reduced the prevalence of the Race 0 to which it has resistance against, but has increased Race 1. Breeders are now focusing on incorporating several resistance genes into corn hybrids. Incorporating both the Ht1 and Ht2 provide resistance against both Races 0 and 1. Thus far, this multigenic approach has proven to be effective. However resistant plants still show some symptoms, and the threat of new races showing up lends to the need for other management practices, especially in areas where the disease is present.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The cone {{resistance}} and sleeve friction measured when a penetration test is executed in the horizontal direction {{differ from those}} obtained when sounding in the traditional vertical direction. In order to quantify the differences a number of tests has been executed in a 2 m diameter rigid wall calibration chamber on sands with different densities and different gradations. These tests {{have shown that the}} difference between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> cone <b>resistance</b> is greatest for medium dense sands, but show little dependancy on the gradation of the sand. The ratio of horizontal over vertical sleeve friction on the other hand shows little variation for different densities, but is strongly dependant on the coarseness of the sand. ...|$|R

The anchor was embedded horizontally in a granular medium. The analysis was performed using lower bound finite element limit analysis and linear programming. An iterative procedure, proposed recently by the authors, was implemented to incorporate the variation of phi with sigma(m). It is noted that for a given embedment ratio, with a decrease in anchor width (B), (i) the uplift factor (F-gamma) increases continuously and (ii) the average ultimate uplift pressure (q(u)) decreases quite significantly. The scale effect becomes more pronounced at greater embedment ratios...|$|R
50|$|A gene-for-gene {{relationship}} can evolve {{only in a}} discontinuous pathosystem. This is because it functions as a system of locking. A matching allo-infection {{is the equivalent of}} a lock being unlocked. With the end of the season, all matched (i.e., unlocked) host tissues disappear. With the onset of a new growing season, all discontinuous host tissue (e.g., new leaves of a deciduous tree, newly germinated annual seedlings, or newly emerged tissue of a perennial herb) is unmatched and each host individual has a <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> that is functioning. This is the equivalent of re-locking. This alternation of matching and non-matching (or unlocking and re-locking) is an essential feature of any system of locking, and it is possible only in a discontinuous pathosystem. Conversely, in a continuous pathosystem just one matching allo-infection on each host individual is required for that individual to be parasitised for the rest of its life which, in the case of some evergreen trees, may endure for centuries. A gene-for-gene relationship is useless in such a pathosystem and, consequently, it will not evolve.|$|E

40|$|In our times, when {{electricity}} and electrical devices are around us every day, {{it is very}} important to be protected from electrostatic discharge. The best protection from electric charge dissipation provides conductive textile materials. For the last few decades fine and flexible conductive yarns were developed, which ensure very good electrostatic properties. Unfortunately, due to their chemical nature, these yarns do not distinguish good comfort properties. The main purpose of development of such textiles is to determine the influence of conductive yarns and hollow fiber yarns arrangements in the middle layer of the three layer weft-knitted fabrics to electrostatic and comfort properties. So, in order to have flexible textile materials with good electrostatic and comfort properties, multifunctional three layer weft-knitted fabrics of combined pattern were designed and manufactured for this research work. Two groups of polyester based three layer knitted fabrics with different arrangement of conductive yarns (such as carbon core yarn and polyester silver coated yarn) and polyester yarn of special design (Coolmax®, Thermolite®) were investigated. The parameters of electrostatic characteristics, such as surface and <b>vertical</b> <b>resistances</b> as well as charge decay properties were measured. The results have showed that all tested fabrics have excellent shielding properties. The main influence on the electrostatic properties of tested fabrics has the arrangement of conductive carbon core yarns inserted in the knits. In order to evaluate the comfort of knitted fabrics the air permeability, hygroscopicity, time of absorption and drying degree of fabrics were evaluated. It was determined, that the values of comfort parameters depend on the quantity and distribution of Coolmax® and Thermolite® yarns in the fabrics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

Based on Eq. (1), we infer that we can increase J 2 by reducing ρCL. Equation (1) also indicates that the proper increase of the <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> (i.e., ρp[*]× tp) also helps to enhance J 2. Alternatively, the <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> can become larger by including the N·ρPNP. However, the value of N·ρPNP can be affected by the number of PNP-AlGaN junction. Moreover, the value of ρPNP is subject to the doping concentration, the thickness and the AlN composition of the n-AlxGa 1 -xN layer.

40|$|A novel {{asymmetric}} {{vapor chamber}} is developed in this study. In this vapor chamber, nanostructure is patterned {{on the inner}} top surface of condensing wall and this condensing wall is made to be superhydrophobic to replace the conventional porous wick. This improvement not only results in drop-wise condensation which has a much higher heat transfer coefficient compared with film condensation, but also provides a shortcut for the condensed water to drop back directly to the center wick. Thus, a smaller liquid flow resistance and higher anti-dryout capability are achieved. The evaporator wick is made of sintered multi-layer copper powder. The dimensions of the vapor chamber are 70 x 70 x 3 mm(3). The test module includes an aluminum block with recirculated cooling water going through it and a heater with an area of 1. 5 x 1. 5 cm(2). The optimum working pressure is determined by testing {{the performance of the}} vapor chamber under different initial pressures. Heater temperature, horizontal resistance and <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> are identified as key parameters to evaluate the performance of heat spreader. It is found that heater temperature increases with increasing heat flux. However, the <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> shows the opposite tendency with increasing heat flux. The performance of the novel vapor chamber is compared with that of a conventional vapor chamber and copper plate. The newly developed vapor chamber can greatly reduce the heater temperature. Furthermore, better temperature uniformity and a lower <b>vertical</b> <b>resistance</b> can be achieved for the newly developed vapor chamber which is promising for the thermal management of high power electronic devices.

40|$|The {{monolithic}} structural {{action of}} various types of walls of flanged cross section and walls with engaged stiffeners or returns (nonrectangular sections) is critically dependent on the shear capacity of the interface between the components making up the section. An assessment of the shear capacity of the interface may also be required {{as part of the}} elastic or inelastic analysis of structural elements. Observation of past earthquake events has confirmed that effectively connected flanges also directly influence the seismic performance of nonrectangular sections by providing a more robust and seismically resistant structural element. To analyze the significance of the parameters that influence the <b>vertical</b> shear <b>resistance</b> of interfaces of flanged sections of masonry obtained using different types of bonding and bonding patterns (header units, shear connectors, and wire ties), a series of specimens with “H-shaped” cross sections was tested.

Considerable strength reserves and shear ductility were observed in almost all cases. Following the experimental study, a numerical investigation was carried out using a simplified micromodeling finite element approach.
