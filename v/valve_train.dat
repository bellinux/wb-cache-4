25|$|Higher lift allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a higher lift cam results in less airflow than with a cam with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this higher lift could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the intake side. Notably though, higher lift has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as <b>valve</b> <b>train</b> rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|E

The bore size is cast {{on the top of the}} block near the back of the right bank cylinder head. The block features a deep skirt where the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, forming a very rigid crankcase gallery. The oil system feeds a central gallery to the cam and crankshaft first from front to rear, and then dividing at the front to feed the two lifter galleries from front to rear. From the rear of the two lifter galleries oil is then supplied up to the two rocker arm shafts which serve as galleries to lubricate the <b>valve</b> <b>train.</b> The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. Juxtaposed with the Rambler V8, the Chevrolet small-block engine feeds both lifter galleries and the central cam and crankshaft galleries simultaneously through a three way split from the rear, having oil proceed to the front of the engine, the lifter galleries feeding oil to the <b>valve</b> <b>train</b> through hollow pushrods.|$|E

2500|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} valve lift, running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the valve spring tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This {{could also be a}} result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than following the cams’ profile. [...] This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. [...] This is where the engine rpm exceeds the maximum design rpm. [...] The <b>valve</b> <b>train</b> is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily.

2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without {{balance shaft}} a straight eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the <b>valve</b> <b>train</b> within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead valve configuration (as in the contemporary Buick engines). Combined with a substantial exhaust manifold and effective intake and exhaust muffling {{this can lead to}} a very quiet vehicle, both internally and externally. At the time of its use a quiet engine was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of slow idle speeds, enhancing both drivability and quietness. While Chrysler vehicles had similar engines they were not targeted for the lower middle price range enabled by General Motors' manufacturing expertise and volumes of the time.|$|E

40|$|In this work, a low-order five {{state model}} of the air {{handling}} system for a multi-cylinder variable geometry turbocharged diesel engine, with cooled exhaust gas recirculation and flexible intake valve actuation, is developed and validated against 286 steady state and 62 transient engine operating points. The model utilizes engine speed, engine fueling, EGR valve position, VGT nozzle position and intake valve closing time as inputs to the model. The model outputs include calculation for the engine flows {{as well as the}} exhaust temperature exiting the cylinder. The gas exchange model captures the dynamic effects of not only the standard air handling actuators (EGR valve position and VGT position) but also intake valve closing (IVC) timing, exercised over their useful operating ranges, and thus is critical for designing robust controllers. The model 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities are enabled through the use of analytical functions to describe the performance of the turbocharger, eliminating the need to use look-up maps; a physically-based control-oriented exhaust gas enthalpy sub-model, and a physically-based volumetric efficiency sub-model. Traditional empirical or regression-based models for volumetric efficiency, while suitable for conventional <b>valve</b> <b>trains,</b> are therefore challenged by flexible <b>valve</b> <b>trains.</b> The added complexity and additional empirical data needed for wide valve timing ranges limit the usefulness of these methods. A simple physically-based volumetric efficiency model was developed to address these challenges. The model captures the major physical processes occurring over the intake stroke, and is applicable to both conventional and flexible intake <b>valve</b> <b>trains.</b> The model inputs include temperature and pressure in both the intake and exhaust manifolds, intake and exhaust valve event timings, engine cylinder bore, stroke, connecting rod lengths, engine speed and effective compression ratio. The model is physically-based, requires no regression tuning parameters, is generalizable to other engine platforms, and has been experimentally validated using an advanced multi-cylinder diesel engine equipped with a fully flexible variable intake valve actuation system. ^ The in-cylinder oxygen fraction serves as a critical control input to these strategies, but is extremely difficult to measure on production engines. Fortunately, estimates or measurements of the oxygen fraction in the intake and exhaust manifold, the in-cylinder charge mass, and residual mass can be utilized to calculate the in-cylinder oxygen fraction. This work outlines such a physically-based, generalizable strategy to estimate the in-cylinder oxygen fraction from only production viable measurements or estimates of exhaust oxygen fraction, fresh air flow, charge flow, fuel flow, turbine flow and EGR flow. The oxygen fraction estimates are compared to laboratory grade measurements available for the intake and exhaust manifolds. The oxygen fraction estimates will be shown to be particularly sensitive to errors in the EGR and turbine flow. To improve the EGR flow estimate, a high-gain observer is implemented to improve the estimate of EGR flow. Furthermore, the in-cylinder oxygen estimation algorithm is developed, and proven, to be robust to turbine flow errors. The model-based observer estimates the oxygen fractions to within 0. 5...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{thorough}} understanding of mitral and aortic valve motion dynamics is essential in mastering the skills necessary for performing successful valve intervention (open or transcatheter repair or replacement). We describe a reproducible and versatile beatingheart mitral and aortic valve assessment and <b>valve</b> intervention <b>training</b> model in human cadavers. METHODS: The model is constructed by bilateral ligation of the pulmonary veins, ligation of the supra-aortic arteries, creating a shunt between the descending thoracic aorta and the left atrial appendage with a vascular prosthesis, anastomizing a vascular prosthesis to the apex and positioning an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in the vascular prosthesis, cross-clamping the descending thoracic aorta, and finally placing a fluid line in the shunt prosthesis. The left ventricle is filled with saline to the desired pressure through the fluid line, and the IABP is switched on and set to a desired frequency (usually 60 - 80 bpm). Prerepair valve dynamic motion can be studied under direct endoscopic visualization. After assessment, the IABP is switched off, and <b>valve</b> intervention <b>training</b> can be performed using standard techniques. RESULTS: This high-fidelity simulation model has known limitations, but provides a realistic environment with an actual beating (human) heart, which is of incremental value. The model provides {{a unique opportunity to}} fill a beating heart with saline and to study prerepair mitral and aortic valve dynamic motion under direct endoscopic visualization.

However, the decomposition results of the discrete wavelet transform do not possess time invariant property, which may result {{in the loss of}} useful information and decrease the classification accuracy of fault diagnosis.

Secondly, the vibration signals are decomposed by redundant second generation wavelet packet transform and then the faulty features are extracted from the resultant wavelet packet coefficients. Finally, the extracted fault features are given as input to classifiers for identification.
