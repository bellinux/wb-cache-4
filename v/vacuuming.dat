5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady <b>vacuuming</b> up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

5000|$|As {{an example}} of a guest star, Ian McGrady made an {{appearance}} throwing grapes high into the studio ceiling and catching them in his mouth, consistently. This was after an appearance by a so-called [...] "human carpet", who read a manifesto of why needed to be <b>vacuumed</b> and then summarily stretched out on the ground and was <b>vacuumed</b> by an assistant.|$|R
30|$|Chitosan {{solution}} (5 %) and 1 % PEO solution {{were first}} prepared separately by dissolving chitosan in 0.5 M acetic acid, then <b>vacuumed</b> in an oven at 0.8 Torr to remove air bubbles[17]. Solutions containing 0.5 wt.% of Triton X- 100 ™ and 5 to 10 wt.% of DMSO were {{mixed with the}} chitosan/PEO solutions, and the mixtures were again stirred for 16 h and <b>vacuumed</b> to remove air bubbles before use.|$|R
25|$|As {{discussed}} {{in more detail}} at Tineola bisselliella#Pest control, alternatives to mothballs to control clothes moths include dry cleaning, freezing, thorough <b>vacuuming,</b> or washing in hot water. Camphor is also used as a moth repellent, particularly in China.}} Unlike naphthalene and dichlorobenzene, camphor has medicinal applications and is not regarded as a carcinogen, though it is toxic in large doses.|$|E

Phillip Salon's Mud Club dominated Bagleys on Saturday nights known for flamboyant clientele, staging productions of a large scale, including such strange design elements such as washing lines full of clothes above the dance-floor, housewife characters <b>vacuuming</b> on podiums the club ran until 1996 when the event was replaced by Freedom.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in {{autonomous}} behavior is to actually perform a physical task. A new area showing commercial promise is domestic robots, with a flood of small <b>vacuuming</b> robots beginning with iRobot and Electrolux in 2002. While the level of intelligence is not high in these systems, they navigate over wide areas and pilot in tight situations around homes using contact and non-contact sensors. Both of these robots use proprietary algorithms to increase coverage over simple random bounce.|$|E

USE - For <b>vacuumed</b> hollow glass balls. ADVANTAGE - Cheaper; produces balls with better insulation properties...|$|R
50|$|The {{gravimetric}} method uses sensitive and accurately calibrated scales {{to weigh the}} amounts of gases added into the cylinder. Precise measurement is required as inaccuracy or impurities can result in incorrect calibration. The container for calibration gas must be as close to perfectly clean as practicable. The cylinders may be cleaned by purging with high purity nitrogen, the <b>vacuumed.</b> For particularly critical mixtures the cylinder may be heated while being <b>vacuumed</b> to facilitate removal of any impurities adhering to the walls.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} compotes of preventing pests is having good housekeeping skills. The building should be regularly <b>vacuumed,</b> mopped, and dusted, and food debris should be removed. When the museum is <b>vacuumed,</b> the edge tool around the furniture and baseboards should be used as pests tend to hide in these locations. The collection storage area should be kept clean and free of clutter. Every six months the entire collection storage area should be cleaned, and every month a visual inspection should be conducted throughout the space.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} {{is the process}} that was used when rescuing frescoes in La Fenice, a Venetian opera house, but the same process {{can be used for}} similarly damaged frescoes. First, a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol is applied. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized <b>vacuuming.</b> The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with barium hydrate. The cracks and detachments are stopped with lime putty and injected with an epoxy resin loaded with micronized silica.|$|E
25|$|Sky {{was born}} in 2009; a {{psychiatrist}} Biryukova saw prescribed her antidepressants while she was pregnant although {{she said she did}} not need them. By then lenders were beginning to foreclose the family's properties and they were in arrears on many of their bills. They had {{to move out of the}} Kirkland home and into the smaller Bellevue residence. Solomon claimed in later court papers that at this time, his wife's psychological problems began to manifest themselves, causing him to begin eating outside and sleeping on the floor to comply with her obsession with keeping the condominium clean. The board cited the couple several times for violating noise regulations; at one point they awoke their neighbors with <b>vacuuming</b> after 11 p.m. She, in turn, alleged he became controlling and angry.|$|E
25|$|Daniels {{answers the}} call leaving ASA Rhonda Pearlman alone to field {{questions}} from Deputy Commissioner William Rawls and Commissioner Ervin Burrell. She reports that forensics teams are attending each crime scene {{and they are}} recovering 9mm bullet casings, <b>vacuuming</b> for hair and fiber and laser printing for footprints. Daniels returns and is asked {{to confirm that the}} bodies are linked to one organization. He tells Burrell that Marlo Stanfield's drug organization is their prime focus and is then asked what they have on Stanfield. He explains that Major Crimes was building a case against Stanfield until three months ago when their wiretaps were pulled by Lieutenant Marimow. Burrell offers Daniels whatever support he needs. Daniels tells Burrell that he needs the patrol division to begin searching for houses. Daniels leaves to begin organizing a citywide search.|$|E

50|$|Central {{vacuum system}} inlet {{fittings}} are intentionally designed with a tighter {{radius of curvature}} than those of other bends in the system. If <b>vacuumed</b> debris becomes stuck it will jam at the inlet, where {{it is easy to}} find and remove.|$|R
500|$|The drill removes {{an annulus}} of ice around the core {{but does not}} cut under it. A {{spring-loaded}} lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. [...] The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface. [...] The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the WAIS Divide coring project, a <b>vacuuming</b> system {{was set up to}} facilitate this. [...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. [...] The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.|$|E
500|$|Recommended steps by {{individuals}} {{to reduce the}} blood lead levels of children include increasing their frequency of hand washing and their intake of calcium and iron, discouraging them from putting their hands to their mouths, <b>vacuuming</b> frequently, and eliminating the presence of lead-containing objects such as blinds and jewellery in the house. In houses with lead pipes or plumbing solder, these can be replaced. Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water {{in the morning to}} flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes. Lead testing kits are commercially available for detecting the presence of lead in the household. As hot water is more likely than cold water to contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and for making baby formula. [...] Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure. Measures such as dust control and household education {{do not appear to be}} effective in changing children's blood levels.|$|E

50|$|Boxed {{wine and}} <b>vacuumed</b> sealed wine can be aerated {{through the use}} of a single glass aerator. There are a number of {{different}} types of single glass aerators. Some have a movable spout that adjusts to the different size and shape of a wine glass.|$|R
5000|$|Bag: The {{most common}} method {{to capture the}} debris <b>vacuumed</b> up {{involves}} a paper or fabric bag that allows air to pass through, but attempts to trap most of the dust and debris. The bag may be disposable, or designed to be cleaned and re-used.|$|R
2500|$|The 18-year-old Kampusch reappeared on 23 August 2006. At 12:53pm, when Kampusch was {{cleaning}} and <b>vacuuming</b> her kidnapper's BMW 850i automobile in the garden, someone called Přiklopil on his mobile phone. Because of the <b>vacuuming</b> noise, {{he walked away}} to take the call. Kampusch left the vacuum cleaner running and ran away, unseen by Přiklopil, who, according to the caller, completed the phone call without any sign of being disturbed or distracted. Kampusch ran for some 200metres through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on {{the window of a}} 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, [...] "I am Natascha Kampusch". The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04pm. Later, Kampusch was taken to the police station in the town of Deutsch-Wagram.|$|E
2500|$|Bronze {{objects were}} kept in {{dehumidification}} chambers {{for a few weeks}} and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed [...] "depth cleaning," [...] which entailed the use of small drills and <b>vacuuming.</b> Similar measures were taken with gold. [...] Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.|$|E
2500|$|As these indoor {{techniques}} {{continue to}} develop, <b>vacuuming</b> robots will gain {{the ability to}} clean a specific user-specified room or a whole floor. Security robots {{will be able to}} cooperatively surround intruders and cut off exits. These advances also bring concomitant protections: robots' internal maps typically permit [...] "forbidden areas" [...] to be defined to prevent robots from autonomously entering certain regions.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{encapsulation}} {{to create}} a crystalline residue that can be immediately <b>vacuumed</b> (as opposed to the dry powder residue of wet-cleaning systems, which generally requires an additional day before vacuuming)is a newer technology that has recently become an accepted method for commercial and residential carpet deep cleaning.|$|R
25|$|Activated carbon {{filters are}} used to retain {{radioactive}} gases within the air <b>vacuumed</b> from a nuclear boiling water reactor turbine condenser.

2500|$|As with moving {{or working}} with dry pieces, the textile should be washed in a flat, fully {{supported}} position. [...] Usually this is achieved {{through the use}} of screens like the ones used in <b>vacuuming,</b> though these may be supported in a frame of some kind for added stability. [...] The textile should be sandwiched between two screens. [...] If the piece is particularly delicate or fragile, it may be wrapped in netting, then placed between the screens.|$|E
