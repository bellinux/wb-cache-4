25|$|A counter {{argument}} to opponents of compulsory voting {{is that in}} these systems the individual still has the practical ability to abstain at the polls by voting informally if they so choose, due to the secrecy of the ballot. A spoilt vote does not count towards any political party and effectively {{is the same as}} choosing not to vote under a non-compulsory voting system. However, Singer argues that even the appearance of <b>voluntary</b> <b>participation</b> is sufficient to create an obligation to obey the law.|$|E

It also aims to develop the defence trade in the region by encouraging ASEAN member states to participate in the intra-ASEAN defence trade and support trade shows and exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} 40 years, voter turnout has been {{steadily}} declining in the established democracies. This trend has been significant in the United States, Western Europe, Japan and Latin America. It has {{been a matter of}} concern and controversy among political scientists for several decades. During this same period, other forms of political participation have also declined, such as <b>voluntary</b> <b>participation</b> in political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. The decline in voting has also accompanied a general decline in civic participation, such as church attendance, membership in professional, fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher associations. At the same time, some forms of participation have increased. People have become far more likely to participate in boycotts, demonstrations, and to donate to political campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since <b>voluntary</b> <b>participation</b> in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E

40|$|Australia's {{economic}} restructuring and micro-economic reforms have generated {{a new wave}} of employee participation in organisational decision making. Employee participation is often used to introduce changes in organisations. It is also complimentary to new production strategies such as justin-time, continuous improvement, total quality management, and team-work. Central to the success of any form of <b>voluntary</b> employee <b>participation</b> program is the decision by employees to choose to join, and then continue their involvement, in a participative program. Employees do have an alternative, that is to not participate. This paper reports on recent research into the factors common to employees who choose to participate or not participate in one organisation's <b>voluntary</b> employee <b>participation</b> programs. In doing so it provides valuable insight for other organisations into the factors they may need to manage if they wish to achieve high levels of sustained participation by workers...|$|R

2500|$|The Kimberly process {{operates}} through <b>voluntary</b> <b>participation,</b> self-examination, and peer-review. The United States is the world’s largest diamond market, and in 2001 legislators {{decided to}} take action to ban the importation of illegally mined diamonds. Representative Tony P. Hall (D-OH) led on the issue in Congress and introduced the Clean Diamonds Act, H.R. 918, on March 7, 2001, to lessen U.S. involvement in this illicit diamond trade. The bill prohibits individuals or corporations from importing rough diamonds into the United States unless the extracting and intermediary countries utilize export and import controls verifying the legitimacy of the diamonds. H.R. 918 does this by ensuring that the import of diamonds into the United States meets specified requirements that are consistent with United Nations Resolution 55/56 [...] "H.R. 918, Clean Diamonds Act." [...] Resolution 55/56, [...] being the document adopted by the general assembly in 2000 aimed at breaking the link between the transaction of illicit diamonds and armed conflict.|$|E

There exists a population-based cancer registry ([URL] a hospital-based cancer registry ([URL] and “organ-based” registries administrated by various medical associations and organizations, such as the Japanese Joint Committee for Lung Cancer Registration ([URL] However, these registries possess several shortcomings: for example, the population-based cancer registry has been reported to contain omissions of cases, and survival analyses have not been conducted (Sobue et al. 2007). The hospital-based registry predominantly includes only data from specialized hospitals, (Sobue et al. 2007). and registries managed by medical associations generally include only <b>voluntary</b> <b>participations.</b> All of these registry databases do not adhere to a single format, and there is no framework that allows for their simple integration (Sobue et al. 2007;Hirata et al. 2012).

40|$|Objectives. Conflicting {{arguments}} {{exist in}} the literature about whether associational involvement can enhance people’s social resources (operationalized as the extent to which people have nearby social networks they can rely on). We aim to test these arguments. Methods. We use two-wave panel data. These are needed, as a causal relationship is presumed: participation as antecedent and social resources as out-come. To test this relationship, we compared two groups: respondents who became members of an association (between the two waves) and respondents who remained uninvolved. Results. We found no general membership effect. However, starting volunteer work showed a small, positive effect on the growth of social resources. Furthermore, membership effects were found among groups with fewer possibilities of acquiring social resources in other contexts (the elderly, people without a partner, and ethnic minorities). Conclusions. In line with the more skeptical ideas about voluntary associations, the effects of <b>voluntary</b> association <b>participation</b> seem small. However, people differ in {{the extent to which they}} profit from this participation. A paradox exists in the study of <b>voluntary</b> association <b>participation.</b> O...|$|R
