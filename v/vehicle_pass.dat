25|$|Emergency {{services}} in Norway use mostly blue lighting. If a blue flashing light {{is seen in}} either traffic or the sea, other vehicles must yield to let that <b>vehicle</b> <b>pass.</b> Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a ‘code 160’ endorsement on their driver's license. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren {{may not be used}} alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and traffic lights with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as tow-trucks, snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.|$|E
500|$|For instance, while {{traveling}} in a moving vehicle at a [...] velocity, {{the laws of}} physics do not change {{as a result of its}} motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving <b>vehicle</b> <b>pass</b> by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.|$|E

It consists of a depression in the road covered by a transverse grid of bars or tubes, normally made of metal and firmly fixed to the ground {{on either side of the}} depression, so that the gaps between them are wide enough for an animal's feet to enter, but sufficiently narrow not to impede a wheeled vehicle or human foot. This provides an effective barrier to animals without impeding wheeled vehicles, as the animals are reluctant to walk on the grates.|$|E

5000|$|Vohimarina (literally [...] "flat mountain") and Lamosina (literally [...] "back") are two villages {{separated}} by a few miles walking distance. The origin of the name Vohimarina came from the mountain made of a huge rock dominating the village. This mountain has a strange layout of having a flat surface on its top. It has a mysterious long and tubular shape like a beast with a huge bump and a queue (150-200 m high, 700 m length, 70 m width). The front of the rock represents a face of an animal facing the village located down to the west direction. This rock is seen from a radius of 10 km and Lamosina is the farthest village seen {{from the top of}} the mountain. Lamosina had its name because it is the extreme village seen from the roof tafo of the rock, roof that is like a bump or a back lamosina.For many years, the two villages have been twinned in name but still {{separated by}} a distance of 5 miles. Vohimarina is bigger than Lamosina and historically from French rule the independence, Vohimarina is the biggest administrative unit canton. Lamosina like the other small villages= Anjanomalaza, Vohibe, Matahimasy, Vahambe are under Vohimarina authority.To reach Vohimarina, one needs to drive a 4 x 4 wheel car; follow the national Road RN7 South to Tulear. From Fianarantsoa, you pass Mahazengy, Soaindrana, Talata Ampano and at Andranovorivato you turn right. From this point,the road is no longer asphalted. The 12 km that separate Andranovorivato to Vohimarina take 45 minutes/one hour because the road is barely practicable with bumps, holes,hills and the two bridges have been damaged by the cyclones. you need to be careful when crossing as two trunks of trees are lied in parallel to reach the gap so be accurate your <b>vehicle</b> <b>pass</b> on them.The Rock mountain will be on the left, you will follow the right flank and finally pass in front of the head of the [...] "beast" [...] before going down to the village.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a vehicle sequencing problem for adjacent intersections under {{the framework of}} Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM).

Since there are considerable <b>vehicle</b> <b>passing</b> combinations, how to find an efficient <b>vehicle</b> <b>passing</b> sequence in a short time becomes a big challenge, especially for more than one intersection. In this paper, we present a technique for combining certain vehicles into some basic groups with reference to some properties discussed in our earlier works. A genetic algorithm based on these basic groups is designed to find an optimal or a near-optimal <b>vehicle</b> <b>passing</b> sequence for each intersection. Computational experiments verify that the proposed genetic algorithms can response quickly for several intersections. Simulations with continuous vehicles are carried out with application of the proposed algorithm or existing traffic control methods. The results show that the traffic condition can be significantly improved by our algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} vibrational response of a full-scale highway bridge {{before and after}} the introduction of a simulated crack in one of the three supporting steel girders. The simulated cracking of the girder was carried out in five stages beginning with the cutting of the entire bottom flange at the mid-span of one fascia girder. Subsequent stages increased the severity of the crack by continuing the cutting of the girder through the web in six-inch increments. ^ The overall goal of this work was to determine what processing techniques and response components could be used to form the basis of a continuous monitoring system for in-service highway bridges. The system would detect a change in the stiffness of the structure that could present a severe hazard or even collapse. ^ A large portion of the study was experimental, and involved the field testing of a portion of a highway bridge that was being replaced with another structure at the same location. A minimum of 10 passes were made with a full-size pick-up truck during each stage of the test to simulate traffic passing over the bridge. ^ The vibrational response of the bridge was measured at eight locations on the structure for each <b>vehicle</b> <b>pass</b> and recorded for analysis. A Frequency Response Spectrum (FRS) was produced from the results of each <b>vehicle</b> <b>pass.</b> An average FRS was also produced. The location of peaks within the average and individual FRS and their amplitudes were compared between the different stages. The values of the Signature Assurance Criterion, which utilize the response of the structure at specific frequencies, and the Cross Signature Assurance Criterion, which utilize the response at specific locations, clearly indicate a change in stiffness. ^ A finite element model was developed and calibrated using the experimental results from the unaltered structure. Reduction in the stiffness of the primary beam elements resulted in good correlation with the experimental results to a certain degree. Changes in the torsional frequency range were not duplicated with the model. ^ Recommendations for further research are discussed. ...|$|E
