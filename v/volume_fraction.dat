However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant <b>volume</b> <b>fraction</b> of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the <b>volume</b> <b>fraction</b> of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an amorphous solid.|$|E

It works on concentrated dispersions without dilution. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the particles / droplets. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and <b>volume</b> <b>fraction</b> of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (e.g.Creaming and Sedimentation) and global changes in size (e.g. flocculation, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E

25|$|Movement {{of water}} {{takes place in}} these passageways in any direction, {{longitudinally}} in the cells, as well as laterally from cell to cell until it reaches the lateral drying surfaces of the wood. The higher longitudinal permeability of sapwood of hardwood is generally caused {{by the presence of}} vessels. The lateral permeability and transverse flow is often very low in hardwoods. The vessels in hardwoods are sometimes blocked by the presence of tyloses and/or by secreting gums and resins in some other species, as mentioned earlier. The presence of gum veins, the formation of which is often a result of natural protective response of trees to injury, is commonly observed on the surface of sawn boards of most eucalypts. Despite the generally higher <b>volume</b> <b>fraction</b> of rays in hardwoods (typically 15% of wood volume), the rays are not particularly effective in radial flow, nor are the pits on the radial surfaces of fibres effective in tangential flow (Langrish and Walker, 1993).|$|E

Multiphase flow experiments were carried out with formation water, crude oil and gas from different North Sea gas fields in Statoil's High Pressure Multiphase Flow Loop in Porsgrunn, Norway. Four different flow regimes were investigated (stratified wavy, slug, dispersed and annular). A traversable dual energy gamma densitometer {{was used to measure}} the fluid densities in the pipe. Partial least squares regression was previously applied to identify multiphase flow regimes and quantify <b>volume</b> <b>fractions</b> of gas, oil and water. That study showed promising results for flow regime identification but the predictions of the total <b>volume</b> <b>fractions</b> were not acceptable. In this study a new method combining {{gamma densitometry}} and 3 -way partial least squares regression was applied in order to improve the quantitative estimation of the total <b>volume</b> <b>fractions</b> gained the previous study. The proposed 3 -way regression approach allows prediction of the total <b>volume</b> <b>fractions</b> directly using one model instead of multiple models which was reported earlier. The improved quantification of the <b>volume</b> <b>fractions</b> of gas, oil and water was used to improve the flow regime identification plots and increase the interpretability. The new 3 -way prediction results for the <b>volume</b> <b>fractions</b> were significantly better than what was found earlier based on individual PLS models.

2500|$|Another {{problem of}} the parts-per {{notation}} {{is that it may}} refer to mass fraction, mole fraction or <b>volume</b> <b>fraction.</b> Since it is usually not stated which quantity is used, it is better to write the unit as kg/kg, mol/mol or m3/m3 (even though they are all dimensionless). The difference is quite significant when dealing with gases and {{it is very important to}} specify which quantity is being used. For example, the conversion factor between a mass fraction of 1 ppb and a mole fraction of 1 ppb is about 4.7 for the greenhouse gas CFC-11 in air.

In the case of the colloid, the <b>volume</b> <b>fraction</b> of particles (or particle density) may be so low that a significant amount of fluid may need to be removed initially for the gel-like properties to be recognized. This can be accomplished in any number of ways. The simplest method is to allow time for sedimentation to occur, and then pour off the remaining liquid.

2500|$|Nearly all {{materials}} {{could be}} seen as hierarchically structured, especially since the changes in spatial scale bring about different mechanisms of deformation and damage. However, in biological materials this hierarchical organization is inherent to the microstructure. [...] One of the first examples of this, in the history of structural biology, is the early X-ray scattering work on the hierarchical structure of hair and wool by Astbury and Woods. In bone, for example, collagen is the building block of the organic matrix — a triple helix with diameter of 1.5nm. These tropocollagen molecules are intercalated with the mineral phase (hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate) forming fibrils that curl into helicoids of alternating directions. These [...] "osteons" [...] are the basic building blocks of bones, with the <b>volume</b> <b>fraction</b> distribution between organic and mineral phase being about 60/40.|$|E
