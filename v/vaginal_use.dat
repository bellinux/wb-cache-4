50|$|While a plug {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with most any harness, just by inserting the plugs before putting on the harness, all the harness tends to do is push the plugs in, and not move them as to provide stimulation when the wearer thrusts. Depending on the type of harness, different ways are used to properly attach plugs to the harness. A common type consists of an opening or rubber ring with a cloth or leather back, similar to what might be used to hold the main dildo {{to the front of the}} harness, but positioned over the anus, vagina, or ones for both. A dildo/plug with a wide base is inserted through the ring, then when the harness is put on, the material pulls tight against it, holding it firm. For vac-u-lock harnesses, one or two additional vac-u-lock plugs are mounted on the inside of the harness, allowing any vac-u-lock attachment to be used. Most vac-u-lock harnesses that have the connectors for internal plugs come with two plug-shaped vac-u-lock attachments, a smaller one for anal use and a larger one for <b>vaginal</b> <b>use.</b> Like other types of harnesses, both plugs may be used at once, and often are separately adjustable on the strap to fit the wearer's body.|$|E

40|$|Motility is {{the feature}} that allows {{spermatozoa}} to actively reach and penetrate the female gamete during fertilization. When this function is altered, and especially decreased, troubles in conceiving may occur. In this study, we demonstrated that treating fertile women with myo-inositol (MI) vaginal suppositories ameliorated their partners’ sperm motility and also positively affected their conceiving capacity, without changes in cervical mucus structural and biochemical characteristics. Indeed, {{by means of}} the postcoital test on female cervical mucus, a significant improvement especially in progressive sperm motility was recorded after MI suppository use. Concomitantly, after MI treatment, a reduction of immotile spermatozoa percentage was observed. Importantly, MI vaginal supplementation positively correlated with a pregnancy for 5 of the 50 couples enrolled in the study, leading us to speculate that this substance may substantially contribute to create in the cervical mucus an ideal milieu that makes spermatozoa more motile and functionally able to fertilize.

Seventy per cent (95 % CI: 62. 0 - 77. 2 %) of the sex workers were HIV positive and on average they had five sexual partners per day. Vaginal douching and <b>vaginal</b> substance <b>use</b> were common among the sex workers. Vaginal douching was reported by 97 % (n = 146) of the respondents and 94 % reported <b>vaginal</b> substance <b>use</b> for 'dry sex'. A combination of traditional remedies, patent medicines, antiseptics and household detergents was used to clean and make the vagina dry and tight.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mucosal drug {{delivery}} nanotechnologies {{are limited by}} the mucus barrier that protects nearly all epithelial surfaces not covered with skin. Most polymeric nanoparticles, including polystyrene nanoparticles (PS), strongly adhere to mucus, thereby limiting penetration and facilitating rapid clearance from the body. Here, we demonstrate that PS rapidly penetrate human cervicovaginal mucus (CVM), if the CVM has been pretreated with sufficient concentrations of Pluronic F 127. Importantly, the diffusion rate of large polyethylene glycol (PEG) -coated, nonmucoadhesive nanoparticles (PS−PEG) did not change in F 127 -pretreated CVM, implying that F 127 did not significantly alter the native pore structure of CVM. Additionally, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) remains adherent in F 127 -pretreated CVM, indicating {{that the presence of}} F 127 did not reduce adhesive interactions between CVM and the virions. In contrast to treatment with a surfactant that has been approved for <b>vaginal</b> <b>use</b> as a spermicide (nonoxynol- 9 or N 9), there was no increase in inflammatory cytokine release in the vaginal tract of mice after daily application of 1 % F 127 for 1 week.

40|$|Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is {{the most}} common vaginal {{syndrome}} afflicting fertile, premenopausal and pregnant women. BV is associated with important adverse health conditions and infectious complications.

The dominance of lactobacilli in healthy vaginal microbiota and its depletion in BV has given rise to the concept of oral or <b>vaginal</b> <b>use</b> of probiotic Lactobacillus strains for treatment and prevention of BV. This review investigated the evidence for the use of a single strain or cocktail of probiotics, administered orally or intravaginally, either alone or in conjunction with antibiotics for the treatment of BV. Lactobacilli use in BV is supported by positive results obtained in some clinical trials. The majority of clinical trials yielding positive results have been performed using probiotic preparations containing high doses of lactobacilli suggesting that, beside strain characteristics, the amount of exogenously applied lactobacilli could have a role in the effectiveness of the product. However, substantial heterogeneity in products, trial methodologies and outcome measures do not provide sufficient evidence for or against recommending probiotics for the treatment of BV...|$|E
30|$|To {{complete}} this objective {{we focused on}} topical, placebo vaginal dosage forms currently in development as microbicide delivery systems. The four delivery systems used for investigating markers of product adherence were the “universal” HEC (hydroxyethylcellulose) placebo gel [6, 7, 15, 16] and the placebo forms of the tenofovir (TFV) vaginal film [17], vaginal insert [18], and the dual reservoir TFV-levonorgestrel intravaginal ring (IVR) [19, 20]. Two main approaches for placebo marker development were investigated: 1) Excipient based detection methodologies and 2) spectroscopy methodologies, specifically Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) coupled with chemometric modeling. Initial work for developing FTIR-based prediction models to determine the presence of placebo products in this report has been completed [21]. Once methodologies were developed to detect placebo product through excipient-based assays and FTIR spectroscopy, a clinical study was performed to determine feasibility and how long after <b>vaginal</b> <b>use</b> the product could be detected using the developed approaches. We previously developed biomarkers of semen exposure in the vagina and described the decay curves of these biomarkers [22, 23].

40|$|Heterosexual {{transmission}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) is the most frequent mode of infection worldwide. However, the immediate events between exposure to infectious virus and establishment of infection are still poorly understood. This study investigates parameters of HIV infection of human female genital tissue in vitro using an explant culture model. In particular, we investigated {{the role of the}} epithelium and virucidal agents in protection against HIV infection. We have demonstrated that the major target cells of infection reside below the genital epithelium, and thus HIV must cross this barrier to establish infection. Immune activation enhanced HIV infection of such subepithelial cells. Furthermore, our data suggest that genital epithelial cells were not susceptible to HIV infection, appear to play no part in the transfer of infectious virus across the epithelium, and thus may provide a barrier to infection. In addition, experiments using a panel of virucidal agents demonstrated differential efficiency to block HIV infection of subepithelial cells from partial to complete inhibition. This is the first demonstration that virucidal agents designed for topical <b>vaginal</b> <b>use</b> block HIV infection of genital tissue.

40|$|The {{concurrent}} {{increases in}} global population and {{sexually transmitted infection}} (STI) demand a search for agents with dual spermicidal and microbicidal properties for topical vaginal application. Previous attempts to develop the surfactant spermicide, nonoxynol- 9 (N- 9), into a vaginal microbicide were unsuccessful largely due to its inefficiency to kill microbes. Furthermore, N- 9 causes damage to the vaginal epithelium, thus accelerating microbes to enter the women’s body. For this reason, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), naturally secreted by all forms of life as part of innate immunity, deserve evaluation for their potential spermicidal effects. To date, twelve spermicidal AMPs have been described including LL- 37, magainin 2 and nisin A. Human cathelicidin LL- 37 is the most promising spermicidal AMP to be further developed for <b>vaginal</b> <b>use</b> for the following reasons. First, it is a human AMP naturally produced in the vagina after intercourse. Second, LL- 37 exerts microbicidal effects to numerous microbes including those that cause STI. Third, its cytotoxicity is selective to sperm {{and not to the}} female reproductive tract. Furthermore, the spermicidal effects of LL- 37 have been demonstrated in vivo in mice. Therefore, the availability of LL- 37 as a vaginal spermicide/microbicide will empower women for self-protection against unwanted pregnancies and STI...|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} whether vaginal cleansing {{reduces the risk}} of postoperative infection after abdominal total hysterectomy on benign indications and to analyze risk factors. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. All clinics including patients in the Swedish National Register for Gynecological Surgery. Population. All 7, 193 women who underwent abdominal total hysterectomy for benign indications from 2000 to 2007. Methods. Information on clinic routines for preoperative vaginal cleansing was obtained retrospectively in a postal survey. Associations between routines for vaginal cleansing and structured data from the Register were analyzed by means of multivariate logistic regression models. The main effect variable was postoperative infections defined as infections treated with antibiotics within six to eight weeks postoperatively, reported by the patient or the physician. Main outcome measures. Prevalence and risk factors for postoperative infections. Results. Prevalence of postoperative infections was 14. 4 %. The prevalence did not differ between those having had <b>vaginal</b> cleansing <b>using</b> chlorhexidine and those without <b>vaginal</b> cleansing, whereas <b>using</b> saline solution was encumbered with a significantly increased risk. Risk factors for postoperative infections were age 60, obesity, smoking, weight of the uterus, duration of hospital stay, blood transfusion, and peroperative injury of the urinary bladder or ureter.

The obtained microcapsules were discrete, spherical with free flowing properties and evaluated for particle size, shape, flow properties, wall thickness, drug encapsulation efficiency and in vitro release performance. The drug carrier interactions were investigated in solid state by FT-IR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The microcapsules with a narrow size range of 23 - 68 µm showed higher encapsulation efficiency. The selected microcapsule formulation, MC 3 (Drug polymer ratio 1 : 4) was employed for gel formulation {{with a variety of}} carbopol polymers (carbopol- 934, 940, 974 and 980) by mechanical stirring method in order to develop a sustained release microencapsulated metronidazole microcapsules-containing bioadhesive gel.
