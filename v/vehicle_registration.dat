5|$|Ireland is {{the third}} best seller European market of E85 flex-fuel vehicles, after Sweden and France. Bioethanol (E85) in Ireland is made from whey, a waste product of cheese manufacturing. The Irish {{government}} established several incentives, including a 50% discount in <b>vehicle</b> <b>registration</b> taxes (VRT), which can {{account for more than}} one third of the retail price of a new car in Ireland (around €6,500). The bioethanol element of the E85 fuel is excise-free for fuel companies, allowing retail prices to be low enough to offset the 25 per cent cut in fuel economy that E-85 cars offer, due to ethanol's lower energy content than gasoline. Also, the value added tax (VAT) on the fuel can also be claimed back. E-85 fuel is available across the country in more than 20 of Maxol service stations. In October 2005, the 1.8 Ford Focus FFV became the first flexible-fuel vehicle to be commercially sold in Ireland. Later Ford launched the C-max and the Mondeo flexifuel models. Saab and Volvo also have E85 models available.|$|E

40|$|Investigates the {{relationship}} between housing wealth and consumption using postcode-level variation in house prices and administrative data on new passenger <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> {{as a proxy for}} consumption. Abstract Understanding {{the relationship}} between housing wealth and consumption is important, because it informs the extent to which fluctuations in house prices might affect the broader economy. We investigate {{the relationship between}} housing wealth and consumption using postcode-level variation in house prices and administrative data on new passenger <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> as a proxy for consumption. In our preferred specification, we estimate an elasticity of new passenger <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> with respect to gross housing wealth of 0. 4 – 0. 5, and an average marginal propensity to consume (MPC) for new passenger vehicles of about 0. 06 cents per dollar change in gross housing wealth. Assuming new <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> and total consumption have the same sensitivity to changes in housing wealth implies an MPC for total consumption of 2 cents per dollar change in gross housing wealth. But US evidence indicates that new vehicle consumption is particularly sensitive to changes in housing wealth. Assuming {{the same is true for}} Australia, our estimates imply an MPC for total consumption of less than 0. 25 cents. Notably, we find evidence that the relationship between house prices and new <b>vehicle</b> <b>registrations</b> is heterogenous in income, with low-income households having a higher propensity to purchase a new vehicle following a rise in housing wealth than high-income households. This implies that the distribution of changes in house prices is relevant for understanding its effect on aggregate consumption.  ...|$|R
