5|$|Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr. (born Leslie Lynch King Jr.; July 14, 1913– December 26, 2006) was an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} the 38th President of the United States from August 1974 to January 1977, following the resignation of Richard Nixon. Prior to this he served eight months as the 40th Vice President of the United States, following the resignation of Spiro Agnew. He was the first person appointed to the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> {{under the terms of the}} 25th Amendment, and consequently the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to executive office. Before his appointment to the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency,</b> Ford served 25 years as U.S. Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Twenty-fifth Amendment's adoption, a Vice Presidential vacancy {{remained}} {{until the}} start of the next presidential term. The <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidency</b> has been vacant several times due to death, resignation, or succession to the Presidency. Often these vacancies lasted for several years.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> did {{not carry}} many {{official}} duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, {{making him the}} first vice president to do so. He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.|$|E

Moore praised his devotion to freedom of religion and his opposition to imprisonment for debt.|$|E
50|$|Hoffa was re-elected over Leedham (again {{running on}} the TDU platform) in 2001, 64.8 percent to 35.2 percent. Leedham {{challenged}} Hoffa and the Hoffa Unity Slate a third time in 2006, losing 65 percent to 35 percent (with 25 percent turnout). Hoffa faced TDU candidate Sandy Pope, a local union president, in 2011. Also running, with a full slate of officer and vice presidential candidates, was former Hoffa supporter and former national vice president Fred Gegare. Hoffa again easily won re-election, earning 60 {{percent of the vote}} to Gregare's 23 percent and Pope's 17 percent. The Hoffa Unity Slate also won all five regional <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies,</b> although the slate's support declined across the board. Hoffa won reelection once more in 2016, this time against Teamsters United candidate Fred Zuckerman, but by a much narrower margin of 52 to 48 percent. The 2016 election was also the first time Hoffa-allied candidates lost regional <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies</b> to the Teamsters United reform slate.|$|R
50|$|The major {{difference}} between the U.S. and the C.S. <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidencies</b> was that the Confederate term in office was six years long. The President was explicitly forbidden from running {{for a second term}} by the constitution, but the Vice President was not. It was unclear whether or not a Vice President, who became President {{in the middle of a}} term, could run for his own term afterward.|$|R

He was later to be elected the first Member of Parliament for Emuhaya in 1963. He held the post of a regional Vice-President for Western Province, one of the seven regional <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies</b> in postcolonial era Kenya period spanning 1966–1970.|$|R
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b> It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> later that day, before adjourning.|$|E

50|$|Summerville {{was elected}} vice {{president}} in the 1901 elections under President Garretson W. Gibson, and was reelected in 1903 and 1905 under President Arthur Barclay. However, Summerville died on July 27, 1905 prior to taking office for his third term. As no constitutional provision allowed for the replacement of a vice president, meaning that President Barclay would {{have been forced to}} serve his entire term without a vice president, the constitution was amended in 1905 to allow for a special election to be held in the event of the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency's</b> vacancy.|$|R
5000|$|Flush with success, {{and having}} become a {{well-known}} (if not exactly household) {{name in the}} industry, Banyan seemed destined for greatness. Unfortunately, this was not to last. The opportunities available drew a number of young, high-powered sales people, and some observers felt that <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies</b> were handed out freely to assuage egos. Political infighting within the sales department and its multiple [...] "regional vice presidents" [...] allegedly led to resignations and terminations {{of a number of}} highly qualified sales and marketing people. A noted example is the closure of the company's #1 sales office, and the rumors that its management was dismissed to settle a personal dispute.|$|R

5|$|Murray M Chotiner (October 4, 1909– January 30, 1974) was an American {{political}} strategist, attorney, government official, {{and close}} associate {{and friend of}} President Richard Nixon {{during much of the}} 37th President's political career. He served as campaign manager for the future president's successful runs for the United States Senate in 1950 and for the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> in 1952, and managed the campaigns of other California Republicans. He was active in each of Nixon's two successful runs for the White House in low-profile positions.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, Ford {{nominated}} former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to {{fill the}} <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> he had vacated. Rockefeller's top competitor had been George H. W. Bush. Rockefeller underwent extended hearings before Congress, which caused embarrassment when it was revealed he made large gifts to senior aides, such as Henry Kissinger. Although conservative Republicans were not pleased that Rockefeller was picked, most of them voted for his confirmation, and his nomination passed both the House and Senate. Some, including Barry Goldwater, voted against him.|$|E
50|$|The role of First Vice President {{was created}} in the {{revision}} of the Constitution in 1989. It took over some of the responsibilities of Prime Minister. According to Article 124, First Vice President will be chairing the board of ministers and coordinate the other <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies,</b> if let by the President. According to Article 131, First Vice President takes over as acting President in cases where the President in incapacitated, but only if permitted by the Supreme Leader.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 This {{qualitative}} narrative inquiry study {{explored the}} experiences and perspectives of five Asian American females who have sought <b>presidencies</b> and/or <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies</b> in community colleges. All five of the participants are currently either a president or vice president in community colleges. This study found nine themes that capture the barriers and facilitators that these Asian American females encountered along their career path. The themes were mother as role model, biculturalism and bicultural efficacy, unplanned pathways and not self-identifying, earned leadership positions, strong work ethic, stereotyping and assumptions, Asian physicality and invisibility, fracturing the glass ceiling, and positive attitude and strength. Future implications for research and practice is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Dr. William Tietz, MSU's ninth president, {{arrived in}} August 1977 just as {{economic}} {{conditions in the}} state were improving. With {{three of the four}} <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies</b> at the university open, Tietz imposed his stamp on the administration almost immediately. This included a strong emphasis on research, faculty development, better teaching, and diversity (particularly for Native Americans, the handicapped, and women). His aggressiveness, energy, and immediate rebudgeting of funds into faculty sabbaticals helped win over professors, who voted against unionization in 1978. Tietz's major goal, increasing research funding, was greatly helped by a 1981 decision of the legislature to refund indirect cost payments back to the university. This led to an immediate 15 percent recovery of in federal funds, and in time private foundation funding rose significantly as well.|$|R
5|$|The PJ held primary {{elections}} for the 1989 presidential elections between Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, and Antonio Cafiero, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Menem won these elections, with Duhalde as candidate for the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> under his ticket, and then won the general elections. Duhalde {{did not like the}} legislative work, and preferred to work with the actual administration of a district. Menem suggested that he run for governor of the populous Buenos Aires Province, which Duhalde accepted on the condition of a great budget aid to the province. This proposal was supported in Congress by Alfonsín, which led to a steady alliance between both politicians. Duhalde was elected governor, ending the political influence of Cafiero.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{frequent}} moves later spawned {{accusations that}} Chester Arthur {{was not a}} native-born citizen of the United States. When Arthur was nominated for vice president in 1880, a New York attorney and political opponent, Arthur P. Hinman, initially speculated that Arthur was born in Ireland and {{did not come to}} the United States until he was fourteen years old. Had that been true, opponents might have argued that Arthur was constitutionally ineligible for the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency</b> under the United States Constitution's natural-born-citizen clause. When Hinman's original story did not take root, he spread a new rumor that Arthur was born in Canada. This claim, too, failed to gain credence.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidency</b> in 2009.

50|$|Born the {{youngest}} of 23 children in Archibald Patch, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, he nonetheless matriculated at the University of Chicago. He became a St. Louis union leader of Warehousemen, when St. Louis was America's fifth largest entrepot because of its situation on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, and a major rail hub. The Warehousemen and Department Store Worker merged into United Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Employees of America, and that local union merged into Teamsters Local 688 in St. Louis. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters was the third of three international trade union <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies</b> he held. He was also {{a vice president of}} the teachers' union and the AF of L. He was a delegate to Democratic National Convention from Missouri in 1952. He was vice-president of the Alliance for Labor Action to promote social concerns and to organize the unorganized. He was a member of the American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP.|$|R
50|$|The December 1991 {{election}} {{was the first}} in which Teamsters members elected the General President by direct secret ballot rather than through delegates hand-picked by local leaders. Other candidates in the election included: R.V. Durham, leader of the Teamsters in North Carolina and generally considered the front-runner in the campaign (he had the backing of a majority of the union's executive board); Walter Shea, a veteran union staffer from Washington, D.C.; and Carey. Although James P. Hoffa, son of disappeared Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa and a long-time Teamsters union attorney, tried to enter the race for president, a federal official ruled that he did not qualify under the union's eligibility rules. Carey and his slate (which included a candidate for secretary-treasurer and 13 <b>vice</b> <b>presidencies)</b> swept the election. Carey won with 48.5 percent of the vote to Durham's 33.2 percent and Shea's 18.3 percent. But turnout was low: Less than half the membership voted, and only 16 percent of the union's total membership voted for Carey. Carey vowed to reduce the general president's salary, end the practice of permitting union officers to draw multiple salaries, no longer endorse Republicans for president, and seek federal legislation mandating universal health care.|$|R
5|$|By {{her second}} {{year on the}} seven member board, she was a {{unanimous}} selection to be second in command as Columbus School Board Vice President. She was unanimously re-elected the following year. In her fourth year of service on the board beginning on January 3, 1995, she lost a 4–3 election for Columbus School Board President when the incumbent, Robert W. Teater, cast a tie-breaking vote for himself. She subsequently declined the <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b> During her fourth year, she unsuccessfully attempted to include a sexual orientation policy in the school district's nondiscrimination policy that would protect homosexuals. She was reelected in 1995. In 1996, she contested Ohio's 16th district seat in the Ohio State Senate with Eugene Watts, but she lost by a 51.80–37.46% margin in a five-way contest.|$|E
5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the <b>Vice</b> <b>Presidency,</b> with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the delegates}} {{turned to the}} <b>vice</b> <b>presidency.</b> Edmund Pettus, {{representing}} Alabama, moved the nomination of William Hayden English, a banker and former representative from Indiana. English, {{a member of the}} Indiana delegation, was fairly unknown to most delegates. He had been a Bayard enthusiast and was known as a successful businessman and hard money supporter; more crucially, he hailed from an important swing state. While Hendricks was a better-known representative of Indiana, Easterners in the party preferred English, who they saw as sounder on the money question. Several states seconded the nomination. John P. Irish of Iowa nominated former governor Richard M. Bishop of Ohio but, after all the other states expressed support for English, the Ohio delegation requested that Bishop's name be withdrawn and English's nomination made unanimous; the motion carried.|$|E
