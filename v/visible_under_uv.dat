40|$|Physic nut {{is one of}} {{potential}} plant which produces biofuel. It is necessary to do an intensive breeding program either conventionally or molecularly based to develop new varieties of physic nut. All this time the physic nut DNA extraction methods always used liquid nitrogen to destroy the plant tissue. Liquid nitrogen is not always available, especially in remote areas. Physic nut has high latex content which makes extraction process more difficult. The {{aim of this study}} was to find the technique of DNA extraction which can give a good result without using liquid nitrogen. This research was conducted in Molecular Biology Laboratory, ICABIOGRAD Bogor from November to Desember 2015. There were five Jatropha species from Thailand which used in this research e. g. Jatropha curcas, Jatropha podagrica, Jatropha gossypifolia, Jatropha multifida, and Baliospermum solanifolium.

40|$|The present {{contribution}} aims {{at creating}} color images printed with fluorescent inks {{that are only}} <b>visible</b> <b>under</b> <b>UV</b> light. The considered fluorescent inks absorb light in the UV wavelength range and reemit part {{of it in the}} visible wavelength range. In contrast to normal color printing which relies on the spectral absorption of light by the inks, at low concentration fluorescent inks behave additively, i. e. their light emission spectra sum up. We first analyze to which extent different fluorescent inks can be superposed. Due to the quenching effect, at high concentrations of the fluorescent molecules, the fluorescent effect diminishes. With an ink-jet printer capable of printing pixels at reduced dot sizes, we reduce the concentration of the individual fluorescent inks and are able to create from the blue, red and greenish-yellow inks the new colorants white and magenta. In order to avoid quenching effects, we propose a color halftoning method relying on diagonally oriented pre-computed screen dots, which are printed side by side. For gamut mapping and color separation, we create a 3 D representation of the fluorescent ink gamut in CIELAB space by predicting halftone fluorescent emission spectra according to the spectral Neugebauer model. Thanks to gamut mapping and juxtaposed halftoning, we create color images, which are invisible under daylight and have, under UV light, a high resemblance with the original images...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{jellyfish}} {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) {{coding sequence}} was used to replace the coat protein (CP) genes in a full-length cDNA clone of CPMV RNA- 2. Transcripts of this construct were replicated {{in the presence of}} RNA- 1 in cowpea protoplasts, and GFP expression could be readily detected by fluorescent microscopy. It was not possible to infect cowpea plants with these transcripts, but combined with a mutant RNA- 2, in which the 48 -kDa movement protein (MP) gene has been deleted infection did occur. With this tripartite virus (CPMV-TRI) green fluorescent spots were <b>visible</b> <b>under</b> <b>UV</b> light on the inoculated leaf after 3 days and a few days later on the higher leaves. These results show that the polyproteins encoded by RNA- 2 do not possess an essential function in the virus infection cycle and that there is, contrary to what we have found so far for the proteins encoded by RNA- 1, no need for a tight regulation of the amounts of MP and CPs produced in a cell. Subsequently, the GFP gene was introduced between the MP and CP genes of RNA- 2 utilizing artificial proteolytic processing sites for the viral proteinase. This CPMV-GFP was highly infectious on cowpea plants and the green fluorescent spots that developed on the inoculated leaves were larger and brighter than those produced by CPMV-TRI described above. When cowpea plants were inoculated with CPMV RNA- 1 and RNA- 2 mutants containing the GFP gene but lacking the CP or MP genes, only single fluorescent epidermal cells were detected between 2 and 6 days postinoculation. This experiment clearly shows that both the capsid proteins and the MP are absolutely required for cell-to-cell movement...|$|E
