5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the General Assembly to pass {{an increase in the}} motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state sales tax from three percent to five percent. Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E
25|$|A {{hot button}} issue {{that seemed to}} {{galvanize}} the public was the <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee increase Davis implemented under provisions of legislation passed by his predecessor which originally reduced the fees. On June 20, 2003 the Davis administration reinstituted the full <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee, and to date the action has withstood legal challenge. The action was a key step in the plan to close the $38 billion shortfall in the 2003–2004 budget. The increase tripled the <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee for the average car owner, and began appearing in renewal notices starting August 1. The California state budget passed in late July 2003 included the projected $4 billion in increased <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee revenue.|$|E

25|$|When Gray Davis was {{recalled}} and Arnold Schwarzenegger {{was elected}} governor in October 2003, Schwarzenegger vowed {{that his first}} act as governor would be to revoke the <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee increase. On November 17, just after his inauguration, Gov. Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order S-1-03, rescinding the <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> fee retroactive to October 1, 2003 when the fee increase went into effect. Analysts predicted that this would add more than $4 billion to the state deficit. Schwarzenegger did not indicate how cities and counties would be reimbursed for the lost revenue they receive from the license fee to support public safety and other local government activities.|$|E

25|$|Helen Barnes died in {{the early}} morning hours of June 1, 1925, in an {{automobile}} accident not far from Woodmont, Connecticut. She and her boyfriend, John Griffin, a junior at Sheffield Scientific School and son of a well-to-do manufacturer from Indiana, were traveling at a high rate of speed when their car struck a slow moving vehicle, careened into another and then rolled over a number of times killing the two almost instantly. Friends of Griffin felt the other driver, who was later cited for driving without a <b>vehicle</b> <b>license,</b> shared some the blame for the tragedy due to his erratic driving. Barnes and Griffin had gone out that morning to dine at an all-night hotdog stand in nearby East Haven. Though there had been no official announcement, Griffin had previously told friends that the two planned to marry.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Bonin {{was arrested}} for {{stealing}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> plates and {{was placed in a}} juvenile detention center for other minor crimes. While housed at this juvenile detention center, he was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by several people, including his adult counselor. Four years later, in 1961, facing the prospect of the foreclosure of their home, Bonin's parents opted to relocate to California. The Bonin family settled in a modest home on Angell Street in the city of Downey; shortly thereafter, Bonin's father died from cirrhosis of the liver. While living at this address, Bonin is known to have molested both his younger brother, and several neighborhood children. Many of these neighborhood children were lured into Bonin's home with the promise of alcohol, and all his known victims were younger than he was. In addition to these acts of molestation, Bonin is known to have committed several acts of robbery, petty theft, and grand theft in his teenage years.|$|E

500|$|A 2005 {{poll found}} that 78% of Americans {{did not know that}} {{residents}} of the District of Columbia have less representation in Congress than residents of the 50 states. Efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, [...] "Taxation Without Representation", on D.C. <b>vehicle</b> <b>license</b> plates. There is evidence of nationwide approval for D.C. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of Americans believe that D.C. should have voting representation in Congress. Despite public support, attempts to grant the District voting representation, including the D.C. statehood movement and the proposed District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment, have been unsuccessful.|$|E
