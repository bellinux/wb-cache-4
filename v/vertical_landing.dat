5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} <b>vertical</b> <b>landing,</b> {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling <b>vertical</b> <b>landing</b> (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E

40|$|The current {{terrestrial}} reference frame, current global GPS {{products and}} current precise GPS processing techniques, limit {{the determination of}} accurate, long-term, vertical station velocities from continuous GPS measurements on a global scale. Several authors have reported biases in their vertical station velocities determined from continuous GPS when compared to alternative geodetic methods. It {{has been argued that}} until these problems have been resolved, the study of relative land and sea level rates on regional scales {{is the only way to}} investigate <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements at tide gauges co-located with continuous GPS. In the UK, we have been operating a network of continuous GPS and absolute gravimetry stations for the purpose of determining <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements at tide gauges for almost ten years.

In this paper, we compare <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements obtained from both geodetic methods with estimates of <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements from high quality, independent geological and geophysical evidence, and derive a GPS-specific bias for which the estimates of <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements from all continuous GPS stations are corrected.

40|$|International audienceIn recent decades, {{geodetic}} {{techniques have}} allowed detecting <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions and sea-level changes {{of a few}} millimetres per year, based on measurements taken at the coast (tide gauges), on board of satellite platforms (satellite altimetry) or both (Global Navigation Satellite System). Here, contemporary <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions are analysed from January 1993 to July 2013 at 849 globally distributed coastal sites. The vertical displacement of the coastal platform due to surface mass changes is modelled using elastic and viscoelastic Green’s functions. Special {{attention is paid to}} the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment induced by past and present-day ice melting. Various rheological and loading parameters are explored to provide a set of scenarios that could explain the coastal observations of <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions globally. In well-instrumented regions, predicted <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions explain more than 80 per cent of the variance observed at scales larger than a few hundred kilometres. Residual <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions show a strong local variability, especially in the vicinity of plate boundaries due to the earthquake cycle. Significant residual signals are also observed at scales of a few hundred kilometres over nine well-instrumented regions forming observation windows on unmodelled geophysical processes. This study highlights the potential of our multitechnique database to detect geodynamical processes, driven by anthropogenic influence, surface mass changes (surface loading and glacial isostatic adjustment) and tectonic activity (including the earthquake cycle, sediment and volcanic loading, as well as regional tectonic constraints). Future improvements should be aimed at densifying the instrumental network and at investigating more thoroughly the uncertainties associated with glacial isostatic adjustment models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, we {{extend the}} {{advanced}} approach of combining tide gauge and satellite altimetry data with supplemental equations from adjacent tide gauge records {{of at least}} 30 years of common data to investigate {{the relative importance of}} the nonclimate contribution of <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movement to the observed rates of sea level change along the coasts of southern Europe. The sensitivity tests proved that the advanced approach is robust and accurate at the submillimeter per year level of around 0. 4 mm yr− 1 in estimating rates of <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements. It enabled identifying stations displaying large rates of <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> movements that {{must be taken into account}} when predicting future sea level rise and appraising the exposure to its impacts on populations and assets. The average rate of coastal climate-related sea level rise in the Mediterranean Sea was consequently revisited to be of 1. 7 mm yr− 1 over the past century, whereas the Atlantic northern Iberian coast revealed a significant high rate of sea level rise in excess of 3. 4 mm yr− 1 for the past 70 years. Future work should consider applying this powerful approach to other geographic contexts as a useful source of supplementary data for geodynamic studies...|$|R

40|$|The Taiwanese {{government}} {{has established a}} complete tide gauge network along the coastline for accurate sea-level monitoring. In this study, we analyze several factors impacting the determination of absolute or geocentric sea-level trends—including ocean tides, inverted barometer effect, datum shift, and <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion—using tide gauge records near Taiwan, from 1993 – 2015. The results show that datum shifts and <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion {{have a significant impact}} on sea-level trends with a respective average contribution of 7. 3 and 8. 0 mm/yr, whereas ocean tides and inverted barometer effects have a relatively minor impact, representing 9 % and 14 % of the observed trend, respectively. These results indicate that datum shifts and <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion effects have to be removed in the tide gauge records for accurate sea-level estimates. Meanwhile, the estimated land motions show that the southwestern plain has larger subsidence rates, for example, the Boziliao, Dongshi, and Wengang tide gauge stations exhibit a rate of 24 – 31 mm/yr as a result of groundwater pumping. We find that the absolute sea-level trends around Taiwan derived from tide gauges or satellite altimetry agree well with each other, and are estimated to be 2. 2 mm/yr for 1993 – 2015, which is significantly slower than the global average sea-level rise trend of 3. 2 mm/yr from satellite altimeters. Finally, a recent hiatus in sea-level rise in this region exhibits good agreement with the interannual and decadal variabilities associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation...|$|R

Global Positioning System (GPS) data reanalyses are mandatory when aiming {{at the highest}} consistency of the estimated products for the whole data period. The University of La Rochelle Consortium (ULR) has carried out several GPS data reanalysis campaigns with an increasing tracking network, an improving processing strategy and the best methodology. The geodetic results from the latest GPS velocity field estimated at ULR (named ULR 5) are presented here. The velocity field includes 326 globally distributed GPS stations, from which 200 are GPS@TG (30 % more than previous studies). The new GPS data processing strategy, the terrestrial frame definition and the velocity estimation procedures are described. The quality of the estimated vertical velocities is empirically assessed through internal and external velocity comparisons, including {{the analysis of the}} time-correlated noise content of the position time series, to be better than 0. 6 mm/yr (2 sigma). The application of this velocity field is illustrated to appraise to what extent <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions contaminate the estimates of satellite altimetry drifts. The impact on the altimeter-derived sea level trends was evaluated to be up to 0. 6 mm/yr. Worldwide TGs were grouped into regions in order to explore long-term spatial sea level variability in the rates of sea level change.

40|$|Sea level {{variation}} {{is one of}} the parameters directly related to climate change. Monitoring sea level rise is an important scientific issue since many populated areas of the world and megacities are located in low-lying regions. At present, sea level is measured by means of two techniques: the tide gauges and the satellite radar altimetry. Tide gauges measure sea-level relatively to a ground benchmark, hence, their measurements are directly affected by vertical ground motions. Satellite radar altimetry measures sea-level relative to a geocentric reference and are not affected by <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motions. In this study, the linear relative sea level trends of 35 tide gauge stations distributed across the Mediterranean Sea have been computed over the period 1993 - 2014. In order to extract the real sea-level variation, the <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion has been estimated using the observations of available GPS stations and removed from the tide gauges records. These GPS-corrected trends have then been compared with satellite altimetry measurements over the same time interval (AVISO data set). A further comparison has been performed, over the period 1993 - 2013, using the CCI satellite altimetry data set which has been generated using an updated modeling. The absolute sea level trends obtained from satellite altimetry and GPS-corrected tide gauge data are mostly consistent, meaning that GPS data have provided reliable corrections for most of the sites. The trend values range between + 2. 5 and + 4 mm/yr almost everywhere in the Mediterranean area, the largest trends were found in the Northern Adriatic Sea and in the Aegean. These results are in agreement with estimates of the global mean sea level rise over the last two decades. Where GPS data were not available, information on the <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion deduced from the differences between absolute and relative trends are in agreement with the results of other studies...|$|R

40|$|Norway’s {{national}} {{sea level}} observing system {{consists of an}} extensive array of tide gauges, permanent GNSS stations, and lines of repeated levelling. Here, we make use of this observation system to calculate relative sea-level rates and rates corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) along the Norwegian coast for three different periods, i. e., 1960 to 2010, 1984 to 2014, and 1993 to 2016. For all periods, the relative sea-level rates show considerable spatial variations that are largely {{due to differences in}} <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion due to GIA. The variation is reduced by applying corrections for <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion and associated gravitational effects on sea level. For 1960 to 2010 and 1984 to 2014, the coastal average GIA-corrected rates for Norway are 2. 0 ± 0. 6 mm/year and 2. 2 ± 0. 6 mm/year, respectively. This is close to the rate of global sea-level rise for the same periods. For the most recent period, 1993 to 2016, the GIA-corrected coastal average is 3. 5 ± 0. 6 mm/year and 3. 2 ± 0. 6 mm/year with and without inverse barometer (IB) corrections, respectively, which is significantly higher than for the two earlier periods. For 1993 to 2016, the coastal average IB-corrected rates show broad agreement with two independent sets of altimetry. This suggests that there is no systematic error in the <b>vertical</b> <b>land</b> motion corrections applied to the tide-gauge data. At the same time, altimetry does not capture the spatial variation identified in the tide-gauge records. This could be an effect of using altimetry observations off the coast instead of directly at each tide gauge. Finally, we note that, owing to natural variability in the climate system, our estimates are highly sensitive to the selected study period. For example, using a 30 -year moving window, we find that the estimated rates may change by up to 1 mm/year when shifting the start epoch by only one year...|$|R
