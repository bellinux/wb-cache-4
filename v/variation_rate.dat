40|$|Background: The {{observation}} of <b>variation</b> in substitution <b>rates</b> among lineages {{has led to}} (1) a general rejection of the molecular clock model, and (2) the suggestion {{that a number of}} biological characteristics of organisms can cause <b>rate</b> <b>variation.</b> Accurate estimates of <b>rate</b> <b>variation,</b> and thus accurate inferences regarding the causes of <b>rate</b> <b>variation,</b> depend on accurate estimates of substitution rates. However, theory suggests that even when the substitution process is clock-like, variable numbers of substitutions can occur among lineages because the substitution process is stochastic. Furthermore, substitution rates along lineages can be misestimated, particularly when multiple substitutions occur at some sites. Although these potential causes of error in rate estimation are well understood in theory, such error has not been examined in detail; consequently, empirical studies that estimate <b>rate</b> <b>variation</b> among lineages have been unable to determine whether their results could be impacted by estimation error. Methodology/Principal Findings: To evaluate the extent to which error in rate estimation could erroneously suggest <b>rate</b> <b>variation</b> among lineages, we examined <b>rate</b> <b>variation</b> estimated for datasets simulated under a molecular clock on trees with equal and variable branch lengths. Thus, any apparent <b>rate</b> <b>variation</b> in these datasets reflects error in rate estimation rather than true differences in the underlying substitution process. We observed substantial <b>rate</b> <b>variation</b> among lineages in our simulations; however, we did not observe <b>rate</b> <b>variation</b> when average substitution rates were compared betwee...|$|R

These two loci are highest sequence <b>variation</b> <b>rate</b> within human genome. This means HLA-DRB1 is rapidly evolving, much more rapidly than almost all other protein encoding loci. Much of the variation at HLA DRB1 occurs at peptide contact positions in the binding groove, as a result many of the alleles alter the way the DR binds peptide ligands and changes the repertoire each receptor can bind.This means that most of the changes are functional in nature, and therefore are under selection. In the HLA region, genes are under heterozygous or balancing selection, although certain alleles appear to be under positive or negative selection, either in the past or present ...|$|E

Recently, {{in a limited}} collection of strains, epidemic serogroup A isolates {{were found to have}} elevated mutation rates that was caused by defects in mismatch repair pathways. To ascertain the role of these mutators in the epidemic spread of this serogroup, the prevalence of hypermutability in a collection of 95 serogroup A N. meningitidis invasive isolates was determined. Overall mutability in Neisseriae can be described by measuring both missense mutation rates as well as phase variation frequencies of “contingency loci. ” Fifty-seven percent of serogroup A isolates possessed elevated mutability, which could be divided into two classes: intermediate and high level. Eleven of 20 high-level mutators, with phase <b>variation</b> <b>rates</b> > 100 -fold higher than wild-type isolates, were defective in mismatch repair.

30|$|This {{provides}} {{an idea of}} the process variation rates. Considering all sensor nodes and sensoring time, for the temperature field, the maximum of this rate is 0.0294 °C/s, and for the humidity field, the maximum is 0.202 %/s. The means of these variation rates are 0.00002 °C/s and 0.00051 %/s, respectively. The humidity signal presents a larger <b>variation</b> <b>rate</b> than the temperature signal, being thus a faster process. As DECA considers the <b>variation</b> <b>rate</b> of the signal, the greater the <b>variation</b> <b>rate,</b> the higher the number of required transmissions. Thus, DECA requires more transmissions for monitoring humidity than for temperature, an inherent feature of the adaptiveness of DECA. This explains the less significant lifetime increase (LI) when monitoring humidity, as shown in Fig. 6. In addition, when using DECA, as the <b>variation</b> <b>rate</b> decreases, nodes tend to sleep for larger time periods. For example, considering δ= 2 %, the means of the inactivity periods over all nodes and times are 3.7118 and 1.1659 s when DECA is applied for monitoring temperature and humidity, respectively; the maximum values of the inactivity periods are 14.6594 and 10.4643 s, respectively. These values show that DECA correctly adapts the sleeping periods of sensor nodes according to the behavior of the physical quantity being monitored.|$|E
