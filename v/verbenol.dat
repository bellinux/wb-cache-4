40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to determine the chemical composition and insecticidal and repellent activities of the Artemisia mongolica essential oil against Lasioderma serricorne and to isolate active constituents from the essential oil. The essential oil of A. mongolica was obtained by hydrodistillation and 36 components were identified with GC-MS. Eucalyptol (39. 88 %), (S) -cis-verbenol (14. 93 %), 4 -terpineol (7. 20 %), (−) -camphor (6. 02 %), and α-terpineol (4. 20 %) {{were found to be}} major components. With a further isolation process, five constituents obtained from the essential oil were identified as eucalyptol, <b>verbenol,</b> 4 -terpineol, camphor, and α-terpineol. In the progress of assay, it showed that L. serricorne adults had different sensitivities to the crude essential oil and isolated constituents. 4 -Terpineol exhibited strongest contact activity against L. serricorne, showing the LD 50 value of 8. 62 [*]μg/adult. Moreover, camphor and α-terpineol showed stronger fumigant activity (LC 50 = 2. 91 and 3. 27 [*]mg/L air, resp.) against L. serricorne than crude essential oil and other constituents. In addition, the essential oil, eucalyptol, <b>verbenol,</b> and α-terpineol showed comparable repellency against L. serricorne adults.

40|$|Terpenes are a {{valuable}} natural resource {{for the production}} of fine chemicals. Turpentine, obtained from biomass and also as a side product of softwood industry, is rich in monoterpenes such as α-pinene and β-pinene, which are widely used as raw materials in the synthesis of flavors, fragrances and pharmaceutical compounds. The rearrangement of their epoxides has been thoroughly studied in recent years, as a method to obtain compounds which are further used in the fine chemical industry. The industrially most desired products of α-pinene oxide isomerization are campholenic aldehyde and trans-carveol. Campholenic aldehyde is an intermediate for the manufacture of sandalwood-like fragrances such as santalol. Trans-carveol is an expensive constituent of the Valencia orange essence oil used in perfume bases and food flavor composition. Furthermore it has been found to exhibit chemoprevention of mammary carcinogenesis. A wide range of iron and ceria supported catalysts were prepared, characterized and tested for α-pinene oxide isomerization in order to selective synthesis of above mentioned products. The highest catalytic activity in the preparation of campholenic aldehyde over iron modified catalysts using toluene as a solvent at 70 °C (total conversion of α-pinene oxide with a selectivity of 66 % to the desired aldehyde) was achieved in the presence of Fe-MCM- 41. Furthermore, Fe-MCM- 41 catalyst was successfully regenerated without deterioration of catalytic activity and selectivity. The most active catalysts in the synthesis of trans-carveol from α-pinene oxide over iron and ceria modified catalysts in N,N-dimethylacetamide as a solvent at 140 °C (total conversion of α-pinene oxide with selectivity 43 % to trans-carveol) were Fe-Beta- 300 and Ce-Si-MCM- 41. These catalysts were further tested for an analogous reaction, namely <b>verbenol</b> oxide isomerization. Verbenone is another natural organic compound which {{can be found in a}} variety of plants or synthesized by allylic oxidation of α-pinene. An interesting product which is synthesized from verbenone is (1 R, 2 R, 6 S) - 3 -methyl- 6 -(prop- 1 -en- 2 -yl) cyclohex- 3 -ene- 1, 2 -diol. It has been discovered that this diol possesses potent anti-Parkinson activity. The most effective way leading to desired diol starts from verbenone and includes three stages: epoxidation of verbenone to verbenone oxide, reduction of verbenone oxide and subsequent isomerization of obtained <b>verbenol</b> oxide, which is analogous to isomerization of α-pinene oxide. In the research focused on the last step of these synthesis, high selectivity (82 %) to desired diol was achieved in the isomerization of <b>verbenol</b> oxide at a conversion level of 96 % in N,N-dimethylacetamide at 140 °C using iron modified zeolite, Fe-Beta- 300. This reaction displayed surprisingly high selectivity, which has not been achieved yet. The possibility of the reuse of heterogeneous catalysts without activity loss was demonstrated...|$|E

Accumulation of (Z) - 3 -hexenyl vicianoside in the exposed plants has adverse {{impacts on the}} performance of the common cutworms. The aglycon of (Z) - 3 -hexenyl vicianoside is derived from airborne (Z) - 3 -hexenol emitted from infested plants. The ability to incorporate and convert (Z) - 3 -hexenol to its corresponding glycoside is widely conserved in an array of plant species. However, the specificity of this ability to discriminate between the chemical structures of different volatile alcohols remains unknown. In this study, we investigated glycosylation of several volatile alcohols in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The exposure of Arabidopsis to a variety of volatile alcohols, (Z) - 2 -pentenol, (Z) - 3 -hexenol, (Z) - 3 -heptenol, (Z) - 3 -octenol, (Z) - 3 -nonenol, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol, <b>verbenol,</b> perillyl alcohol, myrtenol, geraniol, or linalool led to the detection of the putative corresponding glucosides.

40|$|Scope GABAA receptors are {{modulated}} by Sideritis extracts. The aim of {{this study}} was to identify single substances from Sideritis extracts responsible for GABAA receptor modulation. Methods and results Single volatile substances identified by GC have been tested in two expression systems, Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney cells. Some of these substances, especially carvacrol, were highly potent on GABAA receptors composed of α 1 β 2 and α 1 β 2 γ 2 subunits. All effects measured were independent from the presence of the γ 2 subunit. As Sideritis extracts contain a high amount of terpenes, 13 terpenes with similar structure elements were tested in the same way. Following a prescreening on α 1 β 2 GABAA receptors, a high-throughput method was used for identification of the most effective terpenoid substances on GABA-affinity of α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptors expressed in transfected cell lines. Isopulegol, pinocarveol, <b>verbenol,</b> and myrtenol were the most potent modifiers of GABAA receptor function. Conclusion Comparing the chemical structures, the action of terpenes on GABAA receptors is most probably due to the presence of hydroxyl groups and a bicyclic character of the substances tested.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the substrate selectivity of active site mutants of the monooxygenase cytochrome P 450 cam. A range of mutants was constructed which replaced the phenolic side-chain at the Tyr- 96 position by various hydrophobic amino acid residues. These 'hydrophobic mutants' were then combined with other mutations around the active site (Val- 247, Phe- 87, Ile- 395 and Phe- 193) which altered the space available at different positions in the active site. These mutants were then tested with an in vitro reconstituted P 450 cam system with a range of substrates related to diphenylmethane and phenylcylcohexane. All of these large compounds were poor substrates for the wild-type enzyme. It was found that it was necessary to increase both the space available in the active site and the active site hydrophobicity to achieve substrate turnover. The substrates were oxidised preferentially on the aliphatic cyclohexyl ring over the more constrained phenyl ring suggesting that the active site is predisposed to binding the cyclohexyl ring close to the haem. Hydroxylation using the in vitro reconstituted P 450 cam system is limited by catalyst lifetime and the need for the expensive cofactor NADH. For P 450 cam hydroxylation to become a viable synthetic method it is necessary to find ways to bypass the use of NADH. For this reason various self-sufficient P 450 cam system were constructed and expressed in E. coli. The best of these, despite limited protein expression, was found to turnover camphor with the wild-type P 450 cam enzyme and other substrates with the Y 96 A mutant. The in vivo catalytic system was then used to screen many P 450 cam mutants for the oxidation of natural products, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (e. g. limonene, pinene and valencene). Most of the target substrates are not oxidised by the wild-type enzyme but all are hydroxylated by some if not all of the P 450 cam mutants with different degrees of selectivity. Some of the products identified so far are important compounds in the field of flavour and fragrance chemistry (e. g. <b>verbenol</b> and nookatone). </p...|$|E
40|$|The blue {{pine wood borer}} (Phaenops cyanea) and {{the black}} pine sawyer beetle (Monochamus galloprovincialis) (Fig. 1) both are pests of the white pine (Pinus silvestris) and other Pinus species. Both insects have nearly the same demands {{regarding}} their breeding site. Larval development requires a fresh, unwilted inner bark. An infestation occurs on freshly cut trees or on trees suffering from stress (e. g. after dry seasons, loss of needles caused by feeding caterpillars or damage by forest fires). Phaenops cyanea detects susceptible pines by their volatile emissions (SCHÜTZ et al. 2004) {{and is able to}} infest the trees already at a low stress level. During feeding the larvae avoid the resin ducts of the tree and thus evade the oleoresin defence. The beetle is endemic in Europe and – under favourable climatic conditions – can cause substantial damage to pine forests. It is the most significant bark-breeding beetle of white pine in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany. Monochamus galloprovincialis is found in Europe and northern Africa. The larvae tend to a more copious feeding which makes them more susceptible to the oleoresin defence of the tree. Thus, M. galloprovincialis prefers trees that are weakened by a higher degree of stress. The economic damage caused by feeding of thebeetle is low. However, the beetle has gained a special attention of forest scientists because of its association with the nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus which is causing the pine wilt disease (PWD) in Pinus. The only outbreak of the PWD within Europe is limited to an area of 258. 000 ha in Portugal. (MOTA et al. 1999). Die Forstschädlinge Phaenops cyanea (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) und Monochamus galloprovincialis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) befallen beide Kiefern (Pinus sylvestris), die geschwächt sind, z. B. durch Wasser-Stress. Die Larven von P. cyanea entwickeln sich in oder unter der Rinde, während Larven von M. galloprovincialis nach einem Fraß im Kambium des befallenen Baumes auch tief in das Holz eindringen. P. cyanea befällt bereits Bäume, die nur einem geringen Stress ausgesetzt waren, während M. galloprovincialis Bäume bevorzugt, die erheblich geschwächt oder bereits tot sind. Die vorliegende Studie soll anhand elektrophysiologischer Experimente untersuchen, welchen olfaktorischen Hinweisen die beiden Insekten bei ihrer Suche nach einem geeigneten Eiablageplatz folgen. Duftstoffe von Pinus sylvestris wurden auf Aktivkohle gesammelt und mit Gaschromatographie, Massenspektroskopie und Elektroantennographie untersucht (GC-MS/ EAD). Die stärksten Signale von P. cyanea traten im Retentionsindex-Bereich von 936 (&# 945;-Pinen) bis 1200 auf, wobei insbesondere bizyklische Terpene und Terpenoide wie &# 945;-Pinen, &# 946;-Pinen, 1, 8 -Cineol und trans- <b>Verbenol</b> detektiert wurden. M. galloprovincialis reagierte auf einen weiteren Bereich von Stoffen, ebenfalls beginnend mit &# 945;-Pinen, bis hin zu Stoffen mit einem Retentionsindex von ca. 1300.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{dissertation}} {{the possibilities of}} aggregation of antagonists of bark beetles using allochthonous kairomones were to be analysed. The focus of the analysis was the species of European red-bellied clerids (Thanasimus spp.) in forests of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and common spruce (Picea abies). Differences in trap efficiency have been analysed using the normal THEYSOHN® - slit trap and those with closed lids filled with a catching liquid. It transpired that significantly more target organisms have been locked in with the closed trap system than with the customary model. As potential attractants for European red-bellied clerids (Thanasimus spp.) standard attractants such as Pheroprax®, Sexowit®, Cembräwit®, Acuwit®, Tomowit® as well as Chalcoprax® have been tested. Furthermore the aggregate effect of individual semiochemicals, which form part of the above attractants, have been analysed in relation to European red-bellied clerids and bark beetles {{which appeared in the}} habitat. The effect of an increase of the emission rate of the attractant onto the target organisms was also part of the analysis. In addition to trials with attractants in THEYSOHN®-slit traps trials with attractants on stems of pine wood and spruce wood have also been conducted and analysed. This was to clarify whether one could aggregate that many antagonists of bark beetles that the stem does not at all or gets less populated with bark beetles. In the course of this analysis it has been attempted to identify further antagonists of bark beetles that could be aggregated with attractants. It was determined that there are important differences in levels of aggregation between the species of Thanasimus formicarius, Thanasimus rufipes and Thanasimus pectoralis with respect to the substances tested. Thanasimus formicarius has been observed in spring and early summer in pine and spruce forests. The concentration of activity of this species was higher in pine forests than in spruce forests. With respect to the tested attractants Thanasimus formicarius showed a stronger preference for Ipsdienol and Ipsenol as for (S) -cis-Verbenol in each case in connection with 2 - 3 - 2 -Methylbutenol. It is also possible to replace 2 - 3 - 2 -Methylbutenol with other substances. The substances of Sexowit® and Acuwit® ((+) -Ipsdienol, (-) -Ipsenol, α- and β-Pinen, 2 -Phenylethanol or rather Ethanol) also seem to have a strong attraction for the Thanasimus formicarius. Thanasimus rufipes and Thanasimus pectoralis mainly appeared from early summer into the late summer and were respectively recorded in the traps. Both species, in comparison to the Thanasimus formicarius, showed a much stronger preference to (S) -cis- <b>Verbenol,</b> respectively attractant mixtures which contained (S) -cis-Verbenol. Thanasimus rufipes has mainly been detected in pine forests and Thanasimus pectoralis in spruce forests. In pine forests Pheroprax® could be confirmed as an effective allochthonous kairomone. In spruce forests, until the completion of this analysis, no definitive attractant could be identified which aggregats European red-bellied clerids (Thanasimus spp.) on the object to be protected without attracting bark beetles (namely Ips typographus) ...|$|E
40|$|Oxygenated {{derivatives}} of the monoterpene (+) -alpha-pinene {{are found}} in plant essential oils and used as fragrances and flavorings. (+) -alpha-Pinene is structurally related to (+) -camphor, the natural substrate of the heme monooxygenase cytochrome P 450 (cam) from Pseudomonas putida. The aim of the present work was to apply the current understanding of P 450 substrate binding and catalysis to engineer P 450 (cam) for the selective oxidation of (+) -alpha-pinene. Consideration of the structures of (+) -camphor and (+) -alpha-pinene lead to active-site mutants containing combinations of the Y 96 F, F 87 A, F 87 L, F 87 W, and V 247 L mutations. All mutants showed greatly enhanced binding and rate of oxidation of (+) -alpha-pinene. Some mutants had tighter (+) -alpha-pinene binding than camphor binding by the wild-type. The most active was the Y 96 F/V 247 L mutant, with a (+) -alpha-pinene oxidation rate of 270 nmol (nmol of P 450 (cam)) (-) (1) min(-) (1), which was 70 % of the rate of camphor oxidation by wild-type P 450 (cam). Camphor is oxidized by wild-type P 450 (cam) exclusively to 5 -exo-hydroxycamphor. If the gem dimethyl groups of (+) -alpha-pinene occupied similar positions to those found for camphor in the wild-type structure, (+) -cis-verbenol would be the dominant product. All P 450 (cam) enzymes studied gave (+) -cis-verbenol as the major product but with much reduced selectivity compared to camphor oxidation by the wild-type. (+) -Verbenone, (+) -myrtenol, and the (+) -alpha-pinene epoxides were among the minor products. The crystal structure of the Y 96 F/F 87 W/V 247 L mutant, the most selective of the P 450 (cam) mutants initially examined, was determined to provide further insight into P 450 (cam) substrate binding and catalysis. (+) -alpha-Pinene was bound in two orientations which were related by rotation of the molecule. One orientation {{was similar to that}} of camphor in the wild-type enzyme while the other was significantly different. Analysis of the enzyme/substrate contacts suggested rationalizations of the product distribution. In particular competition rather than cooperativity between the F 87 W and V 247 L mutations and substrate movement during catalysis were proposed to be major factors. The crystal structure lead to the introduction of the L 244 A mutation to increase the selectivity of pinene oxidation by further biasing the binding orientation toward that of camphor in the wild-type structure. The F 87 W/Y 96 F/L 244 A mutant gave 86 % (+) -cis-verbenol and 5 % (+) -verbenone. The Y 96 F/L 244 A/V 247 L mutant gave 55 % (+) -cis-verbenol but interestingly also 32 % (+) -verbenone, suggesting that {{it may be possible to}} engineer a P 450 (cam) mutant that could oxidize (+) -alpha-pinene directly to (+) -verbenone. <b>Verbenol,</b> verbenone, and myrtenol are naturally occurring plant fragrance and flavorings. The preparation of these compounds by selective enzymatic oxidation of (+) -alpha-pinene, which is readily available in large quantities, could have applications in synthesis. The results also show that the protein engineering of P 450 (cam) for high selectivity of substrate oxidation is more difficult than achieving high substrate turnover rates because of the subtle and dynamic nature of enzyme-substrate interactions...|$|E
40|$|Enzymes are {{becoming}} an effective tool in industrial processes, from crude {{applications such as}} bioremediation to fine processes such as chirally selective biocatalysis. The ligninolytic enzymes have recently received considerable attention for industrial application due to both their broad substrate range {{and their ability to}} degrade the most recalcitrant natural polymer, lignin. This group of enzymes was therefore identified as the target group for this study. Improved enzyme properties are constantly being sought to enhance the range of applications for enzymes. Biodiversity provides a wide variety of enzymes. Several researchers have concentrated on extremophiles as their primary source of superior enzymes, consequently neglecting temperate environments in their search for these enzymes. The relatively neglected fungal biodiversity of South Africa provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that potentially important industrial enzymes with unusual properties could be isolated from mesophilic basidiomycetous fungi. Subsequent screening of Eastern Cape biodiversity for thermostable ligninolytic enzymes from basidiomycetes resulted in the isolation of a novel laccase enzyme from a basidiomycetous species. This fungus was identified as Peniophora sp. UD 4 by phylogenetic analysis of rDNA ITS sequences. Initial studies indicated a superior optimum temperature of 70 °C and thermostability, indicated by no loss in activity at 60 °C over nine hours. Further characterization of the laccase revealed a broader than usual substrate range through its unusual ability to oxidatively couple DMAB and MBTH. The laccase also exhibited a broad pH oxidation range for ABTS (pH 2 – 6. 8), and a relatively high affinity (K_m_ = 0. 0123 mM) and catalytic efficiency (63 252 mM^(- 1) ^s^(- 1) ^) for ABTS as a substrate. The laccase activity from Peniophora sp. UD 4 was shown to be comprised of three isozymes with a molecular weight of 62 kDa and pI’s of 6. 33, 6. 45 and 6. 50. Investigation of the nutrient and physical factors affecting ligninolytic enzyme production and growth of Peniophora sp. UD 4 indicated that the wild-type organism was unsuitable for large scale production of the thermostable laccase due to the low levels of laccase production. The thermostable laccase was applied to defouling of ultrafiltration membranes, bioremediation of industrial waste streams, biocatalysis, and biosensor technology as potential applications. Application of the Peniophora sp. UD 4 laccase to defouling of membranes used for ultrafiltration of brown water showed large flux recoveries of 31, 21 and 21 % after the first three defouling recycles respectively, compared to 3 % for the control without immobilized enzyme. The novel laccase showed potential for the bioremediation of industrial waste streams, the most successful being that of bleach plant effluent, where a reduction of 66 % of the phenolic load was achieved. Application of the novel laccase to biocatalytic oxidation of ferulic acid and (±) -α-pinene showed higher product yield as compared to oxidation of these compounds by Trametes versicolor laccase in mediated and non-mediated systems. The major products of (±) -α-pinene oxidation were identified as <b>verbenol</b> and trans-sorberol. The Peniophora sp. UD 4 laccase was successfully applied to biosensor technology, which benchmarked significantly better than Trametes versicolor laccase for the detection of 4 -chlorophenol. The biosensor developed with laccase from UD 4 by covalent binding to a glassy carbon electrode exhibited the best combination of sensitivity and stability. This thesis shows that a laccase with superior properties was obtained from a mesophilic South African basidiomycete. The catalytic properties displayed by the novel laccase from Peniophora sp. UD 4 all contribute to the increased industrial applicability of laccases, and may be the most industrially feasible enzyme of its class isolated to date...|$|E
