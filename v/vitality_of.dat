5|$|During {{religious}} ceremonies, many adherents {{choose to}} wear clothing that imitates the styles of dress worn in Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe. They also often wear symbols indicating their religious allegiance. The {{most commonly used}} sign among Heathens is Mjölnir, or Thor's hammer, which is worn as a pendant, featured in Heathen art, and used as a gesture in ritual. It is sometimes used to express a particular affinity with the god Thor, although is also often used {{as a symbol of}} Heathenism as a whole, in particular representing the resilience and <b>vitality</b> <b>of</b> the religion. Another commonly used Heathen symbol is the valknut, used to represent the god Odin or Woden.|$|E

Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of managing design {{to achieve a}} business objective was first documented in 1907. The Deutscher Werkbund (German Work Federation) was established in Munich by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques. A German designer and architect, Peter Behrens, created the entire corporate identity (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG), and {{is regarded as the}} first industrial designer in history.

5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the <b>vitality</b> <b>of</b> her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, but the book displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) {{split the}} empire into {{separately}} administered {{eastern and western}} halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other. In 330, {{after a period of}} civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common {{in the middle of the}} 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the <b>vitality</b> <b>of</b> the smaller towns. Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries.|$|E

5|$|In Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Kain is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} human noble. In the game's prologue, he is murdered by assassins, and resurrected as a vampire by Mortanius, a necromancer. He is promised both vengeance and a cure to his vampirism if he can restore the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, edifices whose state dictates the <b>vitality</b> <b>of</b> the world; the nine guardians who symbiotically represent the Pillars were corrupted prior to his birth, and must be killed before the land can recover. During his quest, he meets the ancient vampire Vorador, who influences him to forsake his former humanity and accept his vampirism, and discovers the Soul Reaver, a legendary soul-devouring sword. Using the Reaver, he tries to alter the course of Nosgoth's history to prevent the Nemesis—a tyrant king—from coming to power. Tricked by Moebius, the guardian of time, Kain succeeds in destroying the Nemesis, but the temporal paradox this triggers results in a new timeline in which vampires have been hunted to extinction; Kain is left the last surviving vampire in Nosgoth. After systematically tracking down and killing most of the guardians, he confronts Mortanius—revealed as the guardian of death, and the orchestrator of Kain's assassination—and realizes that he himself is the final guardian, and that the cure to his curse entails his own destruction. Faced with the obligation of self-sacrifice—thereby restoring the world, but ensuring the annihilation of the vampire race—or the alternative of destroying the Pillars to rule over the world in its miasmatic state, Kain opts for the latter choice, embracing vampirism as a blessing as the Pillars collapse.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results <b>of</b> {{evaluation}} <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> structure <b>of</b> ontogenetic subcenopopulations of juvenile and immature (im 1 and im 2) plants Quercus robur L. in seven aggregations of forest vegetation of Krolevets-Hlukhiv Geobotanical Region. It is found that ontogenetic subcenopopulations of Q. robur young generation, formed under canopy of deciduous forests of the region under study, are noted for high level <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> structure diversity and for having three qualitative types: blooming, balanced and depressive ones. It is observed that dynamics of Q quality index values in ontogenetic subcenopopulations Q. robur in the aggregations under study fits three variants of changes. In the first one we can see stable decrease of Q quality index values in the line j → im 1 → im 2. Three of seven aggregations under study have dynamics of Q index values fitting the variant where increase of values {{takes place in the}} phase j → im 1, and their decrease occurs in the phase im 1 → im 2. Q index values also decrease in the phase j → im 1 and their increase in the phase im 1 → im 2 is established in three more phytocenoces. It is proved that change to every next phase of development (from j to im 1, and also from im 1 to im 2) is accompanied by the appearance <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> plasticity in Q. robur young generation (i. e. Q quality index value changes) and <b>vitality</b> variability (changes <b>of</b> share of individuals <b>of</b> various <b>vitality</b> classes), respectively. Quantitative as well as qualitative aspects <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> plasticity realization are evaluated based on the original factor – index <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> dynamics – IVD. It is found that at the initial stages of ontogenetic development negative changes <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> structure in Q. robur happen more often then positive ones. Decrease in the individuals’ <b>vitality</b> and worsening <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> structure are mainly accompanied by the reduction of cohort quality status. Ascertained facts as for <b>vitality</b> structure <b>of</b> ontogenetic subcenopopulations of juvenile and immature (im 1 and im 2) plants fairly prove the complicated nature of formation of continuous flow of Q. robur generations in phytocenoses with the appearance of this species and assurance of stable and lasting existence of its cenopopulations, respectively. From the peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>vitality</b> structure and its dynamics, we assume that considerable transformation of species composition of forest stands as a result of Q. robur reduction in their composition may happen in forests Tilieto (cordatae) –Acereto (platanoiditis) –Quercetum (roboris) stellariosum (holosteae) and Quercetum (roboris) acereto (tatarici) –urticosum (dioicae) in the studied region in future...|$|R
