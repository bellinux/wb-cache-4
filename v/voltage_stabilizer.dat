40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{physico-chemical properties}} of seven benzil-type <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are reported. The benzil core is substituted with alkyl chains of different length that {{are linked to}} the benzil core via an ester, ether, or tertiary amine group. All additives can be melt-processed with low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirms that benzil compounds are not affected by the LDPE cross-linking reaction induced by dicumyl peroxide. Moreover, a combination of gel content measurements, thermal analysis, and small-angle X-ray scattering indicates that the presence of benzil <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizers</b> does not significantly alter the microstructure of cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE). Electrical tree inhibition experiments under high-voltage alternating current conditions show that all investigated additives substantially enhance the dielectric strength of the insulating material at a concentration of only 10 mmol kg− 1.

40|$|<b>Voltage</b> <b>stabilizers</b> are an {{emerging}} class of additives that enhance the dielectric strength of an insulating polymer such as polyethylene. Several partially conflicting reports ascribe the stabilizing effect {{to either a}} high electron affinity or low ionization potential of the additive. Here, we report a clear correlation of the electron affinity {{and to a lesser}} extent the EHOMO–ELUMO difference of various <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizers</b> with electrical tree initiation in cross-linked polyethylene. To facilitate a fair evaluation, the voltage-stabilizing efficiency of a set of 13 previously reported <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> which strongly differ in their chemical composition, is compared at equal stabilizer concentration and equivalent test methodology. These results are correlated with the electron affinity and EHOMO–ELUMO difference, as obtained from density functional theory (DFT) modeling, which agreed well with available literature values. Moreover, based on the here established strong correlation between dielectric strength and electron affinity, a new molecule with exceptionally high electron affinity is selected from the extended literature on organic photovoltaics. This malononitrile–benzothiadiazole–triarylamine based molecule with a high electron affinity of 3. 4 eV gives rise to a 148 % increase in tree initiation field compared to 40 % obtained using anthracene, one of the most efficient previously reported voltage-stabilizers, under equivalent test conditions. Thus, we here propose to use the electron affinity as a guiding criterion for identifying novel high-efficiency <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> which opens up the vast library of organic semiconductors as potential candidates, as well as associated synthesis routines for the design of yet unexplored materials...|$|R

50|$|In this bipolar {{junction}} transistor (BJT) implementation (Figure 4) of the general idea above, a Zener <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizer</b> (R1 and DZ1) drives an emitter follower (Q1) loaded by a constant emitter resistor (R2) sensing the load current. The external (floating) load of this current source {{is connected to the}} collector so that almost the same current flows through it and the emitter resistor (they {{can be thought of as}} connected in series). The transistor, Q1, adjusts the output (collector) current so as to keep the voltage drop across the constant emitter resistor, R2, almost equal to the relatively constant voltage drop across the Zener diode, DZ1. As a result, the output current is almost constant even if the load resistance and/or voltage vary. The operation of the circuit is considered in details below.|$|E
50|$|A {{conventional}} solid-state diode allows significant current {{if it is}} reverse-biased {{above its}} reverse breakdown voltage. When the reverse bias breakdown voltage is exceeded, a conventional diode is subject to high current due to avalanche breakdown. Unless this current is limited by circuitry, the diode may be permanently damaged due to overheating. A Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except the device is specially designed so as to have a reduced breakdown voltage, the so-called Zener voltage. By contrast with the conventional device, a reverse-biased Zener diode exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows the current to keep the voltage across the Zener diode close to the Zener breakdown voltage. For example, a diode with a Zener breakdown voltage of 3.2 V exhibits a voltage drop of very nearly 3.2 V across {{a wide range of}} reverse currents. The Zener diode is therefore ideal for applications such as the generation of a reference voltage (e.g. for an amplifier stage), or as a <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizer</b> for low-current applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Inrush {{currents}} {{generated by}} unloaded power transformer often reduce power quality on the system. To improve this situation, this paper proposes an active inrush current compensator that {{is capable of}} reducing the inrush current effectively during startup mode. The proposed compensator is based on an inverter-based series compensator which is comprised of a single-phase inverter and series transformer. Voltage sags are very frequent events with energization of transformer or starting of large motors although their duration is very short. Hence, during <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizer</b> mode, the existing series compensator is controlled by a <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizer</b> controller and superimposes a compensating voltage on the inverter output whenever the load voltage deviate from the nominal value. This strategy is easier to implement because it requires no information of the transformer parameters, power on angle of circuit breaker and measurement of residual flux. Some simulations results show satisfactory performance of the proposed technique on both inrush current reduction and correcting voltage sags.

40|$|Electrical treeing {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{degradation}} mechanisms in polymer dielectrics at highly divergent electric fields and can, if initiated, cause dielectric breakdown as soon as an electrical tree channel has bridged the insulation. One way of increasing resistance to electrical treeing is the addition of certain organic additives such as polycyclic aromatic compounds or benzophenone-like structures. These additives act as voltage stabilizers that are believed to capture high energy electrons and dissipate their energy, preventing degradation of the polymer matrix by the impact of “hot electrons”. In this study, a benzil type compound is evaluated as <b>voltage</b> <b>stabilizer</b> in a superclean cross-linked polyethylene compound used for high voltage cable applications. The stabilizing effect of the additives is measured using test objects of wire-plane electrode geometry in ramped AC voltage experiments.
