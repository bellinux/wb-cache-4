Avery Patent #4.392.785, 1983 and Elmo G. Harris Patent #617.877, 1899). Control systems of the <b>variable</b> <b>stroke</b> wind pumps were mechanical and hydraulic; however, those experiments did not {{attract the attention of}} any windpump manufacturer.

The overall design of the positioning stage consists of a mobile and a fixed part separated using a four-point contact technique. The uniqueness of the proposed positioning stage lies in its light design with the ability to perform <b>variable</b> <b>strokes</b> at short (< 100 μm) and long range (millimeter level) with preembedded auto guidance feature. The analytical modeling and experiment have been realized. The open- and closed-loop performance of positioning stage in linear and nonlinear trajectories have been tested and good agreement is observed between experimental and analytical results. The positioning stage is able to perform <b>variable</b> <b>strokes</b> up till 2 mm in the xy plane. In closed loop, the maximum precision errors in short and long strokes are found to be 0. 031 and 0. 451 μm, respectively. The maximum travel speed is 12 mm/s in open loop...|$|R

50|$|The first simple fixed-stroke {{hydraulic}} motors had the disadvantage {{that they used}} the same volume of water whatever the load and so were wasteful at part-power. Unlike steam engines, as water is incompressible, {{they could not be}} throttled or their valve cut-off controlled. To overcome this, motors with <b>variable</b> <b>stroke</b> were developed. Adjusting the stroke, rather than controlling admission valves, now controlled the engine power and water consumption. One of the first of these was Arthur Rigg's patent engine of 1886. This used a double eccentric mechanism, as used on <b>variable</b> <b>stroke</b> power presses, to control the stroke length of a three cylinder radial engine. Later, the swashplate engine with an adjustable swashplate angle would become a popular way to make <b>variable</b> <b>stroke</b> {{hydraulic motors}}.|$|E

It has not been tested whether other non-age variables influence care decisions made by allied health professionals. This paper explores demographic and stroke-related variables that are putatively associated {{with the quality of}} care provided to acute stroke patients by allied health professionals. Methods: Data were retrospectively audited from 300 acute stroke patient records regarding allied health care. Compliance with each of 20 indicators of allied health care quality was established. The influence of various demographic and stroke-related variables on each performance indicator was examined. We undertook a series of analyses using univariate logistic regression models to establish the influence of these variables on care quality. Results: Patient age had a significant correlation with only one process indicator (early mobilization). Seven <b>variables,</b> including <b>stroke</b> severity and level of dependence, were associated with patient age. The majority of these age proxies had significant associations with process indicator compliance. Correlations between non-age <b>variables,</b> in particular <b>stroke</b> severity and comorbidity, suggest the potential for complex confounding relationships between non-age variables and quality of allied health care. Conclusion: Compliance with individual indicators of allied health care was significantly associated with variables other than patient age, and included stroke severity, previous independence, comorbidities, day of admission, stroke unit admission, and length of stay. The inter-relationships between these non-age variables suggest that their influence on quality of care is complex.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to develop a {{structural}} equation modeling (i. e., path-flow analysis model) for active drag force based on anthropometric, hydrodynamic and biomechanical variables in young swimmers. The theoretical model was developed according to main review papers about these determinants. Sixteen male swimmers (12. 50 ± 0. 51 years-old; Tanner stages’ 1 - 2) were evaluated. It was assessed: (i) anthropometrical variables such as body mass, height, frontal surface area; (ii) hydrodynamic variables including drag coefficient and active drag with the velocity perturbation method; (iii) the biomechanical <b>variables</b> <b>stroke</b> length, stroke frequency and swimming velocity after a maximal 25 -m bout. Path-flow analysis was performed with the estimation of linear regression standardized coefficients between exogenous and endogenous variables. To verify the model fit, root mean square residual was computed. The active drag presented significant association with all exogenous <b>variables,</b> except for <b>stroke</b> length and stroke frequency. Confirmatory model excluded the frontal surface area (RMSR > 0. 1). Even so, 95 % of active drag was explained by remaining variables in the model. Confirmatory path-flow model can be considered as not suitable of the theory. In order to increase the model fit, in a near future it is advice to develop new frontal surface area estimation equations specific for young swimmers rather than using models developed with adult/elite swimmers...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{tried to}} {{determine}} the association between left atrial (LA) fibrosis, detected using delayed-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI), and the CHADS 2 score (point system based on individual clinical risk factors including congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, and prior <b>stroke)</b> <b>variables,</b> specifically <b>stroke.</b> BackgroundIn patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), conventional markers for the risk of stroke base their higher predictive effect on clinical features, particularly previous stroke history, and not individual LA pathophysiological properties. We aimed {{to determine the}} association between LA fibrosis, detected using DE-MRI, and the CHADS 2 score <b>variables,</b> specifically <b>stroke.</b> MethodsPatients with AF who presented to the AF clinic and received a DE-MRI of the LA were evaluated. Their risk factor profiles, including a CHADS 2 score, were catalogued. The degree of LA fibrosis was determined {{as a percentage of}} the LA area. Any history of previous strokes, warfarin use, or cerebrovascular disease was recorded. ResultsA total of 387 patients, having a mean age of 65 ± 12 years, 36. 8 % female, were included in this study. A history of previous stroke was present in 36 (9. 3 %) patients. Those patients with previous strokes had a significantly higher percentage of LA fibrosis (24. 4 ± 12. 4 % vs. 16. 2 ± 9. 9 %, p < 0. 01). A larger amount of LA fibrosis was also seen in those patients with a higher CHADS 2 score (≥ 2 : 18. 7 ± 11. 4 vs. < 2 : 14. 7 ± 9. 2, p < 0. 01). A logistic regression analysis of all <b>variables</b> except <b>strokes</b> (CHAD score) demonstrated that LA fibrosis independently predicted cerebrovascular events (p = 0. 002) and significantly increased the predictive performance of the score (area under the curve = 0. 77). ConclusionsOur preliminary, multicenter results suggest DE-MRI–based detection of LA fibrosis is independently associated with prior history of strokes. We propose that the amount of DE-MRI–determined LA fibrosis could represent a marker for stroke and a possible therapeutic target with potential applicability for clinical treatment for patients with AF...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze the effect of an ankle-foot {{orthosis}} on gait variables (velocity and cadence) of stroke patients. To do this, a systematic review was conducted of four databases. [Subjects and Methods] The papers identified were evaluated based on the following inclusion criteria: 1) design: controlled, clinical trial; 2) population: stroke patients; 3) intervention: analysis of spatiotemporal variables of gait with an ankle-foot orthosis; 4) control group with different intervention or no intervention; and 5) outcome: improvement in gait velocity or cadence. [Results] Thirteen controlled trials addressing the effect of an ankle-foot orthosis on gait <b>variables</b> of <b>stroke</b> patients were found. They exhibited methodological quality of 3 or more points on the PEDro scale. [Conclusion] While the findings suggest the benefits of an AFO regarding gait velocity, the impact of this type of orthosis on cadence remains inconclusive.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Data {{about the}} {{distribution}} of stroke severity and its correlates are sparse. In a population-based approach, we determined the NIH Stroke Scale Score (NIHSSS) and studied associations with demographic <b>variables,</b> <b>stroke</b> unit care, etiology, the onset assessment interval (OAI), {{and the rate of}} thrombolysis. METHODS: We performed a databank-based post-hoc analysis of data ascertained during the prospective, population-based stroke study among the 188, 015 permanent residents of Basel City, Switzerland. RESULTS: In 246 / 269 (91. 4 %) patients, NIHSSS was available. The median NIHSSS was 5. 0 +/- 6. 0. NIHSSS 0 - 6, 7 - 15, and 0. 001), shorter OAI (p = 0. 009), and thrombolytic therapy (p > 0. 001). In multivariate regression analyses, age, OAI, and thrombolysis correlated independently with higher NIHSSS. Stroke unit patients differed from non-stroke unit patients in shorter OAI, younger age, and higher NIHSSS. CONCLUSION: In a geographically defined stroke population, 1 / 3 patients had moderate-to-severe stroke. Patients with less severe strokes were younger, sought medical attention later and were less likely to receive thrombolysis. Thus, public stroke awareness programs might consider targeting also younger individuals and stress that also mild-to-moderate strokes benefit from emergency medical care...|$|R

However, lot of work is needed to reduce the diesel exhaust emissions and give the way for full utilization of the diesel fuels excellent characteristics. This paper presents a theoretical study on the effect of <b>variable</b> <b>stroke</b> length technique on the emissions of a four-stroke, water-cooled direct injections diesel engine with the help of experimentally verified computer software designed mainly for diesel engines. The emission levels were studied over the speed range (1000 rpm to 3000 rpm) and stroke lengths (120 mm to 200 rpm) and were compared with those of the original engine design. The simulation results clearly indicate the advantages and utility of <b>variable</b> <b>stroke</b> technique in the reduction of the exhaust emission levels. A reduction of about 10 % to 75 % was achieved for specific particulate matter over the entire speed range and bore-to-stroke ratio studied. Further, a reduction of about 10 % to 59 % was achieved for the same range. As for carbon dioxide, a reduction of 0 % to 37 % was achieved. On the other hand, a less percent change was achieved for the case of nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides as indicated by the results.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{prevalence}} of Q-T prolongation in patients with liver cirrhosis and the modifications of the Q-T interval after liver transplantation. Q-T interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) and dispersion of Q-T interval were evaluated in 75 cirrhotic patients and in 24 controls {{by means of a}} 12 -lead electrocardiogram. In addition, 15 patients were evaluated before and after liver transplantation. Forty-five patients (60 %) had a prolonged Q-Tc. Compared with controls, both patients with alcoholic and non alcoholic cirrhosis had increased Q-Tc (414 +/- 28 msec 1 / 2, 463 +/- 31 and 444 +/- 32 respectively; p < 0. 001 and < 0. 001); Q-Tc was significantly higher in alcoholic than in non-alcoholic cirrhosis (p < 0. 02). Q-T dispersion was normal in cirrhotics. No correlation was found between Q-Tc interval and severity of the cirrhosis, haemodynamic <b>variables</b> (<b>stroke</b> volume, cardiac output) and s-calcium and potassium concentrations. After transplantation, Q-Tc decreased significantly (415 +/- 26 msec 1 / 2 vs 449 +/- 31; p < 0. 0001) returning to the values of the normal subjects, but no modification of the Q-T dispersion was observed. These data show that 1) prolongation of Q-T interval is frequent in cirrhosis, being higher in alcoholic than in non-alcoholic cirrhosis, 2) is not related to the severity of the disease, and 3) is reversible after transplantation...|$|R
