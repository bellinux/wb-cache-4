40|$|The Japanese pork {{market is}} {{protected}} by {{a complex set of}} restrictions, including a <b>variable</b> <b>levy</b> and an import tariff. The combination of these policies distorts the quantity, price, and form of Japanese pork imports. An important issue relevant to the liberalization of the Japanese pork market is the accurate measurement of the price wedge between Japanese and world pork prices. The analysis indicates that the tariff equivalent of the price wedge over the 1986 - 88 period was 44 %. If the tariff equivalent of the price wedge is reduced over a ten-year period, Japanese pork imports are projected to increase by over 39 % initially and by over 215 % compared to baseline projections by the year 2000. Producer welfare can be maintained by a deficiency payment scheme. A less costly alternative is an industry buffer scheme, which maintains the level of the pork industry for two years and then implements a declining deficiency payment scheme that limits the decrease in production levels to 5 % per year.

Some of the major controversial aspects of present import and price policies for protecting the domestic beef industry are examined in some detail. The domestic marketing channels for beef in Japan are being substantially modernized.

40|$|The authors {{extend the}} widely used Newbery and Stiglitz (1981) {{approach}} to measuring welfare changes from commodity price stabilization {{to a general}} equilibrium setting. They derive the welfare changes in terms of net consumer and producer surplus, rather than in terms of producer income as in the Newbery and Stiglitz approach. The authors present formulas for measuring the welfare changes for domestic price stabilization achieved through profitable storage (as assumed by Newbery and Stiglitz) and for stabilization through a variable tariff scheme. These formulas differ significantly, so it is inappropriate to use the Newbery and Stiglitz formula to justify the use of domestic price controls such as a <b>variable</b> <b>levy.</b> In recent years, governments {{in many developing countries}} have liberalized their trade policies in the pursuit of improved economic performance. But this has exposed their economies to variations in international prices and raised questions about the desirability of domestic price stabilization programs. A popular mechanism for this purpose is a variable import levy scheme. The authors'analysis confirms that domestic welfare is lower under trade policies that stabilize domestic prices, as such policies serve only to shift the price uncertainty from producers and consumers to the government budget - while incurring the social costs of the distortionary tariffs and subsidies. The authors focus on a comparison of the welfare effects of price stabilization under a variable tariff scheme and storage, but suggest a better option: to use financial instruments for hedging against commodity price risks. This requires that there be no capital controls - {{one of the main reasons}} private insurance is seldom undertaken in developing countries.

40|$|Contact {{for this}} paper: Laura Bipes/University of Minnesota/Department of Applied Economics/ 1994 Buford Avenue. / St. Paul, MN 55108 USA. From the start, {{agriculture}} {{played a central}} role in the Uruguay Round of GATT trade negotiations. The Punta del Este Declaration called for a solution to the problems facing agricultural trade through modified trade rules and an agreement to lower protection levels. It was recognized that such an improvement implied negotiations on the national farm policies as well as just trade policies. The time that it took to reach agreement reflected the political sensitivity and technical complexity of this task. The Agreement embodied in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round breaks new ground for agriculture, and takes a big step towards placing this sector of world trade under rules more consistent with those in operation in other areas. However, the degree of liberalization of markets is modest, and much remains to be done in future rounds of negotiations. The most far-reaching element in the Agreement is a change in the rules regarding market access. With very few exceptions, all participating countries have agreed to convert all existing non-tariff barriers (along with unbound tariffs) into bound duties and not to introduce new non-tariff measures. Negotiations agreed to reduce these new bound tariffs, as well as tariffs already bound earlier, according to Schedules included as a part of the Agreement. "Tariffication" will impose changes in import policies for a number of countries. Canada will replace import quotas for dairy and poultry products with tariffs, initially at a high level. The European Union will replace its <b>variable</b> <b>levy</b> with tariffs, though a maximum duty-paid price for cereals has been negotiated which puts a limit on the tariff charged. Latin American countries have generally engaged in tariffication in recent years in advance of the Uruguay Round Agreement: for these, and other countries their tariffs will now be bound. The US will forgo the use of Section 22 import quotas and the negotiation of voluntary export restraint agreements with beef suppliers, but the impact on these markets is likely to be small. Japan and Korea have been allowed to delay tariffication in the case of rice for the next few years. The Agreement provides in cases of tariffication for "minimum access opportunities", to guard against the impact of high initial tariff rates. This will open up reduced-tariff quotas for a number of products including beef, cereals and fruits and vegetables. The quotas will be expanded to about 5 percent of consumption over the 6 year period. Japan and Korea have agreed to a greater expansion of market access for rice in compensation for the delay in introducing tariffs. The ability of countries to control export subsidies in agricultural markets was one of the main issues under discussion in the negotiation. Under the Agreement, countries accept commitments on reducing expenditure on export subsidies as well on the quantity of subsidized exports. This will limit export subsidies by the EU and other countries, for such products as wheat, dairy products and beef, and should lead to firmer world market prices in these commodities. These quantities are also expressed in the Schedules which form part of the Agreement. Countries have also agreed not to apply export subsidies to commodities not subsidized in the base period. The Agreement also sets rules and commitments for domestic support policies. It defines a set of policies which are deemed to be less trade-distorting than others, and allocates them to a "green box" which is broadly immune to challenge. Other policies not sheltered in this way are subject to reduction through a limit on the total support given by domestic subsidies and administered prices. It was decided that neither the U. S. deficiency payments (under current legislation) nor the new hectarage compensation payments under the reformed Common Agricultural Policy of the EU need to be reduced. It was also agreed that subsidies that conform to the new rules are sheltered from international challenge under the GATT. Developing Countries generally face less stringent commitments, having 10 years rather than six to make the changes, and having to meet only two-thirds of the reduction targets. In addition, development policies are included broadly in the "green box". Along with the provisions on domestic and trade policies in the Agreement, participants also concluded an Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement). The goal was to make it easier to distinguish between genuine health and safety issues and disguised protection. The right of countries to set their own safety and health standards is reaffirmed, but with the provision that such standards should be based on scientific justification and that use be made of international standards where possible. The extent to which the Agreement will lead to greater market access, curb export subsidies and modify domestic policies in the next few years can only be determined from a detailed inspection of the Schedule of commitments made by the individual countries. Paradoxically, the immediate impact on national policies is likely in most cases to be small. Many countries have been engaged in a process of reducing government support to agriculture, and making such support more closely targetted to needs, in advance of the outcome of the Round. Policy reforms in the EU, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand, along with much of Latin America, have been strongly influenced by the negotiations in the Uruguay Round. The Agreement thus takes on the task of supporting and locking-in such reforms, and encouraging them in other countries. In some aspects the Agreement falls short of expectations (or at least initial demands). It does not constitute a major move toward free trade in agricultural products: the cost of changing the rules has been to give up some degree of liberalization. The tariffs which countries will impose in place of non-tariff barriers are in many cases so high that trade will be restricted to the agreed access quantities. Export subsidy programs will continue though at a reduced level. The major pressure to reinstrument farm policies will continue to be from domestic budget constraints. It will take further rounds of negotiations to reduce protection in agricultural markets to a level comparable to that for most manufactured products. However, with the rule changes and the new types of country commitments agreed, a much more promising basis bas been created for future negotiations. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

40|$|Trade {{uncertainty}} {{occurs when}} quality changes or when Administrative Trade Barriers (ATBs) cause {{a chance that}} a commodity will not enter the import market. Trade uncertainty adversely affects marketing firms and commodity trade. But arbitrage still precludes the distribution of rents to middlemen. An exporter subsidy may correct price distortions and expand trade towards the highest world welfare. The case for intervention appears strongest in thin markets with a low number of trade transactions and perishable commodities. Nonetheless, promoting trade liberalization before other interventions may still make sense when ATBs are present because reduced trade uncertainty also improves world welfare. Key words: agricultural trade, margins, nontariff trade barriers, uncertainty. Marketing firms seek profits from commodity arbitrage by exploiting the margin, or differ-ence, between the exporter price and the im-porter price. Competitive marketing firms sometimes cause price alignment between countries by increasing shipments under free trade (Samuelson, Takayama and Judge). But several factors may preclude price alignment in agricultural markets. For instance, trade policies such as quotas or <b>variable</b> <b>levies</b> limit price adjustment in importing countries (McCalla). Also, local supply and demand conditions may sometimes be a barrier to trade (Sexton, Kling, and Carman). Third, oli-gopoly pricing occasionally restricts price equalization (Ohno and Gallagher). Uncertainty may also complicate marketing firm behavior and margins for internation-ally traded agricultural products. Some di-mensions of marketing firm uncertainty have been studied (Goodwin, Grennes, and Wohlgenant; Hennessy; Fraser).

With constant tariffs, price volatilities in both countries increase {{with an increase in}} the tariff rate of one country or with an increase in the storage cost in one country. When one country (`the EC') uses a <b>variable</b> import <b>levy</b> and export subsidy to defend a fixed price floor, increases in the floor (a) increase mean price and decrease price volatility in the EC and (b) decrease mean price, increase volatility and increase private stockholding {{in the rest of the}} world. The volatility of farm incomes in the EC are relatively insensitive to increases in the floor. Commodities; Common Agricultural Policy; Stabilization; Storage...|$|R
