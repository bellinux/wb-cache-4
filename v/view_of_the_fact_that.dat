5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say. In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean that he gave warning to his people that the sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean 'at sunrise.' As regarding dǫglings for Dellings in H, and Dǫglingar were the descendants of Dagr (according to SnE. 183).|$|E
5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle {{the origins of the}} city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, {{and at the same time}} to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

25|$|Noel Odell, {{the last}} man to see Mallory and Irvine on their ascent in 1924, offered a more benign explanation: that the ice-axe had merely been placed there on the ascent to be {{collected}} {{on the way back}} in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the climbing ahead was almost entirely on rock under the prevailing conditions.|$|E

25|$|A {{petition}} {{was started}} on Change.org on 15 May 2016 {{calling on the}} EBU and the contest's organisers to void the final results in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the overall winner only placed second in both the jury and televote. The EBU later responded to the petition by stating that Jamala's win was decided upon by juries made up of professionals {{of the music industry}} and by the viewing public. The EBU {{went on to say that}} Ukraine will remain the winner, regardless of the petition's view.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} natural {{geologic}} barriers to isolate radioactive waste {{is demonstrated by}} the natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo, Africa. During their long reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of plutonium together with other transuranic elements were generated in the uranium ore body. This plutonium and the other transuranics remained immobile until the present day, a span of almost 2 billion years. This is quite remarkable in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> ground water had ready access to the deposits {{and they were not}} in a chemically inert form, such as glass.|$|E
25|$|Discovery Bay {{currently}} (April 2009) {{consists of}} 14 residential development phases with properties ranging from garden houses to high-rise towers {{of up to}} 24 storeys. The development also features a 400-metre-long privately owned beach (accessible to the public but no lifeguards present), four private membership clubs including a golf club and a marina club and a public park (Siena Central Park). The absence of public recreational facilities is a bone of discontent with the residents especially in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the developer has an outstanding obligation to provide 300,000 square metres of such facilities {{as part of the}} original plan.|$|E

25|$|In September 1989, the 120,000 ton collier M.S. Leon entered port with 85,000 tons of coal. The coal was {{unloaded}} by crane {{unto the}} conveyor {{and taken to}} the Coal Company {{at the rear of}} the Ashdod power station. The big ship was brought into port by modern Voit-Schneider type tugboats, which have an exceptional maneuverability and a bollard pull of 35 and 45 tons respectively. Bringing 160,00 G.R.T. ships into the port (at partial load capacity) is a considerable accomplishment in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Port of Ashdod was intended for navigation by ships of maximum deadweight of 30,000 tons (before the port was expanded in the 2000s).|$|E
25|$|On 6 March 1964, King Paul died, and Constantine succeeded him as King of the Hellenes. In July 1964, the {{announcement}} of the engagement of Constantine and Anne-Marie raised the polite protests of the Left in Denmark. Anne-Marie and Constantine were married on 18 September 1964 (two weeks after Anne-Marie's 18th birthday) in the Metropolis, the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Athens. The bride wore a Jørgen Bender design. Prior to the wedding, Anne-Marie converted from Lutheranism to the Greek Orthodox Church. Also, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she was marrying a foreign ruler, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her succession rights to the Danish throne for herself and her descendants.|$|E
25|$|Referring to coverage, between 2001 and 2006 PRAGUAS I {{equipped}} 252,000 {{persons with}} new supply systems and 127,000 people with on-site sanitation (i.e., approximately 5% and 3% of the Ecuadorian rural population of 4.7 million people). In small towns (cabeceras cantonales), where water service was interrupted, technical assistance {{was provided to}} improve the performance, separating service provision from direct provision by municipalities and increasing operative efficiency, to reach continuous sustainable service of good quality. In <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> designs for more than 600,000 inhabitants (which is 13% of the Ecuadorian rural population) have already been prepared, a fast coverage expansion is expected within PRAGUAS II, which began in 2007 and was to last until 2011.|$|E
30|$|The present plasma {{supports}} {{two types}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waves governed by Eq. (9), which evolve into {{two types of}} compressive solitons governed by Eq. (12). However, Eq. (10) shows that only the wave corresponding to plus sign propagates in the plasma. Since this wave belongs to the reflected soliton governed by Eq. (13), it is inferred that only the soliton corresponding to plus sign in Eq. (9) reflects. This is justified in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> soliton requires a minimum energy to reflect from the density gradient during the reflection mechanism.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent {{cases have}} focused {{attention}} on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> informed observer has sometimes become dangerously close to becoming the court's view. In dealing with this, the court must adopt <b>the</b> public's <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> not its own view. This distinction {{is not one of}} semantics, but bears great significance as it signifies <b>the</b> acceptance <b>of</b> public perception in the judicial process.|$|R

25|$|Rabinow {{has also}} devoted {{a great deal}} of energy to the {{invention}} of new venues, adjacent to the existing university structures, diagnosing the university’s disciplinary organization and career patterns as among the major impediment to 21st century thought. In <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the organization and practices of the social sciences and humanities in the U.S. university system have changed little in recent decades, they are unlikely to facilitate the composition of contemporary equipment. Rabinow has called for the creation of venues that are adjacent to, but more flexible than, the university and the existing disciplinary structure. He has played leading roles in the design of two such organizations, the Anthropology of the Contemporary Research Collaboratory (ARC), and the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC).|$|E
25|$|Less {{than a year}} later, on 10 January 1710, he {{received}} a letter of appointment to the chief rabbinate of the Ashkenazi congregation of Amsterdam. In addition to free residence, the office carried with it a yearly salary of 2,500 Dutch guilders (a large sum, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> fifty years later 375 guilders was the usual salary of the chief rabbi of Berlin). Unselfish and independent by nature, Ashkenazi renounced the perquisites of his office, such as fees in civil suits, {{in order to maintain}} his independence, and accepted the high position only upon the condition that under no circumstances was he to be required to subordinate himself to the congregation, or to be obliged to receive gifts, and that he should be permitted to preserve absolute freedom of action on all occasions.|$|E
25|$|Uthman was {{a shrewd}} {{businessman}} and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed {{greatly to the}} Rashidun Empire. Umar had fixed the allowance {{of the people and}} on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the public treasury. Under Umar, it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners. The army felt dissatisfied at this decision, but Umar suppressed the opposition with a strong hand. Uthman followed the policy devised by Umar and there were more conquests, and the revenues from land increased considerably.|$|E
25|$|Although Hindus were {{frequently}} soft targets in Pakistan, <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> Taliban {{forces in the}} political arena has particularly unsettled the already fragile situation for the minority community. Increasing persecution, ostracism from locals and lack of a social support system is forcing more and more Hindus to flee to India. This has been observed in the past whenever the conflicts between the two nations escalated but this has been a notable trend in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> recent developments are due to internal factors almost exclusively. The Taliban have used false methods of luring, as well as <b>the</b> co-operation <b>of</b> zealots within local authorities to perpetrate religious cleansing.|$|R

25|$|Under Paul VI, the Secretariat of State set minimum {{qualifications}} {{of age and}} priesthood for the appointment of Chaplains of His Holiness (35 {{years of age and}} 10 of priesthood), Honorary Prelates (45 of age and 15 of priesthood) and Protonotaries Apostolic Supernumerary (55 of age and 20 of priesthood). However, it waived the minimum age limit for vicars general proposed for appointment as Honorary Prelates, in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> as long as they hold the office of vicar general, they also held the still higher rank of Protonotary Apostolic Supernumerary. For the same reason, the Secretariat of State did not consider it appropriate that someone who was already a vicar general be appointed only a Chaplain of His Holiness. All these criteria have been superseded by the 2013 decision of Pope Francis to grant only the title of Chaplain of His Holiness and to require even for this a minimum age of 65 years.|$|E
25|$|However, Baalis, king of Ammon, was {{hostile and}} envious of the Judean remnant {{and sent a}} Judean, Yishmael Ben Netaniah, who was descended from the royal family of Judea, to assassinate Gedaliah. In the seventh month (Tishrei) of 582/1 BCE (some {{four to five years}} {{following}} the destruction of the Temple, although the exact year is unclear and subject to dispute; others claim the assassination took place in the same year as the destruction), a group of Jews led by Yishmael came to Gedaliah in the town of Mitzpa and were received cordially. Gedaliah had been warned of his guest's murderous intent, but refused to believe his informants, having the belief that their report was mere slander. Yishmael murdered Gedaliah, together with most of the Jews who had joined him and many Babylonians whom the Babylonian King had left with Gedaliah. The remaining Jews feared the vengeance of the Babylonian King (in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the King's chosen ruler, Gedaliah, had been killed by a Jew) and fled to Egypt.|$|E
