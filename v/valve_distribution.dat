40|$|Abstract. The water {{hydraulic}} reciprocating {{plunger pump}} driven by linear motor is suitable to deep sea application with high efficiency and variable control. Aiming {{to study the}} principle structure and working characteristics of the pump, two patterns of valve and piston distribution were designed. And the control method and the performance were analyzed by simulation based on the AMESim model. The {{results show that the}} pressure and flow pulsation of piston type pump are much smaller than the valve type, even though the piston type is large in scale and works at low flow rate. Compared with a <b>valve</b> <b>distribution</b> tri-linear-motor reciprocating plunger pump(VDTLMP), as the flow rate of the piston distribution double linear motor reciprocating plunger pump(PDDLMP) is decreased from 36. 7 L/min to 21. 2 L/min theoretically, the pressure pulsation amplitude is decreased from 46 % to 2 %, and the flow pulsation rate is also decreased from 0. 266 to 0. 007. These results contribute to the research on deep-sea water hydraulic power pack and direct drive pump with high efficiency and energy conservation...|$|E
40|$|Context In {{the past}} 20 to 30 years, {{the area of}} {{pediatric}} interventional cardiology has had noteworthy development. Technological revolutions have significantly progressed management of cardiovascular disease in both children and adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). This article reviews the current indications, techniques and complications of interventional therapy for CHD. Evidence Acquisition Training and publications in this field are rare. Overall, 64 article from January 1953 to February 2014 were studied. A total of 26 articles were involved in pediatric evaluation. Results There have been several catheter-based interventions for congenital heart disease. Percutaneous intervention in pediatric cardiac disease {{has been established in}} the past 2 to 3 decades. There are currently devices accepted for percutaneous closure of ASDs, patent ductus arteriosus (PDAs), and muscular ventricular septal defects (VSDs). The period of percutaneous valve implantation is just beginning, and the next few years may bring about advances in miniaturized <b>valve</b> <b>distribution</b> methods to allow insertion in smaller children. Conclusions Completely prepared catheterization laboratory, surgical holdup, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support capabilities must be accessible at any center to achieve interventional cardiac catheterization. Additional understanding of normal history of interventions more than 2 decade post process, novel strategies and methods will certainly lead to an increase in the methods for managing of congenital heart disease...|$|E
40|$|The poppet {{control valve}} {{is one of}} the most {{widespread}} hydraulic components. The paper purpose is the evaluation of flow characteristics of poppet valve by means of a complete numerical analysis. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the valve fluid dynamic performance, exploiting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in order to give the reliable indications needed to define the valve design criteria and avoid expensive experimental tests. The numerical analysis was performed by using the commercial code of CFD, and the numerical results show the complete flow field inside the valve. Axisymmetric as well as three-dimensional valve model was considered and the simulation results also are verified with experimental results. The results have confirmed the good accuracy of the simplified CFD analysis based on 2 D axisymmetric valve model being more efficient than full 3 D approach and show this method as very useful to forecast flow characteristics of poppet control valves. Hydraulic control poppet <b>valve,</b> <b>distribution</b> of the velocity in layers of the fluid, computational grid in the modelled geometry, pressure distribution for axisymmetric and three-dimensional mode for different flow rate, fluid velocity distribution in valve metering section for axisymmetric and three-dimensional model for different flow rates, the example of streamlines, the comparison of flow characteristics are contained in the publication...|$|E

And in June 2009, they met with small-time UK game developers, Just Add Water at the 2009 Game Developers Conference. Gilray wanted Lanning to revisit the franchise for two reasons - firstly because he saw the Oddworld universe had so much scope within the environments they created, {{that he wanted to}} give life to the backgrounds the way Ridge Racer would have animation that didn't affect gameplay, but gave life to the environment and secondly, because he wanted Lanning to deliver on the promise of the full five games in the Oddworld Quintology. Lanning and his business partner Sherry McKenna's response was not to demand a licensing fee, nor demand to be the biggest hit, but simply if Just Add Water could build a sustainable business that provides the fanbase with quality offerings, then they would work together.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to identify the dynamics of a Tenneco Automotive hydraulic damper valve and to predict valve performance. Accurate simulations of damper valve performance can be used to improve valve designs without the expense of physical testing. The Tenneco damper valve consists of thin shims and a spring preloaded disc that restricts fluid from exiting the main flow orifices. The deflection of the shims and spring are dependent on the flow-rate through the <b>valve.</b> The pressure <b>distribution</b> acting on the deformable valve components is investigated numerically using a dynamic modelling technique. This technique involves sequential geometry and simulation updating, while varying both the geometry and flow-rate. The valve deflection is calculated by post-processing the pressure <b>distribution.</b> <b>Valve</b> performance can be predicted by coupling the valve deflection with CFD pressure results...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items (PCIs). To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Orbiter Main Propulsion System (MPS) hardware are documented. The Orbiter MPS consists of two subsystems: the Propellant Management Subsystem (PMS) and the Helium Subsystem. The PMS is a system of manifolds, <b>distribution</b> lines and <b>valves</b> by which the liquid propellants pass from the External Tank (ET) to the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) and gaseous propellants pass from the SSMEs to the ET.

The Helium Subsystem supplies helium that is used within the SSMEs for inflight purges and provides pressure for actuation of SSME valves during emergency pneumatic shutdowns. The balance of the helium is used to provide pressure to operate the pneumatically actuated valves within the PMS. Each component was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticalities were assigned based on the worst possible effect of each failure mode. Of the 690 failure modes analyzed, 349 were determined to be PCIs...|$|R
