The analysis is in connection with the scientific work of the particle detector of the Solar Intensity X-ray and particle Spectrometer (SIXS) on-board BepiColombo, which is to be launched in 2014. In this work we have used a test particle simulation model developed by Vainio and Sandroos of the University of Helsinki. Mercury's environment is a complex system, resulting from the interaction between the solar wind, magnetosphere, exosphere and surface. The mission BepiColombo, a joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will be equipped with scientific instruments for detailed observation of Mercury's magnetic field and the magnetosphere. SIXS will investigate the direct solar X-rays and energetic proton and electron fluxes in the planet's environment. The flux distribution of energetic protons on the surface of Mercury and in the magnetopause is studied at different locations of the simulated BepiColombo/MPO like orbit around the planet. Two primary simulations were carried out: first, an orbit with periherm 2840 km and apoherm 3940 km and second, a surface skimming circular orbit. Motivation for circular orbit was to understand the distribution at the magnetopause of particles hitting the surface of the planet as viewed from above the surface on the noon-midnight meridian. The response of several energy levels of particles to different locations in the static magnetic field is studied by analysing latitude-longitude maps of flux distribution and asymptotic directions through various widths of instrument <b>view</b> <b>cone.</b> SIXS experiment uses five such view cones.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to produce buccal translation, with little or no coronal tipping, and evaluate hard tissue changes of the dental-alveolar complex. A prospective, randomized, split-mouth study was conducted with 11 patients (average age 14. 1 years, range 12. 5 - 16. 9 years) requiring maxillary first premolar extractions for comprehensive orthodontic treatment.
