5|$|In Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General (2011), the {{applicant}} sought a declaration that section 377A of the Penal Code was unconstitutional. The High Court stated {{that a person}} who is asserting an infringement of a constitutional liberty must establish that he or she has not merely a sufficient interest but a substantial interest in the matter, that is, he or she must be alleging a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fundamental liberty. The Court did not discuss the issue of standing in the context of administrative law.|$|E
5|$|In Tan Eng Hong, the Court of Appeal {{stated that}} the same test for {{standing}} applies to both declarations and prerogative orders, and read the statements from Chan Hiang Leng Colin quoted above as an implicit acceptance that an applicant must demonstrate the <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> right personal {{to him or her}} to have standing.|$|E

Colonel Winter (James Gandolfini), the prison's commandant, is a great admirer of the general but is offended by a comment he overhears: Irwin criticizes Winter's much-prized military artifacts collection, calling it something no actual battlefield veteran would ever have.|$|E
5|$|Preparations {{for the war}} {{dominated}} Shelby's second term. Two {{days before}} his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia. This was done in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian. Already commander of the militias of Indiana and Illinois, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at Newport before hurrying {{to the defense of}} Fort Wayne.|$|E
5|$|The city of San Francisco {{notified}} the Mallochs {{that they were}} in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building code prohibiting more than three floors above a garage, because the building contained four floors of apartments above the garage. The Mallochs successfully argued that their structure stepped back in progression up the slope of Telegraph Hill so that the top floor was not directly above the garage. No part of the building was in violation of the code.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, the {{football}} team's 10–0 season {{culminated in a}} 28–13 victory over first-ranked Tennessee in the 1952 Sugar Bowl. Maryland's participation, however, was in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Southern Conference resolution passed mid-season that banned participation in postseason bowl games. Byrd had Maryland accept the bowl invitation, despite Tatum's objections. The coach thought the threatened sanctions, which prevented Maryland from playing any Southern Conference games the following season, would severely disadvantage his team. In 1952, Maryland and Clemson, which had also violated the bowl game ban, were sanctioned, and the incident hastened the break-up of the Southern Conference and formation of the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which both schools were founding members.|$|E
5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E
5|$|The NFA {{claimed that}} the {{diversion}} to the parent company violated the beverage contracts between various parties. Negotiations between the two entities eventually failed, {{which led to a}} class action suit being filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against Burger King Corporation, Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper on behalf of all Burger King franchises in the United States in May 2009. In the filing, the NFA claimed the three defendants were in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1999 beverage contract that set specific beverage syrup usage goals. The four parties settled shortly after the filing when Burger King agreed to seek advertising funds from other sources.|$|E

In 2013, Yamamoto pleaded no contest to oral copulation with a minor, attempted sexual intercourse with a minor and sexual penetration with a foreign object on a minor, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

5|$|Witnesses {{differed}} {{about whether}} Tom McLaury {{was carrying a}} weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body {{and he was not}} wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{crimes are}} a {{worldwide}} threat. Any individual {{with access to}} a computer may become victim to a computer crime. In the summer of 2010, the Pentagon alone received over six million hacking and security threats per day, or 250, 000 <b>an</b> hour. One <b>of</b> many measures to prevent computer crimes is the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), a federal statute that prohibits the unauthorized access <b>of</b> <b>a</b> computer or computer data, such as when a hacker obtains bank account information from a financial institution’s network. There is currently disagreement among appellate courts as to the scope and application of the CFAA. Some circuits apply the CFAA only to hacking crimes, while others include <b>violations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> webpage’s terms <b>of</b> service or <b>an</b> employer’s computer-use policy. <b>A</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employer’s computer-use policy could be as minor as checking a personal Facebook page or personal bank account while at work. On the other hand, the <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employer’s computer-use policy could be more egregious, {{as in the case}} of United States v. Nosal. In Nosal, an en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit examined the scope of the CFAA as applied to an employee who used a work computer for personal purposes, addressing the issue <b>of</b> whether <b>a</b> <b>violation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> employer’s computer-use policy can be considered criminal hacking...|$|R
