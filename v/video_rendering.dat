2500|$|Internet Explorer 9 is only {{supported}} on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, and was {{supported on}} Windows Vista SP2. It supports several CSS 3 properties (including border-radius, box-shadow, etc.), and embedded ICC v2 or v4 colour profiles support via Windows Color System. The 32-bit version has faster JavaScript performance, this being {{due to a}} new JavaScript engine called [...] "Chakra". It also features hardware accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, hardware-accelerated text rendering using DirectWrite, hardware-accelerated <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XPS print pipeline. IE9 also supports the HTML5 video and audio tags and the Web Open Font Format. Internet Explorer 9 initially scored 95/100 on the Acid3 test, but has scored 100/100 since the test was updated in September 2011.|$|E
50|$|The Imagine 128-II added Gouraud shading, 32-bit Z-buffering, double display buffering, and a 256-bit <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> engine.|$|E
50|$|This {{program also}} {{features}} real-time <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> {{which allows the}} user to instantly preview edits made to the video timeline.|$|E
50|$|A <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> is {{software}} that processes a video file and sends it sequentially {{to the video}} display controller card for display on a computer screen. An example of a <b>video</b> <b>renderer,</b> is the VMR-7 that was used by Microsoft's DirectShow. An example of a UNIX <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> is the one container within GStreamer.|$|R
25|$|Windows Vista also {{introduces}} a new <b>video</b> <b>renderer,</b> available {{as both a}} Media Foundation component and a DirectShow filter, called the Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> (EVR). EVR is designed to work with Desktop Window Manager.|$|R
50|$|With native implementation, the decoded video {{stays in}} GPU memory {{until it has}} been displayed. The video decoder must be {{connected}} to the <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> with no intermediary processing filter. The <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> must also support DXVA, which gives less freedom in the choice of renderers.|$|R
50|$|Text mode <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> came to {{prominence}} in the early 1970s, when video-oriented text terminals started to replace teleprinters in the interactive use of computers.|$|E
50|$|However, {{this level}} of {{filtering}} complexity is not required all the time. There are commonly available methods {{to reduce the amount}} of work the <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> hardware must do.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{by using}} the <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> {{capabilities}} for which GPUs were initially designed, MapD has built a visualization layer called Immerse {{that is capable of}} rendering large datasets (billions of rows of data) with millisecond lag.|$|E
25|$|DXVA 2.0 {{supports}} only Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> as the <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> on Windows Vista. DXVA integrates with Media Foundation {{and allows}} DXVA pipelines {{to be exposed}} as Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs). Even decoder pipelines or post-processing pipelines can be exposed as MFTs, {{which can be used}} by the Media Foundation topology loader to create a full media playback pipeline. DXVA 1.0 is emulated using DXVA 2.0.|$|R
5000|$|Full: The Full edition {{includes}} all {{features of the}} Standard edition plus ffdshow, DScaler5 MPEG-2 decoder, DC-Bass Source Mod, Haali Media Splitter, Haali <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer,</b> and GraphStudioNext.|$|R
25|$|DirectDraw: {{for drawing}} 2D Graphics (raster graphics). Deprecated {{in favor of}} Direct2D, though still in use {{by a number of}} games and as a <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> in media applications.|$|R
50|$|Studio 17 was {{released}} in October 2013. New features/enhancements include significant performance boost with dramatically faster AVC <b>video</b> <b>rendering,</b> enhancedCUDA support and a streamlined interface. New Live Screen Capture, support for AVCHD 2.0 and valuable new extrasfrom Red Giant and iZotope.|$|E
50|$|Guvcview is {{compatible}} with all V4L2 camera devices, using the Linux UVC driver and based on luvcview for <b>video</b> <b>rendering.</b> Audio support employs the PortAudio open-source library. The application's user interface is built using GTK+ and designed to be simple and easy to use.|$|E
50|$|The code base {{is written}} in C++ using Qt {{frameworks}} for the user interface, FFmpeg libraries for demuxing and decoding of audio/video, Portaudio for audio rendering, OpenGL for <b>video</b> <b>rendering,</b> and Libass for rich subtitle rendering. Apprentice Video source code is freely available under the MIT license.|$|E
25|$|Since November 2007, DirectShow APIs {{are part}} of the Windows SDK. It {{includes}} several new enhancements, codecs and filter updates such as the Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> (EVR) and DXVA 2.0 (DirectX Video Acceleration).|$|R
50|$|The {{functions}} {{exposed by}} DXVA DDIs are not accessible directly by a DirectShow client, but are supplied as callback functions to the <b>video</b> <b>renderer.</b> As such, the renderer plays {{a very important}} role in anchoring the pipeline.|$|R
50|$|DXVA 2.0 {{enhances the}} {{implementation}} of the video pipeline and adds a host of other DDIs, including a Capture DDI for video capture. The DDIs it shares with DXVA 1.0 are also enhanced with the ability to use hardware acceleration of more operations. Also, the DDI functions are directly available to callers and need not be mediated by the <b>video</b> <b>renderer.</b> As such, a program can also create a pipeline for simply decoding the media (without rendering) or post-processing and rendering (without decoding). These features require the Windows Display Driver Model drivers, which limits DXVA 2.0 to Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 8. On Windows XP and Windows 2000, programs can use DXVA 1.0. DXVA 2.0 allows Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> as the <b>video</b> <b>renderer</b> only on Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. (With Windows XP, DXVA-Rendering is possible with VMR9 and the well-known Overlay Mixer.) DXVA integrates with Media Foundation and allows DXVA pipelines to be exposed as Media Foundation Transforms (MFTs). Even decoder pipelines or post-processing pipelines can be exposed as MFTs, which can be used by the Media Foundation topology loader to create a full media playback pipeline. DXVA 1.0 is emulated using DXVA 2.0. DXVA 2.0 does not include the COPP DDI, rather it uses PVP for protected content. Windows 7 implements DXVA-HD if the driver complies with WDDM 1.1.|$|R
50|$|NVIDIA's PureVideo HD <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> {{technology}} is an improved {{version of the}} original PureVideo introduced with GeForce 6. It now includes GPU-based hardware acceleration for decoding HD movie formats, post-processing of HD video for enhanced images, and optional High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) support at the card level.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} an embarrassingly {{parallel}} problem is 3D <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> handled by a graphics processing unit, where each frame (forward method) or pixel (ray tracing method) can be handled with no interdependency. Password cracking is another embarrassingly parallel task that is easily distributed on graphics processing unit or clusters.|$|E
50|$|Texture {{memory is}} a type of digital storage that makes texture data readily {{available}} to <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> processors (also known as GPUs), typically 3D graphics hardware. It is most often (but not always) implemented as specialized RAM (TRAM) that is designed for rapid reading and writing, enabling the graphics hardware increased performance in rendering 3D imagery.|$|E
5000|$|The {{usage of}} the FRIM AviSynth plugin (FRIMSource) is {{described}} on [...] "videohelp3d" [...] home page. LAV Filters {{can be used to}} get audio from H.264 MVC 3D video clip. The developer [...] posted that in a future release of it might be possible that LAV <b>Video</b> <b>renders</b> the <b>video</b> as Side-by-Side directly.|$|R
25|$|Windows Vista and Windows 7 {{ship with}} a new renderer, {{available}} as both a Media Foundation component and a DirectShow filter, called the Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> (EVR). EVR is designed to work with Desktop Window Manager and supports DXVA 2.0, which is available on Windows Vista and Windows 7. It offers better performance and better quality according to Microsoft.|$|R
50|$|The first release, {{present in}} Windows Vista, focuses on {{audio and video}} {{playback}} quality, high-definition content (i.e. HDTV), content protection and a more unified approach for digital data access control for digital rights management (DRM) and its interoperability. It integrates DXVA 2.0 for offloading more of the video processing pipeline to hardware, for better performance. Videos are processed in the colorspace they were encoded in, and are handed off to the hardware, which composes the image in its native colorspace. This prevents intermediate colorspace conversions to improve performance. MF includes a new <b>video</b> <b>renderer,</b> called Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> (EVR), which is the next iteration of VMR 7 and 9. EVR has better support for playback timing and synchronization. It uses the Multimedia Class Scheduler Service (MMCSS), a new service that prioritizes real time multimedia processing, to reserve the resources required for the playback, without any tearing or glitches.|$|R
50|$|DXVA {{works in}} {{conjunction}} with the <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> model used by the video card. DXVA 1.0, which was introduced as a standardized API with Windows 2000 and is currently available on Windows 98 or later, can use either the overlay rendering mode or VMR 7/9. DXVA 2.0, available only on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and later OSs, integrates with Media Foundation (MF) and uses the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR) present in MF.|$|E
50|$|Pointing an {{electronic}} camera {{at the same}} stationary monochrome caption {{for a long period}} of time could result in the image becoming burnt onto the camera tube's target — and even onto the phosphor of a monitor displaying it in extreme cases.Monoscopes were used as character generators for text mode <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> in computer displays for a short time in the 1960s. The monoscope declined in popularity during the 1960s due to its inability to generate a colour test card, and the development of solid state TV test pattern signal generators.|$|E
50|$|The four {{most widely}} used {{middleware}} packages that provide subsystems of functionality include RAD Game Tools' Bink, Firelight FMOD, Havok, and Scaleform GFx. RAD Game Tools develops Bink for basic <b>video</b> <b>rendering,</b> along with Miles audio, and Granny 3D rendering. Firelight FMOD is a low cost robust audio library and toolset. Havok provides a robust physics simulation system, along with a suite of animation and behavior applications. Scaleform provides GFx for high performance Flash UI and high-quality video playback, and an Input Method Editor (IME) add-on for in-game Asian chat support.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Video</b> Mixing <b>Renderer</b> (VMR) allows {{integration}} of video with other 2d and 3d windows ...|$|R
50|$|Software <b>Rendered</b> <b>Video</b> : Flash Player {{supports}} software <b>rendered</b> <b>video</b> since version 6. Such video supports vector animations displayed {{above the}} video content. Such content is typically rendered using software decoding.|$|R
30|$|For the {{quantitative}} analysis, {{we chose to}} compare {{the quality of the}} stereoscopic videos synthesized using our technique with those of the technique proposed in [12] and the stereoscopic <b>videos</b> <b>rendered</b> from the actual (recorded) depth map. Note that since the ground truth depth maps of Breakdancers and Ballet are not available, the results for these two streams did not go under quantitative analysis.|$|R
50|$|The 3DO Company {{designed}} a next-generation console {{that was never}} released due to various business and technological issues. The M2 project, which began as an accelerator add-on for the 3DO, was to use dual PowerPC 602 processors in addition to newer 3D and <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> technologies. Late during development, the company abandoned the console hardware business and sold the M2 technology to Matsushita. While Matsushita initially claimed to be planning a game console with the technology, it was shortly thereafter re-branded for the kiosk market competing with the CD-i system.|$|E
50|$|Internet Explorer 9 {{supports}} several CSS 3 properties, embedded ICC v2 or v4 color profiles support via Windows Color System, and {{has improved}} JavaScript performance. It {{is the last}} of the five major web browsers to implement support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). It also features hardware-accelerated graphics rendering using Direct2D, hardware-accelerated text rendering using DirectWrite, hardware-accelerated <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> using Media Foundation, imaging support provided by Windows Imaging Component, and high fidelity printing powered by the XML Paper Specification (XPS) print pipeline.Internet Explorer 9 also supports the HTML5 video and audio tags and the Web Open Font Format.|$|E
50|$|Monoscopes {{were used}} as {{character}} generators for text mode <b>video</b> <b>rendering</b> in computer displays {{for a short time}} in the 1960s. The CBS Laboratories Vidiac, and the A. B. Dick 990 System, were among the earliest character generators for broadcast television. CBS Laboratories later developed the more advanced Vidifont system in preparation for the 1968 US presidential elections, where a rapid method of all-electronic character generation was required so that news outlets could identify unexpected interviewees on the spot. A similar generator using analogue electronics, Anchor, was developed by the BBC in 1970 and used in the general election later that year.|$|E
50|$|MPC-HC updates the {{original}} player and adds many useful functionalities including {{the option to}} remove tearing, additional video decoders (in particular H.264, VC-1 and MPEG-2 with DirectX Video Acceleration support), Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> support, and multiple bug fixes. There is also a 64 bit-version of Media Player Classic - Home Cinema for the various Windows x64 platforms. MPC-HC requires at least Windows XP Service Pack 3.|$|R
50|$|Media Foundation {{uses the}} Enhanced <b>Video</b> <b>Renderer</b> (EVR) for <b>rendering</b> <b>video</b> content, which {{acts as a}} mixer as well. It can mix up to 16 {{simultaneous}} streams, with the first stream being a reference stream. All but the reference stream can have per-pixel transparency information, {{as well as any}} specified z-order. The reference stream cannot have transparent pixels, and has a fixed z-order position, at the back of all streams. The final image is composited onto a single surface by coloring each pixel according to the color and transparency of the corresponding pixel in all streams.|$|R
40|$|Storyboarding is a {{standard}} method for visual summarization of shots in film and video preproduction. Reverse storyboarding is the generation of similar visualizations from existing footage. We identify the key attributes of preproduction storyboards then develop computational techniques that extract corresponding features from <b>video,</b> <b>render</b> them appropriately, then composite them into a single storyboard image. The result succinctly represents background composition, foreground object appearance and motion, and camera motion. For tracking shots, we show that the visual representation conveys all the essential elements of shot composition. ...|$|R
