40|$|The {{development}} of a high-pressure diesel spray in its very early stage is examined through enlarged shadowgraphs in both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. A rather wide range of <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> was covered to clarify the mechanisms of the initial stage of development. At 0. 3 ms {{after the start of}} injection, there is a region where the tip penetration is insensitive to the ambient pressure and it becomes shorter with the increase in <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure.</b> This characteristic feature of the spray formation process is related to the eddy motion generated in the spray. The transition of the atomization regime from a wavy jet to a fully developed spray is also shown, and it is suggested that the pressure history in the nozzle sac is closely related to this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDoppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early {{velocity}} normalized to the time-velocity integral during diastole {{is equivalent}} to volumetric peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume. To compare the pathophysiologic validity of normalized and nonnormalized peak early flow velocity, pulsed Doppler echocardiography with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements was performed in 52 patients with coronary artery disease. Left ventricular loading conditions were changed by intravenous administration of norepinephrine in 15 patients and synthetic atrial natriuretic polypeptide in 15 others. Norepinephrine increased nonnormalized and normalized peak early flow velocities in association with significantly elevated end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures and decelerated the time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decline. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide did not change either nonnormalized or normalized peak early flow velocity, despite significant reductions in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> and an accelerated time constant. Normalized peak early flow velocity showed the highest univariaite correlation with long-term change in mitral <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> (n = 52, r = 0. 67, p < 0. 0001). It provided a modest univariate correlation (n = 30, r = 0. 74, p < 0. 0001) with immediate change in mitral <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> during norepinephrine infusion, whereas this correlation was lower (n = 30, r = 0. 57. p < 0. 001) during polypeptide infusion. However, multivariate regression analysis relating normalized peak velocity with long- and short-term changes in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures, time constant and constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness improved the correlation coefficiepts (r = 0. 80 to 0. 85. all p < 0. 0001). In contrast, neither univariate nor multivariate correlations of nonnormalized velocity with long- and short-term changes in these hemodynamic variables were satisfactory. Thus, nonnormalized peak early flow velocity does not directly reflect underlying hemodynamic changes in humans. Normalization to mitral stroke volume clarifies the dependence of peak early flow velocity on the determinants of early diastolic filling. When left ventricular early diastolic filling is evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, normalized peak early flow velocity {{should be taken into}} consideration...|$|E

Adult patients with hydrocephalus of various causes that were treated with programmable shunt valves during the last ten years were retrospectively studied. In 127 patients, 139 electromagnetic programmable shunt valves were implanted. Results. A nontraumatic subdural fluid collection was detected in 12 patients.

50|$|Booster {{pumps are}} usually piston or plunger type compressors. A single-acting, {{single-stage}} booster is the simplest configuration, and comprises a cylinder, designed {{to withstand the}} operating pressures, with a piston which is driven back and forth inside the cylinder. The cylinder head is fitted with supply and discharge ports, to which the supply and discharge hoses or pipes are connected, with a non-return valve on each, constraining flow in one direction from supply to discharge. When the booster is inactive, and the piston is stationary, gas will flow from the inlet hose, through the inlet valve into {{the space between the}} cylinder head and the piston. If the pressure in the outlet hose is lower, it will then flow out and to whatever the outlet hose is connected to. This flow will stop when the pressure is equalised, taking <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> into account.|$|R
40|$|From {{a safety}} standpoint, {{regardless}} of plant or facility type, {{the most important}} pieces of equipment are the pressure relief devices. The most critical characteristics of a pressure relief device are its set pressure and the related relieving capacity. The Set Pressure of a pressure relief device is defined as that value of increasing inlet static pressure at which the discharge becomes continuous (ASME PTC 25 - 1994, Performance Test Codes). To preclude an unsafe overpressure situation, the set pressure of the pressure relief device must not exceed the {{maximum allowable working pressure}} of the equipment or system being protected. Because of testing facility limitations, size or pressure, pressure relief valves intended for elevated temperature service are often set using ambient temperature air. Adjustments are made to the ambient <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressures</b> to compensate for the temperature differences. The extent of the adjustments to the pressure relief valve set pressure is important to ensure the valve will provide the required overpressure protection at the elevated in-service temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{atomization}} {{behavior of}} an intermittent fuel spray from a diesel nozzle was clearly observed {{by means of}} shadowgraphy using an image-converting camera with the framing rate of 10 ^ 5 f. p. s. and an image-intensified CCD camera with high-speed gating. A rather wide range of valve-opening pressure (5 to 70 MPa) was covered, and simultaneous measurement of the injection pressure inside the nozzle sac was also attempted to clarify the atomization mechanisms at its very early stage of injection. At the beginning of injection, {{the emergence of a}} liquid column was observed.

The pressure variations between the pear-shaped precombustion chamber and the cylinder for motoring and full load conditions were determined with a Farnboro electric indicator. The combustion chamber designs tested gave good mixing of a single compact fuel spray with the air, but did not control the ensuing combustion sufficiently.

At 0. 5 - 2. 0 msec intervals of isovolumic systole, Vce was derived as (dP/dt) /kP, where k = 24 cm- 1. Plots of Vce and P yielded inverse curves from peak Vce to aortic <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> which averaged 27 msec in controls, and 11 msec during norepinephrine administration. Extrapolated Vmax, in muscle lengths/second, averaged 3. 6 (controls), 3. 6 (volume load), and 6. 6 (norepinephrine). In each experimental state, Vmax was also determined from force-velocity relations of isovolumic beats (abrupt aortic occlusion) analyzed at 10 msec intervals from conventional pressure recordings. Vmax by both methods correlated well (r = 0. 88). While good correlations were also noted between Vmax and maximum dP/dt, (max dP/dt) /integrated isovolumic pressure, (max dP/dt) /peak isovolumic pressure, and (max dP/dt) /kP, only the last two of these successfully distinguished changes between volume load and inotropic stimulation.

40|$|Introduction: Shunting {{systems are}} {{implanted}} for draining cerebrospinal fluid to treat hydrocephalus, intracranial cysts, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Most shunt systems include a valve which regulates drainage. A differential pressure valve opens when intracranial pressure exceeds the valve’s opening pressure. The difficulty with these valves is selecting and predicting {{the most suitable}} <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> for the individual patient after insertion. Using a valve with a non-adjustable opening pressure requires surgery to change the opening pressure. Potentially, an adjustable valve, such as the Codman Hakim programmable valve, allows non-invasive valve pressure-adjustment for managing over- and underdrainage {{by being able to}} fine-tune the valve's opening pressure to the patient’s changing intracranial hydrodynamics. Objective: To evaluate the use of an adjustable valve in a consecutive, non-selected group of patients. To evaluate its reliance, spectrum of complications, use and effects of opening pressure adjustments and economical impact. Results and conclusions: An adjustable valve has the advantage of enabling trans-cutaneous alterations of the valve's opening pressure as the patients’ clinical course changes during the postoperative period. Pressure-adjustment optimized treatment, and clinical outcome improved following the majority of adjustments. Subdural fluid collections could be managed with pressure-adjustment. The rate of shunt complications was similar to other studies. Valve malfunction was uncommon. Accidental pressure-resetting, other than that caused by magnetic resonance imaging, was rare. Avoided shunt revisions reduce cost. Because we cannot predict which patient will need pressure-adjustment, our preference is to use an adjustable valve for all conditions...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne-dimensional (1 D) engine gas dynamic {{simulations}} {{are necessary}} in order to develop control laws for specific valve systems such as variable valve timing or the pneumatic hybrid engine. The keystone of 1 D engine models is the valve boundary condition, where the pressure wave phenomenon into a pipe is created and the in-cylinder mass flowrate is determined. Most commercial or research simulation codes embed the method of characteristics (MOC) constant-pressure valve boundary condition from Benson. This constant-pressure model in its original form provides good results in most cases, but this paper shows that it does not converge for low <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> and <b>pressure</b> ratio values, for which the characteristic lines become vertical.

40|$|Fluid transients, {{also known}} as water hammer, can have a {{significant}} impact on the design and operation of both spacecraft and launch vehicle propulsion systems. These transients often occur at system activation and shutdown. The pressure rise due to sudden opening and closing of valves of propulsion feed lines can cause serious damage during activation and shutdown of propulsion systems. During activation (valve opening) and shutdown (valve closing), pressure surges must be predicted accurately to ensure structural integrity of the propulsion system fluid network. In the current work, a network flow simulation software (Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program) based on Finite Volume Method has been used to predict the pressure surges in the feed line due to both valve closing and valve opening using two separate geometrical configurations. The <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> surge results are compared with experimental data available in the literature and the numerical results compared very well within reasonable accuracy (< 5 %) for a wide range of inlet-to-initial pressure ratios. A Fast Fourier Transform is preformed on the pressure oscillations to predict the various modal frequencies of the pressure wave. The shutdown problem, i. e. valve closing problem, the simulation results are compared with the results of Method of Characteristics.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{safe use}} of cuffed {{tracheal}} tubes for children necessitates a cuff pressure limitation at 20 - 25 cmH 2 O. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the reliability and benefit of a new cuff pressure release <b>valve</b> (<b>opening</b> <b>pressure</b> 20 cmH 2 O) for children intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube. METHODS: In a prospective, observational trial cuff pressure was recorded in paediatric and adolescent patients intubated with a cuffed tracheal tube during sevoflurane/nitrous oxide anaesthesia. The cuff pressure release valve was interposed between the cuff manometer and the pilot balloon. In 25 patients measurements were started at the initial opening pressure (group A) and in a further 25 patients measurements were started at the minimal sealing cuff pressure (group B). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients, aged from 0. 4 to 17. 8 years (median 7. 4 years) were enrolled in the study. The opening pressure measured (group A) was 19. 7 +/- 0. 8 cmH(2) O and the cuff sealing pressure (group B) was 11. 7 +/- 2. 9 cmH 2 O (range 6 - 16 cmH 2 O). Mean cuff pressure values in group A were 20. 4 +/- 1. 6 cmH 2 O and 16. 5 +/- 3. 3 cmH 2 O in group B. In one patient (group A) the cuff pressure exceeded 25 cmH 2 O and was manually decreased to 20 cmH 2 O. In total, 24 filling procedures (group A 14; group B 10) were required during 103. 1 h of investigation because of cuff pressure drop and audible air leakage, mainly caused by cuff pressure increases and consequent releases during patient positioning. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that the tested cuff pressure release valve was useful and reliable to limit cuff pressure in tracheal intubated children and adolescents within an acceptable pressure range...|$|E

The {{onset of}} this pressure perturbation {{coincides with the}} onset of the left ventricular (LV) isovolumic contraction, and hence will be referred to as the start of the arterially detected isovolumic contraction (AIC start). In the present study we test the hypothesis that the pressure perturbation indeed has a cardiac origin. In ten YorkshireLandrace swine, waveform intensity analysis demonstrated that AIC startwas followed by a positive intensity wave (0. 3 × 10 5 0. 3 × 10 5 W (m 2 s 2) 1). Timing analysis of LV and aortic pressure waveform showed that AIC startwas preceded by a LV pressure perturbation (3. 8 1. 8 ms, p < 0. 001). These novel cardiac timing and aortic wave intensity findings reveal the cardiac origin of the pressure perturbation. In 15 YorkshireLandrace swine, myocardial motion analysis showed a significantly higher rate of segment shortening during {{the first part of the}} LV pressure perturbation. Therefore, both the LV and aortic pressure perturbation are most likely caused by the early phase of myocardial contraction, which also causes mitral valve closure.

40|$|The {{so-called}} stiction effect (or stiction force) {{is one of}} {{the sources}} of thermodynamic losses in compressor suction and discharge systems. The losses associated with the stiction effect are caused by a deformation of the lubricating oil film between the valve and the seat.

This paper advances a theoretical model for solving the dynamic behavior of a ring-shaped lubricant oil film between a discharge valve and the seat. The valve is allowed to move under the action of an external force due to the timedependent pressure difference between the cylinder and the discharge chamber. The main contributions of the model are the consideration of a finite amount of oil between the valve and the seat and mathematical relationships for calculating the initial condition for the oil film thickness. The model results are compared with those obtained with the Khalifa and Liu (1998) method. At conditions typical of discharge systems of domestic refrigeration compressors, viscous effects are the dominant component in the oil stiction force under dynamic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} estimating pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure from within the right ventricle. If feasible, this could {{have important implications for}} long-term hemodynamic monitoring. Background. Right ventricular pressure at the time of pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>opening</b> closely approximates pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure. Because maximal first derivative of right ventricular pressure (dP/dt) can be easily measured, if it occurs at or very near pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>opening,</b> right ventricular <b>pressure</b> at maximal right ventricular dP/dt would be an estimation of pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure. Methods. In 10 patients undergoing routine right and left heart catheterization, simultaneous measurements were made using micromanometers in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery at baseline, during isometric work and Valsalva maneuver. Right ventricular pressure at maximal right ventricular dP/dt was considered the estimated pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure and was compared with the actual pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure. Results. At baseline, estimated and actual pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressures were (mean ± SD) 17. 7 ± 6. 6 and 16. 7 ± 6. 7 mm Hg, respectively (p = NS). During isometric stress, estimated and actual pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressures were 30. 4 ± 12. 7 and 28. 4 ± 10. 1 mm Hg, respectively (p = NS). During Valsalva maneuvers, estimated and actual pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressures were 36. 5 ± 17. 8 and 38. 0 ± 16. 1 mm Hg, respectively (p = NS). Conclusions. Although more extensive testing is necessary to evaluate validity in different physiologic and pathologic situations, it appears that right ventricular pressure at maximal right ventricular dP/dt can provide accurate estimation of pulmonary artery end-diastolic pressure...|$|R

The Stephenson valve gear, as used on early steam locomotives, supported variable cutoff, that is, changes to the time at which the admission of steam to the cylinders is cut off during the power stroke.|$|R

Such a static-start engine would provide the efficiency and pollution-reduction improvements of a mild hybrid-electric drive, but without the expense and complexity of an oversized starter motor.|$|R
