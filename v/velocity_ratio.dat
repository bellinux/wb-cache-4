40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for {{the estimation of}} the subsonic-flight-speed characteristics of sharp-lip inlets applicable to supersonic aircraft. The analysis, based on a simple momentum balance consideration, permits the computation of inlet pressure recovery - mass-flow relations and additive-drag coefficients for forward velocities from zero to the speed of sound. The penalties for operation of a sharp-lip inlet at <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios</b> other than 1. 0 may be severe; at lower <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios</b> an additive drag is incurred that is not cancelled by lip suction, while at higher <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios,</b> unavoidable losses in inlet total pressure will result. In particular, at the take-off condition, the total pressure and the mass flow for a choked inlet are only 79 percent of the values ideally attainable with a rounded lip. Experimental data obtained at zero speed with a sharp-lip supersonic inlet model were in substantial agreement with the theoretical results...|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating <b>velocity</b> <b>ratio</b> is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile. There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant <b>velocity</b> <b>ratio.</b> In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the mating gear that provides a constant <b>velocity</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the <b>velocity</b> <b>ratio.</b> Cycloidal gears only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. Cycloidal gears are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|E

The upstream row is supplemented with anti-vortex holes. The addition of anti-vortex holes is presented as a new technique depends on adding two cylindrical holes branching out from the main holes. Three different positions of anti-vortex holes are studied with three different values of <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios.</b> The study is carried out using realizable k-ϵ model in FLUENT commercial code. The numerical model is verified by comparing a single row of film cooling holes results with available experimental works in literature. The results ensure that the staggered arrangement gives higher film cooling effectiveness than the in-line one for all studied <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios.</b> The use of anti-vortex holes increases the film cooling effectiveness.

Further from this value, the elliptic approach highlights the appearance of the fall velocity zone and that’s due to the presence of a trough low pressure. This fall velocity has not been detected by the parabolic approach and that’s due to the jet entrainment by the ambient flow. The intensity of this entrainment {{is directly related to the}} difference between the primary (jet) and the secondary flow (co-flow).

40|$|Effects of flow (hydrodynamic) {{properties}} on {{limiting conditions}} for soot-free laminar non-premixed hydrocarbon/air flames (called laminar soot-point conditions) were studied, emphasizing non-buoyant laminar coflowing jet diffusion flames. Effects of air/fuel-stream <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios</b> were of particular interest; therefore, the experiments {{were carried out}} at reduced pressures to minimize effects of flow acceleration due to the intrusion of buoyancy. Test conditions included reactant temperatures of 300 K; ambient pressures of 3. 7 - 49 8 kPa; methane-, acetylene-, ethylene-, propane-, and methane-fueled flames burning in coflowing air with fuel-port diameters of 1. 7, 3. 2, and 6. 4 mm, fuel jet Reynolds numbers of 18 - 121; air coflow velocities of 0 - 6 m/s; and air/fuel-stream <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0. 003 - 70. Measurements included laminar soot-point flame lengths, laminar soot-point fuel flow rates, and laminar liftoff conditions. The measurements show that laminar soot-point flame lengths and fuel flow rates can be increased, broadening the range of fuel flow rates where the flames remain soot free, by increasing air/fuel-stream <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios.</b> The mechanism of this effect involves the magnitude and direction of flow velocities relative to the flame sheet where increased air/fuel-stream <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios</b> cause progressive reduction of flame residence times in the fuel-rich soot-formation region. The range of soot-free conditions is limited by both liftoff, particularly at low pressures, and the intrusion of effects of buoyancy on effective air/fuel-stream <b>velocity</b> <b>ratios,</b> particularly at high pressures. Effective correlations of laminar soot- and smoke-point flame lengths were also found {{in terms of a}} corrected fuel flow rate parameter, based on simplified analysis of laminar jet diffusion flame structure. The results show that laminar smoke-point flame lengths in coflowing air environments are roughly twice as long as soot-free (blue) flames under comparable conditions due to the presence of luminous soot particles under fuel-lean conditions when smoke-point conditions are approached. This is very similar to earlier findings concerning differences between laminar smoke- and sootpoint flame lengths in still environments...|$|R
