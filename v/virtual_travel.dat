Travel 2.0 model allow user {{to create their own}} contents and exchange their words through globally interactive features on websites. The users also can contribute their experiences, images and suggestions regarding their trips on online travel communities. For example, TripAdvisor is an online travel community which enables user to rate and share autonomously their reviews and feedbacks on hotels and tourist destinations. Non pre-associate users can interact socially and discuss through discussion forums on Tripadvior. Social media, especially Travel 2.0 website, plays a crucial role in decision-making behaviours of travellers. The user-generated contents on social media tools {{have a significant impact on}} travellers’ choices and organisation preferences. The travel 2.0 emerged a radical change in receiving information methods of travellers from business-to-customer marketing into peer-to-peer reviews. The user-generated contents become a vital tool for helping a number of travellers manage their international travels for the first time visiting. The travellers tend to trust and rely on peer-to-peer reviews and virtual communications on social media rather than the information provided by travel supplier. In addition, An autonomous review feature on social media would help traveller reduce risks and uncertainties before purchasing stages. Social media is also a channel for customer complaints and negative feedbacks which can damage images of organisations and destinations. For example, a majority of UK travellers read customer reviews before booking hotels and the bookings of hotels receiving negative feedbacks would be refrained by half of customers. Therefore, the organisations should develop strategic plans to handle and manage the negative feedbacks on social media. Although the user-generated content and rating system on social media are out of business controls, the businesses can monitor those conversations and participate in communities to enhance a customer loyalty and maintain customer relationships.|$|E

The dyke SM fantasy, when toyed with in cyberspace produces a multiplicity and fluidity of sexual and gender perspectives and positionings. Through the creation and play of avatars and alternate personae within the chatroom space and in emailing, the performative nature of dyke SM subjectivity and identity(ies) is exposed and becomes erotically available for sexual/gender interrogations. The dyke SM fantasy, as a narrative is introduced to set the scene for <b>virtual</b> <b>travels</b> through the sexually-based chatrooms of AOL and the erotic writing of emails.

40|$|Travel {{distances}} in gravel-bed {{rivers of}} tagged particles {{of various sizes}} are related to excess stream power estimated for peak discharge. Mean distance of movement, irrespective of grain size, is weakly correlated with stream power, especially near the threshold of movement. There may be several reasons for the weak correlation, including variable effects of bed structure, varying magnitudes of sediment mobilizing events and sampling problems. Grain size itself is of marginal significance. The <b>virtual</b> rate of <b>travel</b> calculated using total time for which the flow is larger than that needed to initiate clast movement also bears a weak relation to the excess stream power over the period.

Brentano and Kleist’s text elucidates the authors’ ‘strange feeling’ towards Caspar David Friedrich’s painting Monk by the Sea. What both texts share is a fundamental experience of ambivalence regarding the topographies depicted in both media.

A decline in peak hour usage of roads and passenger railways would allow for a more even distribution of loads, reducing the need for further investments in capacity.

The reasons why this vulnerability increases while the skills involved should have improved are not clear. By linking two fields of analysis of road safety (fine spatial analysis of crashes and depth analysis of behaviours and psychosocial factors), our project aimed to finely identify the mobility and pedestrian accident involvement of the 10 – 15 years old and specify geographical, psychological and sociological determinants of both variables. Methods and results A study of accident processes among pedestrians aged 10 – 15 years over France for the period 2002 – 2011 was conducted, based on the national accident file and on a sample of accident police reports. It was completed in the field of study of the Lille region (France) by the spatial analysis of local accident data (including the identification of accident scenarios) and the mobility of 10 – 15 years, using data from the 2006 household travel survey. Two field surveys were then conducted. A first survey among 2500 junior high school students has identified the fine mobility practices and their socio-spatial determinants. It also explored the demographic and psychological variables (age, gender roles, perceptions of social norms, risks, rules, level of supervision) explaining the reported pedestrian risky behaviours. A second survey among 300 junior high school students focused on their perceptions of known and unknown walking environments. It enabled to draw up a sensible mapping of their actual walking environment and a qualitative analysis of the elements using to judge the pleasantness and safety and characterise their representations of positive or negative actual and <b>virtual</b> <b>travels</b> as pedestrian.
