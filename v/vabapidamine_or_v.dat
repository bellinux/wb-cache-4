We show that this interaction can be deferred or suppressed by placing a buffer layer of Ti <b>or</b> <b>V</b> between the Al film and the poly Si.

40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the occurrence of}} concealed conduction in anomalous atrioventricular (AV) bypass tracts, 11 patients were selected for study. Two had a right-sided and nine had a left-sided bypass tract. Electrode catheters {{were placed in the}} right atrium, coronary sinus, AV junction and right ventricle. After every eighth atrial or ventricular driving beat (A 1 <b>or</b> <b>V</b> 1) at a constant cycle length, two successive atrial or ventricular premature beats (A 2 and A 3 <b>or</b> <b>V</b> 2 and V 3) were delivered. The A 1 A 2 <b>or</b> <b>V</b> 1 V 2 interval was fixed at 30 ms greater than the effective refractory period of the atrium or right ventricle, but less than the effective refractory period of the bypass tract in the anterograde or retrograde direction. This allows A 2 <b>or</b> <b>V</b> 2 to capture the atrium or ventricle, but not conduct in the bypass tract. The A 3 <b>or</b> <b>V</b> 3 was delivered from late diastole with a progressively shorter A 2 A 3 <b>or</b> <b>V</b> 2 V 3 interval until atrial or ventricular refractoriness was encountered. In the anterograde direction, the presence of A 2 prevented A 3 conduction in the bypass tract despite A 1 A 3 intervals being longer than the anterograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract in 8 of the 11 patients. In the retrograde direction, the presence of V 2 prevented V 3 conduction in the bypass tract despite V 1 V 3, intervals being longer than the retrograde effective refractory period of the bypass tract in 3 of the 11 patients. Thus, using the technique of programmed electrical stimulation, concealed conduction in anomalous AV bypass tracts can be demonstrated in both anterograde and retrograde directions...|$|R
