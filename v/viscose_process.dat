40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} was to reduce the consumption of C 2 S when preparing high-viscosity viscose by pre-treating two softwood pulps with enzymes prior to the viscose stages. Reactivity was evaluated in two ways, Fock´s test of the pulp and the gamma number of the viscose solution prior to regeneration. Whilst the reactivity of a pulp that had been subjected to enzyme pretreatment increased according to Fock´s test, it did not increase according to the gamma number. This unexpected difference between the two reactivity tests was investigated. It was concluded that Fock´s test measures the extent to which C 2 S reacts with a pulp sample during a standardized test, whereas the gamma number measures the resulting degree of xanthate substitution on the cellulose backbone. The gamma number was judged to be the more relevant of the two tests, since it reflects the dissolution ability of a pulp in the viscose preparation. A higher gamma number also means that the coagulation time in the spinning process is prolonged; this is beneficial, as {{it can be used to}} increase the tenacity of the viscose fibres. Measuring the reactivity according to Fock´s test, on the contrary, provides more dubious results, as the test has no undisputed correlation to the <b>viscose</b> preparation <b>process...</b>|$|R

40|$|As a {{subsequent}} study a critical examination {{was carried out}} on a history of first commercialization of Chardonnet silk. Before establishment of the company, in 1889 Chardonnet displayed small spinning machine together with luster 2 ̆ 7 artificial silk 2 ̆ 7 at Expo 2 ̆ 789 at Paris. On 3 ^. December, 1890 2 ̆ 7 Societe anonyme pour la fabrication de la Chardonnet 2 ̆ 7 was registered by Besancon 2 ̆ 7 s proprieters including J. B. Weibel and his collaborators with capital of 6 million francs at Besangon, Dout, France. Chardonnet was {{not a member of}} the board, but a consultant engineer. The plant of the company was constructed during 29 ^ January, 1891 and 1 ^ May, 1892. The planned production capacity was 50 kg/day. The plant started its operation on June, 1892. Records of expenditure, fiber production, and production cost during June, 1892 and 1896 were summarized. Several troubles encountered in large scale production were discussed. Among them the inflammability of 2 ̆ 7 silk 2 ̆ 7 was the most serious and operation was suspended in Jan. 1894 ～ April, 1894 and the factory scale experiments for improvement were performed. Chardonnet had worry about the flammability as early as 1886. He investigated in 1888 ～ 1890 numerous reagents for denitration. However, he adopted, at the time of starting of operation (1892), lackadaisical means, fearing the deterioration and cost-up of the fibers. Technology transfer of Chardonnet process occurred first to Spreitenbach, Switzerland, where a private factory, owned by d 2 ̆ 7 Asson in 1881, to whom Chardonnet licensed and gave technical guidance, was expanded to 2 ̆ 7 Societe 2 ̆ 7 by Swiss capital (capital = 200 × 10 ^ 3 francs.) in 1892. This 2 ̆ 7 second factory 2 ̆ 7 started its operation in 1893, soon stoped due to the same troubles as those at Besangon. De Asson resigned and new management replaced him. Role of F. Lehner, if any, in improvement of the original Chardonnet 2 ̆ 7 s process was examined in detail. 2 ̆ 7 Lehner 2 ̆ 7 artificial silk company (an English company) was formed in 1892 based on Lehner 2 ̆ 7 s two primitive patents, but it did not work well. Lehner, who had no practical (even bench level) experience, joined to Spreitenbach factory to assist in 1894 and learnt the secret of Chardonnet silk process. The Besancon factory reopened on June, 1894 and since then the operation became very successful. Production records in 1890 ～ 1909 at Besancon factory, Tubize, and Vereinigte Kunstseidefabrik (VKF) were summarized. The world production and its share of cellulose nitrate process decreased dramatically between 1909 ～ 1913 and the industry followed quick decay, due to poor cost competitiveness against cuprammonium and <b>viscose</b> <b>processes.</b> Profit and deviviend of Chardonnet silk companies during 1898 ～ 1921 were collected...|$|R

The chapter continues with the phenomenon of the polyelectrolyte adsorption onto cellulose, {{takes a look at the}} <b>viscose</b> production <b>process</b> and, finally, it introduces the novel field of “click” chemistry. In the experimental part, methods and techniques applied are described. The experimental part focuses on the evaluation of the adsorption efficiency of CMC and its derivatives onto viscose in different reaction conditions, as well as on examination of chemical and mechanical stabilities of the modification. CMC functionalization was analyzed with spectroscopic techniques and elemental analysis. The effect of various reaction conditions on adsorption was studied and quantified by means of the phenol-sulphuric acid method for the estimation of total adsorbed carbohydrates. Chemical and mechanical stabilities of the modified CMC and fibres were studied by the alkaline and wet frictional treatments, respectively. The main findings revealed that chemically modified viscose fibres (cellulose II) behave differently from cellulose wood pulp and cotton (cellulose I) in respect of polysaccharide adsorption. The functionalization of CMC resulted in clear changes in the molecular structure of CMC, appearing as an increase in nitrogen content. In addition, spectroscopic analyses revealed characteristic signals of alkyne, azide and amide bonds indicative of successful grafting reactions. Adsorption of CMC onto viscose fibres was studied with Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and revealed changes on the surface of the viscose. The click reaction was demonstrated via fluorescent labelling. Moreover, the study on chemical and mechanical stabilities showed reasonable results. In general, combination of polysaccharide adsorption and click chemistry can be considered as a promising method for introducing new functionalities to the viscose fibres...|$|R

Cellulose, one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} organic substances on earth, is a linear polymer of D-glucose units joined through 1, 4 -β-linkages. Cellulose is however not easily processed without chemical modification. A number of techniques exist for the modification of cellulose, of which the <b>viscose</b> <b>process</b> is {{one of the}} most widely applied. Grafting of synthetic polymeric chains onto or from cellulosic materials is an useful technique that can be used to combine the strengths of synthetic and natural polymers dramatically, so changing the properties of cellulosic materials (pulp, regenerated cellulose, cellulose derivatives). In this study five model xanthate (Reversible Addition-Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) /Macromolecular Design through Interchange of Xanthates (MADIX)) agents, namely, monofunctional, difunctional, trifunctional and tetrafunctional species of the form S=C(O-Z) -S-R, with different leaving groups and different activating moieties, were prepared and then studied to determine the feasibility of cellulose modification via addition fragmentation processes. These agents were characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). Polyvinyl acetates (PVAc) in the form of linear, three armed and four armed star shaped polymers were then successfully synthesized in reactions mediated by these xanthate RAFT/MADIX agents Xanthates were applied to polysaccharide materials using the <b>viscose</b> <b>process</b> (xanthate esters were formed directly on a cellulosic substrate, with subsequent alkylation) Grafting reactions were then conducted with the polysaccharides; cellulose was modified with vinyl acetate, [this is an example of a surface modification of natural polymers that is of interest in various industries, such as textiles and paper manufacture]. Analysis of the graft copolymers was conducted via Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), Liquid Adsorption Chromatography (LAC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), and FT-IR. Polyvinyl acetate was successfully grafted onto three polysaccharides (cellulosic materials), namely Hydroxyl Propyl Cellulose (HPC), Methyl Cellulose (MC) and cellulose.

40|$|The {{conventional}} viscose {{manufacturing process}} is a mature process {{that needs to be}} improved with respect to its environmental impact and its production cost structure. Therefore a research study has been done with the aim to improve the reactivity of the dissolving pulp used, {{in order to reduce the}} chemical demand in the <b>viscose</b> <b>process</b> and thus reduce the cost and indirectly the environmental impact. The work described in this thesis has shown that it is possible to enhance the pulp reactivity and to use less carbon disulphide in the production of viscose, while maintaining a good quality viscose dope, by two entirely different pretreatment methods, one chemical and one enzymatic. The chemical method used pressurized oxygen after the mercerisation step, which increased the reactivity of the alkali cellulose. The viscose dopes produced from the pressurized oxygen treated alkali cellulose had lower filter clogging values, Kw, compared to conventionally produced viscoses. The temperature and the oxygen treatment time of the alkali cellulose were however crucial for the viscose quality. The best performing enzyme of several tested was a cellulase of the mono component endoglucanase preparation Carezyme®. This enzymatic treatment was optimized with respect to viscose dope preparation. The study showed that the enzyme treatment could be carried out under industrially interesting conditions with respect to temperature, enzyme dose and reaction time. A re-circulation study of the enzyme showed that it was possible to re-use the spent press water from the enzymatic treatment step several times, and thus lower the production cost. Some of the <b>viscose</b> <b>process</b> stages were modified to properly fit the enzymatically treated dissolving pulp and a comparison between viscose made from enzyme-treated pulp and viscose made from conventional pulp, showed that the enzyme-treated samples had a lower filter clogging value, Kw.
