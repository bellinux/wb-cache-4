50|$|Reduced <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minima</b> or minimum (RVSM) is the {{reduction}} of the standard <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> required between aircraft flying between FL290 (29,000 ft) and FL410 (41,000 ft) inclusive, from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet (or between 8,850 and 12,500 m from 600 m to 300 m). This therefore increases the number of aircraft that can safely fly in a particular volume of airspace.|$|R
50|$|Until 1999, the {{vertical}} separation between aircraft flying at high altitudes {{on the same}} airway was 2000 ft. Since then {{there has been a}} phased introduction around the world of reduced <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minimum</b> (RVSM). This cuts {{the vertical}} separation to 1000 ft between about 29000 ft and 41,000 feet (the exact limits vary slightly from place to place). Since most jet aircraft operate between these heights, this measure effectively doubles the available airway capacity. To use RVSM, aircraft must have certified altimeters, and autopilots must meet more accurate standards.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 23 - 26, 2000 / Town & Country Hotel and Conference Center, San Diego, CaliforniaA recent Air Traffic Management (ATM) {{initiative}} {{has reduced}} certain oceanic routes from a 2, 000 -foot <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minimum</b> to a 1, 000 -foot (300 m) separation minimum between flight levels of 29, 000 feet and 41, 000 feet. As {{a result of}} this initiative, an aircraft transitioning from the Continental United States (CONUS) to Europe or Asia will be required to have a validated, certified altimeter reporting system within the specified tolerances. The aging military airframes are not currently Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minimum</b> (RVSM) certified. The impact on military deployment time to foreign theatres as well as high- fuel cost makes this a high-priority DoD issue. This paper describes the test and evaluation (T&E) challenge, viable solutions and test method for meeting the RVSM requirements in an approved, affordable, and least down-time (minimal aircraft modification) manner. The test method described herein utilizes a PACER aircraft in formation with the RVSM candidate aircraft. The RVSM {{is just one of the}} many Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) requirements which must be met for military aircraft to fly within premium airspace during overseas deployment. The commercial equivalent of GATM is Communications Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM).

Only aircraft {{that have been}} certified to meet RVSM standards, with several exclusions, are allowed to fly in RVSM airspace. It was introduced into the UK in March 2001.

30|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} in air transport (FEAT) {{can be defined}} as ratio of fuel consumed in liters to revenue tonne kilometer (RTK) [4, 13, 51]. Fuel efficiency of transport aircrafts mainly depends upon two main factors i.e., technology & design, and aircrafts operations [4, 51]. Further, aircraft technology & design depends upon the engine efficiency, aerodynamic efficiency, and structural efficiency, while the aircraft operations relies on ground efficiencies, and airborne efficiencies [4, 73, 74]. In case of aircraft technology & design, aerodynamic features such as blended wing body (BWB), flying wing, higher aspect ratios, and engines with higher bypass ratios are installed on modern jets to improve the fuel efficiency [1]. Aviation operations contain air traffic management procedures such as performance-based navigation, continuous descent approaches, reduced <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minimum</b> (RVSM) and various air traffic flow management systems, beside improved aircraft operating techniques [13, 26].|$|E
40|$|The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) {{regulates the}} need for {{issuance}} of special operators operat- ing permits such as: for operations {{with the use of}} standards Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minimum</b> (RVSM); Perfor- mance-based Navigation (PBN); auto landings on CATII CATIII ICAO categories; EDTO/ETOPS (Extended Twain OPer- ationS/Extended Diversion Time Operations) standards for the operation of turbine-powered airplane flights lasting more than 60 minutes to spare en-route with increased care at an alternate airfield and flight operations at the twin-engine plane over terrain without radio navigation; with the use of Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS); with the use of Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) and with the use of Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). The ability to meet these requirements follows from the analysis of tactical, technical and operational characteristics of avionics, maintenance and repair programs (MRO), aircraft maintenance organizations (AMO) {{and a number of other}} factors. It should be based on a scientific approach and strict satisfaction of all requirements of legal and regulatory documents. The ability to use TCAS, EGPWS and EFB requires a comprehensive scientific analysis, taking into account all the operational factors. The article provides the performance of some scientific and practical aspects related to the application of the above mentioned stand- ards and systems. Some modern methods of statistical analysis of the position and movement parameters of the aircraft are used.

40|$|Flight {{operations}} {{with the use}} of standards Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minimum</b> (RVSM); Performance-based Navigation (PBN); auto landings on CATII CATIII ICAO categories have become common practices in relation to the relevant requirements of ICAO. In this case, operators should receive special operational permits, due to that the task of determining the feasibility of such operations became operational. Increasing the reliability requirements to estimate the accuracy characteristics quality of flight operations requires the development and improvement of methods for their evaluation. First of all, the application of methods based on more accurate representations of error models with more correct models of the error probability density distribution is required, especially in the field of large, rare errors. This article solves one of the tasks of this complex approach to estimate the accuracy characteristics – the task of processing flight information {{in order to determine the}} estimates of the accuracy characteristics of the flight-navigation complex (FNC), since the problem solving provides the possibility of obtaining an integral estimate of the accuracy characteristics based on the application of combined methods. It is shown that the power of the Nikulin criterion is almost twice as high as the Pearson power criterion, which in some cases excludes the acceptance of incorrect hypotheses about the form of the hypothetical distribution function. The use of Nikulin criterion makes it possible to significantly improve the assessments accuracy of flight quality performance characteristics according to RVSM, PBN, CATII and CATIII standards by increasing the criterion power. It significantly increases the estimates accuracy of the accuracy characteristics obtained during the deciphering of flight information. </p...|$|E
50|$|The {{forerunner of}} RLAT/RLatSM is RVSM - Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minima</b> - first {{introduced}} in 1997, reducing the standard altitude spacing between aircraft from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet. RVSM allowed more aircraft {{to operate on}} the same route, thereby improving fuel efficiency and performance. On the North Atlantic the concept of reducing the standard lateral separation was discussed at NAT SPG meetings {{as far back as}} the 1960s. The successful implementation of RVSM and also a Reduced Longitudinal Separation program allowed progress on the RLAT issue.|$|R

40|$|A {{compromise}} solution to increase flight efficiency in cruise, but without penalising capacity (or even safety), would be perhaps to remove (or relax) the minimum {{rate of climb}} (ROC) constraint and/or to reduce {{the height of the}} step climbs in cruise. In this paper, the benefits (in terms of total operating costs) and the associated impact on the air traffic management (ATM) of such “relaxed cruise” operations are quantified for a representative medium-haul aircraft under different scenarios, by means of an in-house trajectory optimisation software. Results show that by reducing the minimum ROC from 500 to 300 ftmin- 1, whilst keeping the step climb height according to current reduced <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minima</b> (RVSM) standard would give a good compromise between cost savings and impact on the ATM.

In {{many parts of the}} world today the continuing growth of commercial air traffic is running up against limits brought on by overuse of aviation resources. Air corridors in Europe and on transoceanic air routes are operating at maximum capacity. Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs) are working these challenges on two levels—near-term incremental improvements and long-term visionary changes. Each country has a CAA; ours being the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Near-term solutions focus on better utilization of resources such as air space and frequency spectrum and improved performance of air traffic control facilities. Long-term visionary changes, such as free flight, could fundamentally change the current civil aviation business process model. CAA policies and standards are driving near-term improvements and migration toward long-term objectives. This initiative is referred as Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM). Implementation of the U. S. military’s vision, Global Reach/Global Power, requires the ability to rapidly deploy armed forces to major regional conflicts anywhere in the world, and to sustain these forces for as long as it takes to resolve these conflicts. To achieve this goal and accomplish rapid deployments while at the same time minimizing costs, the Air Force has adopted a solution that makes extensive use of CNS/ATM. The Air Force calls its initiative Global Air Traffic Management (GATM). Air Force aircraft equipped with GATM avionics will be able to use CNS/ATM capabilities such as reduced <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minimum</b> (RVSM), 8. 33 kHz data links, automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B), and global communication networks. These capabilities make possible improved flight safety, lower fuel costs, and quicker turn times. The Air Force Flight Test Center supports the GATM initiative by providing Air Traffic Control (ATC) Communications Test Facilities and Avionic System Test (ACTFAST) capabilities to support aircraft modification programs...|$|E
40|$|A {{motivation}} {{exists to}} formulate and implement new tools and methodologies {{to address the}} problem of congestion in the National Airspace System (NAS). This thesis presents a novel methodology for allocating aircraft among En Route flight levels as a means to mitigate air traffic congestion and stakeholder operating costs. The core of the methodology is a decision-aiding tool comprised of a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) that is solved using a an A* Search-based Branch & Bound framework. Two metrics, measuring cumulative delay reduction and fuel burn savings, are used to benchmark the performance of the methodology. A combination of these two metrics is also explored as a means to minimize overall airline operating costs. A subsection of the Northeast Corridor is modeled and forms part of the analytic structure used to quantify the potential benefits of the proposed methodology. Simulations are generated from these models in order to gain an understanding of the benefits as they relate to varying NAS conditions. The following scenarios were modeled: 1) A baseline single jetway corridor, 2) Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minimum</b> (RVSM), 3) Miles in Trail (MIT) restrictions on corridor traffic, and 4) the merging of Terminal Area air traffic with En route air traffic. Thus, this research also provides a preliminary, quantitative measure of the delay reduction, fuel burn savings and operating cost savings possible under each scenario, within a NAS corridor setting. Results indicate that 8. 5 minutes of delay reduction per flight can be achieved when minimizing air traffic delay. Similarly, 16. 47 kg/min of fuel burn savings per flight can be achieved when minimizing air traffic fuel burn. Instituting RVSM procedures result in an additional 45 % of delay(cont.) reduction. Imposing MIT restrictions result in a 41 % loss of delay reduction savings. These results were obtained for corridor simulations of 30 minutes in duration. Finally, the methodology is shown to be effective for use as a decision-aiding tool to merge air traffic streams. by Antonio Manuel Abad. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In {{air traffic}} management, {{conflict}} detection algorithms {{are used to}} determine whether or not aircraft are predicted to lose horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minima</b> within a time interval assuming a trajectory model. In the case of linear trajectories, conflict detection algorithms have been proposed that are both sound, i. e., they detect all conflicts, and complete, i. e., they do not present false alarms. In general, for arbitrary nonlinear trajectory models, it is possible to define detection algorithms that are either sound or complete, but not both. This paper considers the case of nonlinear aircraft trajectory models based on polynomial functions. In particular, it proposes a conflict detection algorithm that precisely determines whether, given a lookahead time, two aircraft flying polynomial trajectories are in conflict. That is, it has been formally verified that, assuming that the aircraft trajectories are modeled as polynomial functions, the proposed algorithm is both sound and complete...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} the current scenario of air traffic over Malaysian airspace {{and its impact}} on existing routes and capacity. In dealing with the increase of capacity, ICAO has embarked on implementing several new measures that would accommodate more aircrafts and the same time maintaining the highest level of safety. Those measures are outlined in ICAO’s Doc 9574 and 9937. Instead of introducing more routes, which up to one point could reach its maximum saturation point, ICAO has introduced Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minima</b> (RVSM). RVSM increases the number of aircraft that can be accommodated on the given route. The Malaysian airspace is strategically located {{in the middle of the}} Westbound and Eastbound routes over the Asia Pacific region. This is an added advantage for the installation the Height Monitoring Unit for RVSM performance of aircraft. Generally, almost all of the aircraft overflying Malaysian airspace are already at their optimum flight levels. This paper uses the trend for year 2010 and 2011 data provided by the Department of Civil Aviation of Malaysia in the analysis. The paper analyses the current scenario of air traffic safety over Malaysian airspace and identifies suggestions to develop a system that could extract information from ADS-B for height monitoring purposes...|$|R
40|$|The Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is joint {{program with}} NASA and DLR (German Aerospace Center) {{of a highly}} {{modified}} Boeing 747 -SP. The purpose of this modification is to include a 2. 5 m infrared telescope in a rear bulkhead of the airplane, with a retractable door open to the atmosphere. The NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) is responsible for verifying that the aerodynamics, acoustics, and flying qualities of the modified aircraft stay within safe limits. Flight testing includes determining meteorological limitations of the aircraft, which is done by setting strict temporary operating limits and verifying through data analysis, what conditions are acceptable. Line operations are calibration tests of various telescope instruments that are done on the ground prior to flights. The method in determining limitations {{for this type of}} operation {{is similar to that of}} flight testing, but the meteorological limitations are different. Of great concern are the particulates near the surface that could cause damage to the telescope, as well as condensation forming on the mirror. Another meteorological involvement for this program is the process of obtaining Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minimums</b> (RVSM) Certification from the FAA. This heavily involves obtaining atmospheric data pertinent to the flight, analyzing data to actual conditions for validity, and computing necessary results for comparison to aircraft instrumentation...|$|R
5000|$|Evidence {{very quickly}} emerged {{to suggest that}} the {{aircraft}} had run out of fuel: the flight attendant who survived the accident reported that the captain's final words were [...] "there is no fuel", and transmissions to that effect from the pilots to ATC were overheard by crews of other aircraft, and recorded in the control tower. Shortly after the crash, the person leading the investigation stated that there was [...] "no evidence of fuel in the aircraft" [...] and the aircraft did not catch fire when it crashed. Analysis of the FDR showed all four engines flamed out a few minutes before the crash. Four weeks after the crash the investigation confirmed that the cause of the crash was fuel exhaustion. Poor planning by the airline and poor oversight by aviation authorities in Bolivia were cited as contributory factors. Due to restrictions imposed by the aircraft not being compliant with reduced <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> <b>minima</b> (RVSM) regulations, the submitted flight plan, with a nominated cruising flight level (FL) higher than 280 (approximately 28000 ft in altitude), was in violation of protocols. The flight plan, which was approved by AASANA, included a cruising altitude of FL300 (approximately 30000 ft). [...] The flight plan was sent for review to Colombian and Brazilian authorities as well, in accordance with regional regulations. The aircraft was estimated to be overloaded by nearly 400 kg. The preliminary accident report stated the pilots had discussed their fuel state and possible fuel stops en route. For unknown reasons, the CVR stopped recording an hour and forty minutes before the FDR, when the aircraft was still about [...] away from the crash site at the Rionegro VOR.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} concept for {{precision}} departures based on satellite navigation augmented by either a wide area or local differential GPS {{such as the}} Satellite Based Augmentation System (SBAS) and Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS). The simplest version consists of an “inverted” precision approach in which the aircraft follows the glide path on an opposite track. As a next step, an extended capability allows for lateral area navigation combined with an angular climb out path. Both concepts are tested and evaluated using the Generic Cockpit Simulator GECO operated by the DLR Institute of Flight Guidance. These trajectories could either be encoded in the aircraft navigation database analogue to SBAS LPV approaches or broadcast by a GBAS ground station with terminal area path (TAP) functionality. Moreover, we show initial results in deriving requirements for a 4 dimensional performance based navigation concept defined as a 4 D Required Navigation Performance (4 D RNP). A four dimensional RNP concept needs {{to be seen as}} an extension of the current RNP X definitions and must include a required navigation performance for the vertical and the along track dimension as well as for time. The derivation of the requirements is based on the existing standards for Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minima</b> (RVSM) and radar separation combined with the required probabilities concerning Target Level of Safety (TLS). An operational implementation of 4 D RNP airspace would require trajectory management and continuous data connection between air traffic control and the aircraft. The along-track or longitudinal component is tightly connected to the time component by means of speed and the required time of arrival at each given waypoint.

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} investigating {{a new concept}} {{of operations for the}} National Airspace System, designed to improve capacity while maintaining or improving current levels of safety. This concept, known as Distributed Air/Ground Traffic Management (DAG-TM), allows appropriately equipped autonomous aircraft to maneuver freely for flight optimization while resolving conflicts with other traffic and staying out of special use airspace and hazardous weather. While Airborne Separation Assurance System (ASAS) tools would normally allow pilots to resolve conflicts before they become hazardous, evaluation of system performance in sudden, near-term conflicts is needed in order to determine concept feasibility. If an acceptable safety level can be demonstrated in these situations, then operations may be conducted with lower <b>separation</b> <b>minimums.</b> An experiment was conducted in NASA Langley s Air Traffic Operations Lab to address issues associated with resolving near-term conflicts and the potential use of lower <b>separation</b> <b>minimums.</b> Sixteen commercial airline pilots flew a total of 32 traffic scenarios that required them to use prototype ASAS tools to resolve close range pop-up conflicts. Required separation standards were set at either 3 or 5 NM lateral spacing, with 1000 ft <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> being used for both cases. Reducing the lateral separation from 5 to 3 NM did not appear to increase operational risk, as indicated by the proximity to the intruder aircraft. Pilots performed better when they followed tactical guidance cues provided by ASAS than when they didn't follow the guidance. As air-air separation concepts are evolved, further studies will consider integration issues between ASAS and existing Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems (ACAS). These types of non-normal events will require the ASAS to provide effective alerts and resolutions prior to the time that an Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) would give a Resolution Advisory (RA). When an RA is issued, a pilot must take immediate action in order to avoid a potential near miss. The Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II currently functions as an ACAS aboard commercial aircraft. Depending on the own aircraft s altitude, TCAS only issues RA s 15 - 35 seconds prior to the Closest Point of Approach (CPA). Prior to an RA, DAG-TM pilots operating autonomous aircraft must rely solely on ASAS for resolution guidance. An additional area of DAG-TM concept feasibility relates to a potential reduction in separation standards. Lower separation standards are likely needed in order to improve NAS efficiency and capacity. Current <b>separation</b> <b>minimums</b> are based in large part on the capabilities of older radar systems. Safety assessments are needed to determine the feasibility of reduced <b>separation</b> <b>minimums.</b> They will give strong consideration to surveillance system performance, including accuracy, integrity, and availability. Candidate surveillance systems include Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and multi-lateration systems. Considering studies done for Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minimums</b> (RVSM) operations, it is likely that flight technical errors will also be considered. In addition to a thorough evaluation of surveillance system performance, a potential decision to lower the separation standards should also take operational considerations into account. An ASAS Safety Assessment study identified improper maneuvering in response to a conflict (due to ambiguous or improper resolution commands or a pilot s failure to comply with the resolution) as a potential safety risk. If near-term conflicts with lower <b>separation</b> <b>minimums</b> were determined to be more challenging for pilots, the severity of these risks could be even greater...|$|R
5000|$|To {{mitigate}} the described problem, many recommend, as legally allowed in very limited authorized airspace, that planes fly {{one or two}} miles offset {{from the center of}} the airway (to the right side) thus eliminating the problem only in the head-on collision scenario. The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) [...] "Procedures for Air Navigation--Air Traffic Management Manual," [...] authorizes lateral offset only in oceanic and remote airspace worldwide. [...] However, this workaround for the particular case of a head-on collision threat on a common assigned airway fails to address the navigation paradox in general, and it fails to specifically address the inherent system safety fault intolerance inadvertently designed into international air traffic safety regulations.4 [...] To be specific, in the cases of intersecting flight paths where either aircraft is not on an airway (for example, flying under a [...] "direct" [...] clearance, or a temporary diversion clearance for weather threats), or where intersecting aircraft flights are on deliberately intersecting airways, these more general threats receive no protection from flying one or two miles to the right of the center of the airway. Intersecting flight paths must still intersect somewhere. As with the midair collision over Germany, an offset to the right of an airway would have simply changed the impact point by a mile or two away from where the intersection actually did occur. Of the 342 deaths since 1997 so far encouraged by the lack of a linear cruising altitude rule (like ACCAR) improvement to the fault intolerance of the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, only the head-on collision over the Amazon could have been prevented if either pilot had been flying an offset to the right of the airway centerline. In contrast, ACCAR systematically separates conflicting traffic in all airspace at all altitudes on any heading, whether over the middle of the ocean or over high-density multinational-interface continental airspace. Nothing about Reduced <b>Vertical</b> <b>Separation</b> <b>Minima</b> (RVSM) system design addresses the inherent vulnerability of the air traffic system to expected faults in hardware and human performance, as experienced in the Namibian, German, Amazon and Japanese accidents.5 ...|$|R
50|$|A {{conflict}} {{is an event}} in which two or more aircraft experience a loss of <b>minimum</b> <b>separation.</b> This does not in itself suggest that the aircraft are at any risk of collision.

Conflicts are detected by data assistants, who report them to the actual controllers; the data assistants suggest how to solve the conflict, but the controller is not obligated to follow the suggested instructions. A conflict occurs when the distance between aircraft in flight violates a defining criterion, usually considered as 5 nautical miles (9 km) of horizontal and/or 1000 feet of <b>vertical</b> <b>separation.</b> These distances define an aircraft's protected zone, a volume of airspace surrounding the aircraft which should not be infringed upon by any other aircraft.|$|R

Economic theory predicts that vertical integration fosters socially optimal investment, whereas, due to potential hold-up problems, both <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> and hybrid forms cause severe underinvestment. We test these theoretical predictions in a laboratory experiment and find evidence that, in a vertically integrated environment, the level of investment in rolling stock and in rail infrastructure is roughly socially optimal. The complete absence of a discrepancy in our experimental results between <b>vertical</b> <b>separation</b> and the hybrid organisational structure, contradicting the predictions of model-theory, is surprising and {{can be attributed to}} the relatively high investments in the separated model. This contradiction might also be explained by the existence of social preferences. game theory, <b>vertical</b> <b>separation,</b> railways, experimental economics...|$|R
