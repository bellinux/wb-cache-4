40|$|It is {{observed}} that reclamation of natural rubber latex based rubber using 2, 2 '-dibenzamidodiphenyldisulphide as reclaiming agent is an optional methodology for recycling of waste latex rubber (WLR). For progressive replacement of virgin natural rubber by the reclaim, two alternatives curing system were investigated: adjustment or {{reduction of the}} curing system with increasing reclaim content, {{to compensate for the}} extra amount of curatives brought along by the reclaim. For fixed curing system, as if the reclaim were equivalent to virgin NR. The cure behavior, final crosslink density and distribution, mechanical properties, and dynamic viscoelastic properties of the blends with reclaimed WLR are measured and compared with the <b>virgin</b> <b>compound.</b> The morphology of the blends, sulfur migration, and final distribution are analyzed. The mechanical and dynamic viscoelastic properties deteriorate for both curing systems, but to a lesser extent for fixed curing system compared to adjusted curing system. With the fixed cure system, many properties like tensile strength and compression set do still deteriorate, but tan δ and M 300 /M 100, representative for the rolling resistance of tires are improved. On the other hand, with the adjusted cure system both mechanical and dynamic properties still deteriorate...|$|E
40|$|Issue: Ground rubber from tires, buffings, {{and other}} sources is {{commonly}} added into rubber compounds in order to lower costs and to use recyclate. Best Practice: The size of the ground rubber material varies from 6 to 100 mesh. Smaller particles are available but are not commonly used. When ground rubber is added as a filler, three things almost always occur: 1. The viscosity of the rubber compound increases; 2. The tensile strength is lowered; and 3. The dynamic properties are reduced. One of the biggest reasons manufacturers use ground rubber as fillers in virgin compounds is to reduce costs. The ground rubber costs less than the <b>virgin</b> <b>compound</b> and the price reduction is generally {{in proportion to the}} level of ground rubber added. Development continues on surface modification, devulcanization, and treatments and binders to minimize the negative effects on properties and in fact enhance the properties of compounds containing ground rubber. Implementation: Ground rubber is added into the rubber compound using an internal mixer. It is commonly used at levels from 5 - 75 %, depending on the application. Tires and high performance compounds use 3 - 10 %, and mats, dock fenders, bedliners, and similar low dynamic stress products can use from 10 - 75 % ground rubber. The smaller the particle size of the rubber, the less the negative effect on the compound properties. Benefits: The following data shows the effects of a 20 mesh, ambient-ground rubber compounded into an SBR 1502 compound. The ground rubber has been evaluated at 17, 33, and 50 % levels. The compound recipe is as follows...|$|E
40|$|Produced by {{existing}} {{size reduction}} technologies, rubber crumb {{is the most}} valuable type of recycled material. However, only {{a limited amount of}} untreated crumb can be used in new tyres due to significant property loss. The de-vulcanisation process offers the potential for providing high quality recycled material that {{can be used as a}} substitute for virgin rubber. Rubber materials produced during industrial trials that formed the development stages of the novel DeVulCO” 2 de-vulcanisation technology, were used in this work. A practical way to characterise de-vulcanised and re-vulcanised waste tyre materials and blends with <b>virgin</b> <b>compound</b> was established. This work showed that simple to obtain and understand parameters, acquired from tests that are commonly used in the rubber industry, such as Mooney viscosity, Mooney relaxation and curing can be successfully used to indicate the efficiency of the de-vulcanisation process and hence, to assist the research and development stages of the de-vulcanisation process and to assure quality control. Good correlation was evident between these parameters and the network characterisation parameter (Vr) obtained from the swelling measurements that are known to be a reliable guide but are more time consuming to perform. In this work, the Mooney relaxation test was successfully extended to characterise some de-vulcanised compounds (automotive weather strip and clothing tape). In addition, the swollen-state 1 H-NMR technique was successfully applied to characterise de-vulcanised and subsequently re-vulcanised “closed-loop” tyre materials. A new tool to measure the efficiency of the de-vulcanisation process has been devised, based on a comparison of the peak areas in the olefinic region of rubber extracts analysed by the liquid 1 H-NMR technique. This technique is capable of characterising different components of a rubber blend (e. g. NR, BR) and is suitable for carbon black filled compounds. The results of this work have confirmed the potential of the DeVulCO” 2 technology and have indicated that up to 20...|$|E

40|$|NoMethods of {{recycling}} unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) window frame waste were investigated. The quality of untreated granular waste {{was compared to}} that of waste treated by a range of contaminant removal processes including melt filtration and dissolution. Processability of each recyclate was evaluated by using a highly instrumented single screw extruder that enabled melt viscosity and process variation to be monitored in real time. Product quality measurements such as mechanical properties and surface defects were made on extruded strip, {{and the nature of the}} stabilizers present was determined. The mechanical properties of recyclates were found to be comparable to or better than those of virgin material in all cases and conformed to industry standards for window profile. Contaminant removal stages significantly reduced the amount of large surface defects detected in extrudate. Processability was comparable to that of <b>virgin</b> <b>compounds,</b> but melt viscosity varied among different batches of recyclate, depending on the source and composition of the original PVC formulation...|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and characterization of two series of novel triphenylene-based benzene-bridged symmetric discotic dimers. Two triphenylene discotics have been {{connected to a}} rigid benzene ring via flexible methylene spacers. In one series, triphenylene moiety was tethered with benzene via an ester linkage, while in the second series it is via an ether linkage. Within each series, {{the orientation of the}} linkage of the triphenylene core around the benzene core has been changed by substituting the benzene ring at o-, m-, and p-positions. These materials have been characterized from their spectral and elemental analysis. The thermotropic liquid crystalline properties were investigated by polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction studies. All the <b>virgin</b> <b>compounds</b> do not display any mesomorphism; however, their charge transfer complexes with trinitrofluorenone, an electron acceptor, exhibited columnar mesophases. The direct current (dc) conductivity of charge transfer complexes at two ratios has been studied at variable temperature. The small conductivity value demonstrates that long spacers as well as connectivity to the rigid benzene ring dilute the column packing, hence making π-π interaction less efficient for the entire column length.

40|$|Two {{types of}} ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) rubbers, namely an {{efficient}} vulcanized (EV) and a semiefficient vulcanized (SEV), {{have been used}} to produce devulcanizates in a continuous setup.

The influence of mixing it with <b>virgin</b> rubber <b>compound,</b> the addition of extra sulfur, the operating devulcanization conditions, and the excess of devulcanizing agent on the mechanical properties (hardness, tensile strength, and compression set) of the reclaim rubbers are studied. Most of the reclaims produced show slightly inferior mechanical properties compared to the virgin rubber. Surface imperfection was observed on the devulcanizate with high devulcanizing agent content. Excellent mechanical properties (all above the standards) of the reclaim were found when the devulcanized profile material was used (EV-EPDM) to replace the virgin one for application as a roofing sheet material (SEV-EPDM) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The use of {{reclaimed}} and devulcanised {{material in}} <b>virgin</b> rubber <b>compounds</b> has {{attracted the attention}} of many rubber industries due to increasing raw material costs, diminishing resources and growing awareness of environmental issues. Several methods have been developed to reclaim rubber waste, for example, thermo- and chemo-mechanical processes, microwave regeneration, microbial action and ultrasonic regeneration. However, extensive research on processes for high-quality recycling materials based on waste tyres is still lacking. In this study, optimised processing conditions for the devulcanisation of whole passenger car tyres using diphenyldisulphide (DPDS) as a devulcanisation aid will be applied. The devulcanised ground tyre rubber (D-GTR) obtained from the process was blended on top of the original tyre tread formulation at different concentrations. The results so far indicate that the addition of D-GTR influences the properties of the blend, but to a lesser extent than the commercially used powder or reclaim types do, for which loadings less than 5 % can be applied. The main reason for the influence of D-GTR on the rubber properties is inhomogeneities in the D-GTR/virgin rubber blend and quality aspects of raw GTR...|$|R
40|$|Issue: In the {{production}} of <b>virgin</b> rubber <b>compounds</b> and new products it is often necessary to adhere or bond the rubber to another rubber piece, fabric, or metal. This best practice describes the materials used in these applications. Best Practice: Bonding Agents – This type is commonly used to adhere rubber to metal, plastic, and other rubber compounds. These agents are specialty prepared solvent and water based adhesives that are commonly applied to the bonding substrate. A primer is usually applied. Little is disclosed about {{the composition of the}} bonding agents. Internal Adhesives, Bonding Agents, Binders – For metal and fiber reinforcement, such as steel belts and fabric in tires, hoses, and belts, a HRH (Hexa, Resourcinol, Hi-Sil) system is employed. This system involves adding Hexamethylene tetramine (HMT) or HMMM, resourcinol and precipitated silica into the rubber compound. This increases the stiffness of the unvulcanized rubber and the modulus of the cured rubber. The adhesion, or pull-out, force of steel or fabric from rubber is greatly enhanced with this method. Recently, polymers with maleic anhydride modification have been introduced. EPDM, Hypalon, and PBD are currently available with this treatment. The compounds containing these modified polymer...|$|R

40|$|Issue: Almost all <b>virgin</b> rubber <b>compounds</b> (99 %) utilize either {{carbon black}} or {{inorganic}} fillers such as precipitated or fumed silica, clay, ground or precipitated calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide {{and several others}} as reinforcing agents and/or extenders for rubber compounds. Recycled rubber contains the same fillers as the virgin rubber from which the recyclate was produced. Best Practice: There are significant quantities of mineral fillers used in rubber compounds. These include both natural and synthetic fillers. The major synthetic filler used is precipitated silica. This silica is 0. 02 micron in average particle size. The silica is added to enhance the modulus and tear strength of tire compounds. It is also used as an ingredient in fabric and wire bonding systems. The silica, along with resorcinol and hexamethylene melamine, are used extensively in wire adhesion systems. Typically 10 - 12 phr of silica is used. In addition, several tire compounds designed for very low rolling resistance have 60 phr of silica coupled with a silane coupling agent to achieve vary low tangent delta values in the tread. The silica has an average surface area of 150 - 175 square meters per gram. About 200 million pounds of silica are used {{per year in the}} U. S. and growing rapidly. Clay is also used as a semi-reinforcing agent for rubber, and about 900 million pounds is used per year i...|$|R
40|$|Issue: The {{thermodynamically}} irreversible {{reaction of}} sulfur and rubber molecules creates a three dimensional network of sulfur polymer molecules. These crosslinks create the useful viscoelastic properties of rubber compounds. The crosslinked rubber possesses useful dynamic properties and good physical properties. The {{problem is that}} after the rubber article has used up its useful life, {{it is difficult to}} devulcanize the rubber compound and produce a useful material. Best Practice: Microwave energy is part of the electromagnetic spectra. The process utilizes frequencies of 915 and 2450 Mhz according to the Goodyear Tire microwave patent. The process produces rubber material that is reportedly devulcanized using impulses that can rupture atomic and molecular bonds. Microwave devulcanization involves exposing rubber materials to microwave energy under controlled conditions. These conditions theoretically sever sulfur binds and produce a rubber material that can be compounded and used in <b>virgin</b> rubber <b>compounds.</b> Implementation: Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. obtained a patent for the use of microwave energy in “devulcanizing ” rubber compounds in the late 1970 s. They used the process to “devulcanize” sort ends of hose trim and out of specification EPDM hose. The resulting material, with the proper compound adjustments, such as oil/filler ratios, could be added back into non-OE and other industrial EPDM hose and industrial goods. The process was used for many years and then abandoned due to unfavorable economics. Benefits: The major benefit of the process was to take scrap rubber ends and out of tolerance EPDM hose and produce a useful recycled product that was added to new rubber goods...|$|R
40|$|Fresh lemons (Citrus limon L.) {{from two}} {{locations}} in Italy {{were added to}} fresh olives before milling them to produce flavoured olive oils (FOO). FOOs were characterized for their quality parameters, fatty acid composition, biophenol content, volatile compound composition and sensory profile. Sensory results showed that lemon volatiles would mask negative notes of olive oil obtained from olives with slight offflavours by adding strong notes of lemon leaf, albedo and lemon juice, while they decreased the positive notes of olive fruit, green, leaf and bitter-pungent from good quality olives. Flavouring OO with lemon significantly affected quality indices, with a significant increase of the acidity value and UV indices. OO flavouring with fresh lemon also affected the phenolic compounds, particularly the simplest forms, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol. A dramatic decrease of the concentration of aldehydic and dialdehydic forms of oleuropein was also observed in FOO. As expected, volatile profile of virgin OO dramatically changed due to lemons addition, which caused the presence of several terpene compounds, namely limonene, apinene, b-pinene, sabinene, b-mircene and g-terpinene. In contrast, <b>virgin</b> OO volatile <b>compounds</b> decreased with lemon addition. In conclusion, addition of lemon to OO should {{be carried out by}} considering these results, as well as the legislation for this kind of product...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of both compounds and vulcanizates of silica-filled natural rubber (NR) compatibilized with epoxidized {{low molecular weight}} natural rubbers (ELMWNRs) consisting of 12 and 28 mol % epoxide are investigated. The ELMWNRs with a molecular weight range of 50, 000 to 60, 000 g/mol are produced by depolymerization of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) latex using periodic acid, and then used as compatibilizer {{in a range of}} 0 to 15 phr in <b>virgin</b> NR. The <b>compounds</b> with LMWNR without epoxide groups, and with bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide (TESPT) coupling agent are also prepared for comparison purpose. Incorporation of ELMWNRs lowers Mooney viscosity and Payne effect to the level closed to that of silica/TESPT compound, and clearly enhances the modulus and tensile strength of vulcanizates compared to the compounds with no compatibilizer and LMWNR. The higher epoxide groups content results in the better tensile properties but somewhat less than the compound with TESPT. Addition of extra sulfur into the compounds with LMWNR and ELMWNRs to compensate for the sulfur released from silane molecule in the silica/TESPT system shows small influence on Mooney viscosity, but remarkably enhances 300 % modulus, tensile strength and loss tangent at 60 oC {{as a result of the}} better network formation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{discovery}} of natural compounds capable of modulating nervous system function has revealed new perspectives for a healthier brain. Here, we investigated the effects of oleic acid (OA) and hydroxytyrosol (HTyr), two important extra <b>virgin</b> olive oil <b>compounds,</b> on lipid synthesis in C 6 glioma cells. OA and HTyr inhibited both de novo fatty acid and cholesterol syntheses without affecting cell viability. The inhibitory effect of the individual compounds was more pronounced if OA and HTyr were administered in combination. A reduction of polar lipid biosynthesis was also detected, while triglyceride synthesis was marginally affected. To clarify the lipid-lowering mechanism of these compounds, their effects on the activity of key enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase-ACC and fatty acid synthase-FAS) and cholesterologenesis (3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase-HMGCR) were investigated in situ by using digitonin-permeabilized C 6 cells. ACC and HMGCR activities were especially reduced after 4 [*]h of 25 [*]μM OA and HTyr treatment. No change in FAS activity was observed. Inhibition of ACC and HMGCR activities is corroborated by the decrease of their mRNA abundance and protein level.

40|$|Ambient {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} has revolutionized {{the area of}} mass spectrometric analysis by allowing the analysis of organic and inorganic compounds in their native environment without sample preparation. Eliminating sample preparation has consequently reduced analysis time by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional mass spectrometry techniques such as those involving liquid and gas chromatography. This has been true especially {{in the analysis of}} plant materials, where extensive extraction and purification steps are typically required prior to mass analysis. Here we report on applications of different ambient ionization methods developed in our laboratory for direct analysis of biologically relevant compounds in plant materials. ^ The first part of this thesis discusses the use of the low temperature plasma (LTP) probe for qualitative analysis of extra <b>virgin</b> olive oil. <b>Compounds</b> which could be used to determine the authenticity of extra virgin olive oil such as free fatty acids and phenolic compounds were detected without the need for organic solvents or extraction processes. The second part of the thesis explores the direct analysis of chlorophyll catabolites in senescent plant tissues using desorption ionization (DESI) mass spectrometry. Non-fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites (NCCs), which are the final products of chlorophyll degradation, were detected and their molecular structures confirmed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and reactive-DESI experiments. A novel imprinting method for imaging the spatial distribution of plant metabolites is described as well. Lastly, the relatively new paper spray ionization method was applied for direct analysis of polar lipids in green microalgae. A multi-step experimental protocol was employed to successfully characterize four classes of lipids in microalgae without the need for sample preparation. A novel approach for determining the position of unsaturation in olefins using reactive-paper spray ionization is described. Ozone produced in situ using simple low temperature plasma was used as the reagent molecule to cleave double bonds in the ions being analyzed by mass spectrometry. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this era}} of rapid {{development}} and economic growth, waste management is of high concern for humans. According to statistics, {{a great amount of}} rubber waste materials are produced annually. The major amount of these waste rubber material comes from scrap tires. Only a few percent of the waste rubber materials are recycled and made into new products. Recycling of waste rubber has a certain problem: the crosslink structure of thermoset rubber. Due to the presence of three dimensional crosslink structures in rubber products, they cannot be reprocessed by application of heat, like we do for thermoplastic materials. In order to recycle and reuse the vulcanized rubber {{we have to find a}} way to cleave the crosslink bonds. This technique which can break down the crosslink bonds in the rubber is called devulcanization. Different devulcanization processes are utilizing heat, chemicals, ultrasound, and mechanical stresses in order to break down the crosslink structure of vulcanized rubber and convert the insoluble thermoset rubber into a soft and sticky material which can be processed and vulcanized again. Comparing various devulcanization processes, the thermo-mechanical devulcanization process which applies mechanical forces and heat to break down the crosslink network of rubber is very effective. One of the common ways to maintain the required shear stresses and mechanical forces to cleave and break down the crosslink structure of vulcanized rubber is utilizing the extrusion process. In this research, twin screw extruders are preferred due to their modular designs which enable us to adjust the different levels of shearing on the material. In order to facilitate the extrusion process supercritical carbon dioxide is used. Supercritical carbon dioxide diffuses into the rubber particles during the devulcanization process and facilitates the process by expanding and softening the rubber particles. In this research we have established a high throughput devulcanization process to produce devulcanized scrap tire rubber at an industrial scale. The effect of different process parameters on obtained devulcanized rubber properties, such as network structure, rheological properties, and physical and mechanical properties are studied. Results showed that in the range of our experiment design, the only effective parameter on crosslink density and Mooney viscosity of the devulcanized scrap tire is feed rate. Using Horikx theory, it was shown that the devulcanization mechanism for our scrap tire devulcanization process is a selective crosslink cleavage rather than a random chain scission. The obtained devulcanized rubber was then incorporated in a <b>virgin</b> tire rubber <b>compound</b> and the impact of devulcanized rubber utilization on tire compound performance was studied. Results showed that incorporation of devulcanized rubber into a tire tread compound up to 30 percent does not deteriorate the tire tread properties in a significant manner. Finally, a high throughput devulcanization process was established for scrap ethylene-diene-propylene (EDPM) rubber devulcanization. The effects of main process variables on the properties of the devulcanized EPDM rubber were studied. It was observed that crosslink density and Mooney viscosity of the devulcanized EPDM rubber are affected by the feed rate and screw speed in a significant manner. 1 yea...|$|R
