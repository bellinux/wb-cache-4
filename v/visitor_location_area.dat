50|$|In a GSM network, when a Mobile Station (MS) is {{switched}} ON, the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) attach {{procedure is}} executed. This procedure {{is required for}} the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register (VLR) to register the MS in the network. If the MS has changed <b>Location</b> <b>area</b> (LA) while it was powered off, then the IMSI attach procedure will lead to a Location update.|$|R
40|$|Location {{management}} in mobile environments {{consists of two}} major operations: location update and paging. The more up-to-date the location information, the less paging becomes necessary and vice versa. The conventional approach is the <b>location</b> <b>area</b> based approach (LA-based approach), where a <b>location</b> <b>area</b> (LA) consists of multiple cells. When the mobile station (MS) enters a new <b>location</b> <b>area,</b> the MS immediately updates its location information at the new location's <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> register (VLR) and this update is propagated to the MS's home location register (HLR). The major drawback of the LA-based approach {{is that it does}} not consider any mobility patterns, or call arrival patterns. Moreover, MS updates frequently when it roams only within the boundary cells of different <b>location</b> <b>areas,</b> resulting in unnecessary location updates. So, there is a need for an efficient algorithm which can eliminate the drawbacks of the LA-based approach. To this end, an adaptive location management algorithm is described in this paper: an MS dynamically determines whether or not to update when it moves to a new LA, so that each location update becomes a necessary location update, i. e., in each updated <b>location</b> <b>area</b> at least one call is made. We have conducted experiments to capture the effect of mobility and call arrival patterns on the new location update strategy. We have also tested our algorithm with SUMATRA (Stanford University Mobile Activity TRAces), which has been validated against real data on call and mobility traces. Experimental results show that our adaptive location management algorithm considerably reduces the location management cost, by avoiding unnecessary location updates...|$|R

40|$|The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as the modern digital mobile network architecture. Increasing market demands point toward the relevancy of security-related issues in communications. The security requirements of mobile communications for the mobile users include: (1) the authentication of the mobile user and <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register/Home Location Register; (2) the data confidentiality between mobile station and <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register, and the data confidentiality between <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register and <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register/Home Location Register (VLR/HLR); (3) the location privacy of mobile user. However, GSM does not provide enough security functions to meet these requirements. We propose three improved methods to enhance the security, to reduce the storage space, to eliminate the sensitive information stored in VLR, and consequently to improve {{the performance of the}} system. Proposed methods include an improved authentication protocol for the mobile station, a data confidentiality protocol, and a location privacy protocol. The merit of the proposed methods is to improve but not to alter the existing architecture of the system. Furthermore, this study also performs computational and capacity analyses to evaluate the original GSM system and proposed approaches on a comparative basis...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{key issues}} {{in the design of}} {{personal}} communication service (PCS) systems is the efficient management of location information. The current IS- 41 and GSM schemes use a two-tier system of home location register (HLR) and <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> register (VLR) databases. In a two-tier system, the success of a call requires the HLR and the callee’s current VLR to be failure-free. A VLR failure affects incoming calls to mobile hosts in the VLR’s <b>location</b> <b>area.</b> Meanwhile, if the HLR fails, it cannot direct calls to a mobile host from other hosts that are not in the same <b>location</b> <b>area.</b> Thus, tolerating the failures of the VLRs and HLR is important. In this paper, we propose a scheme, which tolerates the failures of the VLRs and HLR at the same time, without adding or changing any hardware of the systems. Moreover, our proposed scheme has lower HLR access rate, which can reduce the cost and delay in updating and querying. Experimental results show that our scheme can improve the performance of updating and querying in comparison with the traditional two-tier scheme. Therefore, our scheme is not only fault-tolerant but also cost effective...|$|R

40|$|In a {{cellular}} phone system, the service area is partitioned into several <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> (LAs). Every LA {{is associated with a}} mobility database called <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register (VLR). When a mobile user enters an LA, the user must register to the VLR before receiving any cellular service. If the VLR is full, the registration procedure fails, and the system cannot deliver services to the user under the existing cellular technology. To resolve this problem, we propose a VLR overflow control scheme to accommodate the incoming mobile users during VLR overflow. Our scheme only requires minor modifications to the existing cellular mobility management protocols. Particularly, no modification is made to the mobile phones. An analytic model is proposed to investigate the performance of the overflow control scheme. When exercising the scheme, the call setup procedure for an "overflow" user is more expensive than that for a "normal" user. Under the range of input parameters considered in our study [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Replication {{strategy}} is mostly useful for replicating the called mobile user’s profile at selected locations where some caller mobile users have higher calling rate. It plays {{important role in}} personal communication services (PCS) {{in order to reduce}} call setup cost and call setup time. In prior replication schemes, replicated sites (<b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> registers) have no inter relationship. We have proposed a novel and innovative replication tree which is buildup from replicated VLRs (<b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> registers). VLRs are replicated based on effective replication probability of caller mobile user. Home location register (HLR) keeps update replica at root VLR in the replication tree and root VLR forwards update replica to a VLR in the replication tree on demand. The main objective of the proposed scheme is to reduce call setup time and call setup cost by enabling replication of called mobile user’s location profile at certain <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> registers (VLRs) where caller mobile user roams. We have presented analytical modeling which shows that setting inter-relationship among the replicated sites helps in further reducing the call setup cost...|$|R

40|$|GSM and IS- 41 are two {{mobility}} management standards {{widely used}} in second generation networks. These two standards lean on a centralized architecture made up of home location registers (HLRs) and <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> registers (VLRs). From these standards, the location update and search procedures always imply interrogation of the HLR, even if the two mobile terminals that want to communicate {{are in the same}} <b>location</b> <b>area.</b> Given the limited bandwidth of the radio operator channel and the new time sensitive applications of third-generation systems, such an approach of mobility management is not convenient for the next generation mobile networks. This paper proposes a method for reducing the processing load and the signalization traffic generated by update and search location procedures compared to IS- 41 standard. Taking into account the specific characteristics of the traffic in the mobile networks, it introduces a semi-dynamic approach based on a hybrid architecture using forwarding pointers without the load related to the dynamic models. Numerical results show that such a method significantly improves the efficiency of location procedures...|$|R

50|$|The {{key feature}} of a mobile phone {{is the ability}} to receive and make calls in any area where {{coverage}} is available. This is generally called roaming from a customer perspective, but also called visiting when describing the underlying technical process. Each geographic area has a database called the <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register (VLR), which contains details of all the mobiles currently in that area. Whenever a phone attaches, or visits, a new <b>area,</b> the <b>Visitor</b> <b>Location</b> Register must contact the Home Location Register to obtain the details for that phone. The current cellular location of the phone (i.e., which BTS it is at) is entered into the VLR record and will be used during a process called paging when the GSM network wishes to locate the mobile phone.|$|R
40|$|Location {{management}} {{deals with}} how to track mobile users within the cellular network. It consists of two basic operations: location update and paging. The total cost of location management {{is the sum of}} the location update cost and the paging cost. There are many location management schemes, <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> and Reporting Centers are two classical and popular location management schemes. To the best of our knowledge, no performance comparison between Reporting Centers and <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> has been reported in the literature. The paper compares the performance of the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme and the Reporting Centers scheme. The motivation for the study is that the <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> can be derived from a given set of reporting centers such that the location update cost difference between the Reporting Centers scheme and the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme is small whereas the paging cost in the Reporting Centers scheme is larger than that in the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme. Given a set of reporting centers, this paper shows how to derive the <b>location</b> <b>areas</b> from the reporting centers, and compares the performance of <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> and Reporting Centers schemes under various mobility models and incoming call arrival rates. Simulation results show that the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme greatly outperforms the Reporting Centers scheme in most cases although the Reporting Centers scheme performs a little bit better than the <b>Location</b> <b>Areas</b> scheme in some extreme cases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—with the {{increasing}} number of mobile terminals, it is a challenge how to reduce the cost and provide fast and efficient call delivery to the mobile terminals. In the existing mobile networks, the call connection between the two terminals is based on the registration of their identity in the databases known as home <b>location</b> register and <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> register. Conventional registration strategies will incur a high volume of signaling traffic. These strategies can work well up to a certain level of call to mobility ratio. In this paper, we propose a storage-based location tracking scheme based on the storage of the location of a mobile terminal at the repository database, which efficiently reduces the location updates and searching cost in the mobile networks.

40|$|AbstractÐIn a {{cellular}} phone system, mobility databases called <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> registers (VLRs) are used to temporarily hold the subscription information of the roaming users who visit the service area of the VLR. When the users leave the VLR area, the corresponding records in the VLR are deleted. Due to user mobility, {{the capacity of the}} VLR may not be large enough to hold information for all visitors in the VLR area at some time periods. This issue is called VLR overflow. This paper describes a record replacement policy to allow mobile users to receive services in the VLR overflow situation. We utilize analytic modeling to investigate the performance of the replacement policy. The study indicates that our approach effectively eliminates the VLR overflow problem with insignificant extra overhead.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a dynamic hierarchical database architecture for location management in personal communications service (PCS) networks. The proposed scheme allows the dynamic adjustments of user location information distribution {{based on the}} mobility and calling patterns of the mobile terminals (MT’s). A unique distribution strategy is determined for each MT, and location pointers are set up at selected remote locations which indicate the current location of the MT’s. This method effectively reduces the signaling and database access overhead for location registration and call delivery. Besides, the required processing is handled by a distributed network of directory registers and centralized coordination is not necessary. The functions of the other network elements, such as the home location register (HLR) and the <b>visitor</b> <b>location</b> registers (VLR’s), remain primarily unchanged. This greatly facilitates the deployment of this scheme in current PCS networks.
