2500|$|Turning {{finally to}} Bilski's method, {{the court held}} it patent-ineligible. First, the court said, Bilski did not argue that the {{rejected}} claims recited any specific or [...] "particular" [...] machine, so that the court found it unnecessary to decide any issues relating to the machine-implementation branch of the test. [...] "We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation, {{as well as the}} answers to particular questions, such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine." [...] Second, the court turned to transformation of articles from one thing or state to another. What is an [...] "article"? Benson had made it clear that tanning hides, smelting ores, and <b>vulcanizing</b> rubber were all instances of transforming articles. This corresponded to the transformation test as the PTO and some amici curiae articulated it: one physical substance is transformed into a second physical substance. But what of electronic signals and electronically manipulated data? Or even more abstract constructs such as legal obligations, which the Bilski case involved? No Supreme Court precedents addressed such entities.|$|E

Over the years, these companies reorganized and merged. In 1922 National <b>Vulcanized</b> Fiber Company emerged as the main competitor to Spaulding Fibre, which had begun developing <b>vulcanized</b> products in Rochester, New Hampshire and Tonawanda, New York, nearly a quarter century after the industry began in Delaware.|$|R
30|$|In {{the study}} on the {{microwave}} desulfurization process of <b>vulcanized</b> rubber, Tang et al. (2006) discover that when the <b>vulcanized</b> rubber samples were irradiated by microwave for 10 and 20  s respectively, their temperatures are 26 and 41  °C, and the sulfur chemical bonds in rubber rupture. It is believed that {{the damage to the}} cross-linked network of the <b>vulcanized</b> rubber is largely attributable to the non-thermal effect of microwaves.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vulcanized</b> fibre is a {{laminated}} plastic {{composed of}} only cellulose. The material is a tough, resilient, hornlike {{material that is}} lighter than aluminium, tougher than leather, and stiffer than most thermoplastics. The newer wood-laminating grade of <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is used to strengthen wood laminations used in skis, skateboards, support beams and as a sub-laminate under thin wood veneers.A product very similar to <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is leatheroid.

50|$|Ebonite is a {{brand name}} for very hard rubber first {{obtained}} by Charles Goodyear by <b>vulcanizing</b> natural rubber for prolonged periods. For <b>vulcanizing</b> natural rubber he received patent number 3633 from the United States Patent Office on June 15, 1844. Besides natural rubber, Ebonite contains about 25-80% sulfur and linseed oil. Its name comes from its intended use as an artificial substitute for ebony wood.|$|E
50|$|The {{rubber liner}} is then heated in an oven where it {{undergoes}} a chemical reaction called <b>vulcanizing,</b> or curing. This makes the rubber strong and pliable.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of interface and bonding between the liner and propellant were systematically studied {{with regard to}} MAPO content, filler and plasticizer types, and <b>vulcanized</b> agent. It was indicated that the bonding strength of liner and propellant arrive the highest value 0. 32 MPa when MAPO contents was 3 % {{and there is a}} little effect on bonding strength for <b>vulcanized</b> parameter. Moreover, the bonding strength gets weaker when the content of plasticizer decreases. Significantly, the molecular sieve can improve bonding strength greatly. Compared with other cure agent, TDI was the best <b>vulcanized</b> agent, and when it was used in the <b>vulcanized</b> system, the highest value of bonding strength between liner and propellant could be obtained...|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{companies}} involved in <b>vulcanized</b> fibre development in the Wilmington region were the Nunsuch Fiber Company, American Hard Fiber Company, American <b>Vulcanized</b> Fibre Company, Continental Fibre Co., Diamond State Fibre Co., and Franklin Fibre Company. In the 1965 Post’s Pulp and Paper Directory, National <b>Vulcanized</b> Fibre Co. was listed as having two mills' producing rag paper for <b>vulcanized</b> fibre. They were at Newark, producing 15 tons a day; and Yorklyn, producing 18 tons a day. This compares with Spaulding Fibre’s Tonawanda plant, then producing 40 tons a day (Post’s directory). The competitors also produced bakelite, but marketed them under different names: Spaulding’s was Spauldite and National’s brand was Phenolite and Iten Industries' Resiten or Itenite.|$|R
40|$|To obtain {{thermoplastic}} polyurethane (TPU) {{with low}} hardness, dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> TPU/polybutadiene rubber(BR) (70 / 30) blends were prepared. The effect of dicumyl peroxide (DCP) content and stabilizers on the tensile strength and {{elongation at break}} of the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> blends was examined. The tensile strength and elongation at break of the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> blends decrease with increasing content of DCP. The addition of optimal content of stabilizer leads to the improvement of tensile strength and elongation at break of the blends. Also, the effect of sulfur cure systems and accelerators on the tensile strength and elongation of the blends was investigated. The tensile strength and elongation at break of all the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> TPU/BR (70 / 30) blends using 1 -step processing are not {{higher than those of}} simple TPU/BR (70 / 30) blends. However, the tensile strength and elongation of the dynamically <b>vulcanized</b> blends prepared at 8 min (mixing time) using 2 -step processing are higher than those of the simple blends...|$|R

50|$|Once the <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is leached {{free of the}} zinc chloride, it is dried to 5 to 6 percent moisture, {{and pressed}} or calendared to flatness. The {{continuous}} process-made <b>vulcanized</b> fibre could then be sheeted or wound up into rolls. The density of the finished <b>vulcanized</b> fibre is 2 to 3 {{times greater than the}} paper from which it starts. The density increase is the result of 10% machine direction shrinkage, 20% cross machine direction shrinkage, and 30% shrinkage in thickness.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final product}} is a {{homogeneous}} nearly 100%-cellulose mass free from any artificial glues, resins, or binders.
