5000|$|For every railway that enters its {{tractive}} units {{into the}} register, a clear European-wide code is needed, {{separate from the}} number. This alphanumerical <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> <b>Marking</b> (VKM) is allocated by a railway administration in accordance with CR OPE TSI. The list of keeper codes is linked below. (The keeper will be different to {{the owner of a}} vehicle where a leasing agreement is in force.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{railway vehicle}} owner's code formed {{part of the}} vehicle number {{on the side of}} a railway coach or wagon. Until 2005 it was used to specify the owner of the wagon. However, the owner code did not {{necessarily}} reflect ownership of a vehicle but rather who had the right to use it. Since then the owner code has been replaced by the UIC country code. The keeper of a vehicle is now indicated with a <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> <b>Marking</b> (VKM). The table shows the former numbers used.|$|E
5000|$|A {{railway vehicle}} must be {{registered}} {{in a national}} vehicle register (NVR) using a 12-digit number derived from the old UIC system of vehicle numbering. The number contains the register country {{in the third and}} fourth digit. The keeper of a vehicle is indicated with a company abbreviation of maximum five letters, called <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> <b>Marking</b> (VKM) which must be registered with OTIF and ERA [...] and is unique throughout Europe and parts of Asia and Northern Africa. The VKM must not contain special signs or digits.|$|E

50|$|Alongside {{the launch}} of the AOS in 2007, DVLA {{announced}} that any company/organisation accessing <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Keeper</b> data via an electronic request process that is not a Local Authority or Government Organisation must be a member of an Accredited Trade Association (ATA).|$|R
50|$|<b>Keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Cousins had a {{night to}} forget at Sunderland in the League Cup as his two glaring errors allowed Darren Bent to score both goals. The U’s more than held their own against the Premier League side though.|$|R
50|$|He joined Bath City in 2002, {{appearing}} in 6 games. He was the backup to first choice <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Hervin. An injury {{at the start}} of the 2003 season left Johnston 3rd choice so he chose transfer to Bishop Sutton.|$|R
50|$|On 4 March 2011, Derby County {{confirmed}} {{that they have}} signed Duke on loan from Hull City {{until the end of}} the season. The loan period was cut short when he was recalled by Hull City following an injury to reserve <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Oxley.|$|R
25|$|Another home tie {{followed}} a week later, and Boro did everything but score against a Fulham side featuring former Boro <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Schwarzer in goal. The keeper kept out several good efforts but his side's steady defence frustrated the home side and meant the game ended 0–0.|$|R
5000|$|Dundalk won {{the game}} with a goal from Richie Towell during extra-time after the game {{finished}} scoreless after ninety minutes.Towell scored when he smashed the ball past Cork City <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> McNulty after a pass from Daryl Horgan.With the win Dundalk claimed their third league and cup double.|$|R
50|$|He {{went on to}} make 36 {{appearances}} in 2003-04, with the club's regular <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Goodlad out injured. He played 32 games in the inaugural season of League One. He was limited to a single Football League Trophy appearance in 2005-06, as the club's No. 1 Goodlad enjoyed his first injury-free season since Brain's arrival.|$|R
50|$|In October 2012, Spoonley was loaned to Wellington Phoenix for {{one week}} due to both regular <b>keepers</b> (<b>Mark</b> Paston and Glen Moss) being out on {{international}} duty. He played one game against Melbourne Heart, which was drawn 1-1. As {{a result of his}} performance he was voted as the goalkeeper in Fox Sports' team of the round.|$|R

50|$|The {{pre-season}} saw Brian Horton {{bring in}} three key players on free transfers: George Pilkington (Everton); Jonny Brain (Newcastle United); and Austrian Andreas Lipa (Skoda Xanthi). Meanwhile, promising <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Goodlad began a lengthy {{period of time}} on the sidelines with injuries. Optimism surrounded the club, after the rebuilding of the new squad appeared to had finished after the break-up of the club's previous team due to financial troubles.|$|R
50|$|Throughout his career, Le Tissier had a fearsome {{reputation}} for scoring from the spot, converting 47 of the 48 penalties {{that he took}} for Southampton. His sole failure to convert came on 24 March 1993 in a match against Nottingham Forest, his spot kick being saved by Forest <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Crossley, the feat being so unique that Crossley describes it as the save {{of which he is}} most proud.|$|R
50|$|He {{moved on}} to {{recently}} relegated Newport County, but as Newport folded and failed to complete their Conference season, he returned to Torquay {{for a third time}} in April 1989 to cover for the injured Ken Veysey and played at Wembley in the final of the Sherpa Van Trophy Final as Torquay's only other professional <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Coombe was cup-tied. He retired from football in June 1989 to work for the Post Office.|$|R
5000|$|Seeking {{guidance}} {{on how to}} repair the veil, Richard and Kahlan request another [...] "gathering"; this involves turning to the [...] "ancestors' spirits" [...] for help. But instead {{of being able to}} speak to the spirits, Richard and Kahlan are sent down to the underworld and are placed face-to-face with Darken Rahl. Rahl touches Richard with the <b>Keeper's</b> <b>mark,</b> making him unconscious and lets Kahlan know that Richard is only minutes away from death.|$|R
50|$|On the register, {{along with}} the vehicle details (make, model, engine capacity, colour, VIN, etc.) are {{recorded}} {{the details of the}} current <b>keeper</b> of the <b>vehicle</b> (name, address). The current keeper is issued with a registration document known as a V5C, which displays the registration details of the vehicle. Each time any of the registration details change, if the <b>vehicle</b> <b>keeper</b> is changed, or any of the vehicle details are changed, for example, the DVLA/DVLNI has to be notified, and a new document is issued.|$|R
5000|$|United dropped {{two points}} in the title race with Chelsea with 1-1 draw at home with Middlesbrough. United took an early lead when Kieran Richardson slotted home after Wayne Rooney had {{collected}} Paul Scholes' pass and rounded Boro <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Schwarzer. However, in stoppage time in the first half, Boro got a deserved equaliser, as Mark Viduka's diving header beat Edwin van der Sar. United struggled to break Boro down after the break and were indebted to Van der Sar's save to thwart Viduka.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{creation}} of the Premier League, Aston Villa and Birmingham City met twice in the Second Round of the 1993–94 League Cup. Villa won both matches 1–0. The game at St Andrew's was settled by a Kevin Richardson goal after his <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Bosnich had saved a penalty from John Frain to keep the game at 0–0. The second leg at Villa Park was notable for a winning goal from Villa's Dean Saunders and a red card for Blues' Paul Tait. Villa {{went on to win the}} trophy.|$|R
50|$|In October 2012 Coyne started {{training}} with Sheffield United as first choice Blades <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Howard was ruled out for 3 months through injury. On 17 November 2012 Coyne signed a 28-day {{deal with the}} Blades as cover for George Long. The contract was extended by a further month on 17 December 2012. He extended his contract once again on 18 February 2013 on a one-month deal keeping him at Bramall Lane {{until the end of}} March. After failing to make a first team appearance Coyne was released by the Blades when his contract expired in June 2013.|$|R
50|$|Pats' {{went into}} the next game against Cork City without midfielders James Chambers and Mark Rossiter through injury and Greg Bolger through {{suspension}} after receiving 4 yellow cards in the league. The Saints did well considering their makeshift midfield, with Darren Meenan Chris Forrester, Sean O'Connor all coming close but Cork City <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> McNulty stopped everything that came at him. City could have won it with a penalty late on but Saints keeper Brendan Clarke saved well for a 0-0 draw that increased his sides unbeaten record in the league at Richmond Park to 22 games.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Daily Mail, Boro’s Aussie international <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Schwarzer said: “It’s a great song. He (Mark Viduka) is already copping some stick about it and I’m going to make sure he gets some more from the Australia camp — I’m going to make sure they get to hear it as well. We played it in the dressing room afterwards and were a bit unsure about it to begin with but the chorus is pretty good. We all sang and I think Mark was a little bit embarrassed by it but I think he enjoyed it” ...|$|R

2500|$|For the {{following}} season, {{there was a}} new head coach (Glenn Myernick) and a new General Manager, Dan Counce. [...] Myernick and Counce brought new faces to the squad including Paul Bravo, Wolde Harris, Ross Paule, and keeper Marcus Hahnemann. [...] The team struggled early on, but rallied to grab a postseason spot. The Rapids pulled off two upsets and advanced to the 1997 MLS Cup final. Chris Henderson scored a mid-air volley past Dallas <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Dodd in the 87th minute in the Western Conference final, ensuring Colorado's place in the MLS Cup final.

Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|R

5000|$|His {{career at}} Boro got {{off on the}} wrong foot when he was forced to limp off with a calf injury five minutes into his debut at Charlton Athletic. Whilst at Middlesbrough, Ehiogu quickly became a {{mainstay}} in the central defence since joining the club and rejoining his former teammate Gareth Southgate in central defence. He missed the start of the 2003-04 season with a knee injury sustained in the final match of the previous season. He returned in time to play in Boro's League Cup final win against Bolton Wanderers, the first major trophy in the club's history. Only into the third game at the start of 2004-05 season Ehiogu had an accidental clash with his own <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Schwarzer which resulted in knee ligament damage. [...] Again he was forced to miss many important games, although Boro still managed to secure a place in the UEFA Cup for a second successive season.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a vehicle}} {{is alleged to}} have been {{involved}} in an offence, section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, as amended by section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 1991 enables the police to require the <b>vehicle's</b> registered <b>keeper,</b> or any other relevant person, to provide information as to the identity of the vehicle's driver.

50|$|The Saudi's {{pushed on}} and on, {{pressing}} for {{a goal that}} would take the game into extra time, and it looked for all money like they had one in the 84th minute. A cutback found talismanic striker Yasser Al-Qahtani, his shot from near the penalty spot {{had no right to}} be saved but the big hand of Covic found a way. The ball bounced once before spinning out for a corner just inches away from the goalpost. The save was the biggest moment for an Australian <b>keeper</b> since <b>Mark</b> Schwarzer in the famous shootout against Uruguay.|$|R
5000|$|The season {{opened with}} a 3-0 win over Doncaster Rovers, but then Vale {{travelled}} to Roots Hall, where they were beaten 5-1 by Southend United. This defeat {{was the first of}} a run of six games in which the [...] "Valiants" [...] picked up just a solitary point. The Vale consistently lost away from home, but turned Vale Park into a fortress with four successive wins in Burslem. Despite this, attendances remained barely above 2,000. Injuries piled up; Gerry Keenan with ligament damage, Steve Jones with a collarbone injury, whereas Paul Bowles played on despite being overweight. The club in the re-election zone, unable to attract fans, and losing £1,000 a week, Arthur MacPherson resigned as Chairman on 2 October, and was replaced by Don Ratcliffe. Mark Chamberlain was then utilized, and scored four goals in his first four games and also created goals for others. Former top-flight winger Johnny Miller then joined the club after his release from Mansfield Town. Miller's crossing ability had not diminished, and he became a key player. Young <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Harrison in good form, McGrath felt able to sell Trevor Dance to Stafford Rangers for £10,000. Their upturn in form tailed off, and their 4-0 defeat at Plainmoor on 5 November was played in front of a then Torquay United record-low crowd of 1,227 fans. A 1-0 victory over Southend United was the only win in a sequence of fourteen league games.|$|R
5|$|The 2007–08 season saw Central Coast win {{its first}} premiership on goal {{difference}} ahead of Newcastle, following a final round {{that began with}} Central Coast and three other clubs level on 31 points. The final series began with a 2–0 loss to Newcastle in {{the first leg of}} its major semi-final, but the Mariners forced the tie to extra time by holding a 2–0 lead in the second leg after 90 minutes. A 94th-minute goal by Sasho Petrovski, who had scored earlier to level the tie, gave Central Coast a 3–2 win on aggregate, putting the Mariners through to the 2008 A-League Grand Final. In a rematch with Newcastle, the Jets defeated Central Coast 1–0 in the Grand Final, which ended in controversy due to an uncalled handball against Newcastle in Central Coast Mariners penalty box during the closing seconds of the match. If called, the foul would have given Central Coast a penalty kick and a chance to equalise. As Mariners players disputed referee Mark Shield's decision, goalkeeper Danny Vuković struck Shield on the arm, resulting in an immediate sending off and later suspension. Vuković was suspended from both domestic and international competition for nine months, with an additional six-months' suspended ban; the latter period was reduced to three months on appeal. Despite further appeals, the ban was eventually confirmed by FIFA in June, to include banning the young keeper from competing at the 2008 Olympic Games. The ban lasted into October; in response, Central Coast signed former Manchester United and Australian international <b>keeper</b> <b>Mark</b> Bosnich on a seven-week contract.|$|R
50|$|Kennedy {{started the}} 2014-15 season as 2nd choice <b>keeper</b> to <b>Mark</b> Birighitti. He made his season debut in Round 8, and his no.1 spot was {{cemented}} when Mark Birighitti left temporarily {{due to a}} 6-month loan deal at Italian Serie B club A.S. Varese. In the Jet's Round 27 clash away to the Brisbane Roar, Kennedy produced a number of great saves to deny Brisbane going 5-0 {{up in the first}} half. Despite this, the Jets were downed 2-1 due to goals from Kofi Danning and Lachlan Jackson, but Kennedy's performance was rewarded with a place in the Team of the Week. Kennedy made a total of 84 saves, only being outnumbered by rival custodian Liam Reddy.|$|R
