40|$|The {{env gene}} {{fragment}} of an Italian strain of Caprine <b>Arthritis</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) coding for the hydrophilic region of transmembrane protein was amplified, cloned and expressed in prokaryotic system as fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase.

The recombinant transmembrane protein was efficiently expressed, purified under denaturing conditions and used as antigen in western blotting and ELISA. Sera from clinically diseased goats strongly reacted in western blotting and naturally infected animals seroconverted between 20 and 33 weeks of age. An indirect ELISA performed with this antigen showed improved sensitivity in comparison with agar gel immunodiffusion test.

40|$|The {{etiologic}} {{agent of the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), has recently been shown to morphologically resemble and share sequence homology with visna virus, a pathogenic lentivirus. Molecular hybridization, heteroduplex mapping, and DNA sequence analyses were used to compare HTLV-III to other lentiviruses of domestic animals, including visna, caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> and equine infectious anemia viruses. Hybridization results showed that {{a substantial amount of}} sequence homology exists between each of these viruses and HTLV-III. In addition, a closer relationship was found between visna and caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> viruses than for any of the other lentiviruses studied. These results, along with nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, have been used in a comprehensive effort to derive a systematic relationship for lentiviruses and to provide further evidence for classifying HTLV-III with the Lentivirinae subfamily of retroviruses. This relationship predicts that similarities in biology and disease process can be expected between HTLV-III and other Lentivirinae members...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCaprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is a worldwide, {{multisystemic}} disease {{caused by}} a small ruminant lentivirus. Although the main route of transmission is oral, detection of proviral DNA of the caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV) in caprine semen has been previously described. However, the presence of viral antigens in the male reproductive tract has apparently never been reported. The objective was to study lesions in the buck reproductive system and to detect, in these tissues, the presence of proviral DNA, viral RNA and CAEV antigens. Tissues from eight CAEV-infected bucks (one naturally and seven experimentally infected) were analyzed by histopathology, nested polymerase chain reaction, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. Interstitial pneumonia, synovitis, and lesions in the male reproductive tract were detected {{in some of the}} bucks. Proviral DNA was detected in the lungs and joints {{as well as in the}} reproductive systems of all animals, whereas viral RNA was detected only in the genital tract of the naturally infected buck. Viral antigens were immunostained in most of the organs of the male reproductive tract. This report was apparently the first to clearly demonstrate CAEV¬†antigen expression in the male reproductive tract, which indicates the possibility of venereal¬†transmission of CAEV...|$|R

The above findings raise the possibility that HTLV-III-infected monocyte/macrophages may serve as a vehicle for the dissemination of virus to target organs and as a reservoir for viral persistence, as has been shown for other lentiviruses including visna virus and caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus...|$|R
40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is a T-lymphotropic retrovirus associated with immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections in cats. The discovery of FIV {{provides an opportunity}} {{for the development of a}} small animal model for AIDS. To initiate the molecular and biological characterization of FIV, cDNA clones were synthesized and used to isolate a proviral clone of FIV. Molecular cross-hybridization analysis of FIV with five lentiviruses revealed that nucleotide-sequence similarities exist between FIV and these lentiviruses in the gag-pol genes. However, nucleotide-sequence similarities were not seen upon comparison of the FIV long terminal repeat sequence with known viral sequences. Common antigenic determinants appeared to be shared by FIV, caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, and visna virus as shown by serological cross-reactivity of rabbit antibodies to caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus and visna virus with the putative FIV core protein p 28. These studies demonstrated that FIV is a member of the lentivirus subfamily and is distantly related to the AIDS lentiviruses of primates. Importantly, progeny virions of our molecular clone were infectious for experimentally inoculated cats. The availability of an infectious molecular clone will make possible a detailed dissection of the molecular pathogenesis of FIV, which may facilitate the development of vaccine and therapeutic strategies for AIDS...|$|R

40|$|Maedi-visna and caprine <b>arthritis</b> and <b>encephalitis</b> are {{economically}} important viral {{diseases that}} affect sheep and goats. These diseases {{are caused by}} a group of lentiviruses called the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs).

The causative viruses infect their hosts for life, most often subclinically; however, some animals develop one of several progressive, untreatable disease syndromes. The major syndromes in sheep are dyspnea (maedi) or neurological signs (visna), which are both eventually fatal. Adult goats generally develop chronic progressive arthritis, while encephalomyelitis is seen in kids. Other syndromes (e. g., outbreaks of arthritis in sheep) are also reported occasionally, and mastitis occurs in both species. Additional economic losses may occur due to marketing and export restrictions, premature culling and/or poor milk production. Economic losses can vary considerably between flocks. Etiolog...|$|R

40|$|Caprine <b>arthritis</b> and <b>encephalitis</b> (CAE) is an {{economically}} important viral disease of goats. The caprine <b>arthritis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus (CAEV), a lentivirus; infects its hosts for life. Although most infections are subclinical, {{a minority of}} animals develops progressive, untreatable disease syndromes including polyarthritis in adults and encephalomyelitis in kids. This virus also causes indurative mastitis, resulting in decreased milk production. CAEV infections decrease lifetime productivity in dairy goats, particularly when the prevalence of infection is high within a herd. In addition, CAEV is a barrier to the exportation of goats from countries where it is endemic, including the United States. CAEV {{is closely related to}} the maedi-visna virus (MVV), which is found most often in sheep. Although documented cases of natural cross-species transmission are currently rare, CAEV can infect sheep and MVV can infect goats.

The samples were tested by agar gel immunodifusion (AGID) and the seroprevalence obtained was 0. 87 % (6 / 693). The low prevalence obtained was due to production features.
