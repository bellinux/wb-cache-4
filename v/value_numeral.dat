[...] Decimal numerals recording the years 683 CE have also been found in stone inscriptions in Indonesia and Cambodia, where Indian cultural influence was substantial.|$|R

25|$|The Sumerians {{developed}} a complex system of metrology c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology {{resulted in the}} creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period. The period c. 2700 – 2300 BC saw the first appearance of the abacus, and a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system. The Sumerians were the first to use a place <b>value</b> <b>numeral</b> system. There is also anecdotal evidence the Sumerians may have used a type of slide rule in astronomical calculations. They were the first to find the area of a triangle and the volume of a cube.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the first}} postulate, {{it follows that}} we may choose a subset [...] of [...] {{mutually}} independent questions, where [...] {{is the number of}} bits contained in the maximum amount of information.

There will also be more than one possible complete question. If we further assume that the relations [...] are defined for all , then [...] is an orthomodular lattice, while all the possible unions of sets of complete questions form a Boolean algebra with the [...] as atoms.|$|R

50|$|Roman numerals are a {{numeral system}} {{originating}} in ancient Rome, adapted from Etruscan numerals.
