40|$|Purpose: Cultural and {{religious}} diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> is a phenomenon. As diversity within the workforce becomes more prevalent, issues {{of how to}} best accommodate diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> become more salient. This review examines how authors have approached the topic of religious practice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> and also explores the range of management strategies employed to respond to religious diversity. Originality: Contextualising current paradigms relating to religion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> and discussing its implications provides greater insight into the viewpoints of religious groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Moreover, identifying <b>the</b> key areas where further research into religious differences and diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> is required will result in {{an understanding of the}} relationship between organisational management strategies and employee religious observances and practices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Design/methodology/approach: This review looks at the literature, mainly journal articles, pertaining to religious diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contemporary <b>workplace</b> context. Findings: Employers and HR managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of how to best underst{{and religious}} diversity and how to accommodate the need for religious observances and practices by employees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> A clearer distinction needs to be made between religion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> and spirituality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Research examining <b>the</b> effects of religious dissimilarity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organisational context is scarce.

This study aims to understand the significance attributed to the concept of well-being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> by employees, its influencing factors, and, among those, the role of individual psychological characteristics. The research was conducted on a sample of 72 employees using a qualitative approach based on focus groups and individual interviews. Data analysis was performed by a paper and pencil technique. The focus groups and interviews collected 628 statements, which were divided into three main areas: meaning of well-being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> (248), any kind factors that affect well-being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> (158), and individual characteristics that affect well-being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> (222). <b>The</b> individual characteristics identified by the participants as capable of influencing well-being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> include being positive, communication, management of difficulties and conflicts, socio-emotional skills, and values.

The current economic climate of austerity and the resulting financial constraints within the public sector increase this challenge.

Previous research on happiness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> has focused on job satisfaction and employee engagement however happiness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> is an understudied area and offers an incomplete understanding of the phenomenon. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop, in collaboration with staff, a workplace which facilitates staff happiness at work. Concept analyses of happiness and happiness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace</b> were conducted <b>in</b> order to provide a conceptual framework for the study. Self-determination theory is proposed as a theoretical explanation for happiness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> Review of workplace happiness research highlighted an incomplete account of happiness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workplace.</b> <b>The</b> study was conducted in a School of Nursing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> university sector. An Appreciative Inquiry (AI) approach underpinned by a social constructionist philosophy was adopted.

All full time staff (n= 80) of the School were invited to participate. A total of twenty three staff across roles and disciplines chose to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study. Focus group and individual interviews were used to collect data during each of the stages.
