5|$|Many of Titan's craters or {{probable}} craters display {{evidence of}} extensive erosion, and all show {{some indication of}} modification. Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, {{despite the fact that}} some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through <b>viscoelastic</b> crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons. Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. <b>Viscoelastic</b> damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E
25|$|When {{subjected}} to a step constant stress, <b>viscoelastic</b> materials experience a time-dependent increase in strain. This phenomenon is known as <b>viscoelastic</b> creep.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viscoelastic</b> creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting <b>viscoelastic</b> creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the <b>viscoelastic</b> creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single <b>viscoelastic</b> creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{temperature}} of dry ice can cause <b>viscoelastic</b> materials {{to change to}} glass phase. Thus it is useful for removing many types of pressure sensitive adhesives.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to thrombelastography with its pendulum-like principle, {{the design of}} the TEM <b>viscoelastic</b> detection system (figure 1) makes it quite robust and insensitive against mechanical shocks or vibrations.|$|E
25|$|Careful {{control of}} <b>viscoelastic</b> {{properties}} – by modifying the catalysts and polyols used – {{can lead to}} memory foam, which is much softer at skin temperature than at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|In {{manufacturing}} wheat products, gluten {{is valuable}} to impart <b>viscoelastic</b> functional qualities in dough, enabling {{the preparation of}} diverse processed foods such as breads, noodles, and pasta that facilitate wheat consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{relaxation of}} a <b>viscoelastic</b> gel {{has been identified}} as primary mechanism responsible for densification and associated pore evolution in both colloidal and polymeric silica gels. Experiments in the <b>viscoelastic</b> properties of such skeletal networks on various time scales require a force varying with a period (or frequency) appropriate to the relaxation time of the phenomenon investigated, and inversely proportional to the distance over which such relaxation occurs. High frequencies associated with ultrasonic waves have been used extensively in the handling of polymer solutions, liquids and gels and the determination of their <b>viscoelastic</b> properties. Static measurements of the shear modulus have been made, as well as dynamic measurements of the speed of propagation of shear waves, which yields the dynamic modulus of rigidity. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques have been utilized in order to monitor the dynamics of density fluctuations through the behavior of the autocorrelation function near the point of gelation.|$|E
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also <b>viscoelastic,</b> incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some <b>viscoelastic</b> properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Unstable {{colloidal}} suspensions of low-volume fraction form clustered liquid suspensions, wherein individual {{clusters of}} particles {{fall to the}} bottom of the suspension (or float to the top if the particles are less dense than the suspending medium) once the clusters are of sufficient size for the Brownian forces that work to keep the particles in suspension to be overcome by gravitational forces. However, colloidal suspensions of higher-volume fraction form colloidal gels with <b>viscoelastic</b> properties. <b>Viscoelastic</b> colloidal gels, such as bentonite and toothpaste, flow like liquids under shear, but maintain their shape when shear is removed. It is for this reason that toothpaste can be squeezed from a toothpaste tube, but stays on the toothbrush after it is applied.|$|E
25|$|The {{clinical}} {{benefits of}} TEM {{have resulted in}} major savings and publications recommend that <b>viscoelastic</b> methods such as TEM {{should be used in}} surgical procedures where major blood loss followed by the need for transfusions can be expected.|$|E
25|$|Non-Newtonian fluids {{have a more}} complicated, {{non-linear}} stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of rheology {{describes the}} stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include emulsions and slurries, some <b>viscoelastic</b> materials such as blood and some polymers, and sticky liquids such as latex, honey and lubricants.|$|E
25|$|When {{a liquid}} is {{supercooled}} towards the glass transition, the viscosity increases dramatically. The liquid then becomes a <b>viscoelastic</b> medium that shows both the elasticity {{of a solid}} and the fluidity of a liquid, depending on the time scale of observation or on the frequency of perturbation.|$|E
25|$|Even though {{soft tissues}} have <b>viscoelastic</b> properties, i.e. stress as {{function}} of strain rate, {{it can be}} approximated by a hyperelastic model after precondition to a load pattern. After some cycles of loading and unloading the material, the mechanical response becomes independent of strain rate.|$|E
25|$|Fractal geometry, using a {{deterministic}} Cantor structure, is used {{to model}} the surface topography, where recent advancements in thermoviscoelastic creep contact of rough surfaces are introduced. Various <b>viscoelastic</b> idealizations are used to model the surface materials, for example, Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt, Standard Linear Solid and Jeffrey media.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viscoelastic</b> dampers {{are useful}} in {{that they can be}} used for both wind and seismic applications, they are usually limited to small displacements. There is some concern as to the {{reliability}} of the technology as some brands have been banned from use in buildings in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} sound in fluids {{differs from the}} physics of sound in solids, {{although}} both are density waves: sound waves in fluids only have longitudinal components, whereas sound waves in solids have longitudinal and transverse components. This is because fluids can't support shear stresses (but see <b>viscoelastic</b> fluids, which only apply to high frequencies).|$|E
25|$|Sickle-cell {{disease is}} a genetic disease that results in {{abnormal}} hemoglobin molecules. When these release their oxygen load in the tissues, they become insoluble, leading to mis-shaped red blood cells. These sickle shaped red cells are less deformable and <b>viscoelastic</b> meaning that they have become rigid and can cause blood vessel blockage, pain, strokes, and other tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|In this method, {{the initial}} {{three-dimensional}} system is {{replaced with a}} contact of a body with a linear elastic or <b>viscoelastic</b> foundation (see Fig). The properties of one-dimensional systems coincide exactly {{with those of the}} original three-dimensional system, if the form of the bodies is modified and the elements of the foundation are defined according to the rules of the MDR.|$|E
25|$|The tube frame design, using {{steel core}} and {{perimeter}} columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material, created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more {{in response to}} the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop <b>viscoelastic</b> dampers to absorb some of the sway. These <b>viscoelastic</b> dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.|$|E
25|$|The <b>viscoelastic</b> {{properties}} of human vocal fold lamina propria {{are essential for}} their vibration, and depend on the composition and structure of their extracellular matrix (ECM). Adult VF have a layered structure {{which is based on}} the layers differential in ECM distribution. Newborns on the other hand, do not have this layered structure. Their VF are uniform, and immature, making their <b>viscoelastic</b> properties most likely unsuitable for phonation. HA plays a very important role in the vocal fold biomechanics. In fact, HA has been described as the ECM molecule that not only contributes to the maintenance of an optimal tissue viscosity that allows phonation, but also of an optimal tissue stiffness that allows frequency control. CD44 is a cell surface receptor for HA. Cells such as fibroblasts are responsible for synthesizing ECM molecules. Cell surface matrix receptors in return, feed back to the cells through cell-matrix interaction, allowing the cell to regulate its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating {{procedure}} using microcatheter technology. To {{perform a}} canaloplasty, an incision is made into {{the eye to}} gain access to the Schlemm's canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called <b>viscoelastic.</b> The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.|$|E
25|$|Thromboelastometry (TEM), {{previously}} named rotational thromboelastography (ROTEG) or rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), is {{an established}} <b>viscoelastic</b> method for hemostasis testing in whole blood. It is {{a modification of}} traditional thromboelastography (TEG). TEM investigates the interaction of coagulation factors, their inhibitors, anticoagulant drugs, blood cells, specifically platelets, during clotting and subsequent fibrinolysis. The rheological conditions mimic the sluggish flow of blood in veins. TEM is performed with the ROTEM whole blood analyzer (Tem Innovations GmbH, Munich) and is an enhancement of thrombelastography, originally described by H. Hartert in 1948.|$|E
25|$|At a time t0, a <b>viscoelastic</b> {{material}} {{is loaded with}} a constant stress that is maintained for a sufficiently long time period. The material responds to the stress with a strain that increases until the material ultimately fails. When the stress is maintained for a shorter time period, the material undergoes an initial strain until a time t1 at which the stress is relieved, at which time the strain immediately decreases (discontinuity) then continues decreasing gradually to a residual strain.|$|E
25|$|Gelatin readily dissolves in {{hot water}} and sets to a gel on cooling. When added {{directly}} to cold water, it does not dissolve well, however. Gelatin also is soluble in most polar solvents. Gelatin solutions show <b>viscoelastic</b> flow and streaming birefringence. Solubility {{is determined by the}} method of manufacture. Typically, gelatin can be dispersed in a relatively concentrated acid. Such dispersions are stable for 10–15 days with little or no chemical changes and are suitable for coating purposes or for extrusion into a precipitating bath.|$|E
25|$|The Major Qualifying Project (MQP) assesses {{knowledge}} in a student's field of study. As mentioned above, {{this project is}} similar to a senior thesis, with students doing independent research or design. MQPs are often funded by either WPI or external corporations. Topics of MQPs done in the recent past include the design of the MIR 2 space station life support system module, a study of the effects of stress and nicotine on ADHD, the design of a research rocket, a mathematical <b>viscoelastic</b> cell motility model, experimental research of liquid crystals using atomic force microscopy, and the design of polymers for medicine delivery.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{has also}} {{been the subject of}} {{mutation}} breeding, with the use of gamma, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and sometimes harsh chemicals. The varieties of wheat created through these methods are in the hundreds (going as far back as 1960), more of them being created in higher populated countries such as China. Bread wheat with high grain iron and zinc content was developed through gamma radiation breeding. Modern bread wheat varieties have been cross-bred to contain greater amounts of gluten, which affords significant advantages for improving the quality of breads and pastas from a functional point of view. Gluten is appreciated for its unique <b>viscoelastic</b> properties. It gives elasticity to dough and is responsible for dough’s gas-retaining properties.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{is grown}} on more land area {{than any other}} food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. In 2016, world {{production}} of wheat was 749 million tonnes, making it the second most-produced cereal after maize. Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled {{and is expected to}} grow further through the middle of the 21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique <b>viscoelastic</b> and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing {{as a result of the}} worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.|$|E
25|$|Selenizza {{is mainly}} {{used as an}} {{additive}} in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the <b>viscoelastic</b> properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for {{the oil and gas}} industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-elastic light {{scattering}} offers direct experimental access to {{measurement of the}} wavelength and lifetimes of critical fluctuations, which are governed by the <b>viscoelastic</b> properties of the gel. It is reasonable to expect {{a relationship between the}} amplitude of such fluctuations and the elasticity of the network. Since the elasticity measures the resistance of the network to either elastic (reversible) or plastic (irreversible) deformation, the fluctuations should grow larger as the elasticity declines. The divergence of the scattered light intensity at a finite critical temperature implies that the elasticity approaches zero, or the compressibility becomes infinite, which is the typically observed behavior of a system at the point of instability. Thus, at the critical point, the polymer network offers no resistance at all to any form of deformation.|$|E

500|$|The large, column-free {{space between}} the {{perimeter}} and core was bridged by prefabricated floor trusses. The floors supported their own weight, as well as live loads, provided lateral stability to the exterior walls, and distributed wind loads among the exterior walls.

A grid of lightweight bridging trusses and main trusses supported the floors. The trusses had a span of [...] in the long-span areas and [...] in the short span area. The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were on [...] centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the exterior side and a channel welded to the core columns on the interior side.
