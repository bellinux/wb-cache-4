2500|$|The {{batteries}} are {{placed under the}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>floor.</b> This saves interior and trunk space but increases risk of battery damage by debris or impact. The Model S has [...] aluminum-alloy armor plate. CTO Straubel expected batteries to last 10–15 years, and discounts using electric cars to charge the grid (V2G) because the related battery wear outweighs economic benefit. He also prefers recycling over re-use for grid once they {{reach the end of}} their useful life for vehicles.
