5|$|In late 1960 {{or early}} 1961, Thorpe visited <b>Vater</b> at the Kingham Stables, and briefly met Josiffe. He was {{sufficiently}} {{taken with the}} young man to suggest that, should Josiffe ever need help, he should call on him at the House of Commons. Soon after this, Josiffe left the stables after a serious disagreement with <b>Vater.</b> He then suffered a mental breakdown, and for much of 1961 was under psychiatric care. On 8 November 1961, a week after discharging himself from the Ashurst clinic, Josiffe went to the House of Commons to see Thorpe. He was penniless, homeless and, worse, had left Vater's employment without the National Insurance card which, at that time, was essential for obtaining regular work and access to social and unemployment benefits. Thorpe promised he would help.|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because of back pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of <b>Vater.</b> The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of <b>Vater</b> and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the small intestine. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of <b>Vater.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at springerlink. com authorWe report a case of mucinous carcinoma of <b>Vater's</b> ampulla with a unique extension along only the main pancreatic duct (MPD) and microinvasion to the pancreas. A 52 -year-old man was referred to our hospital for the evaluation and treatment of acute pancreatitis. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated swelling in {{the head of the}} pancreas with a mass in the duodenum. Hypotonic duodenography and endoscopic examination revealed a well-defined mass, measuring about 25 [*]mm in size, in <b>Vater's</b> ampulla. A biopsy specimen of the tumor showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. A pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with a regional lymphadenectomy was performed, under a preoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of <b>Vater's</b> ampulla with direct invasion into the head of the pancreas. The resected specimen of the duodenum confirmed the presence of the mass, which measured 22 × 15 [*]mm in size, in <b>Vater's</b> ampulla. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of two components: moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the peripheral region of the tumor <b>Vater's</b> papilla and mucinous carcinoma in the central region of the tumor. The mucinous carcinoma component uniquely extended along only the MPD with microinvasion to the pancreas. Immunohistochemically, both the moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and the mucinous carcinoma were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK 20) and negative for cytokeratin 7 (CK 7) which is the pattern of intestinal-type carcinoma of <b>Vater's</b> ampulla. We concluded that the original site of this tumor may have been the duodenal epithelium of <b>Vater's</b> ampulla originally moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma―which subsequently changed to mucinous carcinoma that extended along only the MPD with microinvasion to the pancreas...|$|R

Rocco and Fidelio prepare to go to Florestan's cell, {{with the knowledge that}} he must be killed and buried within the hour. Fidelio is shaken; Rocco tries to discourage Fidelio from coming, but Fidelio insists. As they prepare to leave, Jaquino and Marzelline rush in and tell Rocco to run, as Pizarro has learned that the prisoners were allowed to roam, and is furious (Ach, <b>Vater,</b> <b>Vater,</b> eilt!—"O, father, father, hurry!").|$|E
25|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} {{may occur}} {{in up to}} 0.2 per 1000 per year. A worm may block the ampulla of <b>Vater,</b> or go into the main pancreatic duct, resulting in acute pancreatitis with raised serum levels of amylase and lipase. Occasionally, a worm can travel through the billiary tree and even into the gallbladder, causing acute cholangitis or acute cholecystitis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Vaters</b> {{was known}} as a sportsman in Latvia since 1921, however his career in {{football}} really took off in 1925 when he played with JKS Riga which in that year finished second in the top Riga football league (<b>Vaters</b> was more of a reserves player then though). The following season was less successful for JKS {{and at the end of}} it <b>Vaters</b> moved to a stronger side - LSB Riga. In 1926 he also played in several matches for the Riga garrison selected team alongside more famous footballers like Arvīds Jurgens, Pēteris Lauks, Arvīds Bārda and Arkādijs Pavlovs.|$|R

25|$|The {{pancreas}} is a secretory {{structure with}} an internal hormonal role (endocrine) and an external digestive role (exocrine). The endocrine part {{is composed of}} hormonal tissue distributed along the pancreas in discrete units called islets of Langerhans. Islets of Langerhans have a well-established structure and form density routes through the exocrine tissue. The exocrine part has two main ducts, the main pancreatic duct and the accessory pancreatic duct. These drain enzymes through the ampulla of <b>Vater</b> into the duodenum.|$|E
500|$|In 1959 Josiffe {{moved to}} the Kingham Stables in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, where he learned {{dressage}} {{while working as a}} groom. The stables were owned by Norman <b>Vater,</b> the self-made son of a coalminer who, like Josiffe, had inflated his name and was known as [...] "Brecht Van de Vater". In the course of his rise, <b>Vater</b> had made numerous friends in higher social circles, among them Thorpe. Initially, Josiffe was settled and happy at the stables, but his relationship with <b>Vater</b> deteriorated {{in the face of the}} latter's assertive and demanding manner, and he was unable to form good relationships with his fellow-workers. He began to evidence the kind of behaviour which a journalist would later summarise as his [...] "extraordinary talent for wheedling his way into people's sympathy before turning their lives to misery with his hysterical temper-tantrums." ...|$|E
500|$|... (Osanna in the Highest) {{is set for}} two choirs and {{a festive}} orchestra, in the same key and time as the {{previous}} movement. The movement is based, as is the opening chorus of the secular cantata , probably on the opening movement of the secular cantata Es lebe der König, der <b>Vater</b> im Lande, BWV Anh 11, of 1732. The movement contrasts homophonic sections with fugal development. Wenk likens the movement to the Passepied, a dance in [...] "fast triple meter with an upbeat".|$|E

500|$|For many years, Weinberg's gear {{included}} Ludwig and Pearl Drums and Zildjian cymbals; he subsequently {{switched to}} DW Drums, but continues to use Zildjian cymbals. He also uses Remo heads and previously using Regal Tip drumsticks and brushes, he now uses <b>Vater</b> drumsticks, notably the 5A Nude wood tip model and Wire Tap brushes. His setup {{has always been}} simple, mostly consisting of a snare drum, mounted tom, bass drum and floor tom while his usual cymbal setup consists of two crash cymbals, a ride cymbal {{and a pair of}} hi-hats, with an occasional third crash: [...] "I've got four drums.

500|$|The gospel quotation, [...] "Wahrlich, wahrlich, ich sage euch, so ihr den <b>Vater</b> etwas bitten werdet in meinem Namen, so wird er's euch geben. [...] " [...] (Truly, truly I say to you, {{whatever}} you ask of the Father in My name, so {{will it be}} given to you.), {{is given to the}} bass as the vox Christi, the voice of Jesus. The instruments, strings probably doubled by oboe d'amore, introduce vocal motifs which the voice picks up. The bass sings the text three times, while the instruments continue playing the same motifs. Julian Mincham observes: [...] "The richness of the text, the unobtrusive nature of the melodic ideas and the gently flowing rhythms combine to create an appropriate atmosphere of dignified restraint".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hertwig {{published}} her memoirs {{under the}} title Ich muß doch meinen <b>Vater</b> lieben, oder? ("I do have to love my father, don't I?"). Hertwig described the subsequent life of her mother who unconditionally glorified her fiancé until confronted with {{his role in the}} Holocaust. Kalder committed suicide in 1983 shortly after giving an interview in Jon Blair's documentary Schindler. Hertwig's experiences in dealing with her father's crimes are detailed in Inheritance, a 2006 documentary directed by James Moll. Appearing in the documentary is Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, one of Göth's former housemaids. The documentary details the meeting of the two women at the Płaszów memorial site in Poland. Hertwig had requested the meeting, but Jonas-Rosenzweig was hesitant because her memories of Göth and the concentration camp were so traumatic. She eventually agreed after Hertwig wrote to her, [...] "We have to do it for the murdered people." [...] Jonas felt touched by this sentiment and agreed to meet her.|$|E

500|$|Bile duct obstruction, {{which is}} usually present in acute cholangitis, is {{generally}} due to gallstones. 10–30% of cases, however, are due to other causes such as benign stricturing (narrowing of the bile duct without an underlying tumor), postoperative damage or an altered structure of the bile ducts such as narrowing {{at the site of}} an anastomosis (surgical connection), various tumors (cancer of the bile duct, gallbladder cancer, cancer of the ampulla of <b>Vater,</b> pancreatic cancer, cancer of the duodenum), anaerobic organisms such as Clostridium and Bacteroides (especially in the elderly and those who have undergone previous surgery of the biliary system). Parasites which may infect the liver and bile ducts may cause cholangitis; these include [...] the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and Opisthorchis felineus. In people with AIDS, a large number of opportunistic organisms has been known to cause AIDS cholangiopathy, but the risk has rapidly diminished since the introduction of effective AIDS treatment. Cholangitis may also complicate medical procedures involving the bile duct, especially ERCP. To prevent this, it is recommended that those undergoing ERCP for any indication receive prophylactic (preventative) antibiotics.|$|E
500|$|Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is {{the most}} common approach in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of <b>Vater</b> and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E
