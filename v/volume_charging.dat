The influence factors, blasting <b>volume,</b> <b>charging</b> rate which simulates coke consumption, bed packing height have been considered.

40|$|Precisely characterizing epoxy/thermoplastic {{interfaces}} on the {{nanometer scale}} using {{scanning electron microscopy}} energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) represents a current challenge due to the large X-rays generation volume, specimen decomposition, and related phenomena occurring with polymer samples. Interface characterization is, however, of high interest because the adhesion strength and overall performance of composites depend on the interface region. This work investigates the interface between an aerospace-grade epoxy based on a tetraglycidyl diaminodiphenyl methane/diaminodiphenyl sulphone (TGDDM/DDS) formulation and a semicrystalline fluoropolymer. Monte Carlo simulation is used in combination with EDX spot analysis to evaluate the effect of X-ray generation <b>volume,</b> <b>charging,</b> and phenomena arising from specimen decomposition. The results indicate that fluorine mobility due to specimen damage by electron beam irradiation is the principal factor affecting interface width measurements.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} fair {{sharing of}} network resources {{over a period}} of time between offline and interactive users. The former value total transferred volume while the latter have timedependent valuations for instantaneous bandwidth. Following the work of Kelly on fair bandwidth sharing, we express the system optimum as an equilibrium of traditional congestion control taking place in a fast timescale and a <b>volume</b> <b>charging</b> mechanism in a slow timescale. The problem is very much related to multipath congestion control where paths are unfolded also in the dimension of time, and our algorithms can be regarded as multipath congestion control algorithms operating on two separate timescales that combine congestion control with scheduling. A novel feature of our algorithms is that, contrary to ordinary dual algorithms, users are not overcharged at any time while approaching the equilibrium. This is a sensible economical property not recognized before in the context of congestion control over long timescales. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — New Internet {{protocols}} such as ECN, re-ECN and Conex, {{provide valuable}} information to ISPs about the congestion within a network. Such information {{could be useful}} in allocating network resources more equitably, {{as well as to}} employ new pricing schemes. However, in designing a new protocol one must take proper account of the incentive issues that thereby arise for its adoption. In this paper, we consider a duopoly market consisting of two access ISPs and formulate a noncooperative game over their choices of pricing strategies when one of them uses volume-based and the other congestion-based pricing. We prove, under mild conditions, the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the competing providers. We further examine how the different types of transit charges affect the pricing strategies of the access ISPs. We find cases where the <b>volume</b> <b>charging</b> ISP is forced to leave the access market. We conclude that ISPs have economic incentives to adopt congestion accountability mechanisms, since they become more competitive due to the smoother and more predictable traffic they have to accommodate and to the lower transit charges they incur.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{and rates of}} total lightning are both correlated to and physically dependent upon storm updraft strength, mixed phase precipitation volume {{and the size of}} the charging zone. The updraft modulates the ingredients necessary for electrification within a thunderstorm, while the updraft also plays a critical role in the development of severe and hazardous weather. Therefore utilizing this relationship, the monitoring of lightning rates and jumps provides an additional piece of information on the evolution of a thunderstorm, more often than not, at higher temporal resolution than current operational radar systems. This correlation is the basis for the total lightning jump algorithm that has been developed in recent years. In order to become a viable option for operational forecasters to incorporate into their severe storm monitoring process, the total lightning jump must be placed into the framework of several severe storm conceptual models (e. g., radar evolution, storm morphology) which forecasters have built through training and experience. Thus, one of the goals of this study is to examine and relate the lightning jump concept to often used radar parameters (e. g., dBZ vertical structure, VIL, MESH, MESO/shear) in the warning environment. Tying lightning trends and lightning jump occurrences to these radar based parameters will provide forecasters with an additional tool that they can use to build an accurate realtime depiction as to what is going on in a given environment. Furthermore, relating the lightning jump concept to these parameters could also increase confidence in a warning decision they have already made, help tip the scales on whether or not to warn on a given storm, or to draw the forecaster s attention to a particular storm that is rapidly developing. Furthermore the lightning information will add vital storm scale information in regions that are not well covered by radar, or when radar failures occur. The physical basis for the lightning jump algorithm in relation to severe storm dynamics and microphysics is a key component that must be further explored. Many radar studies have examined flash rates and their relation to updraft strength, updraft volume, precipitation -sized ice mass, etc.; however, very few have related the concept of the lightning jump and manifestation of severe weather to storm dynamics and microphysics using multi -Doppler and polarimetric radar techniques. Therefore, the second half of this study will combine the lightning jump algorithm and these radar techniques in order to place the lightning jump concept into a physical and dynamical framework. This analysis includes examining such parameters as mixed phase precipitation <b>volume,</b> <b>charging</b> zone, updraft strength and updraft volume. Such a study should provide increased understanding of and confidence in the strengths and limitations of the lightning jump algorithm in the storm warning process...|$|E
