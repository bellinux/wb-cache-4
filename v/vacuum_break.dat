40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003. Dewatering coal, and {{especially}} fine coal (- 600 μm), {{is a significant}} problem {{in the preparation of}} coal. The final moisture level of fine coal can be anything up to 30 % by weight, {{depending on the type of}} dewatering equipment used. Moisture in coal can cause many problems, for example by increasing the transportation costs, as well as decreasing the calorific value of the coal. In industry today there is a need for a dewatering technique that will produce a drier final product. It was found that an interruption in the application of vacuum during a single dewatering cycle yielded a filter cake with a lower final moisture content. It was also demonstrated that the rate at which the coal is being dewatered is much higher than during continuous vacuum application. A further study of this phenomenon showed a twofold time dependency involving both the duration of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>break,</b> and the instant it is introduced in the dewatering cycle. An optimum was found at about 29 s time duration and an introduction time of 30 s, after the start of the cycle. The possibilities of diffusion and cake structural changes were investigated. For the diffusion tests, repeated interruptions of the vacuum were performed during a single dewatering cycle. Although the kinetics agreed with what was expected, the final moisture content was not as low as that found for the optimum single break test. The compressibility of a coal filter cake was one of the structural changes investigated, the other being an increase in area and, thus, airflow through the cake. Coal filter cakes were shown to be largely incompressible. It was, however, shown that an increase in area, and thus an increase in the airflow through the cake, gave excellent results. An increased area resulted in a much lower final moisture content as well as an increase in the dewatering rate. The addition of a cake surface cutter to a standard vacuum belt filter will make the application of these finfings relatively easy to industry. Master...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{integration}} of III-V semiconductors with silicon (Si) technology {{is an interesting}} approach to utilize the advantages of both high-speed photonic and electronic properties. The work presented in this thesis is initiated by this major goal of merging III-V semiconductor technology with Si technology. The focus was primitively placed on development of a Si-compatible tool for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of gallium arsenide (GaAs). For this purpose, a Si/SiGe CVD reactor, ASMI Epsilon 2000, was extended with a TriMethylGallium (TMGa) bubbler system and extra tubing to allow the deposition of GaAs {{as well as the}} standard Si and SiGe depositions. Of key importance was to apply a very low arsine (AsH 3) concentration: 0. 7 % as compared to the at least ten times higher values normally used in MOCVDs. The correspondingly low concentration of TMGa means that the contamination of the reactor chamber with gallium or arsenic is so low that standard high-quality low-doped Si and SiGe depositions can still be performed in the same CVD reactor chamber. In view of this, the research took a unique direction of creating devices where the merging of depositions of gallium (Ga), arsenic (As) and boron (B), together with Si and Ge, all in one reactor, proved indispensable. For the first time, deposition cycles containing layers of different combinations of these III, IV, V elements could then be performed without <b>vacuum</b> <b>break.</b> This was important not only for the growth of good quality GaAs epitaxy and crystalline Ge-on-Si, but also for the formation of junction diodes in these materials. In particular, the formation of p+n Si diodes of exceptional quality was facilitated by deposition of pure gallium (PureGa) or pure boron (PureB) to create the p+-region. The combination of both PureGa and PureB techniques have been implemented on crystalline Ge-on-Si to form ideal Ge-on-Si p+n junctions with world record low saturation currents. The term PureGaB is introduced for this technology. On the application side, this thesis work has been directed towards the very challenging feat of fabricating Ge avalanche photodiodes (Ge APDs) on Si substrates. The low dark current and clear breakdown curve of these diodes were proven to be suitable for infrared detection in linear and photon counting (Geiger) mode.

40|$|Silicon {{heterojunction}} interdigitated back-contact (SHJ-IBC) {{solar cells}} have attracted considerable attention {{because of their}} potential to achieve very highly efficiency. However, the back contacting scheme leads to additional fabrication complexity mainly resulting from the formation of interdigitated n- (back surface field (BSF)) and p-type (emitter) hydrogenated amorphous silicon (aSi:H) strips. Photolithography is widely used for patterning of the interdigitated strips, {{but this is a}} costly and impractical technique for industrial applications. This work focuses on the development of simple BSF/emitter patterning approaches of SHJ-IBC cells to replace photolithography and two methods, selective deposition (SD) and dry etching of a-Si:H, have been evaluated. Selective deposition of materials is a promising approach for electronic device fabrication, which allows materials deposition on pre-defined areas while no deposition occurs on other parts of the device. As a result, costly lithography and etching steps can be avoided. Selective deposition of a-Si:H at low temperature (~ 200 C) using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique, is a novel approach for rear side emitter patterning of SHJ-IBC solar cells. The first target {{of this study was to}} selectively deposit a-Si:H on crystalline silicon (c-Si) while avoiding deposition on the SiOx mask. The second target was to achieve a sufficient quality a-Si:H/c-Si interface passivation using selectively deposited silicon film. The SD of a-Si:H was realized by short deposition of a-Si:H followed by etching using hydrogen plasma. Hydrogen atoms can selectively eliminate strained bonds in a-Si:H films. Proper hydrogen plasma exposure allows to discriminate between Si-Si bonds on different substrates. As such, substrate-SD of a-Si:H is possible. Repetition of short deposition followed by hydrogen plasma etching leads to net deposition on one substrate, i. e., c-Si, but not on mask layers, i. e., SiOx. Two deposition approaches were used to develop SD. The first approach is "Time-modulated power"; where deposition and etching is controlled by radio frequency power. The second deposition approach is "Time-modulated SiH 4 ", where film deposition and etching is controlled by pulsed SiH 4 flow. Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were utilized to measure selectivity, film thickness, and morphology. Effective carrier lifetime (τeff) was measured to check the c-Si surface passivation quality using Quasi-steady-state photo-conductance (QSSPC) method and Photoluminescence (PL) image. From TEM it was observed that, although selectivity is achieved in this work, crystallization of the deposited Si film on c-Si results in poor passivation quality, which is probably induced by long hydrogen plasma exposure. To reduce the crystallization rate, NF 3 plasma treatment was carried out on c-Si surface before SD. The suppression of silicon epitaxial growth was observed. This is due to the transformation of c-Si surface bonding configurations which was confirmed by measurement of Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The QSSPC and PL results indicated improved passivation quality using NF 3 plasma treatment before SD. The other part of this study concerned the etching of a-Si:H (n+) layer in i/n+ a-Si:H stack using hydrogen plasma followed by in-situ re-deposition of a-Si:H(p+) layer. With the aid of in-situ deposition, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>break</b> of PECVD, HF dip of c-Si wafer prior to a-Si:H(p+) deposition, wafer rising and drying can be skipped. A sufficient c-Si surface passivation is here required after the etching and re-deposition processes. According to the SE results, a stable and uniform etching of a-Si:H(n+) film with etching rate of 1. 4 ± 0. 1 nm/min was achieved. An excellent surface passivation quality with τeff of above 8 ms was obtained after etching of a-Si:H(n+) and re-deposition of a-Si:H(p+) layer. A thicker a-Si:H(i) layer was proven to be beneficial to prevent passivation degradation during hydrogen plasma etching. The preliminary results suggest that this is a promising method to replace currently used etching methods that remove the whole a-Si:H(i/n+) stack, significantly simplifying rear side patterning steps for SHJ -IBC solar cell devices...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the liquid phase {{crystallization}} (LPC) technology to produce solar cell absorbers of 10 − 40 µm thickness directly on glass, the development of interdigitated back-contact (IBC) -silicon hetero-junction (SHJ) solar cells thereon and the evaluation of material parameters and future prospects of the LPC technology. The latter is a new hybrid technology between wafers and classical bottom-up thin-ﬁlm technologies. Among them are absorbers based on amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H), micro-crystalline hydrogenated silicon (µc-Si:H), and tandem combinations as well as technologies that aimed to improve crystal quality (solid phase crystallization (SPC)) or reduce process temperatures (Aluminium induced layer transfer (ALILE)). All of them are either limited in performance by grain sizes in the few µm range or a maximum absorber thickness of few µm. Si wafers {{on the other hand}} show excellent performance but are limited to thicknesses over 120 µm and additional kerf-losses limit the potential for saving materials costs. The LPC approach circumvents this problem and represents a promising technology due to electronic absorber material quality and grain sizes being comparable to multi-crystalline (mc) -wafers. A steep learning curve at HZB and UNSW is a proof a steadily improving material quality. Within 5 years the efficiency has jumped from below 5 % to above 13 % that have been achieved in this work. The last leap of efficiencies before this thesis was made possible especially by technological improvements in the intermediate layer (IL) stack that made illumination from the glass side (superstrate) possible and the change from p- to n-type absorbers. The need arose for a contact system especially designed for n-type absorbers and for glass-side illumination to enhance light trapping which was not optimal with the FrontERA contact system used before the start of this thesis. At the same time, the contact systems should serve as a sound basis to investigate material quality. Due to the fact that most standard wafer characterization tools do not work on LPC-Si, most of the analysis is done via the ﬁnished device parameters. Hence, during this thesis, a process to fabricate an IBC-SHJ system was developed for n-type absorbers in superstrate operation, featuring fully passivated contacts. Furthermore, it was shown that these passivated contacts improve the local current collection. A functional IBC-SHJ cell is presented in the thesis along with a short-circuit current density (J SC) of more than 30 mA/cm 2 that was achieved for the ﬁrst time on an absorber of only ≈ 9 µm thickness. It is proven that the IBC-SHJ process leads to working solar cells independent of the glass substrate used, the crystallization type (laser or electron beam) or circumstances (vacuum or ambient) and irregardless of IL deposition methods (CVD or plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)). An open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 655 mV and a current of over 23. 5 mA/cm 2 are demonstrated on a merely 2. 5 µm thick absorber. A method to extract effective minority charge carrier diffusion length (Ldiff) from light-beam induced current (LBIC) line-scans over the absorber contact ﬁngers on a ﬁnished IBC-SHJ device is presented. This method is veriﬁed by simulations and is in general applicable to IBC systems regardless of the contact and absorber type, only depending on IBC geometries and material quality. It is proven that the Ldiff inside grains on LPC-Si absorbers are sufficient for an IBC system. The demonstrated possible versatility of deposition methods, tools and crystallization sources to achieve working IBC cells on LPC-Si sparked a development of high quality homogeneous IL stacks by an integrated (without <b>vacuum</b> <b>break)</b> PECVD process. Crystallization was optimized using a laser source in vacuum (instead of laser in ambient or electron-beam in vacuum). The total optimized absorber fabrication process was combined with an optimized contact system fabrication process and adapted IBC geometries. Among the changes are an increase of the pitch by a factor of two and a reduction in cell size by 40 % to make the process more robust and ﬁt more cells on a substrate to enhance statistics. Concomitantly, a new test structure concept named full-emitter cell (FEC) was developed. It is shown that the results of these accumulated changes led to the current record efficiencies on LPC-Si of 13. 2 % for two distinctly different absorber doping concentrations of 2 · 10 16 /cm 3 and 1 · 10 17 /cm 3 especially due to a tremendous increase in ﬁll factor (FF). Both FF (74. 7 %) and J SC (31. 3 mA/cm 2) presented in this thesis are the highest up date shown on LPC material. The best FEC structure yields an active area efficiency of 15. 9 % and demonstrates the potential of LPC-Si experimentally. The results of a doping density series are used to observe and partly quantify the change in absorber quality depending on P concentration. LBIC measurements show that a drop in current with rising doping density is attributed to a decrease in Ldiff that over-compensates a rise in VOC and FF. Consequently, a doping density of 2 · 10 16 /cm 3 yields the highest efficiencies on average in this experiment. Furthermore, LBIC investigations reveal that the passivation quality of the grain boundary (GB) is reduced for higher doping. It is considered that P segregation may be responsible for this and concluded that gettering or other post-annealing techniques should be applied to improve absorber quality. A study of bifacial quasi-cell test structures with different absorber thicknesses is performed. Measured J − V parameters are compared to simulations for both sub- and superstrate conﬁgurations. A detailed analysis leads {{to the conclusion that the}} interface between glass and LPC-Si is of a high quality and that at this point the bulk is more limiting for the performance. A ﬁnal holistic evaluation of the LPC-Si material and the contact system developed during this thesis identiﬁes limits and possible levers for further improvement. For the material, an improvement of the bulk Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) lifetime seems vital, whereas the contact system still suffers from high series resistance and the light management has potential for improvement. Efficiencies of 16 % seem feasible in the near future, whereas efficiencies approaching 20 % require substantial breakthroughs in improvement of the material quality, contact resistance and optics. Diese Doktorarbeit behandelt die Flüssigphasenkristallisationstechnologie (LPC Technologie) zur Herstellung von Solarzellenabsorbern einer Dicke von 10 − 40 µm direkt auf Glass und die Entwicklung von Solarzellen mit interdigitierenden Rückkontakten mit Silizium Heteroübergängen (IBC-SHJ) auf diesen Absorbern, sowie die Abschätzung von Materialparametern und Zukunftsaussichten der LPC Technologie. Die letztere ist eine neue Hybrid-Technologie zwischen Wafern und klassischen “bottom-up” Dünnschichttechnologien. Beispiele für diese sind a-Si:H, µc-Si:H und Tandemkombinationen derselben, sowie Technologien, die darauf abzielen die Kristallqualität zu verbessern (Festphasenkristallisation SPC) oder die Prozesstemperaturen zu reduzieren (Aluminium-induzierter Schichtaustausch ALILE). Alle genannten klassischen Dünnschichttechnologien sind in ihrem Wirkungsgradpotenzial entweder durch ihre Korngrößen von nur einigen µm oder durch eine maximale Absorberdicke von einigen µm begrenzt. Si Wafer auf der anderen Seite verzeichnen exzellente Wirkungsgrade, sind jedoch begrenzt auf Absorberdicken über 120 µm. Zusätzliche Sägeverluste sorgen dafür, dass das Materialeinsparpotenzial vergleichsweise gering ist. Der LPC Ansatz umgeht dieses Problem und stellt allgemein eine vielversprechende Technologie aufgrund einer mit mc-Wafern vergleichbaren Materialqualität und Korngröße, dar. Eine steile Lernkurve an den Instituten des HZB und der UNSW ist ein klarer Indikator einer stetig gestiegenen Materialqualität. Innerhalb von 5 Jahren hat sich die maximale Effizienz von unter 5 % auf über 13 % (in dieser Doktorarbeit) verbessert. Der letzte Sprung der Konvertierungseffizienzen wurde dank technologischer Verbesserungen des Zwischenschichtstapels(IL) möglich. Dieser ermöglichte eine Solarzellenoperation durch glasseitige (superstrat) Beleuchtung. Außerdem gab der Wechsel von p- zu n-Typ dotierten Absorbern einen Vorteil für die Effizienz. Schließlich wurde es notwendig ein Kontaktsystem zu entwerfen, das speziell für n-Typ Absorber ausgelegt ist und verbesserten Lichteinfang ermöglicht, der bei dem Vorgängermodell FrontERA noch nicht ausgereift war. Gleichzeitig sollte es dieses Kontaktsystem auch ermöglichen die Materialqualität genauer zu untersuchen, denn aufgrund der Tatsache, dass die meisten Standard-Wafercharakterisierungstechniken auf LPC-Si nicht anwendbar sind, müssen die meisten Analysen zur Materialqualität an einer fertigen Solarzelleneinheit vorgenommen werden. Daher wurde während dieser Doktorarbeit ein Prozess entwickelt um ein IBC-SHJ-System für n-Typ Absorber in Superstratkonﬁgurationsbetrieb zu fabrizieren, das vollständig passivierte Kontakte besitzt, um die lokale Stromsammlung zu verbessern. Die erste funktionierende IBC-SHJ Zelle, die in dieser Doktorarbeit präsentiert wird, besitzt eine Sättigungsstromdichte (J SC) von mehr als 30 mA/cm 2 bei einer Absorberdicke um ≈ 9 µm. Es wird außerdem bewiesen, dass der IBC-SHJ-Prozess unabhängig von verwendetem Glassubstrat, Kristallisationstyp (Laser oder Elektronenstrahl), sowie unabhängig von den Kristallisationsumständen (Vakuum oder unter Atmosphäre) und den Beschichtungsmethoden des IL (CVD oder PECVD) zu funktionierenden Solarzellen führt. Auf einem lediglich 2. 5 µm dünnen Absorber werden eine offene Klemmspannung (VOC) von 655 mV und ein J SC von 23. 5 mA/cm 2 gezeigt. Eine Methode um die effektive Minoritätsladungsträger-Diffusionslänge aus LBIC Linien-Scans über die Absorberkontaktﬁnger eines fertigen IBC-SHJ Bauteils zu ermitteln wird präsentiert. Diese Methode wird durch Simulationen veriﬁziert und ist allgemein auf IBC Systeme anwendbar, unabhängig von der Art der Kontakte oder des Absorbers; sie hängt nur von den IBC-Abmaßen und der Materialqualität ab. Es wird bewiesen, dass Ldiff innerhalb der Körner auf LPC-Si Absorbern ausreichend für ein IBC System ist. Die demonstrierte mögliche Vielseitigkeit von Depositionsmethoden, -anlagen und Kristallisationsquellen um funktionierende IBC Zellen auf LPC-Si herzustellen, wurde genutzt um hoch-qualitative IL Schichtstapel mit einem integrierten (ohne Vakuumbruch) PECVD Prozess zu entwickeln. Die Kristallisation wurde mittels einer Laserquelle in Vakuum optimisiert (anstatt mittels eines Lasers unter Atmosphäre oder einem Elektronenstrahl im Vakuum). Dieser gesamte optimisierte Absorberfabrikationsprozess wurde mit einem ebenso optimierten Kontaktsystemherstellungsprozess und angepassten Geometrien kombiniert. Unter den Änderungen sind unter anderem eine Verdoppelung des “pitch” und eine Reduzierung der Zellﬂäche um 40 % um den Prozess weniger fehleranfällig zu machen und durch die dadurch resultierende Erhöhung der Anzahl an Zellen pro Substrat mehr Statistik zu haben. Gleichzeitig wurde ein neues Teststrukturenkonzept namens full-emitter cell (FEC) (Voll-Emitter-Zelle) entwickelt. Es wird gezeigt, dass genau diese kumulierten Änderungen zu den Rekordumwandlungseffizienzen auf LPC-Si von 13, 2 % für zwei deutlich verschiedene Absorberdotierungskonzentrationen von 2 · 10 16 /cm 3 und 1 · 10 17 /cm 3 geführt haben. Besonders herauszuheben ist eine enorme Steigerung des Füllfaktors (FF). Sowohl der FF (74, 7 %), als auch der J SC (31, 3 mA/cm 2), die in dieser Arbeit präsentiert werden, stellen die bis jetzt höchsten auf LPC Material erreichten Werte dar. Die beste FEC Struktur ergab eine Umwandlungseffizienz von 15, 9 % (bezogen auf die aktive Fläche) und ist eine deutliche experimentelle Bestätigung des Potenzials von LPC-Si. Die Ergebnisse einer Dotierserie werden genutzt um die Änderung der Materialqualität in Abhängigkeit der P Konzentration festzustellen und teilweise zu quantiﬁzieren. LBIC Messungen zeigen, dass eine Abnahme des Strom mit höherer Dotierstoffkonzentration auf eine Abnahme von Ldiff zurückzuführen ist. Eine Zunahme von VOC und FF kann diesen Rückgang im Strom in Bezug auf die Gesamteffizienz nicht ausgleichen. Folglich erbringt eine Dotierung von 2 · 10 16 /cm 3 im Mittel die höchsten Effizienzen in diesem Experiment. Desweiteren wird beschrieben, wie LBIC Untersuchungen aufdecken, dass die Passivierungsqualität der Korngrenzen (GB) für höhere Dotierungen niedriger ist. Es wird in Betracht gezogen, dass P Segregation dafür verantwortlich ist und daraus geschlussfolgert, dass “Gettern” oder andere nachträgliche Ausheiltechniken angewenden werden sollten um die Absorberqualität zu erhöhen. Eine Studie bifazialer Quasizellteststrukturen unterschiedlicher Absorberdicke wird beschrieben. In Sub- und Superstratkonﬁguration gemessene Strom-Spannungs-Kennlinien(J − V) -Parameter werden mit simulierten verglichen. Eine detaillierte Analyse führt zu dem Schluss, dass die Grenzﬂäche zwischen Glass und LPC-Si eine gute Qualität besitzt und dass zu diesem Zeitpunkt das innere Absorbervolumen (bulk) für die Leistung limitierender ist. In einer abschließenden holistischen Evaluation des LPC-Si Materials und des in dieser Doktorarbeit entwickelten Kontaktsystems werden Grenzen und mögliche Ansatzpunkte für zukünftige Verbesserungen identiﬁziert. Eine Erhöhung der Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) Rekombinationshalbwertszeit der Minoritätsladungsträger im LPC-Si Volumen scheint entscheidend um die Zelle zu verbessern, wohingegen die Zelle von Seiten des Kontaktsystems am meisten von einer Verringerung des Serienwiderstands proﬁtieren würde. Zusätzlich gibt es ein Potential die Sättigungsstromdichte durch verbesserte Lichteinfangstrukturen zu erhöhen. Effizienzen um 16 % wären bereits in naher Zukunft machbar, wohingegen Effizienzen, die sich 20 % annähern, substanzielle Durchbrüche in Materialqualität, Kontaktwiderstand und Optik erfordern...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of nitrogen plasma exposure of the InP surface on the electrical characteristics of electron cyclotron resonance deposited Al/SiNx:H/InP devices. Nitrogen plasma exposure was performed just before the SiNx:H deposition without <b>vacuum</b> <b>breaking.</b> A 30 s plasma treatment at low microwave power (60 W) sharply reduces the minimum of the interface trap density, from 4 x 10 (12) to 1. 6 x 10 (12) eV(- 1) cm(- 2) (obtained by the high-low frequency capacitance method). We explain this reduction due {{to the formation of}} P-N and/or In-P-N complexes at the InP surface during the plasma-exposure step. These bonds are broken thermally after a rapid thermal annealing of the device. The minimum of the interface trap density, obtained at the optimum plasma exposure conditions, is among the lowest ones reported in the Literature and similar to those obtained with more complicated processing technologies of the SiNx:H/InP structure. This is a clear indication that plasma exposure in N- 2 atmosphere seems to be a valuable and simple surface conditioning method...|$|R
