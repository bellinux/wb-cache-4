40|$|Abstract. The case-based {{reasoning}} approach to email response consists of reusing past messages to synthesize new responses to incoming requests. This task presents various challenges {{due to the}} nature of the messages: Textual descriptions, multiple topics, heterogeneous content, <b>variable</b> <b>text</b> length and varying recurrence of the statements. In this paper, we address the problem of determining which portions of past cases are reusable. Our scheme consists of identifying parts of a past message and declaring them variable, optional or reusable. This formulation of case reuse corresponds, from an application point of view, to the dynamic creation of a response template from antecedent messages. We describe and compare two strategies for selecting the messages portions to be reused: Case grouping and condensation models. Our results indicate that the case grouping strategy is a better choice. We also describe some of our experiments for identifying variable parts, based on named entity extraction techniques. ...|$|E

We also consider the special case where the pattern and the text are the same string. This problem, which we call the string self-prefix problem, is similar to the pattern preprocessing step of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt stringmatching algorithm that is used in several comparison efficient stringmatching and prefix-matching algorithms, including in our new algorithm. We obtain roughly tight lower and upper bounds on the number of symbol comparisons required in the worst case [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a refined scene text {{detector}} {{with a novel}} Feature Enhancement Network (FEN) for Region Proposal and Text Detection Refinement. Retrospectively, both region proposal with only 3 × 3 sliding-window feature and text detection refinement with single scale high level feature are insufficient, especially for smaller scene text. Therefore, we design a new FEN network with task-specific, low and high level semantic features fusion to improve the performance of text detection. Besides, since unitary position-sensitive RoI pooling in general object detection is unreasonable for <b>variable</b> <b>text</b> regions, an adaptively weighted position-sensitive RoI pooling layer is devised for further enhancing the detecting accuracy. To tackle the sample-imbalance problem during the refinement stage, we also propose an effective positives mining strategy for efficiently training our network.

40|$|AI 2003 : Advances in Artificial Intelligence, 16 th Australian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Perth, Australia, December 3 - 5, 2003 Metadata {{plays an}} {{important}} role in discovering, collecting, extracting and aggregating Web data. This paper proposes a method of constructing metadata for a specific topic. The method uses Web pages that are located in a site and are linked from a listing page. Web pages of recipes, real estates, used cars, hotels and syllabi are typical examples of such pages. We call them a series of Web documents. A series of Web pages have the same appearance when a user views them with a browser, because it is often the case that they are written with the same tag pattern. The method uses the tag-pattern as the common structure of the Web pages. Individual contents of the pages appear as plain texts embedded between two consecutive tags. If we remove the tags, it becomes a sequence of plain texts. The plain texts in the same relative position can be interpreted as attribute values if we presume that the pages represent records of the same kind. Most of these plain texts in the same position vary page to page. But, it may happen that the same texts show up at the same relative position in almost all pages. These constant texts can be considered as attribute names. “Location”, “Rating” and “Travel from Airport” are examples of such constant texts for pages of hotel information. If the frequency of a text is higher than a threshold, we accept it as a component of metadata. If we mark a constant text with “N” and a <b>variable</b> <b>text</b> with “V”, the sequence of plain texts forms a series of N’s and V’s. A page in a series contain two kinds of NV sequence pattern. The first pattern is (NV) n, which we call vertical, where an attribute value follows the attribute name immediately. The second pattern is NnV n, which we call horizontal, where names occur in the first row and the same number of values follow in the next row. Thus we can understand the meaning of values and can construct records from a series of Web pages...|$|E

Research method used in this study is qualitative method because this method is appropriate with the characteristics of this research which produces written data from its study subject. The method used is of open and retrospective type. The data are from the novel Supernova with the main data taken from written documents from literary critics and general readers that have been published in the internet.

In terms of profession, more come from vocational field than from academic field. The novel Supernova are more highly received by the readers with senior high school and college background with the work in vocational field. Secondly, it is found that the textual aspect of the novel pertaining to the scientific topic is the part that gets most of the receptions from the readers.

40|$|Two {{modes of}} singing were evident in {{narrative}} performances recorded by Scots travellers: singing set melodies to memorized or re-created texts, and improvising on a variable melody to a memorized or a <b>variable</b> <b>text.</b> In travellers' society both modes are acceptable {{but the majority}} of travellers today prefer set melodies. The improvisatory mode was traditional and used by the older travellers born before World War I, five of whom became my informants or Ewan NacColl's, re. Travellers' Songs from England and Scotland (1977). The tradition of narrative improvisation appears to be obsolete with the death of Mrs Martha Johnstone (Perthshire), 1980. But her 108 sung performances, 66 songs and 34 narratives recorded between 1955 and 1978, by four fieldworkers, provide valuable material for the study of strophic variability [...] its function in the singer's interpretation of an essential story (Lord, 1960 and Buchan, 1972) in performance. Strophic variability is related to the Danish ballad singers' usage of variable intonations, and the author's musical analysis of the diachronic variants of Martha Johnstone's improvisatory ballads follows Thorkild Knudsen's theory of ballad melody or "melodic idea" (1967, 1976). The majority of travellers' performances, however, do not exhibit such extreme structural variations. Their ballads feature regularity manifested in a "standard strophe. " In performance the regularly recurring standard strophe is fluid, composed of musical equivalents or structural options at the level of pitch, figure, motive, phrase or strophe, which the singer may or may not choose to realize. Explanations for {{the presence or absence of}} variation or variants (musical equivalents) are discussed, particularly memory failure and uncertainty on the part of the singer. A high frequency of irregular strophes is evident in travellers' narrative songs. It can be shown that irregular strophes are often "fixed" in singers' versions. According to the author's thesis on variation as a process of volition and cognition, such irregular strophes are viewed as intentional and purposeful e. g., for expressing the climax or denouement of a narrative, or for heightening a particular dramatic or narrative episode within the singer's story. Testimonies from singers, their explanations and definitions bear out the truth of the analysis. Fifty-three examples of narrative performances by seven of the author's informants and six of MacColl's are featured in the work; thirty-nine are complete song transcriptions; fourteen are included on an accompanying cassette. Three especial singers, are from different "homeground areas" of the travellers in Scotland, are the subjects of the study - Martha Johnstone (Perthshire), Duncan Williamson (Argyllshire) and Johnnie Whyte (Angus).

The second doubles the storage cost, but allows one to obtain more accurate empirical Bayes estimates.
