In vehicle suspensions, bellcranks are used in pushrod-style suspensions in automobiles or in the Christie suspension in tanks. <b>Vertically-mounted</b> suspensions may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; bellcranks translate the vertical motion of the wheel in to horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Claire Parker (August 31, 1906 - October 3, 1981) was an American {{engineer}} and animator. A graduate of MIT, her best-known {{contribution to the}} history of cinema is the Pinscreen (Écran d'épingles), a <b>vertically-mounted</b> grid of 240,000 sliding metal rods that are first manually pushed into position to create lit and shaded areas, then filmed frame by frame. While the hand-operated, mechanical Pinscreen superficially shares characteristics with early [...] "optical toys" [...] like the zoetrope, it is distinguished by being one of the first devices ever to produce animation by reconfiguring a set of individual picture elements, later called pixels. Its pin [...] "resolution" [...] is sufficient to create photorealistic images, a painstaking process analogous to modern pixel art.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outcome was}} a {{complete}} redesign, the Model D of 1922. The uniflow engine, perceived as {{the root of the}} troubles with the Doble Detroit, gave place to a two-cylinder compound type, still with Joy's valve gear, but with piston valves. Another crucial development was a coiled monotube once-through <b>vertically-mounted</b> cylindrical boiler following the thinking behind the later version of the Detroit boiler, the most distinctive feature of which was the placing of the burner {{at the top of the}} boiler. This plus drastic insulation was meant to cause the hot gases to reside within the boiler casing for an optimum length of time giving up the maximum amount of heat to the feedwater. There was a forced draft burner at the top of the boiler and an exhaust flue at the bottom. The venturi was placed horizontally at the top of the vertical boiler barrel and oriented in such a way as to avoid direct contact with the monotube while inducing a swirl motion to the gases. It was thus a counterflow design with water entering the lower end of the coiled monotube and progressing upward toward the burner, which meant that the hottest gases gave superheat to the steam at the top of the coil whilst the cooler gases preheated oncoming the feedwater at the bottom. The distinctive hand operated [...] "miniature steering wheel” rotating a throttle control rod that passed down the middle of the steering column can be observed in D2 which still exists (in the UK) at the present time. Photographic evidence shows that D1 retained the foot throttle pedal, so when the wheel throttle control was first applied is not clear. The latter probably gave more precise adjustment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Steady-state {{external}} {{natural convection}} heat transfer from <b>vertically-mounted</b> rectangular staggered interrupted fins is investigated numerically and experimentally. FLUENT software {{is used to}} develop a 3 -D numerical model for investigation of fin interruption effects. A custom-designed testbed was developed and continuous, inline interrupted and staggered interrupted aluminum alloy heatsinks with various geometric dimensions are machined and tested to verify the theoretical results. A comprehensive experimental and numerical study is performed to investigate the effects of staggered interruptions. Our results show that adding staggered interruptions to <b>vertically-mounted</b> rectangular fins can enhance the thermal performance considerably than the inline interrupted fins. The results of this work {{can be used to}} improve thermal performance of enclosures in a variety of electronics, power electronics and telecommunication applications...|$|E

Sample observations of various soil minerals and plant leaves are presented; these goniometric data are compared to the results of a reflectance model from particulate surfaces and those of a ray-tracing model of leaf reflectance and transmittance...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the feasibility of using airborne remote sensing to locate the Rhine plume front. Interest in fronts arises from the desire to predict the fate of pollutants and biological nutrients discharged from rivers into the open sea. Observations were made during flights over the Dutch coastal waters using a <b>vertically-mounted</b> video camera and a side-looking airborne radar (SLAR) designed for oil slick detection. Comparison of radar images with visual observations of the sea colour discontinuity and foam line establish that fronts can indeed be detected by SLAR because of high radar backscatter along the convergence line, where the fresh water jet impinges on saltier water. This provides a sound basis for future investigations using Synthetic Aperture Radar as mounted on ERS- 1. An estimation of errors is given, identifying priorities for improvement of the technique. The accuracy achieved is considered sufficient for the validation of hydrodynamic models...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. The indium ion {{is among}} the {{candidates}} for optical frequency references because of the comparative simplicity of its laser cooling and trapping, the high quality factor (Q = 1. 5 x 1015) of its clock transition, and the insensitivity of its clock transition to shifts. The indium ion has an alkaline-earth-like spectrum with a cycling transition from the ground state to 3 P 1 at 230 nm. We report high-resolution laser spectroscopy of the ground-state to 3 P 0 "clock" transition at 237 nm in single indium ions confined in a Paul-Straubel trap. A frequency-quadrupled diode laser cools and detects the ion on the 3 P 1 transition while a frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG nonplanar ring oscillator (NPRO) at 946 nm stabilized to a <b>vertically-mounted</b> high-finesse optical cavity is tuned to {{the frequency of the}} metastable transition. The clock transition was observed using the shelving technique, giving absorption spectra as narrow as 150 Hz with 33 % shelving contrast. Systematic shifts of the indium ion clock transition include a linear nuclear Zeeman shift, a blackbody shift estimated as - 264 (40) mHz, and a second-order Zeeman shift of - 40 mHz/G...|$|E
40|$|A capacitance/dielectric sensor was designed, constructed, {{and used}} to measure in real time the in-situ water {{concentration}} in a desiccant water bed. Measurements were carried out with two experimental setups: (1) passing nitrogen through a humidity generator and allowing the gas stream to become saturated at a measured temperature and pressure, and (2) injecting water via a syringe pump into a nitrogen stream. Both water vapor generating devices were attached to a downstream <b>vertically-mounted</b> water capture bed filled with 19. 5 g of Moisture Gone desiccant. The sensor consisted of two electrodes: (1) a 1 / 8 " dia stainless steel rod placed {{in the middle of}} the bed and (2) the outer shell of the stainless steel bed concentric with the rod. All phases of the water capture process (background, heating, absorption, desorption, and cooling) were monitored with capacitance. The measured capacitance was found to vary linearly with the water content in the bed at frequencies above 100 kHz indicating dipolar motion dominated the signal; below this frequency, ionic motion caused nonlinearities in the water concentration/capacitance relationship. The desiccant exhibited a dielectric relaxation whose activation energy was lowered upon addition of water indicating either a less hindered rotational motion or crystal reorientation...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. One {{of the characteristics of}} multiphase flows with which the operation of process units have to contend is that they often manifest instabilities that have no equivalence in single-phase flow (Bouré et al. 1973). These instabilities result often in the occurrence of undesirable large pressure, flow and/or volume fraction oscillations, which, at best, upset the expected behaviour of the multiphase flow system, resulting in a logical decrease in the reliability and life of the components and, at worst, can lead to serious flow stoppage or structural failure. Although two-phase instabilities have been studied extensively, large gaps of unexplained behaviour still remain due to the complex nature of flow, pressure drop and heat transfer mechanisms and the interactions that occur between the three. There is still substantial work ongoing in the field as these instabilities may be detrimental in the smooth operation, control, mechanical integrity and safety of heat exchangers in a multitude of their industrial applications. This paper sheds light on the experimental studies of transient behaviour at reduced pressures conducted on the thermosyphon research facility at the University of Manchester in the Morton Laboratory. These studies were initiated because literature does not contain many references to this mode of operation and existing design techniques do no adequately cover operation in sub-atmospheric pressures. Thus, the studies meant to establish the operating limits of a full scale replica of an industrial sized natural circulation thermosyphon reboiler comprising 50 <b>vertically-mounted</b> 25 mm OD tubes of 3 m length. Water is used as the process fluid and condensing steam is the heating source. A constant fluid level is maintained {{at the top of the}} tube-sheet using an overflow line. The behaviour in the flow-induced unstable region, the heat-induced unstable region and the stable region have been investigated. This work attempts to identify the lower and upper thresholds of instability at various reduced process pressures. For the conditions investigated, explicit thresholds are determined for the transitions between the stable region and the two unstable regions. Instability is defined based on the magnitude of oscillations observed in continuously monitored flows around the recirculation loop. The experiments revealed that the region of stable operation is very dependent on process pressure and progressively becomes smaller as the vacuum becomes lower. The use of throttling in the heat-induced unstable region to return to stable operation tends to be over a narrow region, outside of which the sole way to regain stability is to lower the heat load. In the region of flow-induced instability, throttling of the fluid at the inlet is useless and actually makes the situation worse. These instabilities are alleviated by increasing the heat load or flooding the reboiler. cs 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{vaporization}} {{of tungsten}} from the APT spallation target dominates the radiological source term for unmitigated target overheating accidents. Chemical reactions of tungsten with steam which persist to tungsten temperatures {{as low as}} 800 C result {{in the formation of}} a hydrated tungsten-oxide which has a high vapor pressure and is readily convected in a flowing atmosphere. This low-temperature vaporization reaction essentially removes the oxide film that forms on the tungsten-metal surface as soon as it forms, leaving behind a fresh metallic surface for continued oxidation and vaporization. Experiments were conducted to measure the oxidative vaporization rates of tungsten in steam as part of the effort to quantify the MT radiological source term for severe target accidents. Tests were conducted with tungsten rods (1 / 8 inch diameter, six inches long) heated to temperatures from approximately 700 C to 1350 C in flowing steam which was superheated to 140 C. A total of 19 experiments was conducted. Fifteen tests were conducted by RF induction heating of single tungsten rods held vertical in a quartz glass retort. Four tests were conducted in a <b>vertically-mounted</b> tube furnace for the low temperature range of the test series. The aerosol which was generated and transported downstream from the tungsten rods was collected by passing the discharged steam through a condenser. This procedure insured total collection of the steam along with the aerosol from the vaporization of the rods. The results of these experiments revealed a threshold temperature for tungsten vaporization in steam. For the two tests at the lowest temperatures which were tested, approximately 700 C, the tungsten rods were observed to oxidize without vaporization. The remainder of the tests was conducted over the temperature range of 800 C to 1350 C. In these tests, the rods were found to have lost weight due to vaporization of the tungsten and the missing weight was collected in the downstream condensate system. The aerosol formed a fine white smoke of tungsten-oxide which was visible to the eye as it condensed in the laminar boundary layer of steam which flowed along the surface of the rod. The aerosol continued to flow as a smoke tube downstream of the rod, flowing coaxially along the centerline axis of the quartz glass tube and depositing by impaction along the outside of a bend and at sudden area contractions in the piping. The vaporization rate data from the 17 experiments which exceeded the vaporization threshold temperature are shown in Figure 5 in the form of vaporization rates (g/cm{sup 2 } s) vs. inverse temperature (K{sup {minus} 1 }). Two correlations to the present data are presented and compared to a published correlation by Kilpatrick and Lott. The differences are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Material properties, {{coupled with}} typical device {{structures}} of GaN-based light-emitting diode (LED) wafer {{give rise to}} Lambertian emission patterns with large beam divergence. However, this pattern may not be useful or beneficial to many applications. In some specific applications, such as spot lighting or light sources for fiber coupling, emission with narrow beam divergence is required, whereas in general lighting such as the street lamps and indoor lighting, a diffused light source rather than a point source is needed. By manipulating the optical emission of LEDs at the chip level, some performance metrics of LEDs can be enhanced and their applications can be extended into new fields rather than merely for lighting. Additionally, the need for external optics can be eliminated, thereby increasing the flexibility of design. In this thesis, five implementations are reported to achieve emission control, namely chip design, optics design, package design and system design, which are ordered according to the LED fabrication process flow. Manipulation of optical emission can be observed by comparing the proposed devices with the conventional devices, or the successful demonstration of a new application. By chip shaping via laser micromachining, a three-dimensional truncated-conic LED (TC-LED) is proposed to cut off efficiently lateral emissions from the LED sidewall, thus enhancing color uniformity from its top quantum-dot coated surface. The optical properties of TC-LED are investigated: the beam divergence is reduced by 32 o and the power in the normal direction is enhanced by 21. 7 %. After applying quantum dots to achieve white-light emission, the top emission color uniformity is improved by 37 %. By including optics on the chip level, beam divergence can be narrowed down. The hemispherical lens LED (HL-LED) with directional beam is proposed, achieving a 53. 8 % enhancement of fiber coupling efficiency. On top of a flip-chip-packaged TC-LED, a hemispherical BK- 7 lens is capillary-bonded onto the sapphire surface. Compared with TC-LED, the divergence of HL-LED is significantly reduced by 50 o. <b>Vertically-mounted</b> LED (vmLED) is proposed to broaden the emission pattern at the packaging level. By mounting the LED die upright to expose two large illumination surfaces instead of the traditional way of bonding the die flat down, the optical emission pattern is converted from Lambertian to a two-lobed pattern. Both the optical properties and thermal properties are investigated and {{it is found that}} there is a trade-off between the heat dissipation and light output. A sapphire-prism-mounted vmLED is further proposed to improve the heat sinking. In the last two chapters, micro-LED arrays with smaller illuminated active regions are introduced and the combination with external optics, including optical fibers and projection lens sets are used to demonstrate novel LED applications. By coupling a bi-linear micro-LED array into a fiber bundle, a portable microdisplay system is demonstrated and this comprehensive system can be used for image projection. Another application involved a linear UV-micro-LED array coupled with a projection lens set; this optical system has been demonstrated as a direct-write lithographic tool for the fabrication of polymer microlens arrays on InGaN LEDs. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
