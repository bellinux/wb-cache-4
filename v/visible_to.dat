5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means that}} it is not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye. It is slightly dimmer than Neptune, which has an {{apparent magnitude}} of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E

To the southeast of Lindley Mountain, Arden Valley Road turns east and into the park. Arden Valley Road passes Lake Cohasset and Upper Lake Cohasset as it heads eastward.

5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs). Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.12 and is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{that are}} most active at dawn and dusk, when {{temperatures}} are cooler than mid-day, are called crepuscular. The subdued morning and evening light helps make them less <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> predators, but is bright enough {{to allow them to}} locate food. Some animals are crepuscular mainly because their prey is. Crepuscular animals in the area include mule deer, coyotes, porcupines, mountain cottontails, jackrabbits, and many songbirds.|$|E
5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to}} be somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E

5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed. This includes the use of high-contrast disruptive patterns as used on military uniforms, but anything that delays recognition {{can be used as}} camouflage. Camouflage involves deception, whether by looking like the background or by resembling something else, which may be plainly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> observers. This article lists methods used by animals and the military to escape notice.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye.|$|E

HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet {{at least three times}} the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> {{the naked}} eye in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably during {{the latter half of}} that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye for {{twice as long as}} the previous record-holder.

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with {{any degree of}} certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> the naked eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Vesta reached {{opposition}} in the constellation of Leo {{on the night of}} 17–18 February, at about magnitude 6.1, a brightness that makes it visible in binocular range but generally not for the naked eye.

Vesta came to opposition again on 5 August 2011, in the constellation of Capricornus at about magnitude 5.6.|$|E
