5|$|The oldest monuments on this list—Caludon Castle and St Mary's Priory and Cathedral—were {{built in}} the 11th century. Both are now ruins.

5|$|New York Riesling {{generally}} has a characteristic effervescent light {{body with a}} similarly light, mellow flavor. The wine can be dynamic though rarely robust, and ranges from dry to sweet.

25|$|MBO55 and -56 {{also had}} {{issues with the}} {{controllers}} and the lubrication of the gear boxes, and the issues were soon corrected. The most troubling issue was a swaying motion when running on the suburban <b>Vignoles</b> rails. The riders complained to no avail until several derailments made the management aware of the severity. A Gullfisk was test-run and {{found to have a}} much smoother ride. A horizontal suspension was added, which helped somewhat to reduce the swaying. This could only be installed on the newer MBO55 and -56 series, as MBO50 had a different bogie design. The issue was never corrected in a satisfactory way.|$|E
25|$|From 1834 Robertson {{was working}} with Braithwaite {{promoting}} the Eastern Counties Railway. He had married Sophia Brooman, related to the Cobbold family of Ipswich, and the Cobbolds came in strongly to bring a railway to their part of East Anglia. Charles Blacker <b>Vignoles</b> as consultant engineer gave the project credibility. Matters went downhill, however, after Robertson wrote an expansive prospectus in 1834. The land deals were slow and at high premiums, with Lord Petre presenting a particular obstacle. Herapath was brought into the company, did not fit in well, and in October 1835 quarrelled spectacularly with Robertson, who exacerbated the position with Lord Petre on {{what appeared to be}} a grudge. The required Act of Parliament of 1836 nearly missed its chance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vignole</b> is {{actually}} {{made up of}} two distinct islands, which are connected by a bridge. Like Sant'Erasmo, <b>Vignole</b> houses a scanty population, most of whom work in agriculture. The {{eastern part of the}} island is a military zone, housing barracks of the Lagunari regiment. Two bridges connected this sector to the nearby Sant'Andrea Island, home to the eponymous fort.|$|R
