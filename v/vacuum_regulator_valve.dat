50|$|He holds {{a patent}} for an {{automatic}} trip fill nozzle {{and another for}} an exhaust <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> for push-pull diving system.|$|R
50|$|The whole {{construction}} {{is simple and}} reliable; except for the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and steerable nozzles, the rocket engine has no moving parts.|$|R
5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> V was opened and steam {{admitted}} into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> was then {{closed and the}} water injection valve V briefly snapped open and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and raising the pump gear.|$|R
25|$|Because factory {{machinery}} {{needed to}} operate at a constant speed, Watt linked a steam <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> to a centrifugal governor which he adapted from those used to automatically control the speed of windmills.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} side-tanks, the {{locomotive}} {{also had a}} well-tank between the frames under the boiler barrel. The dome {{was on the front}} section of the boiler and the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> was arranged in the smokebox.|$|R
50|$|The balloon is {{attached}} to the inflation nozzle and a piece of string is wound around the neck. After donning safety glasses and hearing protection a check is made to ensure the needle valve is fully closed. The main valve on the cylinder is then opened, followed by the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve.</b> Next, the needle valve is opened and the balloon begins to inflate. As the balloon reaches the correct size the inflation nozzle will begin to lift. At this point the needle valve is closed along with the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and cylinder vale. The string is then used to tie off the balloon neck to ensure that no gas can escape.|$|R
40|$|Valve {{features}} precise gas-pressure {{regulation and}} shuts off flow by remote control. Valve {{is made up}} of <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> cavity and spring-compression adjusts cavity. Elements in regulator cavity are conventional and include high-pressure inlet, ball which mates with seat, push rod, and pressure-sensing diaphragm...|$|R
2500|$|The J class also {{featured}} {{a number of}} other design advances over the K class. It had a larger grate, enabling grate sections to be compatible with those of the N class and permitting an increase in firebox volume sufficient to allow two arch tubes to be installed. Another innovation was the use of a <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> incorporating a centrifugal steam separator (to draw away any water and thus provide the driest steam), rather than the simpler (though extremely reliable) D <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> used in the K class. The J class {{also featured}} [...] substantially redesigned cylinder porting to improve steam flow and efficiency. The innovative SCOA-P type driving wheel centre developed for the Victorian Railways R class was adapted for the [...] diameter J class drivers.|$|R
40|$|During routine flight {{servicing}} {{operation on}} an {{aircraft in the}} hanger, the oxygen charging trolley exploded and caught fire. After examination of the wreckage at the accident site, the Board of Inquiry referred a few samples of burst pipelines and hoses to the laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that the pipelines and the hoses in question have failed by bursting due to sudden rise in pressure. From the evidences on the failed samples and {{the sequence of events}} that led to the accident, it appears most probable that the sudden rise in pressure was due to malfunctioning of the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> in the system. In view of this, it is suggested that the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> which controls the oxygen pressure during charging of the aircraft be examined in detail...|$|R
50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and a pressure relief valve as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a safety release valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a low and high pressure setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage pressure regulator. Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow excess pressure to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a spring-loaded valve that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|R

50|$|The quick-change barrel has {{a slotted}} flash suppressor. The barrel's chamber and bore are chromium-lined and the barrel has four {{right-hand}} grooves with a 305 mm (1:12 in) rifling twist rate. Also {{attached to the}} barrel is the front sight base, carry handle and gas block (equipped with an exhaust-type gas <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> with three settings).|$|R
50|$|The normal {{arrangement}} involved taking steam {{after the}} <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> and passing it through long superheater tubes inside specially large firetubes of the boiler. The superheater tubes had a reverse ("torpedo") bend at the firebox end {{so that the}} steam had to pass {{the length of the}} boiler at least twice, picking up heat as it did so.|$|R
25|$|This type is {{mentioned}} {{here because it}} is very familiar in comics and other drawings, as a wrongly-drawn twin-hose two-cylinder aqualung regulator, with one wide hose coming out of each cylinder top to the mouthpiece with no apparent <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> much more often than a correctly-drawn twin-hose regulator (and often of such breathing sets being used by combat frogmen): see Frogman#Errors about frogmen found in public media.

50|$|The L7A2, {{general-purpose}} machine gun, {{replaced the}} L7A1 in service with the British Army. Compared to the MAG Model 60-20, it features, among other minor changes, a 10-position gas <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> a plastic butt-stock and a bracket, used to mount optical day- and night-vision sights, mounted {{to the left}} side of the receiver. In a stationary defensive role, the L7A2 can be mounted on the L4A1 tripod in conjunction with a periscope sight.|$|R
50|$|The most {{noticeable}} external {{difference from the}} experimental Class MD engine was the altered arrangement of the main steam pipes necessitated by the superheater. Instead of being led vertically down from the dome directly to the high-pressure cylinders, an internal pipe {{was taken from the}} <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> in the dome to the superheater in the smokebox, from where it was brought back to the high-pressure cylinders by external steam pipes arranged under the running boards.|$|R

50|$|Other novel {{developments}} {{include an}} automatic <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> {{which can be}} simply installed to the pumps to allow the maximum utilisation of water supply from low or seasonally variable water sources without the need to manually adjust the pumps - as well as much larger pump versions with 1 metre diameter inlets for large river, marine tidal and flood applications. Systems have also been developed and utilised for rainwater harvesting, water treatment and other water utility applications.|$|R

Steel fireboxes were used as well as [...] "Owens" [...] patent poppet <b>valve</b> and balanced <b>regulator</b> <b>valves.</b> As was usual for short-journey locomotives they were not fitted with superheating, as short journeys allow little time for the superheater elements to reach working temperature.|$|R
50|$|One last {{story is}} told, {{revealing}} that destroying the Buick actually was discussed. However, {{they come to}} theorize that the Buick functions {{as a sort of}} <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> drawing in and out between the two worlds... and that destroying it would do much more harm than good, releasing whatever malign power is maintained by it. They decide that it is safest to watch over the Buick, in the hope that whatever force that powers it will eventually dissipate and expire.|$|R
50|$|An M.L.S. multiple-valve {{regulator}} superheater header was fitted, {{arranged with}} the <b>regulator</b> <b>valves</b> located on its saturated steam side. The regulator spindle {{passed through the}} smokebox side and the operating rods were led along the left-hand side of the boiler to the cab. Steam was fed to the superheater header through a 7 in diameter internal steam pipe from a standpipe in the shallow dome. As an experiment, two of the engines were equipped with patent steam driers, fitted in the dome.|$|R

50|$|The Diameter Index Safety System, or DISS, was {{designed}} by the Compressed Gas Association specifically for medical gases at 200 psig or less. It uses unique, gas-specific threaded connections to fit equipment to station outlets. It is also used for the connection of additional features to equipment, such as in fixing a suction canister to a suction (Medical <b>vacuum)</b> <b>regulator.</b> Although DISS takes more time to affix, this {{has become the most}} popular choice as a threaded connection cannot disengage on its own.|$|R

2500|$|On an {{oxyacetylene}} torch system {{there will be}} three types of valves, the tank <b>valve,</b> the <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> and the torch valve. There will be a set of these three valves for each gas. The gas in the tanks or cylinders is at high pressure. Oxygen cylinders are generally filled to approximately 2200 psi. The regulator converts the high pressure gas to a low pressure stream suitable for welding. [...] Acetylene cylinders must be maintained in an upright position to prevent the internal acetone and acetylene from separating in the filler material.|$|R
40|$|Proportional {{control in}} {{hydraulics}} is widely utilized. The {{most widely used}} current types of proportional valves utilize solenoid technology. While this technology {{has been around for}} decades and has been proven an effective means of control, there is always a demand for improved performance of advancing technologies. Integrating piezoelectric devices as a means to control hydraulic systems helps advance control for hydraulic systems. Piezoelectric stack devices have been used to control hydraulic systems with success. Advantages of these stacks include being relatively small with a high power to weight ratio, using less energy than solenoid operations, and being fast acting. The main disadvantage to these piezoelectric stacks is the small amount of displacement. This research focuses on the use of a piezoelectric linear motor to control a proportional <b>regulator</b> <b>valve.</b> After a literature review was conducted, a mathematical model was developed to determine valve performance. The motor performance was tested under 4 loading conditions and the velocity curves were plotted for different velocities. The valve was printed using 3 D printing and then tests were conducted to determine flow rates and pressures for the rapid prototyped proportional hydraulic <b>regulator</b> <b>valve.</b> It was found that a piezoelectric linear motor {{can be used as a}} means to control a proportional valve. However, the rapid prototyped design was determined to have drawbacks that hindered performance noticeably...|$|R
30|$|The blade has {{a window}} {{opening at the}} end with cutting edges through which tissue is {{aspirated}} {{by means of a}} vacuum source. The vacuum source is connected to a <b>regulator</b> <b>valve</b> with a manometer. The optimal suction power connected to the inner tube of the HM blade is 200  mmHg. When the inner tube is not activated, the window opening is locked to prevent active suction of the distension liquid in order to avoid uterine cavity collapse. The removed tissue is discharged through the device, collected in a pouch, and made available for pathology analysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{throttle}} handle {{is on the}} right lever. In the closed position it completely shuts the fuel <b>regulator</b> <b>valve,</b> stopping fuel from reaching the engine. Turning the handle counterclockwise, the pilot increases the engine thrust. During servicing of the pack with compressed nitrogen the handle is held in the closed position with a shear pin for safety. The pilot's timer is on the same handle. Since the pack has fuel for only for 21 seconds of flight, it is critical to know when the pack will run out of fuel, so that the pilot can safely land before his tanks are empty.|$|R
