50|$|Although jasmonate (JA) regulates many {{different}} {{processes in the}} plant, its role in wound response is best understood. Following mechanical wounding or herbivory, JA biosynthesis is rapidly activated, leading to expression of the appropriate response genes. For example, in the tomato, wounding produces defense molecules that inhibit leaf digestion in the insect's gut. Another indirect result of JA signaling is the <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> of JA-derived compounds. MeJA on leaves can travel airborne to nearby plants and elevate levels of transcripts related to wound response. In general, this emission can further upregulate JA synthesis and signaling and induce nearby plants to prime their defenses in case of herbivory.|$|E

We show that herbivory by phloem-feeding aphids inhibits floral <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> in white mustard Sinapis alba measured by gas chromatographic analysis of headspace volatiles. The effect of the Brassica specialist aphid Lipaphis erysimi was stronger than the generalist aphid Myzus persicae and feeding by chewing larvae of the moth Plutella xylostella caused no reduction in floral <b>volatile</b> <b>emission.</b> Field observations showed no effect of L. erysimimediated floral <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> on the total number of flower visits by pollinators.

This is the first demonstration that phloem-feeding herbivory can affect floral <b>volatile</b> <b>emission,</b> and that the outcome of interaction between herbivory and floral chemistry may differ depending on the herbivore’s feeding mode and degree of specialisation.

Caterpillars preferred volatiles from rust-infected over uninfected trees. Our results suggest a defense hormone crosstalk upon combined herbivore–pathogen attack in poplar trees which results in lowered emission of herbivore-induced volatiles.

We are particularly concerned with modeling the feedback mechanisms which cause a coal dust flame to accelerate, leading to detonation. Previous experimental {{studies have been conducted}} on both coal dust flame propagation and on individual coal particle combustion. Based on the results, a physical model is proposed in which coal dust flame acceleration is entirely controlled, in a feedback fashion, by <b>volatiles</b> <b>emission</b> and their reaction. A control system model is developed that employs five well-stirred reactor subsystems with three feedback interaction mechanisms. The model consists of a leading shock wave, followed by a variable length <b>volatiles</b> <b>emission</b> region ahead of the flame, a fixed length burning region immediately behind the flame front, and a variable length exhaust region extending back to the closed end of the duct. The feedback mechanisms incorporated into the model include heat transfer and pressurization from the burning region to the <b>volatiles</b> <b>emission</b> region, and pressurization from the <b>volatiles</b> <b>emission</b> region to the turbulent mixing region behind the shock wave. Each well-stirred reactor is described by a system of algebraic and ordinary differential equations for the rate of change of conditions inside the reactor. Numerical simulation results reveal that, despite far-reaching simplifications (ordinary instead of partial differential equations, ideal gases insteady of two-phase flow, separation of <b>volatiles</b> <b>emission</b> and combustion, neglection of char burning), the model exhibits the fundamental dynamic properties of the flame propagation process.

In this study, the effects of induction of an early and a later step in plant defence signal transduction on plant <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> and parasitoid attraction are compared. Ion channel-forming peptides represent a class of inducers that induce an early step in signal transduction. Alamethicin (ALA) is an ion channel-forming peptide mixture from the fungus Trichoderma viride that can induce <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> and increase endogenous levels of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid in plants. ALA was used to induce an early step in the defence response in Brussels sprouts plants, Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera, and to study the effect on <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> and on the behavioural response of parasitoids to <b>volatile</b> <b>emission.</b> The parasitoid Cotesia glomerata was attracted to ALA-treated plants in a dose-dependent manner. JA, produced through the octadecanoid pathway, activates a later step in induced plant defence signal transduction, and JA also induces volatiles that are attractive to parasitoids. Treatment with ALA and JA resulted in distinct volatile blends, and both blends differed from the volatile blends emitted by control plants. Even though JA treatment of Brussels sprouts plants resulted in higher levels of <b>volatile</b> <b>emission,</b> ALA-treated plants were as attractive to C. glomerata as JA-treated plants.

40|$|Floral scent is {{important}} to plant reproduction because it attracts pollinators to the sexual organs. Therefore, <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> is usually tuned to the foraging activity of the pollinators. In Petunia hybrida, volatile benzenoids determine the floral aroma. Although the pathways for benzenoid biosynthesis have been characterized, the enzymes involved are less well understood. How production and emission are regulated is unknown. By targeted transcriptome analyses, we identified ODORANT 1 (ODO 1), {{a member of the}} R 2 R 3 -type MYB family, as a candidate for the regulation of volatile benzenoids in Petunia hybrida cv W 115 (Mitchell) flowers. These flowers are only fragrant in the evening and at night. Transcript levels of ODO 1 increased before the onset of <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> and decreased when <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> declined. Downregulation of ODO 1 in transgenic P. hybrida Mitchell plants strongly reduced volatile benzenoid levels through decreased synthesis of precursors from the shikimate pathway. The transcript levels of several genes in this pathway were reduced by suppression of ODO 1 expression. Moreover, ODO 1 could activate the promoter of the 5 -enol-pyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase gene. Flower pigmentation, which is furnished from the same shikimate precursors, was not influenced because color and scent biosynthesis occur at different developmental stages.

The present study addresses the potential trade-off between plant phytochemical responses to insect herbivory and interactions with pollinators. We used a multidisciplinary approach and have combined field and greenhouse experiments to investigate effects of herbivory in plant <b>volatile</b> <b>emission,</b> nectar production, and pollinator behavior, when Pieris brassicae caterpillars were allowed to feed only on the leaves of Brassica nigra plants. Interestingly, <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> by flowers changed upon feeding by herbivores on the leaves, whereas, remarkably, <b>volatile</b> <b>emission</b> by leaves did not significantly differ between infested and non-infested flowering plants. The frequency of flower visits by pollinators was generally not influenced by herbivory, but the duration of visits by honeybees and butterflies was negatively affected by herbivore damage to leaves. Shorter duration of pollinator visits could be beneficial for a plant, because it sustains pollen transfer between flowers while reducing nectar consumption per visit. Thus, no trade-off between herbivore-induced plant responses and pollination was evident. The effects of herbivore-induced plant responses on pollinator behavior underpin the importance of including ecological factors, such as herbivore infestation, in studies of the ecology of plant pollination.

In this review, we combine the results from studies on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected during this decay process and those on the biochemical formation of VOCs {{in order to improve}} our understanding of the decay process. Micro-organisms are the main producers of VOCs, which are by- or end-products of microbial metabolism. Many microbes are already present inside and on a vertebrate, and these can initiate microbial decay. In addition, microorganisms from the environment colonize the cadaver. The composition of microbial communities is complex, and communities of different species interact with each other in succession. In comparison to the complexity of the decay process, the resulting volatile pattern does show some consistency. Therefore, the possibility of an existence of a time-dependent core volatile pattern, which could be used for applications in areas such as forensics or food science, is discussed. Possible microbial interactions that might alter the process of decay are highlighted. Keywords Post-mortem decay. Post-mortem volatiles.

40|$|Vertical flow systems {{filled with}} porous medium {{have been shown}} to {{efficiently}} remove volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) from contaminated groundwater. To apply this semi-natural remediation strategy it is however necessary to distinguish between removal due to biodegradation and due to volatile losses to the atmosphere. Especially for (potentially) toxic VOCs, the latter needs to be minimized to limit atmospheric emissions. In this study, numerical simulation was used to investigate quantitatively the removal of volatile organic compounds in two pilot-scale water treatment systems: an unplanted vertical flow filter and a planted one, which could also be called a vertical flow constructed wetland, both used for the treatment of contaminated groundwater. These systems were intermittently loaded with contaminated water containing benzene and MTBE as main VOCs. The highly dynamic but permanently unsaturated conditions in the porous medium facilitated aerobic biodegradation but could lead to <b>volatile</b> <b>emissions</b> of the contaminants. Experimental data from porous material analyses, flow rate measurements, solute tracer and gas tracer test, as well as contaminant concentration measurements at the boundaries of the systems were used to constrain a numerical reactive transport modeling approach. Numerical simulations considered unsaturated water flow, transport of species in the aqueous and the gas phase as well as aerobic degradation processes, which made it possible to quantify the rates of biodegradation and <b>volatile</b> <b>emissions</b> and calculating their contribution to total contaminant removal. A range of degradation rates was determined using experimental results of both systems under two operation modes and validated by field data obtained at different operation modes applied to the filters. For both filters, simulations and experimental data point to high biodegradation rates, if the flow filters have had time to build up their removal capacity. For this case <b>volatile</b> <b>emissions</b> are negligible and total removal can be attributed to biodegradation, only. The simulation study thus supports the use of both of these vertical flow systems for the treatment of groundwater contaminated with VOCs and the use of reactive transport modeling for the assessment of VOCs removal and operation modes in these high performance treatment systems...|$|R
