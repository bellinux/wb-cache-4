40|$|Since the Act of Value Added Tax in Sweden {{went into}} force in 1994 {{it has been}} the main {{regulation}} of the Swedish Value Added Tax (<b>VAT)</b> <b>payment.</b> As a result of the Swedish admission to the European Union (EU) in 1995, continuous changes have been made to the VAT Act in order to conform with the EC directive of VAT. The Swedish membership of the EU has involved an implementation of the EC law into the Swedish legal system. Therefore, the EC law must always be considered when applying Swedish national law. As from 1 January 2010 the VAT Act has been entered with new VAT regulations, regarding the taxation of services in foreign trade, {{as a result of the}} EC directive 2008 / 8. The purpose of these changes is simply to align the Swedish regulations with EC law. In order to achieve this alignment the Chapter 5 of the VAT act has been restructured. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the significance of the new VAT regulations in Swedish national law and to compare the changes with the previous wording of the VAT act. The conclusion is that the theory of the previous wording has not been changed by the new wording of the VAT act. The principal change has been made to the structure of Chapter 5 of the VAT act.

40|$|This study {{examines}} overnight (O/N) interest rates which constitute {{the short end}} of the yield curve and the factors which have an impact on such rates. The MNB, unlike several other central banks, does not have a direct overnight interest rate target; it does, however, limit the divergence of O/N interest rates from its policy rate with the settings of its operational framework. First, the MNB’s regulations on compulsory reserves allow banks to apply averaging in the reserve maintenance period, which reduces overnight interest rate volatility. Second, the interest rate corridor – determined by MNB’s collateralised loan and deposit – limits the maximum fluctuation band of overnight interbank interest rates. The study finds that the role of reserve averaging to reduce yield fluctuations is imperfect, as a clear seasonal pattern is observed in the intra-maintenance period evolution of overnight rates. The frequency of cumulative front-loading and excess reserves is significantly higher than the frequency of reserve deficit. Therefore, the level of overnight interest rates tends to remain below the policy rate and drop towards the interest rates of overnight central bank deposits {{at the end of the}} maintenance period. Moreover, statistical analysis finds evidence that the impact of liquidity withdrawing shocks are typically greater – approximately twice as much – as of those injecting liquidity. This phenomenon could be explained by the volatility of autonomous liquidity factors, especially that of the government accounts, which is particularly high on <b>VAT</b> <b>payment</b> days. Institutional settings (credit limits, limitation of maximum deviation from reserve requirements, high interbank concentration) curtail the potential of the interbank market to efficiently distribute liquidity over the entire system, which may also explain the asymmetric liquidity management characteristics of Hungarian banks. overnight rate, central bank instruments, operational framework, averaging, reserve requirements. ...|$|E
40|$|Proceeding {{from the}} changes in direct and {{indirect}} taxation {{in the process of}} the EU tax system reform and the fact that new trends bring about vital social changes, the research in this area could add to the understanding of economic development of these countries. In the EU with its decentralized tax policy, changes in direct and indirect taxation are permanently implemented in the process of tax system reform. Harmonization of direct and indirect taxation in the EU is conducted by means of the adopted community law regulations. In the harmonization of direct taxation there is a tendency towards an increase of the level of fiscal coordination and elimination of barriers to the common market. Thus direct taxation reforms are limited to achieving higher level of coordination and preventing evasion and double taxation. The current policy {{is the result of the}} principle according to which fiscal competition has positive effects on reducing consumption and on the EU economic development. In the harmonization process the systems of indirect taxation are aligned particularly with excise duty and value added tax. Fiscal strategies in the reform process are mostly aimed at fiscal coordination, modernization, informative cooperation, evasion reduction and elimination of malpractices in fulfilling a <b>VAT</b> <b>payment</b> liability. Within the excise tax system minimal excise rates are determined and an environmentally-friendly policy is pursued. The main priorities of taxation changes within the harmonization process are in respect of evasion reduction and irrational fiscal competition on the EU market. A study of direct and indirect taxation changes in the process of the tax system reform is highly significant both from the aspect of efficient tax-system functioning, which results in achieving EU macroeconomic goals, and from the aspect of single states' interests in the process of transition and accession...|$|E

Using the 2004 / 2005 Household Budget Survey, we assess the amount of VAT that households pay {{as a proportion of}} weekly disposable income. We measure <b>VAT</b> <b>payments</b> by equivalised income decile, households of different composition and different household sizes. The current system is highly regressive. With the use of a micro-simulation model we also estimate the impact of changing the VAT rate on certain groups of items and the associated change in revenue. We also consider how the imposition of a flat rate across all goods and services would affect households in different categories. The Irish Government has recently announced that it proposes to increase the standard rate of VAT to 22 % in 2013 and to 23 % in 2014. We examine the distributional implications of such increases. The general pattern of results shows that those hardest hit are households in the first income decile, households in rural areas, 6 person households and households containing a single adult with children...|$|R

If diesel {{is used in}} industrial activities, the diesel taxes paid can be fully used as a credit against VAT, {{but if it is}} used in freight or public transportation – basically trucks and buses – only a fraction of diesel taxes paid can be claimed as a tax credit for <b>VAT</b> <b>payments.</b> As a result of this different tax treatment, firms have incentives to use ‘tax-exempted’ diesel in activities requiring ‘non-tax-exempted’ diesel. This tax wedge therefore generates an opportunity for tax evasion, especially for firms with multiple economic activities, one of them being transport. In this paper, we analyse the impact of a tax enforcement programme implemented by the Chilean Internal Revenue Service (IRS), where letters requiring information about diesel purchases and use and vehicle ownership were sent to around 200 firms in 2003. Using different empirical strategies to consider the non-randomness of the selection of firms, the empirical results show consistently that firms receiving a letter decreased their diesel tax credits by around 10 per cent.

After presenting some basic sample characteristics, we investigate the scope and prevalence of hidden employment (both unreported employment and employment masked as contract with a subcontractor), its underlying social and economic factors and the main reasons behind accepting or turning down work offers in the hidden economy. Our results suggest that the selection of the particular form of tax sparing employment, i. e. the choice between accepting unreported employment (receiving unreported wage directly into one's own pocket) and employment masked as pretended subcontracting 2 ̆ 01 d is determined by the worker's socio-economic background to a great extent. Accepting unreported employment (unreported wage) is more prevalent amongst those {{on the periphery of the}} labor market, while pretended subcontracting 2 ̆ 01 d occurs more frequently amongst graduates and those working in public administration, health care, education and culture.

Although one would probably expect that members of families with low income engage in unreported transactions more frequently than the others, our results do not support this hypothesis. We also look at the reactions of respondents to hypothetical situations in which reliance on tax evasion and/or corruption seemingly offer a relatively easy and favorable solution. Answers to questions on such hypothetic situations can serve as a control to our results on actual behavior.
