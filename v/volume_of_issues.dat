50|$|Environmental Health embodies a {{wide range}} of topics with which there are many ethical issues. Many of these issues {{can be traced back to}} a moral {{obligation}} towards to life forms and other units of biological organization, like ecosystems, and the nature of that obligation. Humanity's place within any given ecosystem must be weighed against the importance of regional, and global health of the environment as a whole. Human and animal rights, property use, and other freedoms can be combined with other factors like to form an ethical dilemma social justice, equality, sustainability, and globalism to form ethical dilemmas. In response to difficulties with using moral theories to resolve ethical dilemmas various approaches can be used. A case-by-case approach may be too slow when considering the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>issues</b> at present, so an alternative may be better suited to the task. Taking into account commonly accepted moral virtues can guide conduct and address conflicts between values, rules, and obligations. Most, if not all, of these generally held principles can be found in the ethical approaches listed above, an example of which may be 'respect human rights'. This Principle-Based Method for ethical decision making can be viewed below.|$|E

It lasted for three years, starting from June 1 st  2004, and ending on May 31, 2007.

40|$|Abstract: This essay {{comments}} on Stuart Henry’s {{important contribution to}} our thinking about the administration of interdisciplinary programs. Though I quibble {{with a few of}} the arguments he makes in the last <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>Issues,</b> I focus my remarks on adding to Henry’s suggested strategies for defending interdisciplinarity. I conclude with brief observations on the question of academic appointments and on teaching and learning. Stuart Henry has performed a valuable service to the interdisciplinary mission by clearly articulating the dangers faced by interdisciplinary programs. He is entirely correct in suggesting that we not be lulled into complacency by the fact that our enrollments are increasing in both absolute and relative terms. Interdisciplinary programs are particularly vulnerable in times of budgetary stringency. While the attendance and comments at our roundtable at the national 2005 AIS/AGLS conference suggest that his concerns resonate widely, I likely have a more Pollyannish outlook on the future than Henry. I also quibble with a few elements of Henry’s argument. I {{think we have to be}} exceedingly careful with respect to arguments that interdisciplinar...|$|E

40|$|Because the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> {{currency}} <b>issued</b> by {{a country}} always affects its interest rate, price index, income levels, {{and many other}} important macroeconomic variables, the prediction <b>of</b> currency <b>volume</b> <b>issued</b> has attracted considerable attention in recent years. In contrast to the typical single-stage forecast model, this study proposes a hybrid forecasting approach to predict the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> currency <b>issued</b> in Taiwan. The proposed hybrid models consist of artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression (MR) components. The MR component of the hybrid models is established for a selection of fewer explanatory variables, wherein the selected variables are of higher importance. The ANN component is then designed to generate forecasts based on those important explanatory variables. Subsequently, the model is used to analyze a real dataset of Taiwan's currency from 1996 to 2011 and twenty associated explanatory variables. The prediction results reveal that the proposed hybrid scheme exhibits superior forecasting performance for predicting the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> currency <b>issued</b> in Taiwan...|$|R

Steady {{and stable}} share market {{is one of}} the factors that determines the {{investment}} climate in the country and encourages redistribution of investment capital in promising sectors of the economy. Thus, it is important to study correlation between share market and economy. The paper analyzed the interaction between the parameters of Ukrainian share market (the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> registered share <b>issues,</b> the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> trading shares on the stock market, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> trading shares on a formal stock market and the number <b>of</b> <b>issued</b> shares in Ukraine) and economic development (GDP).
