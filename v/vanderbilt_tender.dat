50|$|The {{colorful}} and dynamic heritage of railroading is showcased with artifacts including an oilcan, brake wheel, whistle marker, lantern, maps, postcards, and books. A folk art model of an engine and tender are almost miniature examples of an NC&St.L engine and <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tender</b> captured in a 1920s photograph in Dickson. This exhibit has been {{expanded to include}} a touch-screen panel of the Dickson rail-yard and downtown area. A hands-on display of a steam engine cabin, and a NC&St.L engine headlight are also showcased.|$|E
50|$|The new locomotive, AB 608, {{was to a}} {{completely}} different design from AB 409 when it emerged from the Addington Workshops in 1915. Although largely similar to the A class, it had a new design of cab and boiler, which was fitted with a superheater after trials conducted on AB 409. It also had the distinctive <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tender,</b> which would become {{a hallmark of the}} AB class during its working life. This locomotive was to become the first of 141 similar locomotives built by various builders in New Zealand and the United Kingdom for NZGR.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{rectangular}} <b>tenders,</b> cylindrical <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tenders</b> were stronger, lighter, {{and held}} more fuel {{in relation to}} surface area. Railroads who were noted for using <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tenders</b> include: ...|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Grand Trunk Western Railway {{purchased}} this 4-8-2 Mountain locomotive (#6039) from Baldwin in 1925. This locomotive burned coal, and had <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tenders</b> and {{an enclosed}} all-weather cab. Preserved at Steamtown National Historic Site.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, No. 1673 was relegated to yard {{work as a}} switcher, its <b>vanderbilt</b> <b>tender</b> {{replaced}} by a smaller squarebox tender, and even then it was seldom made use of as time went by and diesel locomotives began to supersede steam powered ones. It had a brief starring role in the 1955 film Oklahoma, {{for which it was}} fitted with a diamond stack and other turn of the century equipment and colors. By 1955, it was seeing little use, mostly sitting in serviceable storage until March 18 when the engine was used for a few days for a publicity photo shoot in Sahuarita, Arizona. Two days later, it was also the star of Southern Pacific's 75th anniversary in Tucson, Arizona, during which the locomotive pulled an excursion train from the Southern Pacific Depot to the Pacific Fruit Express yard all day long, after which the railroad presented the locomotive to the city.|$|E
50|$|The NZR JB class steam {{locomotives}} {{were all}} originally {{members of the}} NZR J class of 1939. Built by North British Locomotive Works, Scotland, they all initially burned coal and wore distinctive bullet-like streamlining. After World War II the railways suffered problematic coal shortages, especially in the North Island. Approval was gained to convert 12 of the J class locomotives into oil-burners, to burn heavy fuel oil which was available in plentiful quantities at the time. The conversion saw the installation of a two-nossle burner in the firebox, removal of the grate and ashpan which was replaced with a firepan lined with bricks, shortening of the superheater tubes in the boiler, removal of the spark arrester in the smokebox, removal of the brick arch, addition of the related controls and gauges for the oil burning equipment, and the tender modified to carry an oil bunker and associated steam piping. Similar to the K and KA Classes which were converted to oil burning at the same time, the JB Class utilized a separate, removable tank which sat in the former coal space. However, the full-width coal bunker of the J-type's <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tender</b> was cut down so that the oil tank was visible at the sides, with distinctive vertical supports below. The conversion process generally coincided with {{the removal of the}} streamlining, but not always. Once converted, the locomotives were re-classified JB in recognition of the conversion, however they retained their original J class numbers.|$|E
50|$|Throughout their NZR careers, the AB {{class were}} {{known for their}} <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tenders</b> - one of three classes to use this tender, the others being the re-built G class 4-6-2, and the later J/Ja/Jb class 4-8-2 engines. The tenders, {{although}} satisfactory, suffered from having been constructed too lightly for the intended task, and were also prone to rusting, particularly around the frame channels. This necessitated the complete replacement of the tender frames from some locomotives, although not all were treated so.|$|R
5000|$|The Sunbeam {{began in}} 1925 as a heavyweight train. In June 1926 it took 6 1/2 hours each way, leaving Houston at noon and Dallas at 1:25 p.m.; in August 1937 it {{scheduled}} fifteen regular and flag {{stops in the}} 6 1/2 hour run. The Sunbeam was re-equipped on September 19, 1937, as a streamlined train in the Daylight paint scheme. The T&NO streamlined three P-14 class 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives and painted them and their <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tenders</b> in Daylight colors.|$|R
5000|$|The final batch from NBL, numbers 3321 to 3370, had Type MX {{tank wagon}} type tenders with {{cylindrical}} water tanks, similar in appearance to the American <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tenders.</b> They were built {{to the design}} of Dr. M.M. Loubser, ran on three-axle Buckeye bogies and became commonly known as Torpedo tenders.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, the German builder Henschel & Son {{supplied}} ten [...] gauge 4-8-4 locomotives to the Ferrocarriles del Estado (State Railways or FdE) of Chile, {{designated the}} Tipo 100. They were called Super Montañas (Super Mountains), since {{they followed the}} Tipo 80 4-8-2 Mountain that was introduced six years earlier. They were equipped with mechanical stokers and <b>Vanderbilt</b> <b>tenders</b> and weighed 185 tonnes in working order. On test, they produced [...] at a coal consumption of [...] and a water consumption of 274 L per kilometre. The design was not repeated, however, and the FdE returned to the 4-8-2 wheel arrangement with its subsequent acquisitions. The Tipo 100 was used {{on the line from}} Almeda to Talca until it was replaced by diesels in 1969. One of them, no. 1009, is preserved in the Santiago Railway Museum.|$|R
50|$|One further 4-6-2 type was the G class. These {{were six}} three-cylinder Pacific {{locomotives}} that were rebuilt from three unsuccessful G class 4-6-2+2-6-4 Garratt locomotives by NZR’s Hillside Workshops in 1937. They were equipped with AB class boilers, new roller bearing trailing trucks, new cabs and <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tenders</b> of similar design {{to that of}} the AB class. Like the Garratts they were created from, the rebuilds were not considered successful.|$|R
50|$|The tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 8 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 4200 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle loading of 8 lt 18 lcwt 2 qtr kg. It was a tank wagon type tender with a cylindrical water tank, similar in appearance to the North American <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tender.</b> The SAR's Types MX, MY and MY1 tenders with their cylindrical water tanks all became commonly known as Torpedo tenders.|$|R
50|$|They {{were built}} with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers, while their double hopper type ashpans were {{specially}} designed {{to clear the}} four-wheeled trailing bogies. Their specially designed Type MY tenders were similar in appearance to the Type MX and the North American <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tenders,</b> with cylindrical water tanks. The tenders rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the axle load and, along with the Type MX, became commonly known as Torpedo tenders.|$|R
50|$|The Type MX tender had a coal {{capacity}} of 12 lt t, a water {{capacity of}} 6500 imp gal {{and a maximum}} axle loading of 12 lt 10 lcwt kg. It was a tank wagon type tender with a cylindrical water tank, similar in appearance to the North American <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tenders,</b> {{and was the first}} of its kind on the SAR. It rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the axle load and became commonly known as a Torpedo tender.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{tank wagon}} type tender, similar in {{appearance}} to the North American <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tender,</b> with a cylindrical water tank which had an inside diameter of 6 ft. The tender {{was similar to}} the Type MX tender, but its wheelbase was 10 ft shorter. Like the Type MX tender, it rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies, supplied by General Steel Castings of Eddystone, Pennsylvania, and became commonly known as a Torpedo tender. Like its engine, the tender was equipped with vacuum brakes.|$|R
50|$|Like the Class 24 and {{the last}} batch of the Class 19D, the Class S2 had a tank wagon type tender, similar in {{appearance}} to the American <b>Vanderbilt</b> type <b>tender,</b> with cylindrical water tanks and commonly known as a Torpedo tender. Its Type MY1 tender also rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the axle load, but was much shorter than the Type MX tender of the Class 19D and with a different coal bunker top design {{than that of the}} Type MY tender of the Class 24. As was done with the tenders of the Classes S and S1, the top sides of the coal bunker were scalloped out to improve the crew's rearward field of vision.|$|R
