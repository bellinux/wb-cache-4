Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.” Cases have also been reported in Scandinavia and Germany. Autoerotic asphyxiation may often be mistaken for suicide, which is a major cause of death in teenagers.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} analytical formulas derived {{for evaluating}} vapor transport of a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> for an isolated multicomponent droplet in a quiescent environment, based on quasi-steady-state approximation. Among multiple solvent components, only one component {{is considered to}} be much more volatile than the rest such that other components are assumed to be nonvolatile remaining unchanged in the droplet during the process of (single-component) <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> evaporation or condensation. For evaporating droplet, the droplet size often initially decreases following the familiar "d^ 2 law" at an accelerated rate. But toward the end, the rate of droplet size change diminishes due to the presence of nonvolatile cosolvent. Such an acceleration-deceleration reversal behavior is unique for evaporating multicomponent droplet, while the droplet of pure solvent has an accelerated rate of size change {{all the way through the}} end. This reversal behavior is also reflected in the droplet surface temperature evolution as "S-shaped" curves. However, a closer mathematical examination of conditions for acceleration-deceleration reversal indicates that the acceleration phase may disappear when the amount of nonvolatile cosolvent is relatively small and ambient vapor pressure is relatively high. Because the net effect of adding nonvolatile cosolvent is to reduce the mole fraction of the <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> such that the saturation vapor pressure is lowered, vapor condensation onto the multicomponent droplet is predicted to occur when the ambient vapor pressure is subsaturated with respect to that for the pure <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent.</b> In this case, the droplet will grow asymptotically toward a finite size. But when the ambient vapor pressure becomes supersaturated with respect to that for the pure <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent,</b> the condensation growth of droplet can continue indefinitely without bound.

40|$|The term {{organic coating}} {{encompasses}} conventional paints, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, water-emulsion and solution finishes, nonaqueous dispersions (organosols), plastisols and powder coatings. The following definitions {{have been used}} commonly, although they {{have not always been}} strictly applied. Paint is a suspension of finely divided pigment particles in a liquid composed of a binder (resin) and a <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent,</b> sometimes with additives to impart special characteristies. The <b>volatile</b> <b>solvent</b> evaporates from the diying fim after application, while the binder holds the pigment in the diy fim, causing it to adhere to the substrate. Some high quality, hard gloss paints are referred to as enamels (Piper, 1965; Schurr, 1981). Lacquer is defined as a coating that dries priariy by evaporation rather than by oxidation or polymerition. Because the solvents used in lacquers are relatively volatile and no chemical change is required for formation of the mm, lacquers diy veiy rapidly (Piper, 1965; Hamilton & Early, 1972).
