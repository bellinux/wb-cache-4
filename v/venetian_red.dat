5|$|Captain Louis Mountbatten's 5th Flotilla of K class destroyers {{were painted}} Mountbatten pink in 1940. Mountbatten {{observed}} a Union-Castle Liner disappear from convoy during an autumn sunset {{because of the}} company's unusual lavender-mauve-gray hull color. Mountbatten reasoned the color would be effective camouflage during dawn and dusk periods, and devised a similar shade by mixing medium gray {{with a small amount}} of <b>venetian</b> <b>red.</b> Its effectiveness was much disputed; but it was applied to other destroyers, a few cruisers, and numerous small warships which maintained the scheme through 1944 for use in coastal waters.|$|E

50|$|The vine ripens {{relatively}} quite late, producing good yields {{with high}} resistance to fungal disease and rot. The grape crossed with another Veneto wine grape, Marzemina bianca, to produce Raboso Veronese. It produces quite a large, tight, cylindrical bunch {{with one or}} two wings and a sturdy bunchstem. Its spheroid grape has a blue-black, very tough skin with good bloom. The flesh has a varietal, neutral flavour which is slightly meaty and sweet-acidulous-astringent.Each grape has two or three average-sized, pear-shaped seeds. This vigorous vine can produce an abundant yield. Optimal vinification requires appropriate maceration of juice and skins: this results in a full-bodied wine, acidic and tannic when young, ideal for laying down.Left to age in wooden barrels, it will gradually acquire a deep ruby colour with garnet tinges, a broad and full bouquet of wild violets with a concentrated note of morello cherry; the palate is dry, attractively astringent, and full-flavoured.At full maturity, Raboso Piave {{is one of the great}} <b>Venetian</b> <b>reds,</b> probably the best among the traditional wine of Eastern of Veneto. It is excellent with furred and feathered game, red meat, grilled meats and well-matured cheeses. It is also a superb sipping wine, an ideal accompaniment to long winter evenings in the company of friends.|$|R
25|$|For 2000 the R was {{available}} in 6 colours: Black Stone, Nautic Blue Pearl, Silver Metallic, <b>Venetian</b> <b>Red</b> Pearl, Dark Olive Green, Laser Blue. All apart from the first one were metallic paints with Laser Blue being only available on the R. A new 2.4L engine was introduced and power increased to 265PS by use of a larger turbo and VVT. The only available transmission was a newly introduced 5-speed adaptive automatic, rear brakes were upgraded to vented discs unique to the R. A dual outlet exhaust was fitted as standard with the rear bumper being modified to accommodate it. The interior could now be ordered in a two tone design which paired white alcantara and black leather for the seat covers.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} decor {{consisted of}} grey and terracotta walls, <b>Venetian</b> <b>red</b> seating, large red lampshades suspended {{just above the}} orchestra's heads, mirrors surrounding the arena, and portraits of the leading composers {{to the sides of}} the platform. The paintwork was intended to be the colour of [...] "the belly of a London mouse", and Knightley is said to have kept a string of dead mice in the paint shop in order to ensure the correct tone. The arena had moveable seating on a [...] "brownish carpet that blended with the dull fawnish colour of the walls". The arched ceiling had an elaborate painting of the Paris Opéra, by Carpegat, described by E. M. Forster, as [...] "the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen's Hall, inclining each to each with vapid gesture, and clad in sallow pantaloons".|$|E

50|$|Construction {{began with}} a plywood {{template}} and laying out the bottom side planks. Then, the stern and bow posts were temporarily attached. The center width of the boat was then blocked in. Binding ropes and stays were applied and tightened into the final shape of the boat. After this, each tongue and groove siding plank would carefully be selected at equal length and nailed in. The process of slackening, tightening the rope and adding siding planks was repeated until the boat was of proper size. Working {{from the center of}} the boat to the stern and bow, the cross frames and supporting ribs were installed. Finally, the V-bottom shape was precisely crafted to achieve a shallow draft. The end product was then treated with a preservative made from boiled (linseed?) oil and jewelers rouge, which gave them a <b>red</b> <b>Venetian</b> appearance.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{stretched out}} his arm, which swiftly elongated itself till the hand disappeared from view round the corner. In a moment the hand returned with the catalogue. The pair sped on to Messrs. Sotheby's auction-rooms in Wellington Street. Every one knows {{the appearance of a}} great book-sale. The long table, surrounded by eager bidders, resembles from a little distance a roulette table, and communicates the same sort of excitement. The amateur is at a loss to know how to conduct himself. If he bids in his own person some bookseller will outbid him, partly because the bookseller knows, after all, he knows little about books, and suspects that the amateur may, in this case, know more. Besides, professionals always dislike amateurs, and, in this game, they have a very great advantage. Blinton knew all this, and was in the habit of giving his commissions to a broker. But now he felt (and very naturally) as if a demon had entered into him. 'Tirante il Bianco Valorosissimo Cavaliere' was being competed for, an excessively rare romance of chivalry, in magnificent <b>red</b> <b>Venetian</b> morocco, from Canevari's library. The book is one of the rarest of the Venetian Press, and beautifully adorned with Canevari's device,--a simple and elegant affair in gold and colours. [...] "Apollo is driving his chariot across the green waves towards the rock, on which winged Pegasus is pawing the ground," [...] though why this action of a horse should be called [...] "pawing" [...] (the animal notoriously not possessing paws) it is hard to say. Round this graceful design is the inscription [Greek text] (straight not crooked). In his ordinary mood Blinton could only have admired 'Tirante il Bianco' from a distance. But now, the demon inspiring him, he rushed into the lists, and challenged the great Mr. -, the Napoleon of bookselling. The price had already reached five hundred pounds.|$|R
2500|$|Known for [...] "her elusive {{combination}} of childlike innocence and soigné charm" [...] and described as [...] "tall and slender, with <b>Venetian</b> <b>red</b> hair", Olga de Meyer was muse and model to many artists, among them Jacques-Émile Blanche, James McNeill Whistler, James Jebusa Shannon, Giovanni Boldini, Walter Sickert, John Singer Sargent, and Paul César Helleu. Another of her artist admirers was Charles Conder, who was infatuated by Olga Caracciolo and painted her portrait; Aubrey Beardsley {{was part of}} her youthful circle as well. Olga de Meyer also inspired characters in novels by Elinor Glyn and Ada Leverson.|$|E

60|$|The {{blood of}} her son fell upon the table-cloth, and this being hung {{out of the window}} to dry, the wall {{received}} a stain, which neither the sun nor rain of centuries sufficed to efface, and which was only removed with the masonry, when it became necessary to restore the wall under that window, a few months before the time of my visit to Ferrara. Accordingly, the blood-stain has now disappeared; but the conscientious artist who painted the new wall has faithfully restored the tragic spot, by bestowing upon the stucco a bloody dash of <b>Venetian</b> <b>red.</b>|$|E
