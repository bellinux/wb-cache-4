40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} learning and recognizing windows a basic structural elements of façades. We assume rectangular windows and our method is adapted to the segmentation of façades which are horizontaly and <b>verticaly</b> aligned. These limitations are not very restrictive since vast majority of façades have these properties for practical and eastetic reasons. The method begins with perspective rectification of the input image, which ensures that the edges of objects, parallel in space, remain parallel in the image plane. The rectified image is then segmented into hierarchical structure of window candidates. Four heuristic functions for estimating the quality of generated window candidates are presented. They are defined {{on the basis of}} position in the hierarchical structure, the distribution of horizontal and vertical edges, the similarities between candidates, and the learned window appearances. The generation of the final hypothesis uses a greedy approach, which favors homogeneous and aligned candidates. Experimental results are satisfactory but the method should be supplemented before the practical use. The main disadvantage of the method is ignorance of general background knowledge of façade structures. The proposed method can be used in the calculation of approximate solutions and {{as a starting point for}} methods, like stochastic grammar, which includes background knowledge on the structure of symmetrical and repeated patterns of façades. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to understand the}} spatial patterns and processes responsible for canopy and understorey spider (Arachnida: Araneae) diversity at multiple spatial scales in north-temperate hardwood forests. I sampled tree trunks (sticky traps) and foliage (beating) of sugar maple and American beech tree canopies and their understorey saplings in old growth forests near Montreal, Quebec. Results show the composition of canopy and understorey assemblages differed significantly, and so did sugar maple and American beech canopy assemblages. Each stratum was also dominated by different species. The rank-abundance distribution of species from each habitat wsa also <b>verticaly</b> stratified because it fit different distribution models. Different factors likely structure assemblages in both habitats, particularly since the canopy is a less stable environment. Spiders from canopy and understorey foliage were tested in a laboratory for their propensity to balloon. General linear models indicated that small sized web-building spiders of the RTA and Orbicularia clades have the highest propensity to balloon. Small bodied species initiated ballooning regardless of the habitat they were collected in or their developmental stage. My results support the mixed evolutionarily stable strategy theory and indicate the absence of risk-spreading in the dispersal strategy of canopy spiders. My last chapter focused on dispersal capacity and diversity patterns of spiders at multiple spatial scales. Analyses of the species diversity of limited and high dispersal capacity species subsets through nested-multivariate ANOVA, additive diversity partitioning, and species-abundance distribution curves all point towards species-sorting processes as the main driver of local community spider diversity at the tree and stand spatial scales. Mass-effects and patch-dynamic processes drive site and regional scale diversity patterns. This thesis demonstrates that spiders provide good models to test many biological hypotheses. The research chapters of this thesis test hypotheses on the vertical stratification of forest spider diversity, the evolution of local dispersal adaptations, and the importance of dispersal capacity on species diversity patterns through a metacommunity framework...|$|E
40|$|A cumulus {{ensemble}} model {{is used to}} study the tropical water and energy cycles and {{their role in the}} climate system. The model includes cloud dynamics, radiative processes, and microphysics that incorporate all important production and conversion processes among water vapor and five species of hydrometeors. Radiative transfer in clouds is parameterized based on cloud contents and size distributions of each bulk hydrometeor. Several model integrations have been carried out under a variety of imposed boundary and large-scale conditions. In Part 1 of this paper, the primary focus is on the water and heat budgets of the control experiment, which is designed to simulate the convective - radiative equilibrium response of the model to an imposed vertical velocity and a fixed sea surface temperature at 28 C. The simulated atmosphere is conditionally unstable below the freezing level and close to neutral above the freezing level. The equilibrium water budget shows that the total moisture source, M(sub s), which is contributed by surface evaporation (0. 24 M(sub s)) and the large-scale advection (0. 76 M(sub s)), all converts to mean surface precipitation bar-P(sub s). Most of M(sub s) is transported <b>verticaly</b> in convective regions where much of the condensate is generated and falls to surface (0. 68 bar-P(sub s)). The remaining condensate detrains at a rate of 0. 48 bar-P(sub s) and constitutes 65 % of the source for stratiform clouds above the melting level. The upper-level stratiform cloud dissipates into clear environment at a rate of 0. 14 bar-P(sub s), which is a significant moisture source comparable to the detrained water vapor (0. 15 bar-P(sub s)) to the upper troposphere from convective clouds. In the lower troposphere, stratiform clouds evaporate at a rate of 0. 41 bar-P(sub s), which is a more dominant moisture source than surface evaporation (0. 22 bar-P(sub s)). The precipitation falling to the surface in the stratiform region is about 0. 32 bar-P(sub s). The associated latent heating in the water cycle is the dominant source in the heat budget that generates a net upward motion in convective regions, upper stratiform regions (above the freezing level), and a downward motion in the lower stratiform regions. The budgets reveal a cycle of water and energy resulted from radiation-dynamic-convection interactions that maintain equilibrium of the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The Coptic {{cemetery}} in Manshiyet Nasser, {{is the final}} result of a process that includes mapping, "transcription" of these diagrams and design according to certain principles defined during the process. The site for the mapping was Manshiyet Nasser /Garbage city, where the garbage collectors of Cairo are settled. The reason behind the choice, is that this place offers an opportunity to study how the garbage occupies public space in different configurations {{and what kind of}} space is created between the elements that are part of. The final product of mapping is a series of diagrams that depict a deformed grid. The degree of deformation varies, according to the voids created between the elements on the picture /the front view of stacks. The quality on which the interest is focused, are the dense and sparse areas that are created by deformation. The sucession of dense and sparse areas is becoming the main principle of the design. Other key words of the design are :altered landscape and bridging of different levels. The last ones were influential so as the cliff to be the site of intervention. The program is related to the notions of : layered structure, repetition of units, connections-disconnections. At the same time, the cemetery as proposal, might be a solution for the current problematic situation; the Coptics that live in the Garbage City have to travel even for 55 km for visiting the cemeteries. The final design concerns a structure that creates a new border between the cliff and the public space. It may be described as a building-landscape (or landscape building?) for the reason that there is no interior or exterior in the common sense -which is the case for a building, however is formed by elements that are common in buildings such as slabs and walls. The structure consists of precast concrete elements. The graves are developed <b>verticaly,</b> in combination with plants on top of each volume. The solid parts of the structure -that are the graves, are filled with soil, which is also a necessary condition according to the Coptics' tradition, but also plays a role in the decomposition process.

40|$|U članku je obradeno starohrvatsko groblje na položaju Svećurje u Kaštel Starom, na prostoru srednjovjekovnoga sela Radun. Na osnovi analize nakita u grobovima te utvrdenih elemenata pogrebnih obreda poganskoga karaktera, groblje je datirano na sam početak 9. st. i komparirano s istodobnim grobljima u neposrednoj okolici. Located at Svećurje in Kaštel Stari, between Split and Trogir, a smallish Old Croatian {{graveyard}} with interred bodies {{was discovered}} {{at the end}} of 2001. The graves were found during the building works for a family house. Timely intervention stopped the digging of the foundations and the graveyard was completely investigated in two campaigns in 2002. The investigations were conducted by the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments and the dig was led by the author of these lines. The investigated site is situated {{in the area of the}} medieval village of Radun whose name is preserved in the wider area around the graveyard, and nearby there is the very well preserved pre-Romanesque church of St George, surrounded by a later medieval graveyard. The graveyard which is analysed here belongs to the group of smaller graveyards which were set out in rows and we can approximately date it to the early Middle Ages, that it the Old Croatian era in the material culture of the Middle Ages (71 h to 11 Ih century). The basis for this dating is found in the graves, in the method of construction of the stone coffins, number of burials in an individual grave and certain elements of funeral ritual found in most of the graves. All these elements together offer the possibility of a narrower, more precise dating to the beginning of the 92 ̆ 7 h century and in doing this we have to point to other graveyards discovered in Kašteli whose chronological and historical backgrounds enable the comparison of the Radun graveyard with them and its more precise chronological determination. General arguments for such a dating are the orientation and number of bUlials in individual graves and the construction of the coffins made from stone slabs, and the arguments which more precisely confirm the dating are the finds of jewellery in the graves and especially preserved traces of burial rituals which witness the tradition of pagan burial rites which was then still alive. All the discovered graves contained stone coffins, constructed of relatively thin stone slabs placed <b>verticaly</b> along the sides of the hole and covered with one or more of the same slabs. This way of constructing a grave was most common in the early Middle Ages (excluding the so-called pagan era), and also throughout the entire Middle Ages in all Croatian areas south of the river Sava and this has already been well covered in our literature of the Middle Ages. V Sokol has very recently contributed an overview of the different opinions, but the detailed analysis of this question goes beyond the scope of one article. Graves whose bottoms are covered by thin stone slabs are not rare in old Croatian graveyards, and this is especially common in graveyards situated on the territory of the Old Croatian Klis county and are also confirmed by the recent digs in the area around Sinj. The shapes of the graves are also common. Rectangular coffins dominate (9 graves), and four graves contain coffins in a trapezoid shape. This once more confirms the thesis which was put forward in his time by D Jelovina, claiming that the shape of the grave does not correlate to the time of the burial, i. e. that different shapes appear at the same time throughout the Middle Ages, and not successivelyane after the other as the older archaeologists Lj Karaman and S Gunjača had tried to prove. J Belošević came to the same conclusion in his research, as have I after systematic research into the parish graveyard of medieval Sućurac on the site at St George of Putalj. The older opinion is again supported by V Sokol but the results of the latest digs including this one at Svećurje in Radun completely disprove it. At the Svećurje graveyard in Radun (Diagram I, II and III) individual burials dominate, as registered in 9 of 13 graves (G-l, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12 and 13). In G- 6 a double burial was found, and in G- 7 it is more likely that we have a situation of two burials at different times, while for G-lO and G-ll nothing can be said because in the former there was no skeleton and the latter contained the remains of three skeletons, one of which is in situ. Both these graves lie next to each other and are situated in the part of the site where the earth is most shallaw. Both graves are missing their lids, so this was most likely a case of previous damage caused by clearing the terrain for planting vines. In short, and based on the example of this small graveyard, the results gained from the analysis of the graveyard at Putalj were confilmed, according to which graves with one burial are dominant until the 132 ̆ 7 h century and not until the second half of the 132 ̆ 7 h and further throughout the 142 ̆ 7 h and 15,h centuries and the early modem era did family tombs with multiple burials become predominant. The orientation of the burial is also common for the early Middle Ages (E-W), all the bodies are placed in the grave with their head to the west and arms placed alongside the body. The Radun graveyard is generally very poor in finds. Of the 13 graves only two contained anything and that was one earring in each. In G- 3 a small bronze hoop, and in G- 12 adamaged single-bead earring with a smooth rounded be ad (Pic. 2). In both cases these were child 2 ̆ 7 s graves. The finds of these earrings in themselves only approximately determine the dating of the burials in this graveyard which, due to the small number of graves, should be placed within a short time frame. Therefore, to determine the date of the burials in this graveyard more precisely, other elements should be taken into consideration which were luckily given to us by the investigations, and which are crucial not only for the dating of the graveyard as a whole but also for the more precise dating of the jewellery in the discovered graves. In question are the remains of burial rites with clearly pagan characteristics which have been confirmed in four graves. In the small child 2 ̆ 7 s G- 9 grave, small pieces of cinders were found directly above the tiny remains of the newbom 2 ̆ 7 s skeleton. Since the grave was not damaged because the lid slabs were in place, there is no doubt that the cinders were thrown onto the body immediately after its placement in the grave. ln the remaining three cases, remains of ritual fire were found next to the lids of the graves (G- 4, 5 and 6), in all of these cases located on the north or the north-west side. The fact that all these four examples were found at the western end of the graveyard cannot have some chronological meaning in the graveyard as a whole due to the small number of graves, but surely has a crucial role in its general dating. It is especially important to emphasise that amongst the remains of the charcoal from the bumt wood and the stone circle of these fire places, small pieces of rough ceramics were also found. Unfortunately two of the three fire places (vzand 3) 2 ̆ 7 next to G- 4 and 5, were significantly damaged by the digging of the foundations but they also contain a few pieces of ceramics. The best preserved fireplace (VI) was situated next to the lids of G- 6 on the north side. In the relatively thick layer of cinders around the small stone circle, quite a large number of pieces of rough ceramics, mostly unfired and with grains of calcites have been found. Due to this characteristic, the already tiny fragments bumt in the fire, fell apart as soon as they were touched. This is obviously a case of vessels made for one use and therefore not fired. They were used during the burial rites on the grave at the time of the funeral so I would therefore explain these fireplaces as remains of the burial feasts (daća) in honour of the deceased. This continuing survival of pagan burial rites will have a very important role in the dating of the graves in this graveyard. The "pagan horizon" of the Old Croatian era dates from the mid- 7 th to the mid- 9 th century. The main characteristics of the graves of this era are accessories in the graves, mainly pots for food and drink in accordance with the rites and beliefs of the Slavonic polytheistic religion. With the increasing influence of Christianity they slowly disappeared from the second half of the 8 th century on, but still appear sporadically during the first half of the 9 tb century. After this transitional phase, we usually find jewellery, mostly earrings and rings, from the mid 9 "h to the beginning of the 12 th century in the graves of the Christianised phase of the Old Croatian era. The occurrence of fireplaces as part of the pagan rites during burial is very rare in the Croatian graveyards of the pagan horizon. It has been confirmed for certain only in the graveyard at Materize near Nin where the dead were buried in earth mounds, and recently the remains of fire have been registered in early medieval graveyards in Glavice near Sinj (locations Jojine Kuće and Gluvine Kuće) where holes with the remains of fire were discovered but it seems that this was not a case of fireplaces by the grave. Therefore the only certain parallel for fireplaces can be found next to three graves at Materize near Nin where a graveyard dated approximately to the 8 "h century has been found. The presented analogies of the pagan rites offer a lower chronological limit for the graveyard at Svećurje in Radun. This nevertheless needs to be moved to the very beginning of the 9 "h century because of the appearance of the jewellery in the Radun graves. Since ordinary hoop s are not suitable for precise chronological placements, we are left with the find of the single-bead earring from G- 12. An almost identical and equally damaged example has been found in the still uninvestigated graveyard in nearby Kaštel Kambelovac in the area of medieval Lažani approximately dated to the 9 "h century, and one whole earring at the location of the Old Croatian graveyard at Putalj in Kaštel Sućurac (analogies form the wider area are not brought in here, because the analysis is based on the research of the graveyard as a whole, and not individuals types of finds). And while the earring from Lažani remains, due to the fact that the location is still uninvestigated, insufficiently safe for a close chronological parallel, although it is typologically exactly the same, the one from Putalj is very important because of the narrowly determined chronological coordinates. The Putalj graves of the Old Croatian era have been dated, due to archaeological and histOllcal arguments, to directly before the rule of Duke Mislav (cca. 835 - 45), i. e. to the first two decades of the 9 th century. Here remains of pagan rites were been found, because a pot was been placed next to one grave near the legs. Therefore I also view the graves at Svećurje in Radun within the framework of those factors which have been confirmed at Putalj, where we find mixed together elements of the pagan horizon with those which will mark the Christianised horizon of the Old Croatian graveyards from the middle of the 9 "h century to the II"b century, in which exactly this type of single-bead earring is one of the most common types of jewellery found inside the graves. And so the Radun graveyard once more confirms the transitional character of Old Croatian graveyards from the first half of the 9 "h century in the initial phase of more intense Christianisation. Whether the somewhat stronger remnants of pagan rites in the graveyard at Svećurje in Radun also have an ipsignificant chronological distinction is not possible to determine at this stage of the research, but the first two decades of the 9 "h century are in any case a border across which it is not advisable to go back in time, i. e. before 800, so I would therefore date the graveyard analysed here to between 800 and 830, with a note that the time frame of the burials in it will probably be somewhat shorter due to the small number of graves. After the strengthening of the ducal power of the Croatian Trpimirović dynasty during the times of Mislav and Trpomir, approximately from the mid 9 th century, the pagan survival started disappearing rapidly from graves and jewellery became the predominant category of the finds. In this context I just want to mention once more the dating of the type of old Croatian single-bead earring with smooth unomamented be ad analysed here. The older authors dated this type of single-bead earring to the very beginning of the 9 "h century, and this was accepted by a pOltion of younger researchers. But in recent decades there has been a tendency to move the dating of this type, and of single-bead earrings generally, to the mid 9 th century. Considering again all the arguments I think that these two opinions are not absolutely irreconcilable. Namely, the earring from Putalj and the one from G- 12 in the Radun graveyard, taking into consideration the well-established chronological frameworks of the burials on them, confirms the opinion that this type was already appearing at the beginning of the 91 h century but the rarity of such finds in that era shows that most examples of this type belong to the middle and second half of the 91 h as well as the IOIh century. l bave already pointed out the appearance of biconic beads in rudimentary shapes from the middle and second half of the 81 h century during the analysis of the Putalj example, which then justifies the first appearance of single-bead earrings with a smooth be ad as early as at the beginning of the 91 h century. In the analysis of the Radun graveyard, another rare element has to be emphasised which provides us with valuable data on the shapes of graves and the burial mound and which has been determined with four graves. Above the coffins, but outside the area they take up, largish or middle-sized amorphous blocks of stone were found at a height of 30 - 50 cm above the level of the lid. In three cases (G-S, 11 and 12) these were placed at the west end of the grave, and in one case (G-l) at the south-west end, but above the head of the deceased in all cases. According to the circumstances determined in stratigraphic layers at the site I believe that these stones, particularly because of their position in relation to the graves, have to be explained as grave markers in the above-ground part of the grave, i. e. outside the earth which created the burial mound. l also leave open the possibility that these markers were more numerous in this graveyard but have been dislocated during the above mentioned clearing of the terrain when a number of the coffins were also damaged. In any case, if this interpretation is correct, it would represent a valuable find of grave marking from the early Middle Ages, about which we have only hypothetically spoken so far. The very area of the graveyard is completely defined. The site is situated in a narrow terrace, separated from other terrace s by a high drystone underwall. The western border is defined by the digging for the foundations of the house in which they were no more graves towards the west and the eastern border has been defined by a path discovered on the eastern side and placed perpendicularly to the direction of the graves (Pic. 1). On this path and around it there have been found rare fragments from Late Antiquity and rough early medieval ceramics. Translation: Nicholas Philip Saywel...|$|E
