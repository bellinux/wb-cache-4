50|$|Sending faxes over VoIP {{networks}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as Fax over IP (FoIP). Transmission of fax documents was problematic in early VoIP implementations, as most <b>voice</b> <b>digitization</b> and compression codecs are optimized for the representation of the human voice and the proper timing of the modem signals cannot be guaranteed in a packet-based, connection-less network. A standards-based solution for reliably delivering fax-over-IP is the T.38 protocol.|$|E
5000|$|Among the {{key players}} in this area, Lucent played a big role and IBM {{acquired}} ROLM Inc, a US pioneer in ACDs, {{in an attempt to}} normalize all major PBX vendor interfaces with its CallPath middleware. This attempt failed when it sold this company to Siemens AG and gradually divested in the area. A pioneer startup that combined the technologies of <b>voice</b> <b>digitization,</b> Token Ring networking, and time-division multiplexing was ZTEL of Wilmington, Massachusetts. ZTEL's computer-based voice and data network combined user-programmable voice call processing features, protocol conversion for automated [...] "data call processing," [...] database-driven directory and telset definitions, and custom LSI chipset technology. ZTEL ceased operation in 1986.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>voice</b> <b>digitization</b> technique {{which has been}} selected for the Space Shuttle program. The selected approach is compatible with a time-division multiplexing scheme which combines one or two digital voice channels with commands prior to transmission over an RF uplink or with telemetry prior to transmission over an RF downlink...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores {{practical}} applications of VoIP technology at home, {{in combination with}} the opensource private branch exchange Asterisk. A substantial part of this work is the documentation of the functioning of the main parts of public switched telephone networks (PSTN) and VoIP networks. Also described are the principles of <b>voice</b> <b>digitization,</b> commonly used codecs and several VoIP protocols. The last part of the thesis focuses on the design, practical realization and verification of two home VoIP installations...|$|E
