40|$|A multi-microprocessor based {{distributed}} control system manages spatially variable water and chemical application. The microprocessors are networked together using 3120 processors and PLT- 20 transceivers in a master slave configuration. The control units consist of an 8051 I/O processor and a 3120 communications processor that communicate over a half mile 480 <b>VAC</b> three phase <b>power</b> cable. The power line communications used single phase to ground coupling. The control system was tested from May through July 1996 on a mile center pivot irrigation system in Southern Idaho. A power system transient simulation helps to explain field observations. I. BACKGROUND In 1994 (1) work started in earnest on developing methods to improve productivity and efficiency of food production using techniques which can be generally classified as &quot;precision agriculture&quot;. Among others, Agricultural Engineer, Dr. Bradley King of the University of Idaho Aberdeen R&E center investigated methods to control the 150 plus sprinkler valves along a mile long center pivot agricultural irrigation system. Attempts to implements network control using RS 485 proved unreliable. In 1995, Dr. King successfully implemented a center pivot control scheme based on X- 10 power line communications (PLC). He used commercially available receivers to operate the valves. Dr. King’s experiences with the X- 10 system and technical reports from other researches in the precision farming arena convinced him that the PLC would be superior to other means of communications. The X- 10 system had significant disadvantages: a separate 117 VAC line had to be run along the pivot to operate the X- 10 equipment and communications was only one-way with no error detection or correction...|$|R

The system chosen for this study was a three-phase, 4160 <b>VAC,</b> 80 MW <b>power</b> system with a 450 VAC bus to supply traditional ship service loads. Sensitive loads, such as combat systems equipment, are isolated from the harmonic content of the 450 volt bus via solid state inverters. Power generation for this system included two 30 MW and two 10 MW generators. The sizing of these generators was based on operating configurations that would result in the best fuel efficiency under the most common loading conditions. Model components were simulated and compared to data recorded for the U. S. Navy's Full Scale Advanced Development (FSAD) test system for the IPS at the Philadelphia Land Based Engineering Site (LBES). The propulsion motor used in the simulations was developed based on the advanced induction motor installed at LBES. (cont.)

40|$|Radiation {{monitoring}} {{in nuclear}} facilities {{is essential to}} safe operation of the equipment as well as protecting personnel. In specific, typical air monitoring of radioactive gases or particulate involves complex systems of valves, pumps, piping and electronics. The challenge is to measure a representative sample {{in areas that are}} radioactively contaminated. Running cables and piping to these locations is very expensive due to the containment requirements. Penetration into and out of an airborne or containment area is complex and costly. The process rooms are built with thick rebar-enforced concrete walls with glove box containment chambers inside. Figure 1 shows high temperature radiation resistance cabling entering the top of a typical glove box. In some case, the entire processing area must be contained in a 'hot cell' where the only access into the chamber is via manipulators. An example is shown in Figure 2. A short range wireless network provides an ideal communication link for transmitting the data from the radiation sensor to a 'clean area', or area absent of any radiation fields or radioactive contamination. Radiation monitoring systems that protect personnel and equipment must meet stringent codes and standards due to the consequences of failure. At first glance a wired system would seem more desirable. Concerns with wireless communication include latency, jamming, spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and hacking. The Department of Energy's Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has developed a prototype wireless radiation air monitoring system that address many of the concerns with wireless and allows quick deployment in radiation and contamination areas. It is stand alone and only requires a standard 120 <b>VAC,</b> 60 Hz <b>power</b> source. It is designed to be mounted or portable. The wireless link uses a National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B compliant wireless network from Fortress Technologies that is considered robust enough to be used for classified data transmission in place of NSA Type 1 devices...|$|R

40|$|A Marine Icing Monitoring System (MIMS) {{has been}} {{developed}} and deployed on a Marine Atlantic ferry and two offshore supply vessels. The MIMS is a visual based technology for monitoring marine icing accumulation on offshore rigs and vessels where icing poses operational and safety hazards. The system consists of a CPU connected to two high-resolution digital cameras that are positioned to view expansive areas, or smaller areas depending on requirements, where icing could occur when environmental conditions are within certain parameters. The system is stand-alone, requiring no maintenance and needing only a standard 110 <b>VAC</b> <b>power</b> source. All components of the system are weatherproofed so that installation can be anywhere on the deck or superstructure of a facility. The computer controls each camera so that pictures are taken at regular intervals (every 12 minutes) and stored on the computer 2 ̆ 019 s large-capacity hard drive. Data are retrieved from the hard drive {{at the end of}} the icing season each year. The system has a satellite phone so that it can be checked and controlled from IOT.

40|$|Abstract—Over the years, the {{petroleum}} and chemical industry has found increasing favor with 60 -Hz low-voltage (600 <b>Vac)</b> <b>power</b> systems that utilize a high-resistance grounded (HRG) neutral philosophy. Historically, {{the older generation}} of ad-justable-speed drives (ASDs) {{had little or no}} effect on the normal operation of ground-fault indicators (GFIs) used with the installed HRG systems. This paper focuses its investigation into nuisance GFI alarms that may occur when present-generation ASDs are retrofitted into the existing plant. The paper first reviews possible neutral grounding systems, with emphasis on the types of HRG systems possible and GFI alarm philosophy. The paper then dis-cusses how ASDs may generate zero-sequence high-frequency noise currents in the HRG neutral circuit, which may cause nuisance ground-fault alarms and potentially mask a legitimate ground fault. GFI noise current magnitude is defined for both present and older ASD technologies (e. g., insulated gate bipolar transistor versus bipolar junction transistor drives). The effect this transient zero-sequence noise current magnitude has on GFI operation is described. Mitigation methods used at the drive to reduce ASD noise current magnitude to acceptable nonalarm levels is investigated. Filter solutions located at the HRG/GFI meter that reduce nuisance alarms are also investigated. The pros and cons of at the drive or at the meter filter solutions are supported with laboratory and field test data. Application guidelines are given to help avoid nuisance problems with a plant ground-fault protection scheme, which needs to successfully operate in the presence of multiple ASDs. Index Terms—Adjustable-speed drives, common-mode noise, electromagnetic interference filters, ground-fault indicators, high-resistance neutral ground, pulsewidth modulation, zero-sequence current.
