30|$|DALP-TS {{utilizes}} two counters (both initialized to zero) in {{the neighborhood}} selection process: non-improving move count and minor improving move count. DALP-TS increments the non-improving move count <b>value</b> <b>after</b> selecting a non-improving move and resets the <b>value</b> to zero <b>after</b> selecting either type of improving move. Likewise, DALP-TS increments the minor improving move count <b>value</b> <b>after</b> selecting a minor improving move and resets the <b>value</b> to zero <b>after</b> selecting a major improving move; however, after selecting a non-improving move, the minor improving move count does not change. This logic prevents DALP-TS from indefinitely cycling between non-improving and minor improving moves. DALP-TS halts when either of these counters reach a predetermined cessation value (maximum value).|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the broiler´s Ross 308 breast and thigh muscles pH <b>value</b> <b>after</b> addition probiotic, bee pollen and propolis as supplemental diet. A total of 180 chicks in one day old, which were divided into 6 groups (30) : control group T 1 (2 g probiotic), T 2 (4 g probiotic), T 3 (500 mg. kg- 1 natural bee pollen), T 4 (500 mg. kg- 1 propolis extract) and T 5 (600 mg. kg- 1 propolis extract). At {{the end of the}} experimental period (42 days) the broiler has been slaughtered to determinate the pH value by using pH meter equipped with an electrode calibrated (Grif 209 L apparatus). The results show that the pH <b>value</b> <b>after</b> 45 minutes was lower in the experimental groups compared to control group and there were found significant differences (P≤ 0. 05) between the control group with experimental groups, similarly the pH <b>value</b> <b>after</b> 2 hours in breast muscles was higher in the control group compared to experimental groups, but in the thigh the experimental groups (T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 5) were higher than control group except (T 4) group. Otherwise, the pH <b>value</b> <b>after</b> 24 hours was higher in the experimental groups compared to the control except (T 4, T 5) in the thigh.
