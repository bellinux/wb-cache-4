5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, <b>vitrified</b> brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with <b>vitrified</b> mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many <b>vitrified</b> crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|E

40|$|Carnation tissue {{was allowed}} to <b>vitrify</b> in liquid culture and {{ethylene}} production, ACC content and capacity to convert ACC to ethylene were measured in comparison to tissue developing normally on solid medium. Flask atmospheres of liquid cultures accumulated ethylene {{at a higher rate}} during the first four days. Daily ethylene production by <b>vitrifying</b> material decreased later. Ethylene emission by <b>vitrifying</b> tissues always remained above controls when subcultured daily to fresh medium. Explants and microsomal preparations from <b>vitrifying</b> carnations converted ACC to ethylene at a higher degree from the first day in liquid medium. ACC level markedly increased in <b>vitrifying</b> tissues during the first two days of liquid culture. Raising the level of ethylene in the atmosphere of solid cultures did not induce vitrification symptoms nor did use of inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis in liquid cultures prevent the process. The role of ethylene in vitrification is reappraised. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff/Dr W. Junk Publishers. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed {{ceramics}} existed beforehand, {{the author}} and historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of <b>vitrified,</b> translucent ceramics that {{could be classified as}} true porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907).

5|$|They were {{introduced}} into Scotland during the Bronze Age from around 1000 BCE. The largest group {{are from the}} Iron Age, with over 1,000 hillforts, mostly below the Clyde-Forth line, {{most of which were}} abandoned during the period of Roman occupation of Britain. There are also large numbers of <b>vitrified</b> forts, which have been subjected to fire, many of which may date to this period.

5|$|There {{are also}} {{numerous}} <b>vitrified</b> forts, {{the walls of}} which have been subjected to fire, which may date to this period, but an accurate chronology has proven to be evasive. When first noted in the nineteenth century it was assumed that vitrification had been deliberately undertaken as part of the building process to harden walls, but this hypothesis was rejected by V. Gordon Childe in the 1940s and subsequent excavations have indicated that, since the debris from such walls fell on the deposits of occupation it could not {{have been part of the}} building process. Reconstructions have indicated the difficulty of deliberately firing timbers in this way, particularly in the prevailing climatic conditions in Scotland, and it is more likely that this was done as part of a process of fort destruction, either after conquest or when abandoned by the inhabitants. Extensive studies of such a fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries BCE, or the mid-first millennium CE. Excavations at Dunnideer, Aberdeenshire indicate a date for its destruction in the period 500–250 BCE.|$|E

40|$|Vitrification of shoots of Prunus avium L. L. was induced and {{expressed}} in a four week in vitro multiplication cycle simply by replacing agar by gelrite. The first vitrification symptoms were visible from the 7 th day on. Enzymatic antioxidants were compared weekly in crude extract of normal (on agar) and <b>vitrifying</b> (on gelrite) shoots. The activity of superoxide dismutase was higher in <b>vitrifying</b> shoots. The other enzymes (gaîacol-peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, mono- and dehydro-ascorbate reductases, glutathione reductase) had lower activities. Increased superoxide dismutase activity might mean hydrogen peroxide accumulation and decreased activities of the other enzymes, deficiency in its detoxification. The question therefore is raised whether the hyperhydric morphological abnormalities result from the accumulation of toxic oxygen forms. Vitrification is often considered as a morphological response to several stresses. Contrary to most plants which adapt themselves to stresses by increasing all the above defence enzymes, in vitro shoots under <b>vitrifying</b> conditions appear unable to react in a similar manner. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.
