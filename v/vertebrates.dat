5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed <b>vertebrates.</b> Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed <b>vertebrates.</b> However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless <b>vertebrates,</b> such as the lamprey and hagfish. These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed <b>vertebrates,</b> are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5|$|Insects are prey for {{a variety}} of organisms, {{including}} terrestrial <b>vertebrates.</b> The earliest <b>vertebrates</b> on land existed 400 million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores. Through gradual evolutionary change, insectivory was the next diet type to evolve.|$|E

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the <b>Vertebrate</b> Pest Council, welcome to the 12 th <b>Vertebrate</b> Pest Conference. Every other year since 1962, the <b>Vertebrate</b> Pest Council has {{sponsored}} the conference with the primary objective of bringing individuals interested in <b>vertebrate</b> pest control together to discuss problems and solutions of mutual concern. The main objectives of the conference are: 1. To exchange information on <b>vertebrate</b> pest management and related matters. 2. To advance environmentally safe <b>vertebrate</b> pest management methodologies. 3. To build cooperation with public and private agencies in solving <b>vertebrate</b> pest problems. 4. To consider and promote discussion and interaction among agencies and others about problems of mutual concern {{in the field of}} <b>vertebrate</b> pest management. 5. To foster educational work in <b>vertebrate</b> pest management. 6. To encourage research by both public and private agencies on <b>vertebrate</b> pest problems and their solutions. 7. To promote uniformity and coordination of activities among agencies and individuals concerned with the regulatory aspects of <b>vertebrate</b> pest management...|$|R

5000|$|There was a {{persistent}} debate during {{the twentieth century}} as to whether the <b>vertebrate</b> head is “old” or “new”. Scientists who champion the idea of an “old” head suggest that the <b>vertebrate</b> head resulted from the evolution of important modifications to a previously existing head. The idea of a [...] "new" [...] <b>vertebrate</b> head was proposed originally by American <b>vertebrate</b> morphologists Carl Gans and Glenn Northcutt in 1983. They suggested that the <b>vertebrate</b> head is a new structure, which has no corresponding structure in close relatives such as Branchiostoma.|$|R
5|$|A. atacis {{is one of}} few <b>vertebrates</b> {{known from}} the Gres de Labarre Formation. The only other fossils from the {{formation}} belong to Rhabdodon priscus and a Nodosauridae indet.|$|E
5|$|All <b>vertebrates</b> have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the {{embryonic}} stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most <b>vertebrates</b> the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few <b>vertebrates,</b> such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed <b>vertebrates</b> are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of <b>vertebrates</b> are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this <b>Vertebrate</b> Pest Control Conference are several. They are to: 1. 	Get acquainted with other persons {{in the field of}} <b>vertebrate</b> pest control; 2. 	Learn the best and safest methods of <b>vertebrate</b> pest control; 3. 	Hear {{what is going on in}} the various fields of research; 4. Stimulate new research; 5. 	Improve {{communications}} between research workers and between research workers, pest control operators and industry developers of materials used in the field of <b>vertebrate</b> pest control; 6. 	Inform the public about the true role of <b>vertebrate</b> pest control and why it is sometimes necessary, and 7. 	Attempt to eliminate misunderstandings between those of us who are engaged in <b>vertebrate</b> pest control and the general public...|$|R

5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other <b>vertebrates,</b> but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian <b>vertebrates,</b> the surface of the cerebrum is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{elaboration}} of the cerebral cortex {{carries with it}} changes to other brain areas. The superior colliculus, which {{plays a major role}} in visual control of behavior in most <b>vertebrates,</b> shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the neocerebellum) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of TBR1 {{has been studied}} in amphioxi, also known as lancelets. A T-box-containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri and found to possess a T-domain orthologous {{to that of the}} T-Brain subfamily of T-box genes, specifically TBR1. However, lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the neural tissue of the lancelet. This suggests that the neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in <b>vertebrates</b> after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of <b>vertebrates.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} feeds mainly on large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small <b>vertebrates</b> are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. <b>Vertebrates</b> are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{plant is}} known to {{occasionally}} trap <b>vertebrates</b> and even small mammals, with drowned rats having been observed in the pitcher-shaped traps. It {{is one of only}} two Nepenthes species documented as having caught mammalian prey in the wild, the other being N. rafflesiana. N. rajah is also known to occasionally trap small <b>vertebrates</b> such as frogs, lizards and even birds, although these cases probably involve sick animals and certainly do not represent the norm. Insects, and particularly ants, comprise the staple prey in both aerial and terrestrial pitchers.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the heart}} varies among the {{different}} animal groups, with hearts in <b>vertebrates</b> ranging {{from those of the}} smallest mice (12mg) to the blue whale (600kg).

5|$|All <b>vertebrates</b> have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows {{metabolism}} inside {{the brain to}} operate differently from metabolism {{in other parts of}} the body. Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Although MUS81 is a {{component}} of a minor crossover pathway in the meiosis of budding yeast, plants and <b>vertebrates,</b> in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, MUS81 appears {{to be part of}} an essential, if not the predominant crossover pathway. The MUS81 pathway also appears to be the predominant crossover pathway in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.|$|E
5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in <b>vertebrates</b> such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be {{converted}} to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, <b>vertebrates</b> need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to oxaloacetate, {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E
5|$|Among <b>vertebrates,</b> the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large and {{threatening}} as possible.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus atacis {{is known}} from a {{specimen}} from the Marnes Rouges Inférieures Formation. More specifically, {{it is known}} from the Bellevue layer, which has produced many vertebrate fossils. Even though it produced many <b>vertebrates,</b> the formation only has a few elements of plants and invertebrates. The <b>vertebrates</b> consist of numerous remains of Ampelosaurus, scales of Lepisosteus, shell fragments of an indeterminate turtle, cranial fragments and teeth of a crocodile, isolated theropod teeth, classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., an indeterminate ankylosaur, and a dentary and many postcranial elements of Rhabdodon priscus.
