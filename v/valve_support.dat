40|$|BackgroundThis study {{investigated}} the optimization of indications to external <b>valve</b> <b>support</b> using the Vedensky Spiral for primary deep venous reflux based on the femoral vein proximal (ostial) valve anatomy type. MethodsThe external Vedensky Spiral was used for correction of valvular insufficiency in 28 extremities of 24 patients (18 women, 6 men) during 1998 to 2002. Patients were {{a mean age of}} 54. 6 years (range, 32 - 76 years). The clinical manifestation was C 4 in 10 limbs and C 5 in 18 limbs. Primary axial deep reflux was present in all 28 extremities, and axial superficial reflux was also present in 26. Duplex scanning and descending phlebography were used to estimate the functional condition of the deep vein valves. Fibrophleboscopy intraoperatively to study the anatomic status of the femoral vein valves and for checking the repaired valve function was used. ResultsPhleboscopy showed the following anatomy of ostial valves of the femoral vein: 16 valves had wide separation of cusps, 11 had elongation of cusps, and one had a monocusp. The competence of femoral vein ostial valves was completely restituted in all cases with wide separation of cusps. Multiple corrections were performed in cases with incomplete competence of the ostial valve (valve with elongation of cusps or monocusp). ConclusionExternal <b>valve</b> <b>support</b> by the Vedensky Spiral is an effective and simple method of correction of incompetent femoral vein valves in limbs with primary deep venous reflux.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the feasibility of high-resolution phased-array intracardiac imaging. BackgroundIntracardiac echocardiographic imaging of the heart during interventional electrophysiologic (EP) procedures has been limited by inadequate ultrasound penetration and absence of Doppler hemodynamic and flow information produced by rotating mechanical ultrasound elements. MethodsA 10 F (3. 2 mm) phased-array, variable 5. 5 to 10 MHz frequency imaging catheter with a four-way deflectable tip was applied in 24 patients undergoing EP studies. Sixteen prespecified cardiac targets were imaged from a right heart venue. ResultsFifteen patients had no underlying organic heart disease; nine had ischemic, cardiomyopathic, valvular or congenital heart disorders. Longitudinal and short-axis imaging readily disclosed each cardiac <b>valve,</b> <b>support</b> structures and chamber, as well as the pericardium, right and left atrial appendages, the junction of the right atrium and superior vena cava, crista terminalis, tricuspid valve isthmus, coronary sinus orifice, membranous fossa ovalis and pulmonary veins. The average target depth was 8. 8 ± 1. 5 cm (range 0. 5 to 15 cm), with adequate penetration at a 7. 5 MHz imaging frequency. Color flow and Doppler utilities clearly characterized transaortic and pulmonic valve and pulmonary vein blood flow, including during low output states. ConclusionsThese first human studies with this technology demonstrate the methods, feasibility and utility of intracardiac phased-array vector and Doppler imaging for long-axis, apex-to-base global cardiac imaging.

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{conventional}} {{management of}} patients with atrioventricular discordance is directed at associated lesions, taking advantage of physiologic “correction”; however, the morphologic right ventricle and tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>support</b> the systemic circulation. Questions surrounding survival using this approach led us to analyze our institutional results. Methods: All patients with atrioventricular discordance undergoing biventricular repair were analyzed (n = 127, 1959 - 1997), excluding those with functionally univentricular hearts. The ventriculoarterial connection associated with atrioventricular discordance varied and was most commonly discordant (87 %), but occasionally concordant (6 %), double-outlet right ventricle (6 %), or double-outlet left ventricle (1 %). At initial presentation, the most common lesions associated with atrioventricular discordance were ventricular septal defect (86 %), pulmonary stenosis (64 %), tricuspid regurgitation (28 %), and atrioventricular block (12 %). Nine patients underwent a double switch procedure to create ventriculoarterial concordance and the remainder were managed conventionally without correcting discordant connections. Results: Operative mortality was 6 % and did not vary by associated lesion. Twenty years after repair, survival was 48 %. Within 20 years, 56 % of patients required reoperation, usually for atrioventricular valve incompetence (n = 16), pulmonary stenosis (n = 16), or both (n = 3). Pacemakers were required in 50 patients, 4 before repair, 40 within 2 months of repair, and 6 remotely after repair. In early follow-up, the double switch procedure (n = 9) had equivalent mortality and a high pacemaker requirement for atrioventricular block. Conclusions: Analysis of conventional management of atrioventricular discordance revealed cumulative increases in mortality, systemic atrioventricular valve (tricuspid) replacement, complete atrioventricular block, and incidence of reoperation. Alternative management should be examined. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 117 : 1190 - 203...|$|E
40|$|The present {{consensus}} {{regarding the}} fate of the pancreatic proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin in the human intestinal tract rests largely upon experiments by Borgstrom, Dahlqvist, Lundh, and Sjovall (1957), who measured their activity in juice obtained by intubation of the small intestine. The results indicated a progressive fall in activity from the pylorus towards the ileocaezal <b>valve.</b> <b>Support</b> for their conclusion that enzyme degrad-ation takes place in the small intestine has come from Pelot and Grossman (1962), who demon-strated rapid inactivation of pancreatic enzymes in the rat. Studies in this laboratory have shown binding of trypsin and chymotrypsin to human intestinal cells (Goldberg, Campbell, and Roy, 1968 a), and have demonstrated that the spectrophotometric assay of Lundh (1957), as used by Borgstrom et al (1957), was incapable of estimating bound enzymes. An alternative possibility was that the enzymes became bound to the surface of cells during transit through the intestine and to components of intestinal debris. Measurement of the daily output of trypsin in subjects on ileal drainage (Roy, Campbell, and Goldberg, 1967) gave data which, when compared with the trypsin concentration of human pancreatic juice (Haverback, Dyce, Bundy, and Edmondson, 1960), suggested that most of the enzyme reached the terminal ileum intact. It therefore seemed desirable to examine {{the fate of}} pancreatic enzymes in the human small intestine, considering all the factors that can interact with the enzymes from the point of their release into the duodenum.

40|$|Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) is a {{condition}} in present in almost 27 % of adults in which an insufficient amount of blood is pumped back to the heart due to damaged or poorly apposed one-way valves in the leg veins. During forward flow, vein valves allow blood {{to return to the}} heart while posing very little resistance to the flow. During gravity-driven reverse flow, normal valves close and prevent blood from flowing backward through the valve. Incompetent, or damaged, vein valves cannot prevent this reverse flow and lead to a pooling of blood at the feet. CVI is a painful disease presents itself in various ways, including varicose veins, ulcerations of the lower extremities, and severe swelling. Current therapies and treatments include compressive stockings, destruction or removal of affected veins, valve repair, and valve transplants. The implantation of prosthetic vein valves is a future treatment option that does not require an invasive surgery, human donor, or lengthy hospital stay. While no prosthetic vein valves are currently commercially available, this thesis describes the design, verification, and validation of a novel prosthetic vein valve. Verification tests include CFD simulations, functional tests, mechanical tests, and in vitro thromogenicity tests. The validation of the device was done through an animal study in sheep external jugular veins. CFD analysis verified that shear rates within the <b>valve</b> <b>support</b> its lower thrombogenicity as compared to a previous vein valve. Benchtop tests demonstrate superiority in short-term patency over a previous polymer valve. In a sheep study, patency was shown at 6 weeks, surpassing many autograft valves and showing great potential to meet the goal of 3 month patency in sheep. M. S.

40|$|Hydraulics is an {{efficient}} and a generally {{good way of}} transferring energy, but the technology does not come without its drawbacks. One in particular is when it is used in hot environments. Oil fires are devastating and hard to extinguish, the catastrophe in Bois du Cazier 1956 tells us this with its 262 casualties of which most were coal mining workers. The tragedy started with a simple short circuit. In Outotecs plants hydraulics is commonly used. With background in Outotecs customer demands this thesis investigates fire-resistant, non-mineral oil based, hydraulic fluids and implements them in an existent plant, Outotecs kaldo furnace TBRC. The components in the hydraulic system have been modeled using Solidworks and assembled as a hydraulic unit, Power Pack, that has been placed within a 20 feet shipping container. A Life Cycle Cost-analysis has been made for the furnace with the hydraulics and lance systems. A hydraulic fluid analysis has been made using industrial standards, hydraulic- and tribologic theory and contact with leading hydraulic suppliers. The modeling of the system has been made using Solidworks with basis in performance demands, service and reliability, study visits and mechanical hydraulic theory. The LCC-analysis is based on Outotec experience and economic reports delivered by one of Outotecs operational organisations which contains operational characteristics from a similar TBRC in service. The primary choice of fire resistant hydraulic fluid is the polyol ester {{which is the result}} of a fatyt acid and an alcohol. The fluid can be used in the current system without any modifications. The alternative is a water and glycol based hydraulic fluid, if this liquid is used the pumps and motors have to be downrated in the current hydraulic system in the TBRC. The component layout is evolved around the tank. On it the filters are placed, beside it the pumps. Accessibility and service operation controls the placement of the other components.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{expression of the}} pressure barrier in a capillary-burst valve for flow regulation in centrifugal microfluidics. The analysis considers variations of the interfacial energies at the meniscus of three-dimensional (3 D) configuration in a rectangular microchannel with a sudden expansion in cross-section. We derive a simple expression that predicts the critical burst pressure or rotational speed to overcome the capillary valve. Experiments were carried out for capillary valves that were integrated with microchannels on a rotating disk having various cross-sectional dimensions (300 and 400 mu m in width and 80 - 600 mu m in depth) and wedge angles (30 degrees- 100 degrees) of sudden expansion. The flow visualization of the meniscus development across the capillary <b>valve</b> <b>supports</b> the assumptions made for the present analysis. The measurements of burst rotational speeds for the capillary valves are in good agreement with the predictions by the simple expression except that those with a larger channel width and wider wedge angles are nearly 10 % lower than the predicted values...|$|R

They are suitable only for Fontan-like palliation, in which atrioventricular valvar abnormalities {{play a significant}} role in determining the outcome. We studied the segmental arrangements in such lesions and clarified the valvar morphology, particularly its surgical implications. MethodsWe made a macroscopic review of all specimens with an absent atrioventricular connection and a straddling atrioventricular valve that were held in the collections of 3 institutes. We included only those specimens with the straddling <b>valve</b> <b>supported</b> exclusively by either the right-sided or left-sided atrioventricular junction and excluded those with a common atrioventricular junction. ResultsWe found 11 hearts with an absent right atrioventricular connection and a straddling left atrioventricular valve, and 3 with an absent left atrioventricular connection and a straddling right atrioventricular valve. Most had right-hand ventricular topology and discordant ventriculoarterial connections. We found multiple valvar abnormalities, including dysplastic leaflets, short cords, abnormal attachments, and abnormal papillary muscles. The most consistent features were a line of maximal coaptation between the bridging leaflets always perpendicular to the plane of the ventricular septum and a free-floating bridging anterosuperior leaflet. ConclusionsStraddling of a solitary atrioventricular valve with an absent atrioventricular connection produces a uniatrial but biventricular connection. In this setting, the valve guarding the abnormal solitary atrioventricular junction cannot be classified morphologically as mitral or tricuspid.

The right atrioventricular valve consists of a muscle flap with two fixations. The left atrioventricular valve consists of two layers of endocardium {{with a layer of}} connective tissue between them.

We also assessed the relation between serum levels and endothelial expression and also the changes in serum levels following surgery. BACKGROUNDNonrheumatic aortic valve disease {{is believed to be}} a degenerative condition. Increased tissue and soluble adhesion molecule levels are described in inflammatory conditions. METHODSAortic valves from 22 surgical (16 bicuspid, 6 tricuspid) and 6 autopsy (4 normal, 2 thickened) cases were studied by immunohistochemistry. Soluble adhesion molecules were measured in peripheral blood preoperatively, and at 6 and 18 months postoperatively, and compared with controls. RESULTSThe majority of the surgically removed tricuspid and bicuspid valves expressed adhesion molecules (E-selectin, 75 % and 100 %; ICAM- 1, 75 % and 80 %; VCAM- 1, 69 % and 60 %, respectively). The normal postmortem valves did not express these, while the diseased ones did. Endothelial expression of E-selectin correlated strongly with serum levels (r = 0. 695, p = 0. 004). Soluble E-selectin levels were significantly higher at baseline compared with controls (p = 0. 017) and fell significantly at 18 months postoperatively (p = 0. 005). CONCLUSIONSAdhesion molecule expression on diseased <b>valves</b> <b>supports</b> an inflammatory component in “degenerative” aortic valve disease.

40|$|The water {{distribution}} regulation system of Fukuoka City {{is a system}} in which motor valves are operated by remote control while pressure gauges and flow meters attached to distribution pipes are monitored. One of the main objectives of this system is to regulate pressure in all the network nodes between lower and upper target values. With the ever-increasing complexity of the city-wide distribution pipe network, motor valve operations to regulate pressure and flow came to depend more and more on the experience and skills of operators.

40|$|Accurate {{combustion}} analysis at the test bed {{is an important}} tool for the devel-opment engineer. It can help engine design, efficiency improvements or emissions reduction by providing instantaneous feedback on the combustion process. It can also provide detailed combustion information to help speed-up the engine calibration process. By implementing shared memory communication, multiple core capability and streamlined calculation techniques, the calculation time of AVL gas exchange and {{combustion analysis}} software GCA (Gas Exchange and Combustion Analysis) has been dramatically reduced without significantly decreasing calculation results accuracy. This allows AVL IndiCom (in combination with AVL GCA) to perform accu-rate gas exchange and combustion analysis calculations directly and promptly at the test bed. This {{opens the door to}} a number of promising new applications by erasing the bridge between measurement data acquisition and post-processing analysis. Increase of measurement data consistency and the reduction of development time are two of the most important benefits of being able to perform “on-line ” plausi-bility checks of measurement data. The strong links connecting AVL GCA calculation results to the measurement data and the redundancy between calculation and measurement for the assessment of some highly relevant engine parameters (e. g. IMEP, air mass flow) can greatly extend the “on-line ” plausibility checks functions already available in AVL IndiCom or AVL test bed automation software PUMA.
