40|$|This {{dissertation}} essays {{to fill a}} {{gap that}} exists currently in postcolonial theory and criticism: that constituted by the dearth, if not total absence, of a psychological approach. Long before postcolonial studies became a discipline, Frantz Fanon declared that -only a psychoanalytical interpretation of the black problem can lay bare the anomalies of affect that are responsible for the structure of the complex. [DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] Fanon would later emerge as a canonical figure in the field, even spawning an academic cottage industry memorably dubbed -critical Fanonism. [DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] But much of this criticism ignores the essence of Fanon's call for a sociodiagnostic, a psychoanalytic interpretive tool informed by social and economic realities. My intervention seeks to answer the question of what it would mean to read post-colonial history as the history of a trauma, of the subversive return of the repressed. Yet, to speak of psychic epiphenomena and social realism in one breath presents, admittedly, an apparent contradiction. To show this problem as more apparent than real, I bring psychoanalysis into dialogue with philosophical realism. I look to the emergent theory of post-positivist realism for a conception of reference that provides the referential link between -traumatic[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] and -ordinary[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] experience. In my readings of the primary texts that form this study, I show the link between the traumatic wound of (post) colonialism and the strange and often bizarre effects it produces even today. Thus, for instance, I expand our current understanding of the confounding drama of death and continuity in a colonized world recently voided of its will (Wole Soyinka's Death and the King's Horseman), and of the debilitating symptoms of a repressed past that must be workedthrough in order to recover agency (Derek Walcott's Omeros). My exegesis serves as a critique of the tendency in postcolonial studies to privilege only the cultural-political mode of interpretation, thereby leaving a crucial dimension of the postcolonial predicament inadequately explored. If asked to restate the goal of this dissertation, I would, {{for want of a better}} term, say simply, -Towards a psycho-social realist theory of the post-colonial narrative. [DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] It is a close cousin of -the political unconscious,[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] the closest that a materialist attempt at probing the repressed strata of postcolonial trauma has yet come...|$|E
40|$|Borrowing {{from the}} {{resilience}} literature and utilizing a typology developed by Markusen and Carlson in 1988, {{this study will}} begin to match distinctive responses to deindustrialization with specific economic development strategies {{in order to better}} understand how certain Rust Belt regions fa red in light of their given responses and the various strategies they employed. In their article, -Bowing Out, Bidding Down, and Betting on the Basics: Midwestern Responses to Deindustrialization in the 1980 s[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE], Markusen and Carlson (1988) describe three types of responses to economic restructuring. The -Bowing Out[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] approach abandoned the idea of manufacturing reliance, focusing economic development efforts instead on the attraction and growth of service sector employment opportunities. The -Bidding Down[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] approach focused on curtailing manufacturing losses by decreasing {{the cost of doing business}} in a given region. -Betting on the Basics[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE] describes economic development strategies that targeted existing heavy industry, emphasizing the retention and expansion of firms already in the area. Also included in this study is a fourth type of strategy that I call -Sharing the Wealth[DOUBLE <b>VERTICLE</b> LINE], which was proposed by Clavel and Kleniewski (1990) and describes strategies that embraced growth in the service sector and worked to inc orporate linkage policies for the redistribution of related benefits in that sector. In this study, regional responses in eight metropolitan areas of the United States Rust Belt region are analyzed through the lens of adaptive resilience. The regional responses are subsequently categorized based upon current economic and demographic data, data collected through extensive interviews with former stakeholders, and archival research utilizing planning documents. In order to gain a diverse and robust understan ding of each region's response, interviews were conducted with leaders from the public, private and non -profit sectors, and leaders representing offices with urban, suburban or regional interests.

Through a process that had several phases, Met One created a prototype vane that was designed to attach to the existing Model 1585 Bi-Directional Wind Vane instrument structure. The prototype contained over 20 % less mass to enhance responsiveness, which was also increased {{through the use of a}} teardrop-shaped fin structure. The prototype vane can be readily manufactured for commercial retail. Tests in wind tunnel of Building 735 - 7 A, the Meteorological Engineering Facility, indicated that the new vane has a superior starting threshold of less than 0. 14 meter per second, a delay distance of 0. 72 meter, and a damping ratio of 0. 4. The relative accuracy of less than one degree is unchanged from the previous design. The vane bias was acceptable at 0. 8 degree for the horizontal wind angle, but was slightly high at 1. 4 degree for the <b>verticle</b> wind angle. The high value of the <b>verticle</b> wind angle bias can most likely be reduced to the desired less than one degree value with standard manufacturing production techniques. The durability of the prototype vane was not tested in the field but is expected to be slightly less due to the use of hollow rather than foam-filled fins.

However, due to eddy currents, the aluminum vacuum chamber will attenuate <b>verticle</b> ac fields above 8 Hz and horizontal fields above 25 Hz. Eddy currents will also cause phase shifts between the field generated by the correction coils, Bo ' and the field inside the vacuum chamber B i • These problems do not exist with a stainless steel vacuum chamber.

The heat transfer codffficient was found to increase with increase in mass celocity up to the point of spouting and at a fixed mass velocity it was found to decrease with increase in bed level.

40|$|Recent {{satellite}} and in situ measurements {{have indicated that}} limited denitrification can occur in the Arctic stratosphere. In situ measurements from the SOLVE campaign indicate polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) composed of small numbers (about 3 x 10 ^ - 4 cm^- 3) of 10 - 20 micron particles (probably NAT or NAD). These observations {{raise the issue of}} whether low number density NAT PSCs can substantially denitrify the air with reasonable cloud lifetimes. In this study, we use a one dimensional cloud model to investigate the <b>verticle</b> redistribution of HNO 3 by NAT/NAD PSCs. The cloud formation is driven by a temperature oscillation which drops the temperature below the NAT/NAD formation threshold (about 195 K) for a few days. We assume that {{a small fraction of the}} available aerosols act as NAT nuclei when the saturation ratio of HNO 3 over NAT(NAD) exceeds 10 (l. 5). The result is a cloud between about 16 and 20 km in the model, with NAT/NAD particle effective radii as large as about 10 microns (in agreement with the SOLVE data). We find that for typical cloud lifetimes of 2 - 3 days or less, the net depletion of HNO 3 is no more than 1 - 2 ppbv, regardless of the NAT or NAD particle number density. Repeated passes of the air column through the cold pool build up the denitrification to 3 - 4 ppbv, and the cloud altitude steadily decreases due to the downward transport of nitric acid. Increasing the cloud lifetime results in considerably more effective denitrification, even with very low cloud particle number densities. As expected, the degree of denitrification by NAT clouds is much larger than that by NAD Clouds. Significant denitrification by NAD Clouds is only possible if the cloud lifetime is several days or more. The clouds also cause a local maximum HNO 3 mixing ratio at cloud base where the cloud particles sublimate...|$|E

Due to its Quantum Mechanical nature, experiments in this area have been widely publicized to the scientific community. The apparatus is steadily growing easier to use, though fundamental problems are still present. In the first chapter, an address is given on the modem theory of tunneling to rationalize the conclusions Physicists made long ago about this phenomenon. The expanded theory generalizes the mathematical motivation for attempting such unique experiments {{and serves as a}} lead-in for the major components of the apparatus. Many texts do not quantize what the purpose is for each unit in the STM system, nor do they illustrate the process of preparation for probe shaping. It is the objective of the second and third chapters to detail this information. With as much as researchers know about the STM, there still remains an abundance of imaging problems which can develop. A study of graphite will be given in the fourth chapter dealing with one such issue - incorrect topograph scaling. Calibration techniques are provided to effectively determine the scaling needed for images using the horizontal and <b>verticle</b> lattice constants. Steps which appear as layering transitions are used for vertical calibration while B-atom spacing is used for horizontal calibration. Due to the conductive nature of the probe, particulate fragments are more likely to attach to the apex of the probe than to uncharged material in the system. Thus, since the probe 2 ̆ 7 s shape is the most important item to control in STM experiments, atomic resolutions of topographs are often in danger. One of many consequences of having two III atoms on the apex of the probe is a duplication of sample structures on the topographic image. In the fifth chapter, it is proposed that one could determine the structure of a double tip if an imperfection existed on the sample surface for reference. The imperfection used for this study is a hole created by prior tip contact with the graphite sample. The original and duplicate images of the cavity are used to determine this double tip structure...|$|E

This system used {{the best of}} the then standard state of the arts commercial components and was used for shipboard missile data receiving/recording and for quick look missile performance evaluation. In 1977 the Naval Sea Systems Command made funds available to update the AN/SKQ- 3 system by utilizing the RF assembly similar to that used in PUTTS. This new RF assembly provided dual antennas for (1) a wide angle for <b>verticle</b> launch and initial acquisition; (2) narrow beam high gain for long range tracking. The RF unit also included frequency scan with automatic lock when a signal was received, and sector search. In 1978 funding was received from Australia and Iran to procure additional PUTTS. These units (PUTTS III) were updated to handle faster intercept rates as well as improved range tracking and adapt the new RF features from the SKQ- 3 Mod. Added to this were the capability to handle both PAM and PCM data with light weight hardware. These systems were completed and the Australian unit system was delivered after acceptance tests with U. S. fleet operation in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of these successful improvements a new portable system has been built to (1) adapt microprocessors to the set-up of data format; (2) Provide automatic selection remote control of the RF head within the antenna frame; (3) provide the basic data to make automatic processing possible when and if desired; (4) Add the new low noise GASFET preamp to the system to increase the range; (5) Add capability for four receivers in the space presently occupied by the dual receivers to permit the handling of the new missiles with dual RF outputs and (6) provide the capability of system checking of all modules from the antenna through the system to the paper read-out device.

The purer carbonate accumulations of the formation would appear to have been deposited in an environment free of terrigenous detritus between emergent volcanics and shallow water volcanic sandstones to the north, and trench deposits to the south. The result was a carbonate grainstone barrier that subdivided parts of the Middle Ordovician coastline into a landward restricted lagoonal environment and an oceanward open marine environment. [...] Because of the presently deformed nature of the New World Island rocks, several small incomplete sections of the Cobbs Arm Formation were measured and sampled. Detailed investigation of the lithologies of the samples revealed a sedimentological pattern indicative of a slightly erratic transgressive phase of deposition. It is possible that the emergence of the arc terrains, which preceded the deposition of the Cobs Arm Formation, and the subsequent subsidence of the island arc terrains, which accompanied and succeeded Cobbs Arm Formation deposition, was the fore and aftermath of a ridge-trench interaction. The transgression resulted in a landward shift of oceanward facies, now recorded in the <b>verticle</b> sequences of the Cobbs Arm Formation. [...] The conodont fauna of the Cobbs Arm Formation appears to be divisible into two species associations. One relates well with sediments of the proposed restricted environment and the other relates well with sediments of a more open marine environment. On a finer scale, {{there appears to be a}} relationship between substratum characteristics and certain conodont species. Because of this apparent ecological control on many of the conodont species, the conodont zones and subzones of the Middle Ordovician were difficult to accurately apply. [...] Conodonts are found in abundance in the Cobbs Arm Formation and are represented by 39 multielement species and five residual forms including 8 new species and 2 new genera. The two new genera are described on the basis of the two new species Pseudobelodina n. sp. A. and a New Genus A n. sp. A. The fauna is dominantly of North Atlantic Province affinity yet the most abundantly represented species is more commonly found in the Midcontinent Province, i. e. Panderodus gracilis (Branson and Mehl). This species, along with Periodon aculeatus Hadding, Pygodus anserinus Lamont and Lindstrom, Baltoniodus variabilis (Bergstrom), Protopanderodus varicostatus (Swee and Bergstrom), and Pydogus serrus (Hadding) constitutes more than 75 percent of the total number of recovered conodont elements. Other important conodont species include: Baltoniodus prevariabilis-B variabilis transition, distacodus venustus (Stauffer), Drepanoistodus n. sp. A., Eoplacognathus lindstroemi (Hamar), E. robustus Bergstrom, Scalpellodus cavus (Webers), Strachanognathus parvus Rodes, Walliserodus ethingtoni (Fahraeus), Walliserodus nakholmensis (Hamar) and Walliserodus n. sp.

40|$|Nos ultimos annos teem sido observadas mortandades de peixes nos rios do Estado de S. Paulo. Vê-se, das informações obtidas pelo autor e por outros pesquisadores, que o phenomeno não parece novo entre nós; elle tem sido tambem verificado em outros rios do Brasil, embora não repetido com tanta regularidade como agora. Ficou demonstrado no presente trabalho, tratar-se de uma doença contagiosa, causada por um virus filtravel. Apparecem, a principio, alguns peixes doentes ou mortos; seu numero cresce muito nos dias seguintes. Parece serem atacados logo a maioria dos peixes do local onde ella surge porque, em 2 a 3 dias adoecem milhares e, em poucos, 8 a 15, decresce rapidamente o numero de animaes doentes e mortos. Nesse tempo a doença propagou-se a outros rios, relacionados com o primeiro, a montante ou a jusante delle, até muito distante do ponto onde começou a doença. A doença caracterisa-se clinicamente pela diminuição da capacidade motora dos peixes, que se movem com pouca actividade, deixando-se levar pela correnteza ou procurando permanecer nos pontos remansosos do rio; e pela tendencia a subir á superficie das aguas, em posição {{vertical}} ou obliqua, differente dos peixes sãos, que sobem horizontalmente. No inicio da doença os peixes defendem-se da captura, mais tarde são facilmente apprehendidos com a mão. As lesões se resumem em manchas, de tamanho variavel, situadas de cada lado do dorso. Essas manchas nem sempre são presentes. Mais constante é a congestão das nadadeiras, principalmente das nadadeiras peitoraes. Internamente ha augmento de muco na garganta, pallidez do figado e congestão da vesicula biliar, cuja bile é amarellada. Essas lesões internas tambem não são constantes. A doença transmitte-se: directamente, pela cohabitação de peixes seguramente sãos com peixes doentes, ou pela juncção de virus á água contendo peixes sãos; indirectamente, pela agua contaminada, ou pela agua filtrada em vela Chamberland F, cuja integridade foi verificada bacteriologicamente. O virus causador da doença é attenuado e destruido em temperaturas acima de 15 ° ou só age bem sobre peixes conservados em agua com temperaturas proximas de 12 °. Conserva-se perfeitamente a 0 °. Esta particularidade explica a coincidencia da doença sempre no inverno e nos rios de menor volume, onde as mudanças bruscas de temperatura são possiveis. Entretanto, a agua fria por si só não reproduz a doença nos animaes testemunhas, collocados em aquarios ao lado dos infectados, em todas as experiencias. A vista desta particularidade foi dada á doença a denominação de cryoichtyozoose. Verificações histologicas revelaram nos peixes doentes um processo inflammatorio na mucosa buccal, cujas cellulas apresentavam inclusões acidophilas, suggerindo-se então o nome estomatite contagiosa dos peixes, mais apropriado que o nome anterior, porque tem um substracto anatomico para a especificação da doença. Essas lesões permittem um diagnostico da doença a posteriori e á distancia. Investigações feitas sobre a etiologia permittiram afastar todas as outras causas conhecidas de mortandades em peixes: bacteiras, protozoarios, agentes physicos, incluindo o frio, e agentes chimicos, occasionando todos lesões bem conhecidas nesses animaes. Além disso, taes causas são facilmente constatadas por technicas simples de laboratorio ou pelo aspecto dos peixes atacados. Na «discussão» do assumpto ficou patente haver analogias dessa doença com certas mortandades observadas em outros paizes, particularmente com a estudada por Huxley, nos rios do Sul da Escossia, observada durante varios annos. Não é impossivel, tambem, que algumas das doenças descriptas em peixes como causadas por bacterias ou parasitos, sem prova segura da pathogenia desses agentes pathogenicos, tenham sua origem em agentes da mesma natureza da doença de S. Paulo. During {{the past}} few years there has been observed a dying of fishes in the rivers of the Brazilian State of São Paulo. It is evident, from information obtained by the author and by other investigators, that the phenomenon {{does not appear to be}} new among us; it has also been verified in other Brazilian rivers, although not repeated with such regularity as at the present time. In the present paper it is demonstrated that we have to do with a contageous disease, caused by a filterable virus. The epizooty manifests itself by the appearance of some dead or sick fish; the number increasing very much during the suceeding days. It seems that at the outset a majority of the fishes is attacked, in the locality where it appears, for in 2 or 3 days, thousands are affected, and in a short time, 8 to 15 days, there is a rapid decline in the number of ill and dead animals. During this interval the disease spread to affluents of the first river, either above or below the first point of attack, and to a considerable distance from it. Clinically, the disease is characterised by the leassened motor capacity of the fishes, which move very slowly, allowing themselves to be carried by the current, or trying to remain the coves and at the margins of the river; and by the tendency of rising to the surface in an oblique or <b>verticle,</b> position, different from the healthy fish, which rise in a horizontal position. In the initial stage of the disease, the fish actively resist capture, but later on they can be easily taken with the hands. The visible lesions are restricted to spots, of variable size, situated at each side of the dorsum. These spots are frequent but not always present. A more constant character is the congestion of the fins, especially the pectoral fins. Interiorly, there is noted an increase of the mucus in the troath, paleness of the liver with congestion of the gall bladder, the gall being yellowish in colour. These internal lesions also are not constant. The disease is transmitted: directly, by the cohabitation of fish undoubtedly healthy with diseased fish, or by the contamination of the water containing healthy fish by the virus; indirectly, buy placing healthy fish in contaminated water, or in this water filtered through a Chamberland F candle, verified bacteriologically to be free from cracks. The virus do not cause the disease or is destroyed by temperatures above 15 ° C., or is active on fishes at the temperature of about 12 ° C. It retains its virulence perfectly at 0 ° C. This particularity explains the coincidence of the disease always appearing in the winter and in the smaller rivers, in which sudden variations of temperature appeared. However, cold water alone did not produce the disease in healthy test animals, placed in aquaria by the side of the infected fish, in all of the experiments. Because of this characteristic, the disease has been designated as « cryoichthiozoose ». Further histologic investigations shows in sick fishes inflammatory process in the mouth, whose cells show acidophil inclusions. The name « Contagious estomatitis of fishes » was proposed giving a anatomical substrat to the disease, instead the first name. This lesions do permit a further and distant diagnosis of the disease. It was verified that all other known agents causing dying of fishes, such as bacteria, protozoa, physical agents, including low temperature, chemical agents, all causing well known lesions in fishes, could be excluded. Aside from this, they are easily verified by simple laboratory techniques or by the lesions produced in the fishes attacked. In the « discussion » of the subject, it was evident that analogies exist between this disease and certain fish mortalities observed in other countries, especially that studied by Huxley and observed during several years in the rivers of Southern Scotland. It is also possible that some of the fish diseases described as caused by bacteria or animal parasites, but without sure proof of the pathogenicity of these agents, have the same etiology as the disease of the São Paulo rivers, here described...|$|E
