In the medial prefrontal cortex, value-related activity is enhanced when subjective value becomes choice-relevant, and the magnitude of this increase relates directly to the outcome and reliability of the value-based choice.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an abstract framework, called <b>valuation</b> <b>network</b> (VN), for representing and solving discrete optimization problems. In VNs, we represent information in an optimization problem using functions called valuations. Valuations represent factors of an objective function. Solving a VN involves using two operators called combination and marginalization. The combination operator {{tells us how}} to combine the factors of the objective function to form the global objective function (also called joint valuation). Marginalization is either maximization or minimization. Solving a VN can be described simply as finding the marginal of the joint valuation for the empty set. We state some simple axioms that combination and marginalization need to satisfy to enable us to solve a VN using local computation. We describe a fusion algorithm for solving a VN using local computation. For optimization problems, the fusion algorithm reduces to non-serial description of the dynamic programming method, and the axioms {{can be viewed as}} conditions that permit the use of dynamic programming.

We asked if such departures are uniform or if heterogeneous aging processes can designate which older adults show differing decision patterns. Thirty-three healthy {{older adults with}} varying decision-making patterns on a complex decision task (the Iowa Gambling Task) completed an intertemporal choice task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined whether value representation in the canonical <b>valuation</b> <b>network</b> differed across older adults based on complex decision-making ability. Older adults with advantageous decision patterns showed increased activity in the valuation net-work, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and striatum. In contrast, older adults with disadvantageous decision patterns showed reduced or absent activation in the VMPFC and striatum, and these older adults also showed greater blood oxygen level dependent signal temporal variability in the striatum. Our results suggest that a reduced repre-sentation of value in the brain, possibly driven by increased neural noise, relates to suboptimal decision-making in a subset of older adults, which could translate to poor decision-making in many aspects of life, including finance, health and long-term care.

Decision making is often modeled as choices between lotteries and – in typical research on decision under risk – the probabilities are given to the subject explicitly in numerical form. In this study, we examined lottery decision task where the probabilities of receiving various rewards are contingent on the subjects’ own visual performance in a random-dot-motion (RDM) discrimination task, a metacognitive or second order judgment. While there is a large literature concerning the RDM task and there is also a large literature on decision under risk, little is known about metacognitive decisions when the source of uncertainty is visual. Using fMRI with humans, we found distinct fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal networks representing subjects’ estimates of his or her performance, reward value, and the expected value (EV) of the lotteries.

INTRODUCTION In a valuation-based system [Shenoy 1 hen 1 henoy we represent knowledge by functions called valuations. We draw inferences from such systems using two operations called combination and marginalization. Combination corresponds to the aggregation of knowledge and marginalization corresponds to the coarsening of knowledge.

40|$|Despite {{evidence}} supporting {{a relationship between}} impulsivity and naturalistic risk-taking, the relationship of impulsivity with laboratory-based measures of risky decision-making remains unclear. One factor contributing to this gap in our understanding {{is the degree to}} which different risky decision-making tasks vary in their details. We conducted an fMRI investigation of the Angling Risk Task (ART), which is an improved behavioral measure of risky decision-making. In order to examine whether the observed pattern of neural activation was specific to the ART or generalizable, we also examined correlates of the Balloon Analogue Risk Taking (BART) task in the same sample of 23 healthy adults. Exploratory analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between neural activation, performance, impulsivity and self-reported risk-taking. While activation in a <b>valuation</b> <b>network</b> was associated with reward tracking during the ART but not the BART, increased fronto-cingulate activation was seen during risky choice trials in the BART as compared to the ART. Thus, neural activation during risky decision-making trials differed between the two tasks, and this observation was likely driven by differences in task parameters, namely the absence vs. presence of ambiguity and/or stationary vs. increasing probability of loss on the ART and BART, respectively. Exploratory association analyses suggest that sensitivity of neural response to the magnitude of potential reward during the ART was associated with a suboptimal performance strategy, higher scores on a scale of dysfunctional impulsivity and a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, while this pattern was not seen for the BART. Our results suggest that the ART is decomposable and associated with distinct patterns of neural activation; this represents a preliminary step towards characterizing a behavioral measure of risky decision-making that may support a better understanding of naturalistic risk-taking...|$|E
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{focused on}} understanding how {{different areas of}} the brain coordinate in networks to drive higher cognitive functions, and how damage, changes the brain’s synchronized activity (or functional connectivity) in the short and long term. In this dissertation, I studied the functional connectivity of brain networks that are thought to underlie emotion and decision-making, and how these networks change in the face of neurological injury. In my first set of experiments, I studied participants with chronic focal brain damage to determine how damage to brain areas which have been identified as important in emotion and decision-making behaviors (amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, 2 ̆ 6 insula), affected connectivity of brain networks, and how changes in connectivity following damage to these areas related to emotion and decision-making behavior. Supporting my predictions, I found evidence that damage to the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and insula all result in significantly weaker connections between a network of areas important for assigning value to stimuli. Additionally, I found that stronger connectivity in this <b>valuation</b> <b>network</b> was significantly positively associated with performance on ratings of disgusted faces, while stronger connectivity in a network important for processing emotional salience was significantly positively correlated with decision-making performance. In the second set of studies in this dissertation, I utilized a population of epilepsy patients who were undergoing brain surgery to treat their seizures to investigate how a brain network related to emotional salience changed from before to after surgery. This approach allowed me to study how the connectivity and associated behavior of this network changed from preoperative baseline, to the weeks and months after part of this network was removed. While I expected a decline in this network in the weeks following surgery, instead I found a significant positive correlation between preoperative and acute postoperative connectivity in a subset of this network. However, my hypothesis {{that there would be a}} significant increase in the connectivity of this network between acute and chronic postoperative epochs was supported. I only have partial evidence for a significant correlation between the change in salience network connectivity between preoperative and acute postoperative assessments and the associated change in decision-making behavior. This correlation was in the opposite direction of my hypothesis, with increased change in connectivity being positively associated with change in risk-taking behavior. I did not observe a significant correlation between the change in network connectivity and change in behavior across acute and chronic measurements. These findings provide important insight on how measures of network connectivity can inform theories of neuroplasticity and reorganization following brain damage. Understanding how these networks change over time, and how changes in these networks relate to behavioral outcomes, are critical for the development and effective deployment of therapeutic interventions. Together, these studies provide a foundation for further study, demonstrating that these networks change over time with damage, and the residual network strength is associated with performance on measures of emotion and decision-making...|$|E
