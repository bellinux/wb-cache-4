The ratio of air to helium was used to vary the apparent temperature of the layer. The apparent temperature is the temperature at which air would have the same density as the buoyant layer mixture. In this way a temperature range of 300 to 1100 0 K was simulated. It was found that when the layer depth was equal to or greater than the <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> the buoyant layer was stable and the discharge coefficient was within 15 percent or less of the expected value of 0. 60. When the layer depth was less than the <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> the layer became unstable and the discharge coefficient decreased to as low as 0. 18. It was determined that when the layer depth is less than the <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> a weir-type flow condition results where the exiting gases do not fill the entire opening. Previously horizontal vent flow was always treated as orifice-type flow with a discharge coefficient of 0. 60...|$|E

Considering that the transitional level was at 100 – 200  m above the source level of the jets studied (50 – 150  m above vent exit), this would suggest that the pulses observed had an initial jet diameter of the order of ~ 6  m or less.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 54 - 55) Experimental {{measurements of}} the rate of escaping helium from the container {{as a function of}} time were made with a scale where weight readings were obtained continuously with a camcorder. Ten different <b>vent</b> tube <b>diameters</b> ranging from 0. 061 inches to 0. 500 inches, with the same container, were used as it was believed that if buoyancy effects were present, they might be dependent on the <b>vent</b> tube <b>diameter</b> and length. Since the scale can only record the container weight; an analysis was required to enable the differentiation between the masses of the helium and the air inside the container during the vent process. A diffusion model of the vent process was also developed to compare with the experimental data. The experimental data and the diffusion model both showed that the mass of helium inside the container decays exponentially with time. However, the measured rate of escape of helium in the early time period was found to be greater than that of the model, the difference becoming smaller as the <b>vent</b> tube <b>diameter</b> was increased in size. Since the measured and predicted weight measurements differences are greater than those due to experimental errors, the possibility of a presently unexplained buoyancy effect cannot be ruled out by this study. Nevertheless, the results still indicate that the emptying process is ultimately dominated by diffusion considering that the small container took anywhere from 3 hours to 2 days to empty...|$|R

40|$|Head {{injuries}} {{are a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, many resulting from sporting activities. Currently, there is a need in the head protection industry for improved technology capable of reducing the risk of mild and severe head injuries. Contemporary head protection devices are comprised mainly of foam and have several inherent disadvantages, including a limited ability to provide effective energy absorption under both low and high impact velocities. New thin-walled collapsible chamber energy absorption systems may resolve this problem. The chambers consist of four engineering elements which alter their performance - geometry, air volume, material, and venting system. This research analyzed the contribution of air flow through an orifice to the chamber's management of impact energy. The main objective {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of the chamber's <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> on peak force and venting rate during an impact. Two material stiffnesses and five vent diameters were tested at three inbound velocities. Each chamber was impacted ten times using a monorail drop system. Significant main effects were found for material stiffness, <b>vent</b> <b>diameter,</b> and inbound velocity on peak force and venting rate (p< 0. 0001). Under low inbound velocities the largest vent diameters transmitted less force than the smallest, while this relationship reversed at high inbound velocities. Under low velocities air flow rate was negatively, and flow duration was positively correlated to peak force. Under high velocities, air flow rate was positively, and duration was negatively correlated to peak force. This suggested that under low velocities chambers performed optimally when air was dissipated fast, for a short duration; however, as the chamber approached a critical failure region, the increased duration and decreased velocity of air released prevented larger peak forces. Overall, this research confirmed that engineered thin-walled collapsible chambers use air as a mechanism to absorb impacting force...|$|E

In the case of a ‘blind area’ at the source level from which no clast is ejected, the observed cut-off angle would be too steep, leading to an overestimate of z. However, error analysis reveals that {{due to the fact that}} z ≫ r, the sensitivity of the cut-off angle towards this effect is low. For demonstration, let us assume z to be 50 m and the (real) inner <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> 2 r to be 10 m. A ‘blind area’ of 1 -m length on each side (i.e., 20 % of the diameter) would lead to an error for α of approximately 1 °, meaning that α would still be within the above assumed uncertainty.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{hypothesis}} that volcanic blasts can have supersonic regions, we investigate the role of unsteady flow in jets from a high-pressure finite reservoir. We examine the processes for formation of far-field features, such as Mach disk shocks, by using a shock tube facility and numerical experiments to investigate phenomena to previously unobtained pressure ratios of 250 : 1. The Mach disk shock initially forms {{at the edges of}} the vent and moves toward the centerline. The shock is established within a few <b>vent</b> <b>diameters</b> and propagates downstream toward the equilibrium location as the jet develops. The start-up process is characterized by two different timescales: the duration of supersonic flow at the nozzle exit and the formation time of the Mach disk shock. The termination process also is characterized by two different timescales: the travel time required for the Mach disk shock to reach its equilibrium position and the time at which the Mach disk shock begins significantly to collapse away from its equilibrium position. The critical comparisons for the formation of steady state supersonic regions are between the two start-up timescales and the termination timescales. We conclude that for typical vulcanian eruptions and the Mount St. Helens directed blast, the Mach disk shock could have formed near the vent, and that there was time for it to propagate a distance comparable to its equilibrium location. These experiments provide a framework for analysis of short-lived volcanic eruptions and data for benchmarking simulations of jet structures in explosive volcanic blasts...|$|R

We model the plume {{activity}} detected by Galileo at the Pillan and Pele sites from 1996 to 1997 assuming that magmatic eruptions incorporate liquid SO 2 from near-surface aquifers intersecting the conduit system and that the SO 2 eventually forms a solid condensate on the ground. The temperature and pressure at which deposition of solid SO 2 commences in the Ionian environment and the radial distance from the volcanic vent at which this process appears to occur {{on the surface}} are used together with observed vertical heights of plumes to constrain eruption conditions. The temperature, pressure, and density of the gas–magma mixtures are related to distance from the vent using continuity and conservation of energy. Similar eruption mass fluxes of order 5 x 10 ^ 7 kg s^ 1 are found for both the Pillan and the Pele plumes.

30|$|The TIA method {{could in}} {{principle}} {{also be used}} for straight trajectories confined to only one side of the symmetry axis of the pulse. However, the smaller difference between the steepest and the flattest angle would lead to a higher uncertainty; therefore, we only analyzed pulses generating straight trajectories visible on both sides. Pulses within the right-hand side (leeward) sector that were partly (or completely) ‘hidden’ by ash were hence not considered with the TIA. Although it relies to some extent on the assumption of a symmetrical vent, the CAM suffers less from this limitation, as for that method only the cut-off angle of the cumulative straight trajectories of one side was analyzed. Against this background, the results of the horizontal deviation ∆x found by TIA {{can be seen as a}} minimum estimate for the inner <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> 2 r, while CAM in combination with the variation of the input parameters provides a maximum value.

30|$|Entrainment of {{ambient air}} by {{turbulent}} mixing plays {{a central role}} in the dynamics of eruption clouds, primarily because the cloud density is controlled by the mixing ratio between ejected material and ambient air. Generally speaking, the efficiency of entrainment is a function of the Reynolds number. However, it is independent of the Reynolds number when the turbulence is fully developed (Dimotakis, 2000). Because the flow of volcanic plume is considered to be fully turbulent, to correctly reproduce the entrainment efficiency in the plume, our simulations must use a sufficiently high spatial resolution (Suzuki et al., 2005). This means that during simulation, grid sizes were set to be smaller than D 0 / 16 near the vent, where D 0 is the <b>vent</b> <b>diameter,</b> and to increase at a constant rate (by a factor of 1.02) with distance from the vent up to D 0 / 2, such that the grid size is small enough to resolve turbulent flow at locations far from the vent (cf.

40|$|This paper aims at {{contributing}} to the efficient design of explosion protection systems against confined explosions. The issue addressed concerns the quantitative estimation of the protective effect of explosion relief vents {{in the case of}} confined explosions inside tunnels. A series of virtual experiments performed by computer simulation, revealed how the number of <b>vents,</b> their <b>diameter,</b> as well as the angle between the vents and the tunnel, influences the blast wave attenuation. The computational study was performed considering a complicated large-scale tunnel configuration with branches on its half portion. The purpose was the calculation of the attenuation effect due to the presence of vents by comparing the total explosion-specific impulse developing at antidiametric positions inside the tunnel. Simulations were carried out via a three-dimensional numerical model built in the computational fluid dynamics code CFX 5. 7. 1, which has been validated in previous papers against experimental overpressure histories data demonstrating reasonable performance. Computer results showed that the use of branch vents provides an effective method for shock wave attenuation following an explosion, whereas their statistical elaboration revealed that the attenuation is mainly affected by the number of <b>vents</b> and their <b>diameter.</b> In contrast, the angle between the side vents and the main tunnel appeared to slightly affect the pressure wave weakening. Eventually, the quantitative influence of the above parameters was effectively illustrated in functional diagrams, so that the total attenuation effect may be promptly estimated, if the design variables are known. In addition, two statistical models with reasonable fitting to the calculated data are proposed, which express the attenuation effect as a dependent variable of the design variables including their interactions.

30|$|Two {{methods are}} {{introduced}} to estimate the depth of origin of ejecta trajectories (depth to magma level in conduit) and the diameter of a conduit in an erupting crater, using analysis of videos from the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption to evaluate their applicability. Both methods rely on the identification of straight, initial trajectories of fast ejecta, observed near the crater rims before they are appreciably bent by air drag and gravity. In the first method, through tracking these straight trajectories and identifying a cut-off angle, the inner diameter and the depth level of the vent can be constrained. In the second method, the intersection point of straight trajectories from individual pulses is {{used to determine the}} maximum possible depth from which the tracked ejecta originated and the width of the region from which the pulses emanated. The two methods give nearly identical results on the depth to magma level in the crater of Eyjafjallajökull on 8 to 10 May of 51 ± 7 m. The inner <b>vent</b> <b>diameter,</b> at the level of origin of the pulses and ejecta, is found to have been 8 to 15 m. These methods open up the possibility to feed (near) real-time monitoring systems with otherwise inaccessible information about vent geometry during an ongoing eruption and help defining important eruption source parameters.|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} several minutes of an {{explosive}} volcanic eruption, the flow in the column above the vent is unsteady even if the discharge from the vent is steady. At a fixed location in the column, parameters such as temperature and ash content change with time until steady flow conditions are established. For conditions believed to be typical of fountain-forming silicic eruptions of intermediate volume, numerical simulations show unsteadiness in temperature, plume diameter, mass flux, vertical velocity, and particle concentration. In addition to the steady mass flux from the vent, we have identified three sources of mass and heat flux into the column: (1) recirculation of pyroclastic flow material into {{the base of the}} column (low elevation inward flow); (2) ash entrained {{from the top of the}} pyroclastic flow by atmospheric inflow back toward the column (higher-elevation inward flow); and (3) waves reflected within the pyroclastic flow if it encounters topographic obstacles. The thermal and mass flux pulses cause variations in column diameter and fountain height. Changing column diameter would be expected to be manifested in changes in fallout deposits (e. g., by shifts in clast isopleths). These temporal variations (if observed, for example, by satellite measurements of temperature pulses or pulses or inferred from field observations of deposit stratigraphy) could be misinterpreted as indicating source variations such as source mass flux, volatile content, or <b>vent</b> <b>diameter,</b> when, in fact, they result from fluid mechanical processes...|$|E
40|$|During {{operational}} ash-cloud forecasting, {{prediction of}} ash concentration and total erupted mass directly {{depends on the}} determination of mass eruption rate (MER), which is typically inferred from plume height. Uncertainties for plume heights are large, especially for bent-over plumes in which the ascent dynamics are strongly affected by the surrounding wind field. Here we show how uncertainties can be reduced if MER is derived directly from geophysical observations of source dynamics. The combination of infrasound measurements and thermal camera imagery allows for the infrasonic type of source to be constrained (a dipole in this case) and for the plume exit velocity to be calculated (54 – 142 m/s) based on the acoustic signal recorded during the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption from 4 to 21 May. Exit velocities are converted into MER using additional information on <b>vent</b> <b>diameter</b> (50 ± 10 m) and mixture density (5. 4 ± 1. 1 kg/m 3), resulting in an average ∼ 9 × 105 kg/s MER during the considered period of the eruption.

Acoustically derived MER are converted into plume heights using field-based relationships and a 1 D radially averaged buoyant plume theory model using a reconstructed total grain size distribution. We conclude {{that the use of}} infrasonic monitoring may lead to important understanding of the plume dynamics and allows for real-time determination of eruption source parameters.

Sets of conditions for the simulations are determined {{on the basis of the}} bulk of knowledge on the past history of Vesuvius [Cioni, R., Bertagnini, A., Santacroce, R., Andronico, D., Explosive activity and eruption scenarios at Somma–Vesuvius (Italy) : towards a new classification scheme. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, this issue. ]. Volatile contents (H 2 O and CO 2) are parameterized in order to account for the uncertainty in their expected amounts for a next eruption. In all cases the flow in the conduit is found to be choked, with velocities at the conduit exit or vent corresponding to the sonic velocity in the two-phase non-equilibrium magmatic mixture. Conduit <b>diameters</b> and <b>vent</b> mixture densities are found to display minimum overlapping between the different eruptive scales, while exit gas and particle velocities, as well as vent pressures, largely overlap. <b>Vent</b> <b>diameters</b> vary from as low as about 5 m for VS eruptions, to 35 – 55 m for the most violent SP 1 eruption scale. Vent pressures can be as low as less than 1 MPa for the lowest volatile content employed of 2 wt. % H 2 O and no CO 2, to 7 – 8 MPa for highest volatile contents of 5 wt. % H 2 O and 2 wt. % CO 2 and large eruptive scales. Gas and particle velocities at the vent range from 100 – 250 m/s, with a tendency to decrease, and to increase the mechanical decoupling between the phases, with increasing eruptive scale. Except for velocities, all relevant vent quantities are more sensitive to the volatile content of the discharged magma for the highest eruptive scales considered...|$|R
