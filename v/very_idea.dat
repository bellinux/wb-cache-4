However, most Hungarian noblemen were strongly opposed to the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of a female monarch. They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou. Charles could not openly lay claim to Hungary, because his rival for the Kingdom of Naples, Louis I, Duke of Anjouwho was Charles VI of France's unclehad invaded Southern Italy in the previous year.|$|E

5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity. Needless to say, the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of classification is premised on, and engenders, inequality. Therein lies the paradox of equality jurisprudence. The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated {{for the purpose of}} the law and none who are not.|$|E

25|$|Methodologically, social {{complexity}} is theory-neutral, {{meaning that}} it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research.

As complex social systems have many parts {{and there are many}} possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.|$|E

25|$|In Christianity, God the Father's {{relationship}} with humanity is {{as a father}} to children—in a previously unheard-of sense—and not just as the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children, his people. Thus, humans in general are sometimes called children of God. To Christians, God the Father's {{relationship with}} humanity is that of Creator and created beings, and in that respect he {{is the father of}} all. The New Testament says, in this sense, that the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of family, wherever it appears, derives its name from God the Father, and thus God himself is the model of the family.|$|E

25|$|He {{is perhaps}} the most {{influential}} character in films that explore archaeology. Since the release of Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981, the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted. Prior to the film's release, the stereotypical image of an archaeologist was that of an older, lacklustre professor type. In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure. Following 1981, the stereotypical archaeologist is thought of as a male bull whip wielding adventurer and Ivy League professor. The stereotypical image of an archaeologist is also portrayed as an individual usually out doing fieldwork, which is not always the case.|$|E
25|$|In 1517 the Reformation {{began with}} the {{publication}} of Martin Luther's 95 Theses; he posted them in the town square and gave copies of them to German nobles, but it is debated whether he nailed them to the church door in Wittenberg as is commonly said. The list detailed 95 assertions Luther believed to show corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church. One often cited example, though perhaps not Luther's chief concern, is a condemnation of the selling of indulgences; another prominent point within the 95 Theses is Luther's disagreement both with {{the way in which the}} higher clergy, especially the pope, used and abused power, and with the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of the pope.|$|E
25|$|Descent {{from the}} Talmudic {{tradition}} is the defining feature of Rabbinic Judaism. In Rabbinic Judaism {{it is commonly}} believed that the oral traditions codified in the Oral Torah were co-given with the Written Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. This belief has, in contrast, been rejected by the Sadducees and Hellenistic Jews during the Second Temple period, the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period, and in the modern non-Orthodox denominations: Reform Judaism sees all scripture as derived from human experience of the divine, Conservative Judaism holds that {{at the very least}} some of the oral law is man-made, and Reconstructionist Judaism denies the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of revelation. The vast majority of Jews today come from a Rabbinic Jewish background. Karaite Judaism is considered the main contrast to Rabbinic Judaism in our days, but even though Karaites constituted close to half of the global Jewish population around the early 2nd millennium CE, today there but a few tens of thousands left.|$|E

25|$|All major modern Christian communions {{accept a}} uniform canon of 27 books, {{although}} a few small and isolated communities have either fewer or more. Nevertheless, {{the idea of a}} complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from Apostolic times has no foundation in history, and the canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, {{is the result of a}} historical process. The <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of a closed canon did not exist prior to the 2nd century, when it became necessary to counter movements such as Marcionism. By the end of the 4th century unanimity had been achieved in the West concerning the New Testament canon as it is today, and by the 5th century most of the East had come into harmony by accepting the Book of Revelation. Nonetheless, a full dogmatic articulation of the canon for Roman Catholicism was not made until the Council of Trent of 1546, as until then the authority of the Scriptures was not considered higher than that of Sacred Tradition, papal bulls, and ecumenical councils. Martin Luther revived the antilegomena dispute by suggesting the removal of Jude, James, Hebrews, and Revelation; this was not generally accepted by his followers, but these books are still ordered last in the German-language Luther Bible. The canons of other important communions were defined in the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1563 for the Church of England, the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1647 for Presbyterianism, and the Synod of Jerusalem of 1672 for the Greek Orthodox.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|The {{right of}} {{assembly}} was originally {{distinguished from the}} right to petition. In United States v.

The <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances." [...] Justice Morrison Waite's opinion for the Court carefully distinguished the right to peaceably assemble as a secondary right, while the right to petition was labeled to be a primary right. Later cases, however, paid less attention to these distinctions.|$|E

Specifically, the Court said in Twining that the test was whether the right was embedded in [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>idea</b> of free government".
