5000|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>molding</b> (V-process) is a {{variation}} of the sand casting process for most ferrous and non-ferrous metals, in which unbonded sand is held in the flask with a vacuum. The pattern is specially vented so that a vacuum can be pulled through it. A heat-softened thin sheet (0.003 to 0.008 in) of plastic film is draped over the pattern and a vacuum is drawn (...) [...] A special vacuum forming flask is placed over the plastic pattern and is filled with a free-flowing sand. The sand is vibrated to compact the sand and a sprue and pouring cup are formed in the cope. Another sheet of plastic is placed {{over the top of the}} sand in the flask and a vacuum is drawn through the special flask; this hardens and strengthens the unbonded sand. The vacuum is then released on the pattern and the cope is removed. The drag is made in the same way (without the sprue and pouring cup). Any cores are set in place and the mold is closed. The molten metal is poured while the cope and drag are still under a vacuum, because the plastic vaporizes but the vacuum keeps the shape of the sand while the metal solidifies. When the metal has solidified, the vacuum is turned off and the sand runs out freely, releasing the casting.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogens}} causing pneumonia {{are difficult}} to identify because a high quality specimen from the lower lung is difficult to obtain. A specimen collection device, named the PneumoniaCheck, was previously designed to collect aerosol specimens selectively from the lower lung generated during deep coughing {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of specific pathogens causing pneumonia. The device also includes several specially designed features to exclude oral contaminants from the sample, and a filter to collect the aerosolized pathogens. The objective of this thesis is to develop tests to verify the functionality of the device, called the Design Inputs. 	Nine verification tests were performed to demonstrate the ability to collect lower airway aerosols separate from upper airway aerosols, successful exclusion of oral contents, and capture of pathogens in the filter. Further, the PneumoniaCheck was tested for proper sampling of the lower airway aerosols during deep cough at a very low volumetric flow rate to simulate patients with severe restrictive lung disease and with mal-positioning to simulate incorrect patient placement. 	Verification testing of the PneumoniaCheck demonstrates effective separation of upper airway gas from the lower airway gas (p< 0. 0001) and exclusion of both liquid and viscous oral material (p< 0. 0001) from the collection chamber. Testing also demonstrated the selective sampling of the lower airway, even during low volumetric flow rates or incorrect positioning of the device. 	The complex shape of the PneumoniaCheck presents a manufacturing challenge. Making the device from a solid and then drilling out the tubes would be difficult because the outer channels do not align with the inner channel. Rapid prototyping, <b>vacuum</b> <b>molding,</b> and injection molding are all manufacturing options. Rapid prototyping is slow, and usually only economic for small numbers of parts. For <b>vacuum</b> <b>molding</b> or injection molding, the PneumoniaCheck would need to be cut in half and molded, and then the halves connected with fasteners, glued, or welded. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>molding</b> is inexpensive, but there would be a lip at the connection that may be uncomfortable for patients. If the lip is {{on the inside of the}} device, it may interrupt air flow through the device. Injection molding is inexpensive and fast. The PneumoniaCheck could be injection molded in halves, and then glued or sonically welded together. Injection molding would be an efficient and economical way to manufacture the device. 	Verification tests were developed and performed, and the results demonstrate that the PneumoniaCheck successfully collects lower airway aerosols separate from upper airway aerosols, excludes oral contents, and captures pathogens in the filter, even during non-ideal conditions. After considering three different manufacturing options, injection molding was recommended for the device. M. S.

40|$|Current {{microfabrication}} materials include silicon, a {{wide variety}} of metals, dielectrics, and some polymers. Because of the low cost and high processing flexibility that polymers generally have, expanding the use of polymers in microfabrication would benefit the microfabrication community, enabling new routes towards goals such as low-cost 3 D microfabrication. This work describes two main unconventional uses of polymers in microfabrication. The first unconventional use is as a carrier material in the self-assembly (SA) of millimeter-scale parts in which functional electronic components and electrical interconnects were cast into 5 mm cubes of Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The second unconventional use is as a non-flat micromold for an alumina ceramic and as transfer material for multiple layers of micropatterned carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Both of these uses demonstrate 3 D low-cost microfabrication routes. In the SA chapter, surface forces induced both gross and fine alignment of the PMMA cubes. The cubes were bonded using low-melting temperature solder, resulting in a self-assembled 3 D circuit of LEDs and capacitors. The PMMA-encasulated parts were immersed in methyl methacrylate (MMA) to dissolve the PMMA, showing the possibility of using MEMS devices with moving parts such as mechanical actuators or resonators. This technique could be expanded for assembly of systems having more than 104 components. The ultimate goal is to combine a large number of diverse active components to allow the manufacture of systems having dense integrated functionality. The ceramic micromolding chapter explores micromolding fabrication of alumina ceramic microstructures on flat and curved surfaces, transfer of carbon nanotube (CNT) micropatterns into the ceramic, and oxidation inhibition of these CNTs through ceramic encapsulation. Microstructured master mold templates were fabricated from etched silicon, embossed thermally sacrificial polymer, and flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The polymer templates were themselves made from silicon masters. Thus, once the master is produced, no further access to a microfabrication facility is required. Using the flexible PDMS molds, ceramic structures with mm-scale curvature were fabricated having microstructures on either the inside or outside of the curved macrostructure. It was possible to embed CNTs into the ceramic microstructures. To do this, micropatterned CNTs on silicon were transferred to ceramic via <b>vacuum</b> <b>molding.</b> Multilayered micropatterned CNT-ceramic devices were fabricated, and CNT electrical traces were encapsulated with ceramic to inhibit oxidation.

40|$|The {{constant}} {{drive to}} further miniaturization and heterogeneous system integration {{leads to a}} need for new packaging technologies which also allow large area processing and 3 D integration with potential for low cost applications. Large area mold embedding technologies and embedding of active components into printed circuit boards (Chip-in-Polymer) are two major packaging trends in this area. This paper describes {{the use of a}} novel S 2 iP (Stacked System in Package) interconnect technique using advanced molding process for multi chip embedding in combination with large area and low cost redistribution technology derived from printed circuit board manufacturing with a focus on integration of through mold vias and vertical interconnect elements for package stacking. The use of compression molding equipment with liquid or granular epoxy molding compounds for the targeted integration process flow is a new technology that has been especially developed to allow large area embedding of single chips but also of multiple chips or heterogeneous systems on wafer scale, typically 8 ? to 12 ?. The wiring of the embedded components in this novel type of SiP can be done using PCB manufacturing technologies, i. e. a resin coated copper (RCC) film is laminated over the embedded components. Also thin film redistribution technologies can be applied ? using similar processes as used for WLP on silicon. For the 3 D interconnection two technologies are evaluated: In a process flow similar to conventional PCB manufacturing vias are drilled using a UV laser after RCC lamination and are metalized in the same process as the vias for chip interconnection. A second via generation process uses vertical interconnect elements, e. g. silicon dies with well defined lead structures, assembled in the same process step as the embedded dies. Top and bottom surface of those vertical interconnect elements are exposed after mold embedding. Planar interconnection is then formed by thin film redistribution or after RCC lamination, the vertical interconnect elements are contacted using a µVia process. Within this study the different approaches to vertical interconnection in a mold embedded wafer have been intensively evaluated on their processability. A strong focus was put on the process chain chip placement on a temporary carrier - compression <b>vacuum</b> <b>molding</b> for embedding ? RCC lamination or thin film redistribution ? laser drilling processes for µVias & Thru Holes ? metallization structuring ? module singulation & 3 D assembly.

Reliability of the manufactured 3 D stacks is evaluated by temperature cycling and is analyzed both non-destructively and destructively.

40|$|The {{progress}} {{of research in}} the development of novel, rigid, monolithic adsorbent carbon fiber composites is described. Carbon fiber composites am produced at ORNL and activated at the CAER using steam or CO{sub 2 } under different conditions, with the aims of producing a uniform degree of activation through the material, and of closely controlling pore structure and adsorptive properties. The principal focus of the work to date has been to produce materials with narrow porosity far use in gas separations. Carbon fiber composites are prepared at ORNL, usually in plate or tubular form, by <b>vacuum</b> <b>molding</b> from water slurries containing phenolic resin and chopped isotropic petroleum pitch fibers. The composites are activated at the CAER in steam or CO{sub 2 } using samples of dimensions up to 1. 5 x 4 x 12 cm that are cut from the original plates. One of the objectives is to produce uniformly activated composites, which is especially critical when attempting to active large monoliths. It has been found that there are appreciable variations in the density and permeability of the as-formed composites that must relate to the forming technique. These variations are expected to exert some influence on the rate and extent of reaction and surface area development. In attempting to uniformly activate the composites, two reactor configurations have been investigated. In the more successful arrangement, steam ''is introduced at several points {{along the length of the}} composite. A reduction in steam partial pressure from 95 vol% to 44 vol% significantly improved the uniformity of surface area distribution. Activation with CO{sub 2 } was still better, which is attributed to the much slower reaction rate than with steam. Measurements of composite dimensions have shown that there is an overall shrinkage during activation. A direct correlation is found between dimensional shrinkage and burnoff, and is similar for a and steam activation. The causes of the shrinkage are not yet clear. At levels of burnoff above about 40 %, the extent of contraction is sufficient to produce stresses that result in fracture. Activated composites have been evaluated for the separation of CH{sub 4 }-CO{sub 2 } mixtures, and an apparatus has been constructed specifically for this purpose. Samples activated to low burn-off (5 - 7 % wt loss) with low surface areas (from 300 - 500 m{sup 2 }/g) give much better separation of CO{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 }, than samples produced at higher burnoff, and there appears to be no benefit in producing composites at burnoffs higher than 10 %. The greater separation efficiency obtained at low burnoff means that the most effective CFCMS can be produced at relatively low cost. Continuing work will attempt to define the parameters that influence this gas separation, and whether these are applicable to other gas mixtures. Five samples of CFCMS have been recently prepared for shipment to British Oxygen Corporation (BOC) for testing as molecular sieves. The samples were machined to specific dimensions at ORNL (approx. 2. 5 cm diameter x 1. 25 cm thick) and activated at CAER.
